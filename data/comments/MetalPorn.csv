MetalPorn,3e0k52,brutishbloodgod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:49 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that now that you mentioned it, to me it looks like it would belong to a black metal album almost."
MetalPorn,3e0k52,brutishbloodgod,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say doom, because it reminds me of the cover of Vessels of Light and Decay by Indesinence."
MetalPorn,3e0k52,DayoftheBaphomets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:36 2015 UTC,What kind of metal would you classify Mammoth Grinder as? Just curious in case I wanna check it out.
MetalPorn,3e0k52,shitterbug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"my first impression right now is old school death with hardcore/crust in it. I'm two songs in, and you should check it out"
MetalPorn,3e0k52,brutishbloodgod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"What /u/shitterbug said. They're part of the new wave of bands like Black Breath and Xibalba, merging Entombed-style OSDM with crust and other hardcore genres. These guys are really, really fucking good at it and I highly recommend you give this album a listen."
MetalPorn,3e0k52,DayoftheBaphomets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot friend, I'm definitely a fan of OSDM so I'll check this one out. I wish it was a rule to post a sample with each album cover."

MetalPorn,3dlbax,rustypete89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's Boromir of Gondor

MetalPorn,3dcph7,timthetollman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"Nothing special, just the regular CD lyric booklet cover art.  Album of some of the other art in the booklet. The files are just as big as the OP.  I fixed up the colours of the main cover and the art of the wave with the whitecap to look more like what the booklet actually looked like. For some reason my scanner really washes out the colour. Enjoy."
MetalPorn,3dcph7,timthetollman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:20:57 2015 UTC,The entire album art is sections from one large piece by a guy named Paul Romano. I fucking love it and have been trying to get my hands on a large print of it to frame and hang on my wall. Contacted him several times to no avail :( Tried ebay and everything but all I could find was posters etc.

MetalPorn,3d1y12,blazingduck,2,Mon Jul 13 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's Baroness' frontman, I believe, does the artwork for all three bands, and some more, but I can't remember exactly who. I think he did artwork for Kylesa as well."

MetalPorn,3crh3v,NecroLumberjack,2,Fri Jul 10 04:34:44 2015 UTC,Fuck. That is such a cool band logo.
MetalPorn,3crh3v,blazingduck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:41:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Apparently Protector just drew it up one day out of the blue, as a sort of representation of something, never thinking that it would really be of any significance later on. Super cool that it became their logo."

I didn't like the official album art so I took the full art piece from the lyric booklet and put the old school CC logo on it and ""The Bleeding"" title on it for use in my iTunes. I thought I'd share it since it has just been sitting on my HDD doing nothing for a few months now.  600x622 for iTunes."
MetalPorn,3c8nq0,Metal_Malachy,7,Sun Jul 5 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"This is the album art of the latest album 因果応報 (Retributive Justice) from the Japanese Samurai themed death metal band 兀突骨 (pronounced ""Gotsu-Totsu-Kotsu"").  I got this album when it came out in March, but only just got around to scanning the album art today. The file I uploaded is at 90 jpeg compression coming out to 4.37MB before upload to imgur, but the uncompressed file is actually about 10MB.  Also here is a 600x618 (171KB before upload) version."

MetalPorn,3bh2h6,GeneralApathy,3,Mon Jun 29 11:38:28 2015 UTC,It certainly looks like his style.

MetalPorn,39x6vu,ThePremier,-1,Mon Jun 15 15:11:06 2015 UTC,"This is pretty bad photoshop work. The angle of all the ground shadows suggests the sun is nearer to the horizon line, while the shadow of the guy looks like it's created by a desk lamp 6ft out of frame at a 45 degree angle, well above the horizon. The figure's shadow is clearly and poorly generated in photoshop with its unnaturally consistent shading. The lighting on the hospital gown is also inconsistent with the light source.   If you're going to make your cover minimalistic, then at least make the one solitary effect you're trying to pull off look halfway believable.  Great band, but this is a metal art fail, not metal porn."

MetalPorn,375sti,bobhwy,3,Mon May 25 03:08:48 2015 UTC,I can't tell if this is racist or not.
MetalPorn,375sti,Weeperblast,3,Mon May 25 07:56:07 2015 UTC,Definitely not a racist band I can tell you that.
MetalPorn,375sti,Weeperblast,-2,Mon May 25 12:39:31 2015 UTC,"Not saying that the band is racist, just that the depiction on the cover is racist."
MetalPorn,375sti,WillyRocketGiraffe,-1,Mon May 25 16:11:22 2015 UTC,I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's extremely racist.
MetalPorn,36wf1t,maakuz,6,Fri May 22 17:59:18 2015 UTC,Those are often the best kind of gigs.
MetalPorn,36wf1t,unclesquid,1 point,Fri May 22 19:10:49 2015 UTC,Sure are!
MetalPorn,36wf1t,Tsiklon,3,Fri May 22 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"The actual band is Uada from Norrköping, Sweden.  They play death metal but with influences from both groovier music like Lamb of God and darker, black metal music, pending between those two themes from song to song. Here's one of their tunes."

MetalPorn,36owzd,Winter_Soldat,1 point,Thu May 21 03:53:14 2015 UTC,"Seen them twice now. Went to see them in Helsinki last year. Was so fucking enchanting and engaging, I couldn't do anything but stare at the stage the moment the intro started.  Also funny coincidence: Met them the morning after in a completely random coffee shop. They just happened to be in front of us in the line."
MetalPorn,36mxfj,TheViceCampaign,11,Wed May 20 15:42:46 2015 UTC,Link to the new song that was released today.

MetalPorn,36mxfj,_Shush,-1,Wed May 20 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"Take a sharp knife and score the skin around the middle of each potato (don't cut too deeply), making sure both ends of the score connect. Put the potatoes in a medium-size pot, cover them with boiling water from the kettle, and cook until they're done, usually about 20 minutes."
MetalPorn,36mxfj,xBingobam,2,Thu May 21 14:00:58 2015 UTC,"God Damn, They hit the nail on the head. This seems like such a promising follow up to Monolith. The hype is real."
MetalPorn,36mxfj,codythomashunsberger,5,Thu May 21 02:28:28 2015 UTC,They weren't lying when they said it's their best album art so far. In the full artwork you can see the monolith in the background.

MetalPorn,36mxfj,Shnig1,2,Thu May 21 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"And I thought the Monolith artwork was good. This shit is fucking fantastic. I love the color scheme and the realistic feel of the environment.   Also the music is fucking brutal, so that's awesome too"

MetalPorn,36jo3g,lockjawz,4,Tue May 19 21:46:29 2015 UTC,I can't say I'm a huge fan of this band (the vocals kinda bother me) but god damn. I am never unimpressed with their artwork. And that logo! That logo does things to me sexually.
