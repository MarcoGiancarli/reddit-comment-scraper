Who is this?  Kendrick: It is I, Kendrick Perkins.  Kevin: Hello. What do you need, Kendrick?  Kendrick: New Orleans.  Kevin: I understand.  *Kendrick hangs up wired phone, and smiles to himself*"

On the other hand i see pelicans fans making threads believing that kd will come here even though there have been no hints of him even considering us.

NOLAPelicans,3da91z,sonusfaber,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"This writer doesn't account for the fact that we are playing for versatility AND that AD has stated multiple times that does not enjoy playing center.  We are not paying 44 mil for Asik, we are paying 44 mil to have several different chess pieces against different teams. With centers, unlike point guards or shooting guards, the game is too situational to where even a player like Bogut could sit.  It is important also to fuel competition amongst players, namely Ajinca and Asik here.  Last year, defensive specialists such as AD, Asik, Jrue, and EG looked poor on defense. Erman will fix it out, he made the Celtics somehow decent on that end and we have ten times the talent.  I also believe that players such as Asik will benefit tremendously from the conditioning that Gentry is enforcing. With a lighter and stronger body, he will be able to grab that extra board, and contest that shot he couldn't this past year.  Most people forget that every single player on the Pelicans that matters has been on a road to recovery and fitness. This off-season will do wonders."

NOLAPelicans,3da91z,pottersquash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:59:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can't think of a single huge deal in NBA that has ever come without some regret. Perhaps the Miami assembling the big 3, but even now as you look at their gutted team and D-Wade was talking ish of maybe moving, that was a regret. Guaranteed contracts and a luxury tax are the worst."

NOLAPelicans,3d7u58,irrationalportions,5,Tue Jul 14 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"Neither will see any real minutes on our team. Neither is really that good. Curry is probably the better shooter, but I'd say he's the worse defender. Drew had a big game tonight with 16 assists, he was a good passer in his few games with the Sixers last year, and he was a really good passer in the d league. He's also older than Seth (not by much).   It's a harder decision than I would've imagined actually. Neither guy will probably be on our team for the whole season unless they really explode. But if I had to choose I'd pick Larry Drew, only because I think he can become a really good passer off the bench one day. Curry is just a SG who has the size of a PG. He's been really good during this summer league so he'll probably make the team, but like I've said he most likely won't be with us for long."
NOLAPelicans,3d7u58,BigEarl139,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:06:51 2015 UTC,Curry's summer league 3pt shooting has been bad aside from the first game. If I don't see better shooting I'd rather get Drew.

NOLAPelicans,3d7u58,TheBionicShaboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:17 2015 UTC,Both aren't that good and their game might not transition to the NBA. Curry is a better shooter and Drew is a better passer. Depends on what management wants but they ain't getting playing time.

NOLAPelicans,3cpa6u,danial133416,8,Thu Jul 9 17:59:17 2015 UTC,So we are top 3 in the nba for tickets sold next season. So glad that basketball is rising in new orleans.
NOLAPelicans,3cpa6u,pottersquash,4,Thu Jul 9 18:00:27 2015 UTC,That is incredible.
NOLAPelicans,3cpa6u,saintsfan92612,3,Thu Jul 9 18:03:09 2015 UTC,I know right ? Flap flap bitches.
NOLAPelicans,3cpa6u,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Thu Jul 9 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"I doubt that. We have one of, if not the, smallest arenas in the league. Maybe we are top 3 in new business and with a 90% renewal rate, that looks pretty damn good. But just judging by what is available on the Pelicans ticket site, I'd say we are about middle of the pack in volume of tickets sold with about 12-13k full season tickets sold.   I do love the fact that it looks like the floor seats have sold out. Hopefully that means a lot of investment from local businesses into the team."
NOLAPelicans,3cpa6u,Dj_Nussdog,2,Thu Jul 9 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"''We're very pleased and happy to say that we're now in the top three in the NBA in new tickets sales for the season,"" Lauscha said. ''We've had the highest renewal rate in the history of the franchise, well over 90 percent.''  Yeah I think you're right. The Pels being in the top 3 in sheer volume of ticket sales is virtually impossible."

NOLAPelicans,3cpnpi,Dj_Nussdog,2,Thu Jul 9 20:12:35 2015 UTC,There is no trade worth making. Its much more important to keep the core together for a year with Gentry. His contract expires anyway and then we get all that glorious cap space to fantasize about ADKD
NOLAPelicans,3cpnpi,rephil0309,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"Gordon wasn't bad last year. What if he's even better this year? He'll be 27 at contracts end. Is the consensus to just let him go, regardless of how well he performs without attempting to resign him?  If we get into the second round of the playoffs, or are at least really competitive in the first, I don't know of many better places to play. Wouldn't he want to be here? Why wouldn't we want him?  I say this with the aforementioned word ""continuity"" in mind."
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,MengTheBarbarian,11,Thu Jul 9 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly I dislike it. It's not fair, you don't go back on your word like that.   Imagine if KD verbally agrees to sign with us this summer, we lose our shit, and then two days later Sam Presti calls him at 3 AM and he changes his mind. I would lose it"
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,DRphoenix99,2,Thu Jul 9 04:32:40 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong. DJ is a huge fucking bitch for this.  But... This does make our murder's row of a division a little easier.
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,DRphoenix99,7,Thu Jul 9 04:37:05 2015 UTC,"And it also makes the Clippers immensely better. If you want to talk about advantages, neither the Mavs or Clippers were serious contenders yesterday, and we probably could have best them both in the regular season. Now the Mavs will surely be beat, but we will most likely lose to the clippers.   Removing the clippers as contenders would leave only San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Golden State, And Houston as the teams which are DEFINITIVELY better then us. Now you can add LA to that list"
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,DRphoenix99,0,Thu Jul 9 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"It was either the Clippers getting better or the Mavs getting better. At the end of the day, I'd much rather the team out of the division get better. The West is tough, our division is tough. We need all the small help we can get."
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,DRphoenix99,3,Thu Jul 9 05:04:29 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. Think about it this way, if Deandre stays with the Clips, their team is like a 9.5/10, and the Mavs without him are like a 7.0/10. Now if he goes to the Mavs, they become an 8.0, and the Clippers drop to an 8.0 as well.   Now let's say were about an 8.5 team, that means that with DJ to the Mavs, we had a shot to beat both, but with DJ to the clips, were clearly worse the one.   Were better then the Mavs with DJ, we aren't better then the Clippers with him"
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,pottersquash,2,Thu Jul 9 05:09:26 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. Still, fuck the Mavs though."
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,danial133416,2,Thu Jul 9 05:20:12 2015 UTC,Haha fuck em
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,fireman225s,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:29:33 2015 UTC,I agree. No assurance DJ and Mavs even works. Sure a rim protector/dunk specialist works when CP3 on the court. We found that out with Tyson Chandler. Was he ever the same without probably the best pure PG in the game? Nope. I would rather Clips implode and Mavs try to fit square pegs in round holes.
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,fireman225s,6,Thu Jul 9 18:05:23 2015 UTC,I do feel sorry for their fans though.. But on the bright side our division just got a little be easier.
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,irrationalportions,2,Thu Jul 9 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. With San Antonio getting better and the Rockets being typical cock suckers, we needed the Mavs to get brought down."
NOLAPelicans,3cn0dq,BananaPeelSlippers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Memphis, who kept their guys together and brought in a couple good pieces."

NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,SteakWay,8,Thu Jul 9 02:04:43 2015 UTC,Sounds like the Rockets can and will match anything the Pels could offer. Wouldn't hurt to offer it though
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Thu Jul 9 02:18:34 2015 UTC,I heard they couldn't but I have no idea. Like not even who this guy is.
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,pottersquash,2,Thu Jul 9 03:00:57 2015 UTC,http://www.thedreamshake.com/2015/7/7/8907361/should-k-j-mcdaniels-or-josh-smith-receive-the-rockets-mid-level-2015-nba-free-agency  Apparently it comes down to either Josh Smith or McDaniels for them.  And:  http://cdn2.streamable.com/video/46bd90e0de6111e480d989b86aa877cc.webm  Also:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w8wAtjgxT0
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,jetlife_,2,Thu Jul 9 03:48:28 2015 UTC,Excellent. You seem to be a person who knows things. My next question:  Why would we want this McDaniel person?
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,pottersquash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"I know some things, but not all things.  Our primary weakness on offense (and defense to an extent) was getting production from the SF position. Pondexter is an excellent bench player but it's clear he is just that, and not starting caliber. Now McDaniels shooting ability is a bit raw, but his athleticism and defensive prowess is what really makes him valuable. Not to mention he is only 22-years old.  McDaniels was traded midseason to the Rockets from 76ers for virtually nothing; probably because Philly realized they wouldn't be able to sign him this offseason. His value is a bit lower at the moment than it would otherwise be; he only played 10 games for the Rockets, averaging 3.3 MPG and 1.1 PPG. He averaged 25 MPG, 9 PPG and 4 RPG in 52 games with the 6ers for reference. Considering what is out there on the market that we can afford, McDaniels may be our best option."
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,jetlife_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:04:24 2015 UTC,Doesn't Daunte fill this role?
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,pottersquash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, Cunningham is probably even more of a bench player than Pondexter. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy (NOVA bias), and his jump shooting and energy is clearly something we need on this team - he just has some very clear limitations. He's a PF stuck in a SF's body, essentially. Not athletic enough to consistently cover a higher-end SF, and not big enough to bang with PF's in the paint. I would rather him be able to go full-out, 100% for 15 minutes in a game than risk him losing that hustle while playing starting minutes.  Kind of like Ajinca in that sense; love him on the bench but if we have to start him for any extended period of time, we're in trouble."
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,jetlife_,6,Thu Jul 9 16:16:41 2015 UTC,Dear god please let this happen! Watched every game of his at Clemson and would always see him around campus. Having him on my favorite NBA team would be insane!
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,SkipTheBeat,3,Thu Jul 9 03:21:24 2015 UTC,I'll take one McDaniels please.
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,wbro322,3,Thu Jul 9 02:23:11 2015 UTC,Great move. Jrue-McDaniels-Pondexter-Davis-Asik could be one of the best defensive lineups in the league
NOLAPelicans,3cml4k,DRphoenix99,2,Thu Jul 9 04:31:09 2015 UTC,Any updates on this?

NOLAPelicans,3cmtx7,danial133416,2,Thu Jul 9 03:27:07 2015 UTC,Yeah but it was a bitch move by him. Honestly in my book you should honor your word and don't be a pussy. He wasn't even man enough to call cuban and let him know that he changed his mind.

NOLAPelicans,3cids2,danial133416,3,Wed Jul 8 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"More and more I think that's his ideal role. As great as Tyreke was for us last year, if we have him 28-32 minutes a night at like an average usage rate of 30% surrounded by bench shooters he could be a weapon."
NOLAPelicans,3cids2,DRphoenix99,3,Wed Jul 8 04:16:53 2015 UTC,I am looking forward to this season. We will be the next warriors.
NOLAPelicans,3cids2,danial133416,4,Wed Jul 8 03:39:52 2015 UTC,Better. Gentry could only help Kerr so much as an assistant.
NOLAPelicans,3cids2,DRphoenix99,3,Wed Jul 8 04:18:28 2015 UTC,"That was great. My first take away is that he said Tyreke will primarily be a point guard. He could just be referring to his role as a facilitator, but maybe Tyreke will start at PG or play as the primary backup PG.  Also wish someone would have asked about Asik"
NOLAPelicans,3cids2,DRphoenix99,2,Wed Jul 8 04:28:00 2015 UTC,I was very critical of tyrekes play last year and really didn't wanted him off the team at the end of last year. He just seemed so distant from our offense. It was like either it's going through tyreke or the other four on the floor are going to play together this possession. Gentry has given me hope on him though. I think he can handle and incorporate this hybrid style of player and really bring to the next level. I don't think monty was really suited for him. I like that he's losing some weight as well. <3 gentry.
NOLAPelicans,3cids2,wbro322,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:56:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was hoping for, a high octane offense fueled by good defense and oppoetunistic points.  Playing to our stengths as one of the fastest teams in the league in all positions really helps us.  Tyreke is mini-bron in terms of finishing in the paint and he is probably overjoyed."

Dawson looks like he will belong in the NBA, I'm not sure if starter material, but at the very least, any team could give him at least 15 minutes."
NOLAPelicans,3c4irz,Sslagathor,3,Sat Jul 4 19:00:13 2015 UTC,I remember when Austin Rivers was good in the summer league :\

NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,RoastDaMostToast,7,Fri Jul 3 20:56:52 2015 UTC,As much as I'd love to see cp3 back in nola. I rather much see a kd / ad pairing for 2016
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,sarcastic_charisma,-3,Fri Jul 3 23:58:16 2015 UTC,KD wouldn't come to Nola.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,KGB_ate_my_bread,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:26:25 2015 UTC,I'm sure he would ad is down here and it's about winning championships.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,sarcastic_charisma,3,Sat Jul 4 02:07:37 2015 UTC,I think he'd pick Washington over us since it's his home town and they also have two young stars/great players (though not at the level of AD)
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,blinkme123,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:40:00 2015 UTC,I agree that I couldn't see him coming here but I don't understand this going home to play idea. Has he mentioned it before? It was the same things Bulls fans were saying about AD.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,danceswithsharks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying to figure out why Beal is seen as this great player. To me, there is no chance he can look at Washington and see a better chance to win a championship than in OKC. Would he go to DC just cause it's home? No...you don't do that unless you've already won a ship. Imo Ibaka + Russ >>>> Wall + Beal.   I do think is we put up a 52+ win season it would be pretty easy to convince Durant that our team, plus him, is an immediate contender."
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,schmide234,5,Tue Jul 7 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"Well he's under contract until 2018 @ around $20 mil/year, so I'd say is incredibly unlikely we see him back."
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,corndog,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Do you think our front office would make a trade for him? Give Tyreke, Ryan Anderson, and picks?"
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,BlackScienceJesus,6,Fri Jul 3 21:13:54 2015 UTC,No way would they do this. CP3 is a top 5 player.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:18:43 2015 UTC,Well he's also 30. I was just throwing out some tradeable players though; who else could we feel comfortable able giving up that has more value?
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,thejimmyst,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:27:17 2015 UTC,They wouldn't do a trade. We have nothing other than AD that would be worth losing CP3 for.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,thejimmyst,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"The only thing we got that gets us CP3 is Davis, and we obviously aren't doing that."
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:36:44 2015 UTC,Well what if CP3 becomes noticeably upset with the organization and demands a trade? That's honestly the only way I see us getting him back.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,danial133416,3,Fri Jul 3 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"Then they would trade him for like Porzingis or something. We don't have anything to trade for CP3. Our picks going forward probably aren't fantastic value, and if you add CP3 to the team they only get worse. Jrue, Tyreke, Anderson are all basically the players they are going to be, it's unlikely the Clippers would look at them and see growth. If the Clippers trade CP3 they are going to rebuild would be my guess."
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,hdaigre47,5,Fri Jul 3 21:46:07 2015 UTC,Effectively 0

NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,hdaigre47,0,Fri Jul 3 21:03:48 2015 UTC,Let's not. There is absolutely no chance that this would ever happen.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,ARealKoala,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:44:55 2015 UTC,IMO CP3 on the Pelicans > CP3 on the Clippers  Plus why wouldn't he want to play with prime AD?
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,Stretch82,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"How would we get him? He's under contract through 2018, and the only thing the Clippers would take for him is AD. As much as I would love it, it's not happening."
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,snoopygeeze,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:12:38 2015 UTC,Wait til his contract is up
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,lambquentin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"If the rumors are true and the Clippers are interested in signing Javale McGee, Paul will be back in NOLA in no time :)"
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,thejimmyst,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:54:09 2015 UTC,I don't want him back tbh. He would be too old and too expensive.   I want Jrue to stay healthy and grow into the All Star type player he could be with AD.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,lambquentin,0,Sun Jul 5 15:45:38 2015 UTC,Unless he wants the small-town money again and possibly some competition from what we already have I would say it is very unlikely. Like five percent chance of him returning and that is generous.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,danial133416,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:06:36 2015 UTC,Competition? Who do we have that can compete with CP3?
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,lambquentin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:37:17 2015 UTC,Jrue Holiday. Now I know CP3 would out class Jrue in probably everything but CP3 left and still has to earn a spot like everyone not named Anthony Davis.
NOLAPelicans,3c18yc,irrationalportions,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:05:52 2015 UTC,Lol cp3 would easily be our starting pg even with him playing on one leg like he did against the spurs in game 7.

NOLAPelicans,3bvj9b,fireman225s,3,Fri Jul 3 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"I love seeing this. I'm sure people will use the argument that any player will say that about their current team, but he seems like he genuinely does want to be here. Can't wait to see the future of this team."
NOLAPelicans,3bvj9b,danceswithsharks,3,Thu Jul 2 18:01:04 2015 UTC,<3
NOLAPelicans,3bvj9b,wbro322,2,Thu Jul 2 18:12:21 2015 UTC,Well if he gave any intention of leaving then every team would have been interested. This is a great sign. Just gotta drop gordons contract!
NOLAPelicans,3bvivi,Fake_82,6,Thu Jul 2 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"We have about 73 mill committed. Cap is around 67-69million. We are over it. We have two exceptions we can use to round out the roster, as well as minimum contracts. Tax line is about 83 million, and we will stay below it.  Expect Dante, Cole and some wing players back."
NOLAPelicans,3bvivi,LieutenantKumar,4,Thu Jul 2 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"At his point we have the MLE ($5.5 million), the BAE ($2.1 million) and will have to fill the rest of the roster with minimum contracts.  So it looks like we're just running it back. Cole has a qualifying offer on the table. Could use on of those exceptions to bring back Dante Cunningham. And then minimum contract guys.  Barring a significant trade, Pels will look very similar to last season."

NOLAPelicans,3bta4e,danceswithsharks,3,Thu Jul 2 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"Downside was the minimum wage.   I went to the Charlotte Hornets team store a couple days ago and they had five people working on the floor, no customers, and they were working their tails off. I think we might have had five people working on game nights."
NOLAPelicans,3bta4e,danceswithsharks,3,Thu Jul 2 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"I have never gone to our team store if there wasn't some kind of event or it was a game night, I'm curious if there are a lot working during normal days."
NOLAPelicans,3bta4e,MengTheBarbarian,4,Thu Jul 2 04:25:58 2015 UTC,"It was usually just me. I imagine it would depend on where the arena was located. The Palace is in a suburb just off the highway, and back then there was nothing around it. I imagine most people wouldn't have guessed we were open. I think the only time we got customers who weren't Pistons, Vipers (the IHL team) or cheerleaders was when people would come to buy tickets.  Oh, that was another upside to the job - the cheerleading team practiced in the lobby right outside the store."
NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,LoCo89,4,Thu Jul 2 04:18:11 2015 UTC,"A little longer than I'd like, but whatever."
NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,SteelOliver,3,Thu Jul 2 04:31:20 2015 UTC,Interesting: [Macnamara] Was told by Pelicans source that timing of Asik's unguaranteed year is NOT a coincidence. Coincides with the last summer to impress AD.
NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Thu Jul 2 05:17:01 2015 UTC,I think this is good. Its only guaranteed for 4/44. Will keep AD safe for a few years. It might even be trade able in 2019
NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,rephil0309,3,Thu Jul 2 05:43:59 2015 UTC,Fuck yes Asik jersey incoming

NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,Guyote_,5,Thu Jul 2 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"So a couple of things:   Kinda had to. Cap Reasons A lot of noise that its not fully guaranteed which will make it more palatable. And lastly, the length and amount would pretty much support that idea   So let's find out what the actual details are, then we bust out the newly sharpened pitchforks. I promise"
NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,danial133416,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:20:01 2015 UTC,I don't know why dell would give asik a 5 year deal when we have better free agents coming off the books next summer... Not to mention that asik is 29 years old and he would be 34 in 5 years..
NOLAPelicans,3bu4yz,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but so does everyone else. So not really a guarantee especially in the big center market. It's a lock'em up mentality. And check it out Stein has already tweeted some details out  4/45 is perfectly fine for a starting Center"

NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,Good_NewsEveryone,6,Wed Jul 1 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Dell like yo we got Alexis locked up, Perk on the phone... you gonna take this deal or what?"

NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,danial133416,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if we kept Asik now, even if it was reported yesterday that we would like to keep him.  Getting Ajinça locked in at $5m/year for 4 years makes me think that Pels/Asik either haven't spoken yet or they are further apart then they'd like to be."
NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,defeatedbycables,5,Wed Jul 1 20:03:11 2015 UTC,They have been in talks already. Getting him is still a priority.
NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"Ajinca is not a starter. He fouls at an insane rate, he's not really great at rebounding or protecting the rim. He'd be one of the weakest starters in the league. He's a good backup though, and that's what we resigned him to do.   Asik, who I don't love, is for sure coming back. And he's a legit starting Center."
NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,thejimmyst,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:32:41 2015 UTC,Especially seeing what Tyson chandler got.
NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,Lokipokie504,7,Wed Jul 1 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"I hope Gentry and team can remove the rough edges if Ajinca's play, because I always felt like he showed more effort out there than Asik and has some potential to get more playtime this season."
NOLAPelicans,3bs0m4,BioSpock,4,Wed Jul 1 19:16:27 2015 UTC,awesome deal. A quality big for 4 years at 5 per is a steal in today's NBA and will become even more so after the cap increase.

The games against teams like the Warriors and Cavs, probably the Texas teams as well will most likely be packed. It seems like there is a decent sized group of people that always show up for the Rockets. As much as I love having the Blender sold out and packed, it makes the drive home a bitch, especially with the work being done on the ramp to the interstate. I would be willing to put up with that though if it means more support during games!"

NOLAPelicans,3bps9t,cj832,2,Wed Jul 1 05:16:41 2015 UTC,Can someone who understands the cap better than I do explain how they're able to give him this much?
NOLAPelicans,3bps9t,SaltyForeskin,8,Wed Jul 1 04:24:07 2015 UTC,The Derrick Rose Rule  It allows a player on a rookie-scale contract to receive an extension with a starting salary of up to 30% of the salary cap instead of the standard 25% if he hits certain benchmarks. A former first-round pick can invoke the rule if he does any of the following while his rookie-scale contract is in effect:   Win the MVP Make an All-NBA team twice Make the All-Star Game as a starter via fan balloting twice
NOLAPelicans,3bps9t,sarcastic_charisma,2,Wed Jul 1 04:27:25 2015 UTC,Ah ok. There's also a yearly raise at some percentage right?
NOLAPelicans,3bps9t,TerroristOgre,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:31:21 2015 UTC,exactly it's a percentage of the cap based on his performance
NOLAPelicans,3bps9t,TerroristOgre,3,Thu Jul 2 10:52:04 2015 UTC,"Its spread out over the 6 years,  and the cap will be increasing in 2016"

NOLAPelicans,3brwyn,blinkme123,-4,Wed Jul 1 17:39:51 2015 UTC,not really missing 15-18 gms a year is the difference between making the playoffs or not in the west
NOLAPelicans,3bodln,ynksjts,6,Tue Jun 30 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"I really like Ajinca. I don't think he would be a great starter, but he brings some really good energy off the bench."
NOLAPelicans,3bodln,Rokiss1,2,Tue Jun 30 22:16:45 2015 UTC,Not quite a starter but is one of the better backups in the league.
NOLAPelicans,3bodln,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"Decent back up who brings a good offensive game. It was tough to get him minutes because AD, ryno, and asik.  Tends to get in foul trouble. It's hard to tell if that's because he plays loose knowing he's not called on for more minutes or if that's who he is."
NOLAPelicans,3bodln,Ilduce77x,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:48:30 2015 UTC,"He's a good backup who has shown he has the potential to score, but is inconsistent. Also gets in foul trouble WAY too easily."
NOLAPelicans,3bodln,acethewarhawk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"Ajinca really seemed to progress as the year went, but he's not really capable of starting. He fouls at a high rate playing against backups, I think he'd foul out of every game as a starter. He's also not exactly a rim protector despite his size. He is a capable scorer though and really makes a great backup (backups can't be perfect after all)."

NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,BigEarl139,11,Tue Jun 30 21:09:52 2015 UTC,Jrue is younger and cheaper and honestly Tyreke isn't best suited to run an offense. Rudy Gay for Jrue doesn't make us a contender.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"Having Jrue sit the bench doesn't make us a contender either.   Gay is only 4 years older, and we really need a SF.  Tyreke ran our offense amazingly last season. He's also better suited for the Gentry offense than he was for what we were running last season. I don't see any problems with letting Reke run the offense, especially when Gentry will have more control over him than Monty did (he'll actually tell Reke when he's doing something wrong rather than just letting him keep doing it).  Also Jrue is only about $1 million cheaper so."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,5,Tue Jun 30 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"Also Jrue is only about $1 million cheaper so.    Except no. Holiday's contract has 2 years 21,882,025 left. Rudy has 3/yr 40,000,000 left.   By the end of his contract, Jrue will be 27, Rudy will be 32. That is a large difference.    Tyreke ran our offense amazingly last season.   He did his best. But it still stagnated and is very vulnerable with Asik sharing the floor. He isn't meant to be a floor general. Especially in Gentry's system. He is much better suited as a one man show in transition.    especially when Gentry will have more control over him than Monty did (he'll actually tell Reke when he's doing something wrong rather than just letting him keep doing it).   This is baseless speculation and honestly wrong. Monty told and yelled at Reke plenty of times."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:56:23 2015 UTC,"$1 million per year is what I meant. Gay is making 12, 13, and 14 over the next three seasons (last season is a player option). Jrue is making 10 and 11 over the next 2 years. With the new cap both of these contracts will be pretty small. Money isn't a problem here.  Tyreke is absolutely meant to be a floor general. He's always at his best when he's running the offense. It's the only way for him to succeed. He's got great court vision and can make plays happen.  Yelling isn't what I mean when I say he'll have more control over Reke. Tyreke was very obviously just doing what he wanted in our offense last season. It stagnated because it was a bad offense, not because of Tyreke. Our offense has always been just as good, if not better with Tyreke running it over Jrue."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,6,Tue Jun 30 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"$1 million per year is what I meant. Gay is making 12, 13, and 14 over the next three seasons (last season is a player option). Jrue is making 10 and 11 over the next 2 years. With the new cap both of these contracts will be pretty small. Money isn't a problem here.   Okay even over the next two years it averages out to about 2ish M more. And you can't just ignore the last year.    Tyreke is absolutely meant to be a floor general. He's always at his best when he's running the offense. It's the only way for him to succeed. He's got great court vision and can make plays happen.   You are conflating him having the ball in his hands with him running the offense.    Yelling isn't what I mean when I say he'll have more control over Reke. Tyreke was very obviously just doing what he wanted in our offense last season.    How can you claim this in any factual way for starters, and then assume it won't continue?   It stagnated because it was a bad offense, not because of Tyreke. Our offense has always been just as good, if not better with Tyreke running it over Jrue.    This is incorrect. Our offense is statically better with Jrue on the floor. And a large part of the reason the offense stagnated was because of the lack of spacing. You can't claim we had a bad offense when we generated the 3rd highest percentage of open shots and were 8th in efficiency.   I'm sorry man, but its plain as day that Tyreke is no where near the decision maker that Jrue is."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:10:03 2015 UTC,"The last year is $14 mil under the new cap. That's basically what 11-12 is under the current cap.  I'm not? Our offense was great under him last year. When he was running the offense in Sacramento is was looking really nice. I think you just don't like Reke.   I'd prefer Tyreke over Jrue any day. Even if he does make bad decisions sometimes, at least he can get on the floor for us. His size makes him a good man defender, he's still a good passer no matter what you say, and he can get to the rim at will. The only knock against him is his shot. I don't know what your problem is with him, but he's good. And this would be a very good trade for us considering Jrue has barely even played for us."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,thejimmyst,4,Tue Jun 30 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with him. I've gone on record saying Tyreke is our second best player and his is the only Pelican jersey I own. But it's your dislike of Jrue that prevents you from evaluating both fairly. I never said he wasn't a great passer. I said he isn't on the same level as Jrue in decision making, that's not just passing. And he isn't. To best use Tyreke, you don't want him constricted to running the offense. And sure he is a capable man defender but he is really bad off the ball."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,imhungryforpizza,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"I don't dislike Jrue. I think he's a good player. I just want him gone. I'm sure he could succeed on another team with a better training staff, but our training staff sucks. He hasn't been healthy the entire time he's been with us. How is that good for a team? I think we need to just move on already. We're going into a third season with him coming off an injury. We need to start focusing on someone else as our starting point guard now and stop hoping Jrue will just be healthy."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,5,Tue Jun 30 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't think an argument that only relies on future health is a great argument, especially for a guy who is more expensive, older, and on our books longer. What if Rudy gets injured? Then what? You could play the what if injury game with anyone."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,imhungryforpizza,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:33:36 2015 UTC,Rudy doesn't have a history of injuries though. Jrue has barely played 70 games over TWO SEASONS. His future health is absolutely a valid argument. He'll probably miss some more time this year as well since he just had surgery. I'd much rather have healthy Gay with a small chance to get injured over an injured Jrue who hasn't been healthy in a couple years.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,0,Tue Jun 30 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"Tyreke did not run our offense ""amazingly"" last season. Tyreke is not a good PG. He's like passable. He might be a top 20 PG.   Rudy Gay is mediocre to solid, old, and his last two teams basically begged someone to take him.  Jrue for Gay is a terrible trade for our team, and a terrible value for Tyreke. This is almost certainly the HIGHEST Gay's value will ever be. This is almost certainly the LOWEST Jrue's value will be (unless he's just done because of injuries). This is a bad idea."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,imhungryforpizza,0,Wed Jul 1 03:47:30 2015 UTC,Keeping Jrue doesn't make us a contender either.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,5,Tue Jun 30 21:34:18 2015 UTC,He is piece that will. Especially since we can get a wing in 2016. When is a 24 year old point guard who is elite at defense going to be on the market again?

NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,ThorBarnes,4,Tue Jun 30 22:15:36 2015 UTC,So you know the future?
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,0,Tue Jun 30 22:18:15 2015 UTC,He played about 75 games out of 164. He was injured when we got him. Im assuming the trend continues.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,LieutenantKumar,2,Tue Jun 30 22:31:48 2015 UTC,It's short sighted to think he will never get healthy and make a move that makes less flexible based on that.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,thejimmyst,2,Tue Jun 30 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"Curry had serious injury concerns just a couple years ago. The Warriors would be kicking themselves if they traded him on the premise that ""he won't be healthy ever since he has an injury history."" Jrue could never miss another game in his career for all we know."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,thejimmyst,4,Tue Jun 30 22:45:17 2015 UTC,I don't know. I love Jrue. I'd love to see what he could do while healthy. He's an amazing defender and distributor.   Gay doesn't really space the floor which would give Reke and AD room to work. But maybe we don't need a floor spacer in the new system.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,irrationalportions,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:24:19 2015 UTC,"I just don't see Jrue 1) getting healthy and 2) running the fastbreak in Gentry's offense. He's never been a good fastbreak guy. He works best in the halfcourt.   Spacing isn't really an issue either. Gay is a pretty good three point shooter. He's not Curry, but 35% isn't anything to sneeze at. He also shot much better percentages earlier in his career with Memphis when he had a smaller role, so I could see him shooting even better than he has for the past couple seasons."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Good_NewsEveryone,4,Tue Jun 30 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"I just don't see Jrue 1) getting healthy   Do you have the medical reports?   2) running the fastbreak in Gentry's offense. He's never been a good fastbreak guy. He works best in the halfcourt.    What is this based on? Jrue is by far our best decision maker for starters. Secondly Gentry's system isn't to fast break it, its to get in sets faster and execute them quicker.    Spacing isn't really an issue either. Gay is a pretty good three point shooter. He's not Curry, but 35% isn't anything to sneeze at.    Any time you start Tyreke and Asik it will always be an issue.    He also shot much better percentages earlier in his career with Memphis when he had a smaller role, so I could see him shooting even better than he has for the past couple seasons.    Gay had one good season in Memphis as a shooter. His two most efficient stints have been in Sactown."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Good_NewsEveryone,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:03:44 2015 UTC,Have you seen Jrue? He hasn't even played half a season in the two seasons he's been with us.   Jrue is widely regarded as a half court guy. He always slows it down rather than running the break.  We started Reke and Asik for a lot of last season and we didn't have spacing issues. Explain that to me.   He's shot around 35% almost every year of his career. That's pretty good if you ask me.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Tue Jun 30 22:07:38 2015 UTC,Jrue is widely regarded as a half court guy. He always slows it down rather than running the break.   Look at the two coaches he has played for. Then look at their average paces and get back to me.    We started Reke and Asik for a lot of last season and we didn't have spacing issues. Explain that to me.   Except we did. Did we not watch the playoffs? Where Asik and Tyreke were being ignored?
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,thejimmyst,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"We played a top five team all time last season. Reke and Asik weren't the only problems in that series. Nobody but AD and EG could do anything on the court, and we couldn't stop them defensively.   Reke plays bad for 4 games (while he's freaking injured) and all of a sudden we have spacing issues? We didn't have them when we played in the regular season, but all of a sudden we have them because of four games against an all time great team? Ok man."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,thejimmyst,0,Tue Jun 30 22:18:04 2015 UTC,We didn't have spacing issues last year? Do you watch Pelicans games man?
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,thejimmyst,0,Wed Jul 1 03:52:04 2015 UTC,"Eric Gordon, Quincy Pondexter, and Anthony Davis all spaced the floor for us after the all star break. We can have a couple of guys who aren't great shooters on the floor with those guys.   I watched all 86 games we played last year. Do you watch the Pelicans? Because we didn't have spacing issues after the all star break until the playoffs when everyone but AD and EG were injured."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,DRphoenix99,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:57:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe try watching another team to see what a team without spacing issues look like.   You watched all 86 games last year? Cool story. I watched like 75-80 games last year too. I love the Pellies too man, as evidenced by me talking about them on a fucking subreddit."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,imhungryforpizza,0,Wed Jul 1 04:08:07 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of basketball. I watched at least 3 games of every team this year. Some other teams as much as 30 times. I know what teams with spacing issues look like. We aren't one of them. Our players don't have trouble getting to the rim, do they? No. And do you know why that is? Because we have good fucking spacing."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,imhungryforpizza,4,Wed Jul 1 04:13:25 2015 UTC,Terrrrible.  Gay will halt everybody's development while Jrue will only help.  Gay has been not wanted at any team he was and is part of because he is a blackhole.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,greatblack,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:53:20 2015 UTC,In his time with Sacremento that has changed quite a bit from what I understand. At least at the beginning of last season with Mike Malone he was playing off ball a ball and the ball movement was really nice. He isn't the old Rudy Gay anymore.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,greatblack,3,Tue Jun 30 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"Not a huge fan. Gay is a pretty mediocre shooter and with Tyreke and Asik already out there, that's the last thing we need. An Evans/Gordon/Gay/Davis/Asik lineup really only has one serious 3 pt threat.   I don't see any reason Jrue can't play in Gentry's offense. Pels played at a higher pace with Jrue on the floor last year than any other major rotation player. And he has the ability to play off the ball and defend."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,jetlife_,0,Tue Jun 30 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"Gay has shown throughout his career that he can be a pretty damn good shooter. He just drives to the basket more than he shoots. He's also really good on the fastbreak, and if we really plan on running this year that can help.  I just don't know that Jrue can really get healthy. His leg is really making me nervous now. It's been messed up since he was with Philly, and he'll be coming off a surgery again to start this season. I'd rather have a healthy SF over a broken PG anyday."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Im_Daydrunk,2,Tue Jun 30 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"Gay is what, a 34% career 3pt shooter? And on low volume. That's pretty mediocre. Not terrible though.  I'm optimistic about Jrue's future health. He just got that screw taken out and will have all off season to rest. Gentry has talked a bit about shorter practices and things like that, so that could help.  It wouldn't be a terrible deal, I'm just not totally sold on it. You also appear to like Tyreke playing point a lot more than I do."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Im_Daydrunk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:11:46 2015 UTC,I really like Tyreke at point. It's the best way to play him. If we don't have him run the point he can't do anything. I'd rather get the best out of our players than have them play out of position and not at their peak levels.   Also Gay isn't a low volume guy. He takes about 3 attempts a game. He took 200 threes and shot 36%.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,jetlife_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"Per 100 possessions he attempted less 3's than Aminu last year. He's about as good a shooter as Paul Millsap from 3. Millsap does it well for a PF but for a SF, its pretty mediocre.  Eh, he can still ""run the point"" even when there are two other guards on the floor. I like Tyreke off the bench where he can really dominate the ball, but even if he's playing along side Holiday I think there's plenty of ball to go around."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Im_Daydrunk,0,Wed Jul 1 14:12:12 2015 UTC,Tyreke isn't a PG. If you want to play our players in the correct position quit trying to start Tyreke at PG. Tyreke is a wing who can't shoot. He's a good player and I'm glad to have him.
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,Im_Daydrunk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:57:08 2015 UTC,"Do you know who Tyreke Evans is?!? He is absolutely a point guard. That guy can't play on the wing to save his life. He's undersized, can't play offball, and can't shoot. He also can't guard guys bigger than him. He's had the two best years of his career playing point guard. You're an idiot if you think he's a wing player."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,defeatedbycables,0,Wed Jul 1 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"Don't call people an idiot, it truly ruins any discussion. Grow the fuck up. Tyreke is not a PG, he's a 2 that can't shoot."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,defeatedbycables,0,Wed Jul 1 04:05:53 2015 UTC,"Well it's what I believe you are.  Tyreke can't play without the ball in his hands. When a player is the primary ball handler, they are typically your point guard. He started at the point for us for most of last season. How can you say he isn't a point guard?"
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,acethewarhawk,0,Wed Jul 1 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"How can I say he isn't a PG? Because I've watched him play basketball for 5 damn years. Yes he started at PG for us most of last season. And he outperformed most expectations. That doesn't mean he was ""amazing"" as you have said.   Tyreke is pretty good with the ball in the hands. He's very good at getting past the first man. He's an ok passer. He's also turnover prone, has shit court vision, and can't shoot (being able to shoot is very important for the pick and roll).   Also, you've called me an idiot twice. You are poisonous to have on the forum."
NOLAPelicans,3bofc2,DaBear405,3,Wed Jul 1 04:14:44 2015 UTC,"Jrue is perfect 3rd guy on a contender, and Davis is a perfect 1st guy. I would rather keep them both and make a run at KD next offseason then shortsighted make a move for an older and more expensive Rudy Gay.

NOLAPelicans,3bky7o,sonusfaber,3,Tue Jun 30 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"All these questions about ""Are the Pelicans able to build a champ roster around Davis?""  I have watched the now Pelicans since 2007. The amount of moves this franchise has made is stunning. They have gone from the joke of the owner's meeting to a first class organization with the only young name who rivals Lebron.  We went from a general manager who thought he could coach to Dell Demps. We went from an owner who treated the franchise as a ""spend less, make more"" business, to one who embodies, ""Write checks instead of sucking your thumb."" The only thing Bower ever did was make the right call on Paul at 4th. This franchise is willing to fire a winning coach. We made the playoffs and lost to the team that won the entire championship.   I'm excited for next season. I think Gordon is going to give us what we have been waiting for. Smart players are going to recognize what is about to happen and get on board.  ETA: Fixed grammars"

NOLAPelicans,3bl0pz,SteelOliver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:26:36 2015 UTC,There just seem to be a lot of posts about trades and trying to land big names. Most names I've seen thrown out there aren't legit suggestions to fill up the MLE or BAE. I know that it isn't sexy to talk about those things but that is all we will realistically do this off-season
NOLAPelicans,3bl0pz,acethewarhawk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:35:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. My post about Greg Monroe was purely to generate discussion on some news that I read, not that I necessarily thought he would be a good fit for the team.   My biggest concern for the off-season is keeping Norris Cole. His abilities off the bench were HUGE for the Pels last season, especially with Jrue's injuries."
NOLAPelicans,3bl0pz,pottersquash,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"I have only been following Bball closely since Pels switched and as far as I can tell this absolutely never happens. Seems every team gets to keep like 7 guys and the entire rest of the team is dumped. I don't get. It makes it hard for me as a fan, but its how the NBA is done."
NOLAPelicans,3bl0pz,thejimmyst,2,Tue Jun 30 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"Players want raises, and you can't afford to pay them all. On our team, Withey, Cole, and Ajinca all want raises. Davis just got a huge raise. If we just pay them all then we eat up a ton of cap room, in this case on 3 backups.   More turnover comes from the end of the roster. If you look at the roster on the sideboard, players like Jimmer Fredette, Elliot Williams, and Luke Babbitt are nothing but journeyman. It'd be foolish to at least not look at other options there.  And then most teams add a rookie or two (not us because we'd rather 600k), this is obviously good for the future, gets players on under relatively cheap contracts, and is actually good for player morale (rookies can get ""hazed"", it gives the veterans someone to take under their wing, etc).  That's 8 players right there. Although NBA rosters are 15 players, realistically they are closer to like 10. In the playoffs, most teams prefer an 8 or 9 man rotation. So keeping 7 guys is keeping most of your true roster, the rest is mostly filler in the NBA."

NOLAPelicans,3bl0pz,defeatedbycables,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"I'm good with keeping the roster as it is with the exception of how much I hate the Asik trade and his contract. He just didn't pan out the way I imagined it would, but I'm good with letting it ride a year with Gentry to see what changes are made.  I still feel like AD, Jrue, Tyreke, Gordon, Asik gives us a very competitive starting 5, even if we lack a true SF in that lineup."
NOLAPelicans,3bk95v,acethewarhawk,3,Mon Jun 29 22:19:38 2015 UTC,"He's looking for max. Pels would have to trade at least one other core player and renounce Asik.  On top of that, I don't see him as a good fit for the Pels at all."
NOLAPelicans,3bk95v,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Mon Jun 29 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he said the Pels would have to show interest, so I'm assuming they haven't. They also weren't on the list of possible teams, but he did mention he would like to play in NOLA, so I thought it was worth posting."
NOLAPelicans,3bk95v,BigEarl139,3,Mon Jun 29 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"He isn't as good of a defender as Asik is. He can't protect the rim, and I'm not sure he could really bang with the bigger guys down low so AD didn't have to (Monroe feels like more of a PF). He doesn't stretch the floor on offense but at least he can score in the post. And he's a great rebounder. That being said, he won't really fit that well into Gentry's system and he wants too much money. If he wanted to come to the Pelicans he'd have to take a major pay cut. He also wouldn't be getting as many endorsement deals as he would if he signed with LA and NY, so the chances he signs with us are probably less than 1%."

NOLAPelicans,3bh6lz,thejimmyst,3,Mon Jun 29 18:03:24 2015 UTC,Dudley would be a home run acquisition IMO. Versatile defensively and a great shooter. Not to mention he loves NOLA and is familiar with Gentry.

NOLAPelicans,3bh6lz,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really rate experience very highly, this is how we ended up with Posey. Also, Dudley's numbers last year were down compared to PHO as well, not just his Clippers numbers. That being said, I agree he'd be a great fit. He's a far superior player to Cunningham."
NOLAPelicans,3bh6lz,thejimmyst,3,Mon Jun 29 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"Problem with Posey was his contract. He was coming off a championship run in Boston and had been in the league for a decade. We got him at 32.   I think Dudley is a bit different, at 29 he should be stable for a few years, but by experience, I mean experience in the coach's system already. I think that is more valuable than generic experience."

Anderson had a poor season last year and is a consistent injury concern. This isn't even going into his poor defense and shitty contract, which only brings his value down even more. Withey is probably a D-League caliber player, he isn't even worth a second rounder.  There is just no way they are giving up the best center in the league for so little in return. At least the talks that were happening with the Magic involved Nic Vuc, a legitimate 20 and 10 guy - and even then the Kings weren't convinced.

The trade you're suggesting does not provide that, it only makes them a weaker team. Cousins is a franchise player. Lawson is not a franchise player. Anderson is not a franchise player. Whithey may not even be an NBA player.

NOLAPelicans,3b5miv,danial133416,2,Fri Jun 26 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"Michigan State power forward.  shorter guy for his position at 6'6 but he made up for it in college with his freakish athleticism which let him grab a high amount of rebounds.  Good defender and shot blocker, not a great shooter but a passable mid-range game"

NOLAPelicans,3b5miv,danial133416,2,Fri Jun 26 04:10:31 2015 UTC,I understand that the pelicans are trying to find their own draymond green but a power forward who's 6'6.. ? You have got to be kidding me.. He's going to get killed on the boards..
NOLAPelicans,3b5miv,BlackScienceJesus,2,Fri Jun 26 04:13:58 2015 UTC,He won't be that terrible.  In college he relied on athleticism which brought him double-digit boards often playing the center/power forward
NOLAPelicans,3b5miv,Wild_Cabbage,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:16:53 2015 UTC,NBA.com has him listed as a SF.

It's weird; I feel like this is something most fans have wanted for some time, but it's coming just when there's a feeling Gordon was finally going to become some version of the guy we always hoped he'd be. His contract is due to Phoenix really wanting him....during Gentry's tenure as head coach there. I'm sure Gentry would love to work with Gordon, but at the same time having Jeff Green would solve a LOT of problems for us (plus Green has experience with Erman, as the article reports).   That said, if 'Reke's shooting improves, the idea of a Holiday/Evans/Green/Davis/Asik starting five is pretty damn exciting."

He never really gave a shit and was always injury prone. I am sure that a half of season of him knocking down threes won't make dell forget the shit he did in the years prior.
NOLAPelicans,3b4j49,danial133416,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"Kind of. To me, it seemed more like he was disheartened due to injuries than he was just lazy. Add to this the fact that EG was on some pretty bad teams when he was lazy and Jefe Verde has been on good, even GREAT, teams and not given a shit. At least EG, now that we're winning, is putting in the work to improve. That's still no excuse for laziness, but there's no sense in replacing a former lazy guy with a currently lazy guy who spaces the floor less."

Who said he had a piss poor attitude? Pelicans fans that were angry at him for wanting to go to a rising team in the Suns (at the time)? We were going no where as a team, no A.D, no Holiday, no Tyreke. Can't blame the guy for wanting out, PHX was offering him good money, too.   He never really gave a shit and was always injury prone.   Where are you reading that he ""never gave a shit""? That's pure conjecture."

NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,LieutenantKumar,2,Sat Jun 27 03:41:33 2015 UTC,For him we could try to do a ryno + pick or a sign in trade with asik + a pick for jv.   And for gallinari we could easily do a tyreke for gall straight up swap. Both have similiar contracts while tyreke gets to be the primary ball handler in denver and we finally get a starting sf.
NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,jetlife_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:23:05 2015 UTC,"I think JV is worth way more than that. And idk about Gallo. I like him, just not sure about his health."
NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,DRphoenix99,2,Thu Jun 25 04:24:37 2015 UTC,He had a unlucky acl tear a few years ago and the doctor fucked up pretty badly in his surgery which forced him to miss most of last season. He just had a 47 point game back in april and he's a really underatted defender too. And even kevin durant called him one of the toughest defensive players in the nba to play against. But you're right we would have to gamble on his health which is an issue but fixable as long as we have a good training staff. And honestly i don't see tyreke being that effective with us unless he's the primary ball handler but that's gone since jrue will be returning. And right now this is the best value tyreke has ever had so he's a really good trade chip.  Also jv is underatted as fuck right now. We can really get him without having to give up much.
NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"Also jv is underatted as fuck right now. We can really get him without having to give up much.

NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,DRphoenix99,3,Thu Jun 25 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"K.J McDaniels is someone I'd love to bring in, wanted to make a move for him last draft and at the deadline when he was being shopped. I love his game and potential and think he's a solid fit with this roster but if you want more instant results from his minutes he isn't the guy.  Since Quin Cook and Cliff Alexander went undrafted I'd like to see either of them get camp invites. Jay Hook just got a summer league invite and with Curry already on the summer league roster it's getting harder to see Cook get an invite.  Also I don't see everyones problem with selling the pick, 600k could easily fund all the contracts to summer league guys or a minimum or unguarenteed deal next year. Personally I'd rather sell the pick and then take the best summer league guy because he would have a larger chance to succeed with the team IMO after working with coaches and the system you see which guys fit and who don't."
NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,SteelOliver,2,Fri Jun 26 13:15:19 2015 UTC,Here is what I want:  1) Full MLE to Brandon Wright  2) BAE to Marcus Thornton  3) Re-sign Dante using bird rights  4) Re-sign Cole  Jrue - Cole - Douglas  Gordon - Thornton   Pondexter - Evans - Dante  AD - Anderson - Dante  Asik - Wright - Withey  Leaves two roster spots open for min level guys.
NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,LieutenantKumar,2,Thu Jun 25 15:07:25 2015 UTC,56th pick + idk unguarenteed on seth or something or if the 56th is either moved or stashed 2 summer league guys on unguarenteed deals. This would be nice to start the year. Would bet whoever the 13th/14th guys are don't see the year through though.   Also you think Wright would only get MLE? I'm curious to see how much he gets after his moves.
NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,LieutenantKumar,2,Thu Jun 25 15:51:29 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine Wright getting much more than the MLE. Maybe someone offers him 6-7M. Idk, PHX does have cap space."

NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,Jrue-Jitsu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:56:07 2015 UTC,Maybe the pelicans are trying to save 6 million in cap space. But i wouldn't really want to do a straight up trade. Maybe green + a first rounder for gordon ?

NOLAPelicans,3b1azi,BlackScienceJesus,3,Thu Jun 25 05:32:21 2015 UTC,We have negative space due to cap holds. Need to renounce guys to clear it up. Even then it is not much.

NOLAPelicans,3azp0h,BigEarl139,5,Wed Jun 24 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"The jerseys are knockoffs, they aren't legit jerseys.    I think it depends,  this is my first order but sometimes you will get good ones sometimes you will get bad ones is what I gathered.   The site itself is like a Chinese Ebay, payments are safe etc, if the item doesn't come you can dispute for your money back, and the vendors largely operate from reputation, the absolute last thing they want is negative feedback.  I have another legit jersey, and you can tell the difference in materials, the legit one is thicker etc...but honestly man, for $25 vs over $200, I'm perfectly satisfied, and I really like the unique design."

I don't care if they're made out of crap material, I was just worried about being scammed. But if it's safe I'll totally use it. They have some awesome jersey's that I've been wanting for a long time (LSU Pete Maravich one for startes). Thanks for the explanation."
NOLAPelicans,3azp0h,pottersquash,3,Wed Jun 24 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you use a vendor that has good feedback.  I was told that when searching, order from vendors who have ""diamonds"" (you'll see it, it's basically just a symbol from someone who has done tons of volume and has great feedback), and you can sort by reputation too, see other customers who also bought the jersey you want comments on the jersey that you like etc"

NOLAPelicans,3auowy,LieutenantKumar,4,Tue Jun 23 18:07:09 2015 UTC,Jason Smith hustles though! Not like that awful Asik who never runs up the court for offense. I think Jason Smith and Ryan Bowen would be an unstoppable force together.
NOLAPelicans,3auowy,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Tue Jun 23 21:13:12 2015 UTC,I love you just for even mentioning Rybo
NOLAPelicans,3auowy,Wolverigne,3,Wed Jun 24 04:08:09 2015 UTC,I heard Ryan Bowen used to put itching powder in his asshole to keep his energy high.   Definitely one of the greats.

Houston that year was #1 in pace of play and other things too...Gentry is going to change our pace of play, it's going to be SOOO much faster and Asik should play better under those circumstances. just wait, ASIK will be crucial this year! :)"

Played under Gentry in PHX and Robin is 2 years younger. Him and Asik are probably going to make the same money and I want the player who shoots 80% from the stripe.

Honestly with Tyreke, we don't need Rudy."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,bunkcephus,2,Tue Jun 23 16:42:05 2015 UTC,I'd rather we go after Cousins than Gay. Maybe Eric Gordon and a 1st for Cousins...

NOLAPelicans,3astm7,afriendlyspider,3,Tue Jun 23 12:30:25 2015 UTC,Sacramento would laugh in our face if we offered that.
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,jetlife_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:36:37 2015 UTC,Then replace Jrue with Evans and throw in Ryno + a pick... whatever it takes to form the GOAT big man tandem.
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,afriendlyspider,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"Again, no way they would be interested. Jrue has a sizable contract and has some injury concerns - his value is at an all-career low. While Anderson could certainly be a solid piece on a championship team, the Kings aren't close to that. He makes way too much money for the performance he put up last year. Not having a first round pick in three years could seriously come back to haunt us in the near future - even if the pick is in the bottom portion of the draft. Asik can't be traded because he is an unrestricted FA.  It'd be awesome to trade for Boogie but I don't think we have near the pieces to pull it off. He's an elite player about to hit the prime of his career - offering a bunch of role players and a late 1st round pick isn't going to get the deal done."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,jetlife_,2,Tue Jun 23 13:02:44 2015 UTC,Karl wants Cousins gone and Cousins probably wants to leave... I don't think getting him is as hard as you think.
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,afriendlyspider,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:07:52 2015 UTC,"The three-way deal that's been rumored would have the Kings getting a top five pick and Nick Vucevic from the Magic -- that's considerably more than what we could offer. In fact, I don't even think the Magic would trade Vuc for Holiday+Anderson, etc. - he's that good.   The Kings owner has also said that Cousins isn't on the block, so who knows."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,jetlife_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:11:00 2015 UTC,13 mil for 3 years is a great contract with the new cap
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,LieutenantKumar,0,Tue Jun 23 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"It's not. It's a mediocre contract because it's taking up a huge amount of cap space for an average at best player. 13 for 3 is a great contract to have Steph Curry on (I'm so jealous). It would be a great contract to have AD on. 13 for 3 is about what Rudy Gay is ""worth"", and a player on a contract equal to their worth is not a great contract, it's a suitable contract."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,thejimmyst,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"I say it's great because if you look at players who are expected to have similar production over the next 3 years, it's cheaper. See Chandler Parsons or Gordon Hayward. It'll be interesting to see what Batum, Harris, Danny Green, etc get. Mac guys like Green, Leonard, and Butler notwithstanding"
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"Parsons contract is pretty close, 7 million more total, and was sort of a poisonous contract, intentionally overpaid to get him away from Houston.   Gordon Hayward is just much, much better than Rudy Gay. I'd love to have Hayward on the team."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,thejimmyst,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"I would too, but he isn't much much better. They have comparable production."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"For sure, but Hayward is considered to be a better defender (I have no idea how good he actually is defensively honestly), is younger (less likely to decline/more likely to improve), takes less long 2s than Gay, and at least had the 1 year he shot well from 3."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,thejimmyst,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:20:14 2015 UTC,Imo getting boogie is unlikely but i think rudy gay could fit our team well.
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,thejimmyst,0,Tue Jun 23 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"Rudy Gay is not a solid three point shooter, he's a poor 3 pint shooter.  Rudy Gay is not a good defender, at best he's average. Rudy Gay cannot play the 4 effectively.   Rudy Gay has basically one ""elite"" skill, volume scoring. He's actually pretty good at scoring when he's covered. He's kind of like a tall version of Marcus Thornton. And no, I don't want him on our team."
NOLAPelicans,3astm7,thejimmyst,0,Tue Jun 23 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. I know who Jimmy Smith is, I just don't understand why this is funny or clever."

NOLAPelicans,3ac1cb,DaBear405,2,Thu Jun 18 21:47:21 2015 UTC,A healthy gordan + a healthy holiday + gentry = very good back court.   Anthony Davis + anyone = very good front court.   Pelicans are just a little depth and a few complimentary pieces away from serious contention.
NOLAPelicans,3ac1cb,thejimmyst,-1,Fri Jun 19 04:56:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's a stretch to call Holliday and Gordon a very good backcourt. More like average.  And I'm not sure it's true that Davis+anybody equals a good front court.   I do think we are 1 piece from being a serious contender, but I think that piece is like Westbrook or Gasol or Butler or Carmelo or something."
NOLAPelicans,3ac1cb,thejimmyst,2,Sat Jun 20 02:41:15 2015 UTC,A stretch to call them great or all-star. They are better than average though.

NOLAPelicans,3acb35,iAlsoAmNotkevinBacon,5,Thu Jun 18 23:23:06 2015 UTC,His extension is 13m per year. Which with the new cap will end up being quite a decent contract for a good starter
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,thejimmyst,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"Midlevel contracts are poison to building rosters, because you end up with Asik on a ""decent"" contract, Jrue on a ""decent"" contract, Tyreke on a ""decent contract"" and then Gay on a ""decent"" contract and you are maxed out and still don't have a second star.  The value in the NBA is in getting max contract players. Not getting David Lee or Rudy Gay."
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,jetlife_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"Bit late but I think putting David Lee and Rudy Gay together is a bit disingenuous. Gay can still put up 20+ a night, not so much for David  Lee..though I do agree with your overall sentiment."
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,LieutenantKumar,4,Tue Jun 23 13:21:52 2015 UTC,"This trade actually isn't legal, and the last thing the King need is another PF that cant shoot. Faried's extension kicks in this season."
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,uncreativeun,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:18:39 2015 UTC,"I would say no. I think Gay is a loser. Not like in life, but he doesn't know how to win.  Grizzlies, got rid of him, and they do better that season and are pretty successful next few years. Raptors have surprising season getting top three seed after getting rid of him. Kings were already bad, but they didn't get any better with him. It just seems like teams get better when they get rid of him. At least speaking of the regular season."
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,thejimmyst,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:52:04 2015 UTC,"No, because Rudy Gay is another version of Jrue and Tyreke. Getting the 15th best player at every position isn't the way to build around Davis, we need to get another stud somehow. Gordon may actually have some trade value if he starts off hot, but Gay isn't ever going to have real trade value. Locking up cap space long term for a medium player is how we lose AD.  Course, maybe I'm wrong and Rudy Gay comes over and scores 22 PPG and leads us to the finals. But that'd be basketball and I doubt it would happen."
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,rephil0309,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:35:05 2015 UTC,No way. He has a similar skill set to Tyreke but we'd be giving up our best floor spacer. The floor geometry would get all messed up.
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,Eman5805,2,Thu Jun 18 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, Gay is a better shooter than Tyreke and is a far better defender."
NOLAPelicans,3acb35,Jameisisabitch,2,Fri Jun 19 00:27:08 2015 UTC,"Not similar to Tyreke at all, in fact"

NOLAPelicans,3aa7pv,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"I don't remember seeing much of that. I know he has stone hands.  It's frustrating.  But if he's just throwing deep, while not even coming down to play offense, I'd be happy."
NOLAPelicans,3aaxxa,DRphoenix99,-2,Thu Jun 18 16:58:38 2015 UTC,I appreciate the consistency in punctuation errors and full page ads. (Alien Blue).
NOLAPelicans,3aaxxa,Dj_Nussdog,2,Fri Jun 19 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"What punctuation errors did you find? You comment this on all my stuff and never point them out.   I don't get paid, I do research and write about the Pelicans because I love this team and I want to inform fans of what's going on with the team as best I can.  I'm not responsible for the adds on the page, I'm really sorry if they bother you.   Last week someone pointed out errors I had made and I was grateful. I have no problem with constructive criticism but it seems like you just have a vendetta against my articles.   If you don't want to read them please don't, I'm sorry about the ads.

NOLAPelicans,3a6aa5,DaBear405,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"There are a couple from people that obviously aren't Pels supporters. If you check out their profiles they all post on a Thunder blog. One guy's name has OKC in it and it just says ""Ha"". Id guess they are still salty about losing the 8 seed."
NOLAPelicans,3a6aa5,rephil0309,0,Wed Jun 17 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair ""ha"" does not really make a comment salty. Its like a Pelican fan reading an article about how new york will make a run for AD or something. How are you supposed to respond? And I doubt most people are salty over the 8th seed. Most fans didnt even want it towards the end of the season. I live in OKC and the general sentiment was that OKC would eventually get healthy and Durants foot would heal by the time playoffs started and all they needed to do was make the playoffs. Well KD and Serge went out for the season and the injuries to role players never stopped either so by the end people just said fuck it."
NOLAPelicans,3a6aa5,DaBear405,2,Wed Jun 17 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"Other ones definitely worse than ""ha"". ""post was good enough to bring the thunder fans here.. but he aint leaving! /cry"" or ""I'ts probably because they don't get too many likes around here"". Both of these are salty AF.   You're saying that Thunder fans wouldn't rather be in the Playoffs than outside looking in? I doubt that. What you described is the mindset of a fan base that needed some solace. After they didn't make it everyone is like ""Oh well we didn't really wanna be there anyway"""
NOLAPelicans,3a6aa5,rephil0309,0,Wed Jun 17 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"None of those posts really said anything derogatory or salty about AD or Nola... And yes, by the time KD and Serge went down most fans knew it would be a sweep and wanted a lottery pick. Several articles even weighed the pros and cons. Even the newspaper had an article talking about the lottery vs playoffs.    What you described is the mindset of a fan base that needed some solace. After they didn't make it everyone is like ""Oh well we didn't really wanna be there anyway""   No offense here man but you are being a pretty bad sport. Like what, you want the Thunders collective fan base to cry until next season? And that 'mindset' came on way before the Pelicans got the 8th seed i can tell you that."

He could have easily taken the surgery and chilled in LA all year. Not to mention he changed his game to be a spot up shooter to fit the team.  He was kind of an ass hat at the beginning but everyone makes mistakes. IIRC he came out and he said he regrets all those comments too.  Looking forward to watching him play for the Pels next year.

NOLAPelicans,39hfg5,jetlife_,3,Thu Jun 11 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"certainly not enough to work hard and earn his ridiculous contract.   What? The Pelicans gave him that contract man, he earned it (at least the FO thought he did) with his play prior to the extension. You can say what you want about EG, but knocking him for not ""working hard"" is a complete straw-man argument. Let's face it, the guy has had horrible luck with injuries, and his talent may have never been at the level his contract suggests in the first place. Our FO was desperate to hold on to their only return from the Chris Paul trade so they had to outbid the Suns for them. By saying he doesn't work hard enough, are you also implying he is purposely not trying hard, out of spite for us giving him a lucrative contract? That would be Gordon shooting himself in the foot, essentially. If he plays anywhere near the level that he played at this past season, he will be getting a pretty decent contract somewhere.  Besides, why all the love for CP3 in this sub (who clearly forced a trade) and the hate for Gordon? Seems like a bit of a double standard. Our team was going absolutely no where before we drafted AD (i.e why Paul wanted out)....can't blame a guy for wanting to go elsewhere to play for a competitor, while in the process taking less money."
NOLAPelicans,39hfg5,SteelTyphoon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"You make a really good argument!  Knocking players for injuries has become pretty common, but the reaction seems to vary: westbrook gets the ""tough luck"" label; rose gets his commitment called into question.  Also agree about not blaming a guy who wants to play for a competitor, but same story here: LeBron took just a little heat for the decision, hahahaha"
NOLAPelicans,39hfg5,jetlife_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:50:30 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't understand why so many NOLA fans still respect or like CP3 with how much of a douche he was to get off the team.   Look, I agree the management sucked but there was no need to act so unprofessional. I mean look what we have now. It would have been one thing if he waited till free agency and left when he had no obligation to stay, but the fact remains that he whined and cried until he got his way, and the hornets got EG who clearly never wanted to play in New Orleans. Just a shitty situation really.  Thank God we have AD now who doesn't seem like he's going to have the whiny attitude that CP3 had and he will make the team better. I really love watching the clippers lose and would love nothing more than to see the Pelicans go deeper in the playoffs than the flopping crybaby clippers."

He could blossom under this new system. Keep in mind -- when EG signed that offer sheet from PHX, Gentry was their coach."
NOLAPelicans,38st1y,Phunkatron,2,Sun Jun 7 04:47:28 2015 UTC,"True, personally my best case scenario is that we convince Gordon to opt out and resign a smaller more secure deal. Something like 24/3 or something"
NOLAPelicans,38st1y,Phunkatron,2,Sun Jun 7 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"That would mean he'd think he could only make $9 million total over those last 2 years, which is absurd.

NOLAPelicans,38sprl,Guyote_,5,Sat Jun 6 14:13:03 2015 UTC,My christmas wishlist.   Not resigning asik. Eric gordon opting out.
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,danial133416,8,Sat Jun 6 17:07:09 2015 UTC,Asik is going to play a Bogut type role for us. Really hope we keep him Eric Gordon is going to average 20 a game next year. You just watch
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,0,Sat Jun 6 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"Are u serious ?   Asik is no where near the player bogut is. Bogut is quicker, faster, better passer, better defender, more athletic and can finish around the rim very good. Asik was decent in the regular season because he's 7 feet tall and was able to grab boards and block shots against smaller sized opponents . Honestly notice how asik did when he went up against 7 foot centers his own size. He got dominated and he was exposed in the playoffs by the warriors pick an roll. He made bogut look like the best center in the league. Honestly we should go after a center like robin lopez who will fit in gentrys system and has done well under him before ( see 2010).  Yes gordon is a good player but he's not worth the 15 million we are paying him so if he opts out we could go after alot of big name free agents (kawi,gasol,dj etc). But i would love to have gordon back for lesser money.    I can't believe that people actually think that asik is a very good center.. But again i am not suprised since most people in this forum thought that monty was a good coach and wanted him back for next season LOL."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,danial133416,3,Sat Jun 6 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"Didn't say Asik was as good as Bogut, just that he would be playing a similar role. 25 minutes a game, setting lots of screens, protecting the rim. Stop hating so hard on Asik. I know he played terrible in the playoffs (I was super pissed and wanted him gone too), but he's pretty damn good. Really good rebounder and a hell of a defender. He's also freaking huge. He's exactly what our team needs. We won't get any other big men this year because of our cap issues (especially Robin Lopez, he hated it here in New Orleans). Just chill out and wait. Asik is going to be fine. Gordon isn't opting out, and even if he did we wouldn't be getting any of those big name free agents. Kawhi isn't leaving San Antonio, Gasol isn't leaving Memphis (and frankly he's too old), and DJ won't leave LA because Chris Paul is too good.    If you really think Asik is a bad center you probably didn't watch many games but the playoffs this year. Recency bias is a bad thing. Look at his numbers from this season. He was a great plus for us, and really helped our defense. He takes the big guys on defense so AD doesn't have to and sweeps up boards like a mad man. And where did you see people saying Monty was a good coach? From what I saw everyone wanted him gone. Monty is a great guy and we all love him, but nobody wanted him to stay. You're tripping man."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"While I agree with everything you say, there were some people who wanted to keep Monty. Trust me. They argued with me on a nightly basis."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:05:20 2015 UTC,Well I can see why some people would have wanted to keep him. AD loves the guy and people want AD to be happy because superstars leaving has become more and more of a thing in recent years. He's good a drawing up plays and good at developing players. I'm sure people were also nervous about us not finding a good coach as well. It makes sense that they wouldn't want him to go.
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,danial133416,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"I never said asik is bad. He is decent but he isn't a starter on a contending team because of his liability on offense. I get your point of wanting asik to stay due to his success in the reg season but he won't do u any good in the playoffs.  And alot of people wanted monty to stay after the win against the spurs and i remember getting downvoted into oblivion due to me trying to explain that why we should fire monty. After that game 3 against the warriors me and guyote finally shut them all up and one by one they started agreeing with us. It was basically me and guyote against everyone else. And about the big names not coming here man u never know, ad is a top 2 player in the nba and alot of players would want to play with him. And as for lopez he hated it here because we were one of the worst teams in the nba and we weren't winning, like gordon not wanting to be here since he knew we weren't contending and notice how gordon apologized for saying that after we started winning last season."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:05:49 2015 UTC,"Asik isn't a liability on offense. He converts at an average rate at the rim for a center, he grabs offense rebounds at one of the highest rates in the league, and he sets great screens. Centers aren't around for being dominant offense players anymore anyway. He just had a bad post season man. Two years ago he was fantastic with the Rockets in the playoffs. I don't see what you mean.  Just because we have AD doesn't mean we'll get big players. Look at KG with the Timerwolves. Lebron in his first stint with the Cavs. Even Tim Duncan with the Spurs. None of those guys ever got a big name to play with them. Not because nobody wanted to go there, but because they couldn't afford it. We're going to be paying AD someone around $35 million in a couple years. That's a lot of money.  Lopez didn't hate it here because we sucked. He hated the whole culture here. I can't find the statement he made, but it was clear he never wanted to come back here. And if Aldridge stays in Portland there's no way Lopez leaves."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,danial133416,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:54:50 2015 UTC,Two years ago he was starting on a number 8 seed rockets team that lost to the thunder in the first round who didn't have westrook. But i see the point u are trying to make. U think asik is a very good center ? Well lets wait till the season starts and u will see. ( if he get's re signed)
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,2,Sun Jun 7 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"I don't see what Westbrook has to do with Asik grabbing a crazy amount of rebounds and defending the rim really well.  He was good all season, so I know exactly what to expect."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,ptorsch97,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Asik is definitely a liability on offense. I went to about 25 games this year and watched almost every game and I am a huge fan. Asik has trouble just catching the ball, he's not very coordinated. He has no post moves at all, and he accumulates his points through put backs and wide open dunks. Any good center with decent size in the league bullies him around.   He's a solid defender, but specialists on the league don't deserve big contracts. Personally I don't think he deserves more than 8 per year and it would be a huge mistake if we gave him more than that."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"I've watched every game this season as well. He has trouble catching the ball, but very few big men in the league today have post moves. Not having post moves isn't a problem. Getting putbacks and wide open dunks for points is fine. We don't even need a good offensive guy next to AD. Also, the only guys I've seen bully him are ones that are bigger than him, and there isn't very many of those.  We'll give Asik 10 and he'll stay. We need the size so badly. With the cap jumping, that salary will be in a couple years what 6 million is now. He's a really great rebounder and a good defender. That's all we need in a big man. You guys are wanting someone like Boogie, but there are maybe 2 of those guys in the entire league. Every big man today is a specialist, and if they are good at what they specialize in they're going to get paid big contracts."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,ptorsch97,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"If you have trouble catching a ball you aren't worth 10/yr end of story. He doesn't fit in anything gentry does and he's so slow. We need a Tyson chandler like center. A guy who plays above the rim, who is coordinated, and has speed."
NOLAPelicans,38sprl,BigEarl139,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:56:00 2015 UTC,Bogut sure fits into Gentry's system. That is literally all Asik is going to do. Play defense and rebound. You're acting like we're going to run our whole offense through him. We aren't getting anything better dude. He's worth it. He proved it this season.

NOLAPelicans,38bs1d,RoastDaMostToast,5,Wed Jun 3 04:57:44 2015 UTC,"Depends. If everything clicks and we are winning lots of games- we could easily not see a bump in counting stats. I mean our full offensive arsenal should get points no matter what. We could easily see AD only average 22/10/3 but play only 32 MPG or something and we win 55+ games.   But for fun Ill say AD is at 26/11/3.5/2.9/1.8 on 57% shooting, 32 PER.   Jrue at 17/8/4. Gordon at 17/3/4 but super efficient. Reke at 16/6/6 in only 30mpg. Ryan at 15/5 also in about 30 mpg. And Asik at 6/10 and only getting blocked once per game in 25 mpg.   Honestly I don't see any of our guards playing more than 34mpg, and AD probably the highest at 36 MPG. But injuries could change everything."
NOLAPelicans,38bs1d,LieutenantKumar,6,Wed Jun 3 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if AD averaged 30-11-2-1-3 next season. I expect to see Jrue's stats stay the same since he has a play style on offense that doesn't get him many points or assists. I expect a major step back from Reke since he won't have the ball in his hands nearly as much (unless he really excels in Gentry's system which could happen). We will almost definitely bring back Asik, and I'm expecting 8 points 11 rebounds out of him. I honestly expect Eric Gordon to have a monster season. It'll be the first time he's been healthy to start a season since probably his first season with us, and I'm super hyped. I'm expecting probably 20 points on 43-40-88 splits with a couple rebounds and assists thrown in there (though he showed to be a more competent passer at the end of last season).   If Gentry is going to run a 7SOL style offense (which I doubt he will), you can expect these numbers to be even higher since that style of play inflates numbers even more. Either way I'm super excited for this upcoming season, and honestly think we can get into the 4-5 seed with a couple teams slipping off."
NOLAPelicans,38bs1d,BigEarl139,3,Wed Jun 3 05:21:35 2015 UTC,"I would love for Davis to absolutely explode next season but I was expecting around 28 points. I also think Reke will excel in Gentry's  quick offensive scheme. I wouldn't be surprised if he averaged 18/5/5. Jrue is the guy I'm most confused about. I'm hoping the new offense makes him more aggressive but he's still very passive. And with him and Tyreke on the floor together, the latter becomes the primary ball handler. I just can't wait until next season starts!"

Is good with PFs and big men, and surprisingly point guards. Never had a scoring dynamo like KD/Russ to work with.   As long as Billy is running the show you don't have to worry about the negatives - risk averse offense and slow pace."
NOLAPelicans,38bebz,LieutenantKumar,5,Wed Jun 3 03:30:47 2015 UTC,Not a ton as far as Xs and Os but that's what Billy is there for. He'll get along great with everyone and help develop the youngsters. He also has a good bit of experience to help Billy transition to the NBA
NOLAPelicans,38bebz,fireman225s,4,Wed Jun 3 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"He's done a great job in the past developing talent (Vasquez, Aminu, and Ajinca come to mind). He's a player's coach. He was known as a defensive guru, but I never saw that in NOLA."
NOLAPelicans,38bebz,professor_longhair,3,Wed Jun 3 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"You will love him as a person and a ""no bullshit"" guy in interviews and he game plans better than he gets credit for, but he's not great with in-game adjustments (aside from the aforementioned post-timeout plays) and can be frustratingly stubborn. If you want to see that frustration, search the hashtag ""#MontyBall."" I always thought he was similar to Brooks in that he was more of a mentor than an X's and O's guy, so if you liked that about Brooks, you'll get more of it."
NOLAPelicans,38bebz,SoItGoes504,2,Wed Jun 3 05:04:47 2015 UTC,They call him the scrub whisperer so there's hope for your young guys.
NOLAPelicans,38bebz,IHaveNoFiya,2,Wed Jun 3 05:35:36 2015 UTC,"Nice person, good developer and is great at drawing plays out of a timeout. That's about it."

NOLAPelicans,38aqjp,Good_NewsEveryone,4,Wed Jun 3 00:13:43 2015 UTC,So what I gathered from this is that AD is gonna score 40 points a game
NOLAPelicans,38aqjp,fireman225s,5,Wed Jun 3 03:05:49 2015 UTC,Only 40? Did he sit out the 2nd half?
NOLAPelicans,38aqjp,SteelOliver,3,Wed Jun 3 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"Don't we the ""slide"" ball screen to get AD the ball? Aside from the PG spinning it look eerily similar."
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,TheBrutalBrit1,10,Tue Jun 2 13:34:22 2015 UTC,"Excellent hire. Consider this. The Warriors were number 1 in pace and number 1 in defense. Boston was number 5 in pace, and put together an above average defense without a rim protector. Also when Alvin was with the Clips, they were 7th in pace, 9th in defense. Do you see a pattern here? We are hiring coaches who have been around a pace/motion oriented system yet can still mount an effective defense. This is huge."
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,LieutenantKumar,5,Tue Jun 2 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"Whats great about this, besides his defense, is that he is young, so by any chance he stays with us for Gentry's tenure rather than get a HC offer, he can definitely become Gentry's successor."
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,Sslagathor,2,Tue Jun 2 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"As someone not familiar with how coaching positions shift around, it's crazy to me that both incoming coaches were only at their previous team for a year. In my mind I figured you usually stick around for a few years before switching teams."
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,BioSpock,2,Tue Jun 2 14:08:10 2015 UTC,Both get an upgrade in Job Status and probably higher pay too!
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,BioSpock,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:19:16 2015 UTC,Oh I just saw in Ermans case it's actually assistant to associate. That definitely helps! But still there's no sense in loyalty to the team or anything like that? Its interesting.
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,dangercart,2,Tue Jun 2 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"Erman was third in line for the Celtics and our head coach is 38 and lead assistant is 40 and will be an HC within a few years. He was blocked from progressing in Boston so it makes sense for him to take a promotion with another team. It also doesn't hurt that he's a defensive specialist who now gets to work with Davis, Jrue, and Asik. I'm sure he's leaving with the full support of the Celtics' organization."
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,darkhornet,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:43:03 2015 UTC,"I would fully expect that if Erman is offered a head coaching job next year, he'll jump to take that. I don't begrudge guys for taking promotions over ""loyalty."" Until you're a head coach, you're working your way up the tree. Erman's just a very hot name and is able to move up more quickly."
NOLAPelicans,387rmt,XtopherP33,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"Earns is a unique situation where he was in a bad situation in GS 2 years ago.  Boston hooked him up this year most likely as a known stop gap due to an affinity for him historically and knowing the GS situation was not a what it was cracked up to be.  Go check out the story on The Bird Writes blog about him to get full context.  Gentry is the same thing, he was brought in knowing if they were successful, he would get a head coaching offer and the year with him would have helped Steve accelerate his HC chops.  This seems to just be potentially the perfect storm of circumstances benefiting the Pels, vs a question of loyalty and finicky tendencies."

Erman's defense and player development abilities + Gentry's offense (and with all the complaining about Gentry, I don't think his offense was ever in doubt) is going to make for a special team.

NOLAPelicans,386fge,danial133416,3,Tue Jun 2 04:35:58 2015 UTC,I'm so down to have a coaching staff of people that built this years Warriors team
NOLAPelicans,386fge,rephil0309,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:28:13 2015 UTC,Just keep in mind that that the title is a little misleading off of what Stein's tweet actually says
NOLAPelicans,386fge,LoCo89,-7,Tue Jun 2 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"This guy is a mole. He's the one that got fired in golden state for recording coaches conversations.  Also, I can confirm when the Celtics were in town for the Rockets first home game of the season, I was sitting near court side for an event, and Darren spent about 20 minutes talking to Gerson Rosas (rockets assistant GM) about trading Rondo  I don't think he's trust worthy.  Edit: There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with me, but I didn't do anything to not contribute to the conversation.  Edit 2: I'm sure he'll be a great hire, but from a professional standpoint, I'm just pointing out that he recorded conversations. Regardless of whether he was in the right (he probably was in the right, considering it was Jackson), it was wrong. I probably shouldn't have called him a mole, but I still don't think he's all that trust worthy, and that's just from personal experience."
NOLAPelicans,386fge,mr94feet,2,Tue Jun 2 11:33:53 2015 UTC,"Fired for recording conversations because he was trying to get evidence of Jackson undermining him behind his back. It's telling that he hired by Boston as lead scout about a week after that happened, and promoted to assistant over the summer. When it comes to Mark Jackson, the people least likely to be trustworthy are the man himself and his inner circle. Erman  is fine."
NOLAPelicans,386fge,VanGundysBaldHead,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:12:22 2015 UTC,Can you provide any sources? At least for your first statement.
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,NotThoseThings,7,Mon Jun 1 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"No. If we are shelling max or near max money, its not to a guard. Its to a wing or a center."
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:19:56 2015 UTC,You think Alvin would be a draw for Deandre?
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,LieutenantKumar,4,Mon Jun 1 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But again, money is a problem. You better be damn sure DJ is coming before you move guys for space."
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,Dredeuced,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:01:24 2015 UTC,Neat idea. How do we afford him? We'd have to get rid of either Evans or Gordon (since we're obviously not investing ANOTHER max contract into a wing player with all 3 of those salaries on our bill) and that seems like a difficulty.
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,Dredeuced,2,Mon Jun 1 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"Well, you'd either have to dump Gordon + draft pick(s) and let Asik walk or arrange a sign and trade.  Maybe something like this (Note that Deng's salary is in there to approximate Goran's max deal and wouldn't actually be included in a trade.  Also note you'd have to include picks to philly and/or miami to grease the wheels probably).  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=qzmml7a"
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,Dredeuced,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just don't see those teams making those deals. I'd love to trade Gordon's contract off for just about anything but I doubt any team in the league wants it."
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,Dredeuced,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"It's an expiring deal. Philly operates below the minimum salary floor. They'd definitely absorb Gordon's salary for draft picks. They've taken on short term contracts in return for draft picks many times over the last few years.  As far as Miami goes, they wouldn't want to trade goran for reke,  but if Dell and goran's agent made it clear that he was coming to new Orleans, they'd take what they could get."
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:25:03 2015 UTC,"I imagine Miami would view, like most people, the Tyreke contract as a net negative. They wouldn't trade Goran for a perceived downgrade and salary value.  I don't think Philly will have a hard time loading up on bloated contracts and, frankly, at this point I imagine they're planning to start working their young core into something and would atleast want their salary dumps to be experienced, successful veterans on the downswing rather than an injury prone 3 point specialist with very little else to offer."
NOLAPelicans,384dwg,BigEarl139,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:17:26 2015 UTC,"Judging by the mcw and kj trades, i'd say Philly is still very much in asset acquisition mode. Taking on gordon would be buying a draft pick(s).  They'd absolutely do it for the right price. As for miami, they're capped out and in win now mode. If they let goran walk for nothing, it's effectively the end of the era. But you may be right and they wouldn't want reke in which case goran can be signed outright by letting asik's walk or maybe they'd rather have Ryan.  There may not be a high likelihood of adding a guy like goran, but there are multiple ways to make it happen assuming you get buy in from the player."
NOLAPelicans,383ebc,dhunter47,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting read about our new head coach. My favorite ""Gentry played college basketball at Appalachian State under head coach Press Maravich, the father of “Pistol” Pete Maravich."""
NOLAPelicans,3815f4,idrop50bombsvsFnatic,3,Mon Jun 1 02:22:44 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't put any rumors to rest. The idea that AD is leaving is hinging that he cares more about his legacy/chance to win a title or going home to Chicago than money. Gobs and Gobs of money.   Now, if he wants to leave to win a championship, frankly if in 3 years we don't seem title worthy, let him leave. I have no stomach to tread water in the playoffs for years. But tell me where, cept as a Commander in the Lebron Army, can a player truly feel like a championship is guaranteed? Why wouldn't Pelicans attract others? Way I see it, if in 3-4 years we aren't attractive, same shit let him go.  So maybe he just wants to go home. Ok, maybe. But New Orleans is awesome and if he truly prefers to live and die in same area thats on him. Let him go. It's not nothing to do with anything."
NOLAPelicans,3815f4,pottersquash,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:22:57 2015 UTC,Let AD walk if we suck down the line? That's a fucking hot take right there
NOLAPelicans,3815f4,rephil0309,0,Mon Jun 1 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we all need to be prepared for him to leave - it's a very real possibility. And objectively, can we blame him? I would hate to see him become the next Kevin Love, wasting his prime on a team that is known as perpetual losers."
NOLAPelicans,3815f4,jetlife_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"It would immediately put to rest any rumors about AD leaving and we would attract all the former UK players in the league right now   Eh, maybe and doubtful.  Cal hasn't proven he can be a successful NBA coach - if we were to sign him, and things went horribly wrong, he would be on the first bus back to the NCAA. And even if he stay, there is no guarantee that A.D would want to stick around to play for a mediocre team.  As much as his former players seem to love Cal, I don't think those guys would take a pay-cut to play for him. Could he help us with recruiting those guys? It's possible, but that also requires for the free agent to A.) Be a fit for our team (they don't produce a ton of wing talent, which is where our team is the weakest), B.) Be willing to play for our team, C.) Potentially take a pay-cut. I just don't see a ton of former-UK guys in the league right now who would fill a hole.   I'm in the personal belief that if our team at least contends for the next few years, A.D will sign his next contract here. After that, when he's 29? Who knows."
NOLAPelicans,380yg4,greece666,2,Mon Jun 1 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"I hope u know that our defense got much better after we traded for qpon,cole and dante. Our defense was terrible at the start of the season due to a terrible bench. We had fucking austin rivers, jimmer and john salmons getting major minutes off the bench and those guys were terrible, my grandma would play better than them. Don't let the overall season numbers fool you."

Per the article, I think it has some interesting analysis, esp. on Anderson (which links to another article).   In any case, it is not saying the NOP D is bad but that it will have to improve quite a lot for the team to get to the next level."
NOLAPelicans,380yg4,danial133416,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:05:57 2015 UTC,We should get better since we now have a head coach who know's whats he doing and doesn't look lost at times like monty williams. I promise you we will be better this season.
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,Good_NewsEveryone,7,Sun May 31 17:02:18 2015 UTC,I read that when Alvin went to the interview he brought charts and stats to describe how he could use Asik. Gentry said that he can play him like  Bogut in the offense
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,rephil0309,1 point,Sun May 31 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"If Gentry does have a plan on how to use Asik then I would be willing to bring him back on that alone, but I'm still hesitant on giving him a long term deal. What kind of contract do you think he signs if he does stay?"
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,fireman225s,1 point,Sun May 31 18:15:53 2015 UTC,Not OP but I'd be more than happy to sign him to a 3 year deal worth around 16 million. He's only 28 so age isn't an issue. If Gentry thinks Asik can succeed in a Bogut like role than that makes me perfectly fine with resigning him.
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,RoastDaMostToast,1 point,Sun May 31 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"3 years at $16 million would be a steal. Too good to be true in my opinion. Especially with the cap rising, I would expect him to make $10 million per year at minimum. I'm hoping for a contract of the same length though, preferably with a team option."
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,RoastDaMostToast,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:25:44 2015 UTC,I really don't want to pay him anything over 10 million a year. We don't have a lot of cap space so we can't waste it all on an average center
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:44:48 2015 UTC,I would rather spend the money else where. This video is against a terrible Orlando team; I mean look at their starting 5. I think Robin Lopez would be a dream come true for Gentry if we could find a way to make that happen.
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,danial133416,1 point,Sun May 31 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"True. It is, of course, just one game; and only the highlights. I liked the way he threw outlet passes though. I never remember that from this year. Always basically a hand off and then walk it up the court.  I think a lot of people wanted to move on from Asik even before the coaching change. I wanted to bring him back under Monty. But I was pretty unsure about Asik in a fast paced offense. This is just what I dug up in brief research, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I also really like RoLo. Concerned that we can't afford him though."
NOLAPelicans,37z44a,danial133416,1 point,Sun May 31 21:34:12 2015 UTC,We should also go after that backup memphis center kosta koufos. He's really underatted and better than asik imo.
NOLAPelicans,37yp0g,DRphoenix99,6,Sun May 31 15:00:11 2015 UTC,"Gentry came with ""charts and graphs"" ... muahahahahahaha"
NOLAPelicans,37yp0g,L1Trauma,6,Sun May 31 16:31:55 2015 UTC,Been saying this for months. A 22 year old is not going to walk away from what is tens of millions of dollars more than he could get anywhere else.  People who say firing Monty was similar to CP3/Byron miss the fact that Paul had already tendered his extension.  All this plus the fact that the front office has shown they are willing to do anything to get the right pieces in place.
NOLAPelicans,37yp0g,defeatedbycables,3,Sun May 31 16:52:00 2015 UTC,Half the people who say AD is leaving say he's going to the Lakers or the Knicks. I don't take them seriously anyway.

NOLAPelicans,3806kr,danial133416,1 point,Sun May 31 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's probably not a good idea considering our training staff but keep in mind that he was screwed over on his first surgery.  Check out these articles for more information:  http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/09/06/danilo-gallinari-regrets-going-vails-steadman-clinic-first-knee-procedure/11465/  http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24697207/nuggets-danilo-gallinari-voices-displeasure-with-knee-surgery  So basically, he was convinced to undergo a rather different procedure in repairing his ACL tear b/c he was told that it would allow him a shorter recovery time. But his knee didn't heal correctly (Gallo blamed this on the doctor) so he needed another surgery which sidelined him for last season. And that same clinic has had some similar mishaps with other stars like Westbrook. Westbrook had his MCL repaired there BUT he required another surgery (just like Gallo) to fix some loose stitching."
NOLAPelicans,3806kr,DRphoenix99,1 point,Sun May 31 22:40:52 2015 UTC,Galo hasn't been the same since his torn acl. But i do like your thinking of trading tyreke for a sf.
NOLAPelicans,3806kr,RoastDaMostToast,2,Sun May 31 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"He really turned it up in the last stretch of the season though. In the last 2 months of the season (19 games total), he averaged 20/5/2 on 47/41/90. (Also had a career high 47 points in a 2 OT game against the Mavs)  His past injuries are concerning but keep in mind that the doctor screwed him over on his first surgery and he needed a second one to fix that fuck-up."

NOLAPelicans,3806kr,rps215,1 point,Sun May 31 22:36:32 2015 UTC,I would live Galllinari too but his injury history scares me. I mean he just recently tore his ACL. It seems like all of our seasons our best players have missed a massive amount of time so another injury prone guy might not be a good idea.
NOLAPelicans,3806kr,rps215,0,Sun May 31 23:50:50 2015 UTC,"Not a Pels fan, but hell no. Neither are durable really (even though Reke just head one of his healthiest seasons), and Reke adds more to the team IMO. Gallo may never reach his pre ACL-tear days again, and right now I feel like he's only limited to scoring. Reke is still able to do more at a higher level, and I think Gentry may be able to use him better than Monty did. And Gallo's defense is worse than Tyreke's IMO, so I don't know if having Gallo really upgrades the defense that much. Granted, I don't know a lot about QP's defense"
NOLAPelicans,3806kr,TheBionicShaboy,1 point,Sun May 31 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"And Gallo's defense is worse than Tyreke's IMO   Gallo's defense is actually good IMO. He has a good combination of size (6'10!), speed, and strength and he rarely gambles or is out of position. KD said he was one of the toughest defenders in the NBA and he had some pretty decent synergy stats back in Denver even though the Nuggets were TERRIBLE defensively.   And Tyreke's defense might look better b/c he's going up against guards but he's too small to guard the likes of KD/Barnes/Ariza/Batum."

I mean he didn't look the same in the beginning of the season b/c that was his first time playing in almost 2 years  but he finished the season strong, strong enough that Denver publicly came out and said they wanted to build around him."

NOLAPelicans,37wgn7,VanGundysBaldHead,4,Sat May 30 23:50:30 2015 UTC,Good pick. Now we need to bring in an defensive minded assistant. I say mike malone.
NOLAPelicans,37wgn7,dano2425,7,Sat May 30 23:51:14 2015 UTC,Malone is not in the picture. However there is a good chance they land Brain Shaw.
NOLAPelicans,37wgn7,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Sat May 30 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"It looks as if the Warriors may be adding Shaw instead, seeing as he's just moved back to Oakland. My guess is that Kerr and Adams would work on the offense, with Shaw as the primary defensive guy."
NOLAPelicans,37wgn7,LieutenantKumar,8,Sun May 31 00:01:36 2015 UTC,"Adams is the defensive genius, Gentry the offensive wiz. The Warriors will need a new offensive genius. Congrats to the Pellies on hiring Gentry.  As a Warriors fan for 45 years I'm sport to see him go, but glad to see him going to NOLA. I love your city and your team. I have a number two team for the first time. I hope we play y'all in the Western Conference Finals next year. Long live Alvin Gentry, long live the Brow and long live New Orleans!

NOLAPelicans,37wgn7,ARealKoala,2,Sun May 31 01:45:28 2015 UTC,I was kinda joking on my last post but seriously he's most likely going to the warriors since he visited their practice today.
NOLAPelicans,37wgn7,Zzzonked_Out,2,Sun May 31 00:03:55 2015 UTC,Did you see what Indiana players said when that happened? Shaw is a very good defensive coach. He'd be a great lead assistant to Gendry

NOLAPelicans,37w80r,BigEarl139,3,Sat May 30 22:31:42 2015 UTC,Tyreke has his flaws but he is way too vital to this team right now. If Jrue Holiday is injured again Tyreke will be essential to this team
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,DRphoenix99,4,Sat May 30 23:03:09 2015 UTC,I don't think it's time for anything. We haven't seen the team at full strength and we don't know what we can even get back for him. Keep him until you get a real deal. He was the heart and soul of the team and the healthiest guy. Imagine him in a non restrictive offense.
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,LieutenantKumar,2,Sat May 30 23:17:26 2015 UTC,Actually we have seen this team healthy in the beginning of the season and they were deadly.
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,ahungrybatman,3,Sat May 30 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"They didn't have Cole, Dante, and Pondexter. Rivers, Salmons, Jimmer, and a Babbit were all getting major minutes."
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,LieutenantKumar,4,Sat May 30 23:35:58 2015 UTC,The Dark Ages
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,Guyote_,2,Sun May 31 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a big supporter of Tyreke. I think he was forced to play out of position this season since Jrue was hurt. I think he tried too hard to be the guy, which led to some boneheaded plays. But on a team where everyone is healthy, he could be a great offensive player for us and would create some mismatches. I felt like we didn't really run many ""plays"" this year. He could be a great contributor in an offense where he's allowed to PNR with AD, or get ISO match ups."
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,Lokipokie504,-2,Sat May 30 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"I just feel like his skill set is redundant with Jrue on the team. Reke obviously can't come off the bench, and if we start him it has to be out of position because Jrue is our point and Gordon is too small to play the 3. Hell, even Reke is too small to play the three. Our lineup is too small when he starts. I love Reke. I was really excited when we signed him, and have been really excited the entire time he's been on our team. But he's at his best when he's the primary ball handler, and he can't be that with us unless Jrue gets hurt."
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,GONZnotFONZ,1 point,Sat May 30 23:31:46 2015 UTC,Why can't he come of the bench? I actually think he would be perfect as a 6th man.
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,fireman225s,1 point,Sun May 31 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"We've had him come off the bench before. I don't know if he just isn't willing or what, but he plays exponentially worse off the bench."
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,SteelOliver,1 point,Sun May 31 04:59:34 2015 UTC,Idk man we just got a coach that wants to run and Reke can run the break like a mofo. Him and Jrue pushing with AD trailing sounds pretty good to me
NOLAPelicans,37w80r,LateNite504fc,1 point,Sun May 31 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I love Reke. He gets to the rim at will. But we can't run the break every time down the court. When we have to go into our half court set Reke has to have the ball in his hands or he can't do anything. He can't shoot and he can't get open from off ball screens."
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,banngbanng,12,Sat May 30 17:19:51 2015 UTC,I would not. Pek and KMart are 29 and 32 respectively and aren't really players that are going to put you over the edge. Gordon and Anderson both only have 1 year left on their contracts while Pek and KMart have a combined 5 years left on their contracts. I'd rather just stick with Gordon and Anderson and then make a play in free agency next summer.
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Sat May 30 17:26:40 2015 UTC,Eric Gordon looked amazing for the last month of the season including the playoffs. He's shown that when he's healthy he's still a damn good player. I do think we should get rid of Anderson while his value is still high (still know as one of the best stretch fours in the league). I wouldn't take this trade though. Those guys are both too old and not good enough for us at this point.
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,BigEarl139,2,Sat May 30 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but who would take EG's contract? And considering that he'd be a free agent the following summer, he's likely not to stick around in Minnesota."
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,TheBionicShaboy,3,Sat May 30 17:27:26 2015 UTC,Better contract than Pek
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,LieutenantKumar,2,Sat May 30 21:29:23 2015 UTC,I'd say no in a heat beat. At least Eric and Ryan come off the books this year. Pek and Kmart hamstring you.
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Sat May 30 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"Plus Lavigne or this years no 1 pick! Otherwise, no way I would even consider it. Not a fan of pek or martin."
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,LateNite504fc,1 point,Sat May 30 19:11:19 2015 UTC,I think you could get more for Ryan somewhere else and Eric Gordon has 1 year left on his deal.
NOLAPelicans,37v2v8,HydroPumpCiroc,1 point,Sat May 30 19:23:26 2015 UTC,No way.
NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,TragicBronson5,7,Sat May 30 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"I want a defensive coach to get the most out of AD defensively, but honestly I think our team has better offensive pieces so it'd be smarter to go with offensive minded."
NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,SteelOliver,3,Sat May 30 05:25:40 2015 UTC,"The flip side to that is that they're already one of the better offenses in the nba. If they can improve the defense to a similar level and maintain on the offensive end, that might be better than going from top 10 or 15 offense to top 5 while remaining in the bottom 10 on defense.  Edit:  I think thibs with the current roster would have them in the top 5 on d and Davis's continued dominance would keep them in the top half of the league on offense. And if demps wanted to get cute,  he could let asik walk or sign and trade him for a better offensive player so that thibs has to start Anderson. In that scenario, I think thibs schemes even with several sub par defenders on the court at once still improves the defense to above average while the additional firepower from Anderson and Davis's improvement maintain or improve the offense even with thibs not putting in a lot of effort on that end."
NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,NotThoseThings,3,Sat May 30 12:34:55 2015 UTC,"The Pelicans had a good offense because of the players. If you watched the offensive sets, they were stagnant and had limited off ball movement."
NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,idrop50bombsvsFnatic,1 point,Sat May 30 14:44:11 2015 UTC,That's correct and supports my point
NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,NotThoseThings,1 point,Sat May 30 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"I think it was lack of ball movement. A lot of dribbling while the other guys ran patterns designed to create a particular shot for a particular player. Too predictable, wastes clock and offensive talent of the players."
NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,LateNite504fc,4,Sat May 30 19:41:41 2015 UTC,Jvg or alvin

NOLAPelicans,37t7vg,HydroPumpCiroc,1 point,Sat May 30 14:13:13 2015 UTC,Defense I suppose. But the team could improve on both. I could see a top five offense with more passing and more AD. And they could have a top 10-15 defense easily with Asik or a cheaper defensive Center like speights or festus ezili.

NOLAPelicans,37j8ho,poez,1 point,Thu May 28 00:57:08 2015 UTC,I hope that whoever the coach is has a better working relationship with Demps. I think a lot of the roster moves before were not moves that Monty would have wanted. Hopefully whoever the next coach is has the same vision that Demps has for the team.
NOLAPelicans,37j8ho,darkhornet,1 point,Thu May 28 01:46:46 2015 UTC,he said he would come back and coach if his philosophies matched with the FO   This is the part that has me concerned. I'm not sure Dell's natural philosophies line up with JVG. I think Dell's going to want a more running style team and won't be as concerned with defense. We'll find out over the course of the next few weeks.
NOLAPelicans,37j8ho,pottersquash,2,Thu May 28 13:24:05 2015 UTC,"here's my take, JVG left the NBA right when the 7 seconds or less Suns started to change the way people viewed offense, at the time JVG was coaching people didn't really play like the Spurs and Hawks and Warriors. Now JVG is a smart guy, he's been watching the league for almost a decade since then and has seen offense evolve the same way everyone else did. Greg Popovich's offensive ideas In 2005 and 2015 are drastically different, because anyone intelligent knows that in today's league we can't all play like the Cavs right now. I think he would adapt to play at a faster pace, or at least emphasize pushing the ball in transition. another thing to note is JVG's teams shot a lot of threes before it was cool, and I think he would put a huge emphasis on spacing and shooting from deep.   What I'm saying is we know Thibs runs a caveman offense because we've seen it in the modern era, JVG hasn't coaching in a time when teams wanted to play fast, and he likes shooting 3s so it's not set in stone that he will be so hard nosed on offense"
NOLAPelicans,37h2qb,NotThoseThings,3,Wed May 27 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"Could he be your Pace and Space guy, /r/LieutenantKumar?"
NOLAPelicans,37h2qb,LieutenantKumar,7,Wed May 27 16:21:36 2015 UTC,I like Nash. He'd be cool. But you'd need a start studded assistant coach class with him. Especially a defensive assistant.
NOLAPelicans,37h2qb,PairofDoctors,3,Wed May 27 17:04:46 2015 UTC,Mike Malone maybe?

NOLAPelicans,37929t,fireman225s,3,Tue May 26 15:21:06 2015 UTC,More guards! Let's run a 4 guard set with AD at the 5
NOLAPelicans,37929t,ThorBarnes,1 point,Tue May 26 15:54:25 2015 UTC,Some depth at SF and another solid back up big man would be nice. I'd put PG at the bottom of the list.

NOLAPelicans,36y6h3,danial133416,2,Sat May 23 03:04:34 2015 UTC,We weren't too good against the East this year. And honestly we would have been bounced by Lebron and the Cavs.
NOLAPelicans,36y6h3,ThorBarnes,7,Sat May 23 04:56:31 2015 UTC,Yes we would have. In the Finals instead of the first round. But seriously we're probably the third best team in the East.

NOLAPelicans,36mvgu,nimgame,5,Wed May 20 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"There are other outlets. Bourbon Street Shots does an awesome job, probably part of the reason nola.com is so defensive. Although I do think some people crossed the line in the comments. But they're losing readers and they know it. Because of that they've resorted to click bait and fear mongering.  In the end, you choose what material you consume. I can, for the most part, tune them out. Tell the more casual fans I know about BSS and The Bird Writes. Come here to /r/nolapelicans, which is honestly the most level headed Pelicans forum I've been on.  Unfortunately nola.com does have resources that those blogs do not, and occasionally breaks a story. So we have to put up with them somewhat. But ultimately they don't matter. I don't follow their writers, actually Jimmy blocked me a while back, or visit their website often. They're a minor inconvenience.  Also the New Orleans Advocate does a good job with Pelicans coverage. So if you really want to go through a newspaper you could go there."

NOLAPelicans,36jlzs,BlackScienceJesus,0,Tue May 19 22:48:18 2015 UTC,Mostly agree. Not worried about age as much as mediocre prior results with Gentry. Intrigued by Kevin Ollie.
NOLAPelicans,36ijnf,Levelupbuttercup,3,Tue May 19 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"I love both. When I was born, New Orleans didnt have a basketball team. I was born in New Orleans, raised in Lafayette. My family is Saints fans till our deaths.  That said, my dad loved Pistol Pete and made sure I knew about our New Orleans Jazz history. With that said, fuck you Utah.  I love both teams so much. The Saints may not really be ""underdogs"" at the moment, but we were for soooo fucking long lol.   And I agree with your point about attendance. Going to a Pelicans game feels more...helpful, to the team. Like, they need our support more. Saints games will always sell out no matter what. And also, as a poor college student, going to Pelicans games for reasonable prices is so amazing."
NOLAPelicans,36ijnf,Guyote_,3,Tue May 19 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"I like your site. I feel the same way with the Pelicans. I grew up in Wisconsin around people who only watched football so I just naturally became a fan of the Packers. No one in my family watched the NBA but when I was 6 or 7 was the '96 championships I believe with Jordan and I loved him, like most kids who saw Space Jam. I never really followed the Bucks though.   Then around 3 years ago I moved here and went to a few Hornets games and just loved them.Jump to the team rebranding into the Pelicans, that was the perfect time for me to fully adopt them as the team I support. I got season tickets that year and I am now going on season 3 with full season tickets. It's nice season another transplant that has season tickets."
NOLAPelicans,36ijnf,danceswithsharks,4,Tue May 19 18:07:59 2015 UTC,Thanks. Yeah I like the Saints. But love the Pelicans. I just feel because they are the underdog and also the NBA they go all out for my money and I really feel like they care if we show up or not.
NOLAPelicans,36ijnf,danceswithsharks,2,Tue May 19 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I said, I like the Packers, I don't love them though, and the Saints are kind of my secondary team. I love the Pelicans though too. You're completely on point about the cost as well. The Pels are still cheap enough to get tickets too, my tickets are upper bowl but once in a while I will upgrade to the lower bowl and it isn't really that much of an asking price. It really does seem like they care."

He screwed that entire fan base over. He then acted like a girl when he had to play in LA because he wasn't the main attraction due to Kobe. I just don't care for the guy's attitude at all.

NOLAPelicans,36ez45,rephil0309,1 point,Mon May 18 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"I don't want Gentry. His phoenix teams were mostly bad and he never got them to play good D. Now, because he  has a stacked team with Curry he's an offensive genius?  Pels team needs defensive genius more than offensive genius. (No Monty was not Defensive genius, he just talked about defense a lot, but his players could not execute his 90s style defense because it does not fit the modern game when guards cannot be shoved around 20 feet from the basket). This Gentry push seems like a media driven storyline to make the GS playoff run more juicy. I hope that Dell is just playing along and helping Gentry look important with the hope that his good deed will be paid back someday."
NOLAPelicans,36e0zd,LieutenantKumar,5,Mon May 18 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"Only if I had a firm commitment to sign from a young star (potential to be a top 5 player at a position), and that player's current team isn't interested in a sign and trade.  Unlike most, I think Gordon's a pretty decent piece that'll feel like a much better piece when he's re-signed to a decent contract next off season."
NOLAPelicans,36e0zd,NotThoseThings,5,Mon May 18 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"We need another major scoring threat to pair with AD, and Tyreke isn't the guy for that. He's best as a role player, the Chris Bosh of a big 3 instead of the D Wade at best, and that might be a bit too generous. So the concept is sound on the level that we open a slot for that guy.   All right, next level: who? Who can we bring in that can give us 20 a night as an outside shooter? Those guys are very rare. Only 15 NBA players averaged 20 or more a game last season at all positions.  We can't use another PF, which knocks out a lot of scoring threats, and a lot of good UFA's. So who do you offer a max contract as a FA this summer to give us that complementary scoring threat to AD, turn us from playoff team to playoff contender?  The best talent is either at PF or staying right where they are. We aren't getting Lebron. Or DWade. We aren't getting Jimmy Butler or Kawhi Leonard either, even if we sign Tom Thibodeau. There are a couple of interesting point guards but I'm not sure the team wants to put a Rajon Rondo or Goran Dragic into the mix with Jrue.  The fact is the only real difference maker type free agents are not good fits or we have no chance at. No point even looking at Gordons contract a year early since we can't get anything of value on the deal.   Now, I will say there are some interesting Centers who would be an upgrade over Asik if we go that way. Still doesn't solve our lack of consistent outside scoring threat to pair with AD problem. Also shjouldn't require a major roster move like shipping Gordons contract to work out. Would be a way to get an upgrade at one spot, wait out Gordons last year and try for a good 2 or 3 in free agency next year."
NOLAPelicans,36e0zd,backgrinder,5,Mon May 18 19:48:51 2015 UTC,Chris Bosh is going to be in the Hall of Fame. Saying Tyreke could be that guy for us is VERY generous.   Agree that there isn't much in FA for us this year.

NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,RickyFalcone,7,Sun May 17 22:10:00 2015 UTC,We are well aware :(
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,Guyote_,5,Sun May 17 23:03:39 2015 UTC,Hey he actually played really well this year. Not 15 mil good but it's something!
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,fireman225s,5,Mon May 18 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"As a shooting guard he only has one job---score points. He was 42nd leading scorer among NBA guards. This means he was in the bottom third of the league in the one stat that matters most even when compared with pass first point guards who are there to generate assists not scores.   Gordon had stretches where he looked like he would round into shape and score 20 points a game. That would be huge. Only 15 players in the entire league scored 20 a night at any position. But Gordon didn't do that, he has been in decline since his knee injury and at this point I doubt even a contract year will turn him around."
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,backgrinder,2,Mon May 18 05:30:58 2015 UTC,"Just looking at his ppg isn't quite doing him justice though. His outside shooting is something the Pelicans' offense desperately needed. He had a career low in USG% and became a big spot up guy, which you need next to Tyreke.  He's definitely not the same player he was from an impact standpoint. But he changed his game significantly to fit this team and sacrificed things like ppg."
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Mon May 18 10:59:09 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, that's the last year on the contract."
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,TheBionicShaboy,3,Mon May 18 00:21:59 2015 UTC,Did he opt in?
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,LieutenantKumar,2,Mon May 18 03:57:07 2015 UTC,Would you?
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,offENTing,1 point,Mon May 18 04:05:16 2015 UTC,No! The 15 Million is fine but he was unhappy here and wanted to go. If that did not change I'm sure there is a team happy to pick one of the best 3pt shooting guards right now up and pay him good but not that kind of money. Maybe going to the suns and profit from their medical staff would be an option to me.  Considering that he had still has a lot of potential I wouldn't be to sad if he opted in. (I mean that he won't be worth that money but might be able to become a little better)
NOLAPelicans,36ayqd,bhotep,6,Mon May 18 09:54:27 2015 UTC,Congrats on being one of the few people on earth who would reject a $15 million payday and end up with substantially less money.

NOLAPelicans,3687ko,MarchMadnessisMe,3,Sun May 17 03:41:31 2015 UTC,"We match up well against Atlanta, so I could see us winning. The Wizards have looked really bad at times, so I could also see us winning that. Hell with no KLove and a hobbled Kyrie, why couldn't we beat the Cavs?"

I'm not even all that demanding about ""previous experience"" but at least some time in the NBA would be nice imo.   It's like everyone wants Brad Stevens, but none of these other college coaches went to the final two years in a row with mid major, it just seems far more likely that Stevens is a bit of an outlier/prodigy."
NOLAPelicans,367xdo,TeamSquadUltra,3,Sun May 17 01:56:43 2015 UTC,"As a UVA fan, I'd prefer it if we went after someone else."

NOLAPelicans,367xdo,BlackScienceJesus,2,Sun May 17 01:05:50 2015 UTC,He's a bad idea.  His calling card is his defensive scheme which has guys in the paint for longer than 3 seconds on every possession.
NOLAPelicans,367xdo,thejimmyst,2,Mon May 18 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"I like Bennett because he is defensive minded, but he would have to change his system for the NBA rules. Which I think he could do, but it would certainly be a gamble."

And I know Klay just signed an extension but golden state can cut him for us. All of these are about as likely as Portland letting Dame walk."

NOLAPelicans,365jkq,rephil0309,9,Sat May 16 10:07:09 2015 UTC,"Jrue ""Mike Conley 2.0"" Holliday and AD are the Pick and Roll duo of the future. For me everyone else is interchangeable going forward.  Ideally Tyreke would be the ball handler off the bench. He cant be a SG though because he has such an inconsistent jumper.  The ceiling next year is a 55 win season which puts us in a middle seed of playoffs. Hopefully we'll get to the 2nd round since we wont have to play a Juggernaut of a team like GSW"
NOLAPelicans,365jkq,IReallyLikeFootball,5,Sat May 16 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"To chime in with the crowd, Jrue is without a doubt our answer at pg. His defense is fantastic and his offensive game is very well polished. If he's healthy I see no reason why we aren't one of the better teams. His defense is by far my favorite quality. Everyone on our team (minus Asik but that's a given) can score at ease. We need good lock down on ball defenders and we found that in Jrue."
NOLAPelicans,365jkq,Guyote_,3,Sat May 16 20:31:04 2015 UTC,JRUE is deff our PG of the future. Question is if he can stay healthy.
NOLAPelicans,365jkq,backgrinder,1 point,Sat May 16 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"Question is if he can stay healthy.    Makes him very much not the PG of the future imo. I thought Tyreke was showing some real progress there, I wonder if he (and the team) wouldn't benefit long term by shifting him to PG full time."
NOLAPelicans,365jkq,Guyote_,2,Sat May 16 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"He had an issue with his leg, and this year was injured from the same thing. I think he can overcome it. You see how good we are with him at the 1."
NOLAPelicans,365jkq,backgrinder,1 point,Sat May 16 22:15:45 2015 UTC,A history of leg injuries to the same leg is usually a bad sign for an athlete. I just don't know how much you can count on him long term being the guy.

That said, u really can't trade him, so just gotta hope. I like Evans after that. He's good temporary Jrue insurance, but he'd be best as the 6th man. After that, everyone else is just an asset.  And I think its a pretty good collection of assets. Overall, they could resign Asik or replace him and win 55. Probably go to second or third round if healthy."

But upgrading there is not the only way to take it to the next level. A long quick 3 & D wing player or 2 is at the top of my list. Asik really is a good defensive center. Probably only Mosgov, of the ones you mentioned is in Asik's league on D. AD should play more 5, with 4 shooters at end of games. Don't want to invest too much in a center. It may as well be a defender and rebounder who can hold down the paint and take that pressure off AD for the first three quarters."

NOLAPelicans,362dsz,amjewess,5,Fri May 15 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like we need to have a discussion about Tom Thibs. There is a lot of excitement but I can't help shake the feeling he is not the guy we want here.  First and foremost lets talk about what he is good at. The very obvious thing is crafting a defense. For years, even as an assistant, his teams have been in the very top tier defensively. This is an area we have sorely lacked. Thibs is the best in the business at this.  Secondly, his teams have been successful record wise despite a battering of injuries, especially to their MVP player. They have managed to make the playoffs every year.  Thirdly, he is known to get the most out of his point guards/bench players. Similar to Monty in that regard.  Yet despite all this I do not think he is the right guy. We know that Dell wants a motion oriented system that pushes the pace. Thib's teams have been not very fast. Take a look at his pace vs ours the past 5 years:  Thibs vs Monty  23rd    27th  29th    22nd  27th    29th  28th    30th  23rd    29th  They are not all that different. Similarly, Thibs has never been known as a good offensive coach. His teams routinely been exposed in the playoffs for their lack of creative sets. Over the past five years, they have only put fort a better offense than us precisely 2  times- both times when they lead the league in winning. Every other year, they have been very bad offensively (except this year at 11th, we were 8th), despite us being a lottery team with limited talent. If you complained about scoring droughts under Monty, don't expect anything to change here. See last night's game vs Cleveland as a typical example of what it looks like when they simply can't get good shots. I personally do not want that for this team.   Lastly there is the concern about Thibs running players to the ground. While there are arguments on both sides of this coin, so we don't know that the deal is here, but we do know that it is an issue that management and Thibs openly disagreed on.   Dell is spearheading the search. This will be his only chance to hire a guy he wants. I don't think he will pick the stubborn guy, but one that sees eye to eye with him."
NOLAPelicans,362dsz,amjewess,4,Fri May 15 15:10:07 2015 UTC,we were a 45 win team with all of our injuries and thibs could make our defense better but offense stay close to the same... I would love this. If holiday could stay healthy he could really get him back to all star form and Thibs is a big name that might be able to draw in a big time free agent or trade in 2016
NOLAPelicans,362dsz,SurtainDeth,3,Fri May 15 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"Lets make this clear. Thibs will make the team better, this isn't about being better than Monty. This is about Anthony Davis. Davis needs to play in a system that runs and not grinds."
NOLAPelicans,362dsz,whodatcoreydat,3,Fri May 15 19:19:42 2015 UTC,I think if we are  winning AD will be plenty happy if your saying Thibs will grind him down I don't know how much I buy into that   Pro athletes have to train and practice almost every day as it is I think the amount Thibs pushes his players compared to other coaches isn't as big a difference as people are saying and AD already plays a lot of minutes as is
NOLAPelicans,362dsz,fireman225s,1 point,Fri May 15 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"Thibs running his players into the ground is definitely overstated.  Before the Spurs most top teams had players that led the league in minutes.  Even this year 2 teams had 2 players who were top 10 in minutes per game, Houston and Cleveland.  I'll never understand how people make the connection from Butler and Deng playing heavy minutes to Noah and Rose being frequently injured."

NOLAPelicans,362dsz,i_haz_username,3,Fri May 15 16:38:50 2015 UTC,I think Thibodeau is the easy pick that the media has been pushing but I'm not sold on him. I doubt he is going to be high on our list because he will probably want to go somewhere he can be the coach-GM which is an unlikely deal to get when the GM is running the coaching search.  I am pulling for Alvin Gentry or Ettore Messina
NOLAPelicans,362dsz,SteelOliver,1 point,Fri May 15 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"I know Thibodeau is a great coach, but I've heard how much he grinds on players to get them to win. That worries me. While we're a young team and this approach might work, it's not what the rest of the league is doing with resting players during the regular season.   Maybe that's just a fluke and a sign that people are trying to imitate what the Spurs have done in hopes to capture their success, but I worry he'll run some of our guys into the ground and leave the gas tank on 'E'"

NOLAPelicans,362dsz,DRUNKTENNIS,1 point,Fri May 15 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"You know what the more i think about it the more i think we should not hire thibs. First of all dell stated that he would like to have a fast pace game and thibs isn't a fast pace coach. He's a defensive minded coach who likes to grind games out. He's the better version of what monty tried to become. Plus he has a reputation of running his players into the ground like how he played butler 52 minutes in a meaningless game against the magic and he plays his starters too much minutes. No wonder why butler, noah, gasol, gibson, rose and others were banged up. The last thing we need is giving ad 40+ minutes a game. Which is why i think we should hire alvin gentry, hear me out in his first season as a head coach he took the suns to the wcf and he would had went to the finals if it weren't for ron artest making that gw off a airball and kobe making impossible shots at game 6 and plus he fits into dell demps description. Because amare left the suns and their management trading dragic he was left with a shit roster.  He's a offensive coach who likes to play at a fast pace and plus unlike tom thib he doesn't clashes with his gm. Honestly alvin would be the perfect fit and we should bring back mike malone to help our defense improve. What u guys think ?"

NOLAPelicans,3621ms,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Fri May 15 14:38:46 2015 UTC,I am assuming the report earlier in the season was true and Monty did what management required for him. He made the playoffs. Then Benson sent a congratulatory letter after the season. Monty went to the meeting this week believing he was going to get an extension but was blindsided. I'm not saying we should have kept Monty but it could have been handled better and there is no way Monty comes back after that. Also I am just generally against the idea of co-leadership which this thread is about. The team needs one leader to look to in crunch time.
NOLAPelicans,3621ms,BlackScienceJesus,0,Fri May 15 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome, and I don't think Monty has such and ego that would blind him from the upside that this presents all around"

NOLAPelicans,35z8nu,deadcowhead932,3,Thu May 14 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think about this?  I think he would get the most out of Anthony Davis' already stellar defensive ability, and with a healthy Jrue and (tentatively) Asik back, we would have one of the best defenses in the Association.  However, I've heard worries about him over-using his stars, wearing them down and causing injuries, which would be the absolute worst thing for Anthony Davis on his rise to superstardom.  Thoughts?"
NOLAPelicans,35z8nu,SteelOliver,1 point,Thu May 14 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"I hope we get him so we can get the most out of the roster defensively, but I want him to get an offense oriented assistant coach. The Bulls roster has had plenty of injuries, but to place the blame on Thibs for that is ridiculous. Joakim didn't get plantar fasciitis from thibs playing him 38 minutes instead of 34, Rose said he was 100% then just proceeded to injure himself again, and Loul Deng getting a spinal tap isn't on him either. He may play them hard if they're coming back from an injury but I don't think he'll run our team into the ground like they exclaim every 5 posts on /r/nba."

Potentially it could be harmful....but Davis was tied for 5th in the league in MPG this past season. Besides, AD hasn't had a major injury since college - the numerous small injuries he has suffered aren't conclusive with him being injury prone, necessarily.   https://twitter.com/johnschuhmann/status/579992354184122368  You can't just say ""x-injury prone player + having a coach that may or may not overplay said (sed? lol) player above his average MPG"". There are way too many factors that go into it - this isn't Rose we're talking about here, Davis has gotten better every season in spite of his numerous, minute injuries. His minutes have gone up every season, as well. Freak accidents happen to dynamic players (a la Paul George or even Davis's injury this past season); when you play at a certain speed, shit can happen. Are you referring to Butler's elbow injury? He led the league in MPG, but it's very clear his injury had nothing to do with the high minutes he was getting - it was a freak accident in it's truest form. Rose just had/has bad knees, he was averaging right around 36/37 MPG previous to his first injury, which isn't extraordinary at all.  As we saw in the GSW series, he can play 40 MPG at an elite level, against equally elite competition. Will he be expected to play that much during the course of a season? Of course not, but again, there are way too many factors at play to make such a cookie-cutter statement."

Again I know that is only one stat and injuries hurt this team, but if you watch the games you can see that our defense isn't where it needs to be with the players we have.

With being down by 4, getting a bad call to get a free throw and the ball, cutting it to 3 then coming out with a 3 with I think 20 seconds left. It hurts.

AD is going to be a superstar, which is a huge draw for a coach.  they should remain committed to signing AD to the maximum contract extension, then look into Mark Jackson (I don't think Scott Brooks would be able to use this team to it's full potential)."

NOLAPelicans,35qad5,offENTing,1 point,Tue May 12 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"nah he was a guy who could have and probably should have worked out, especially with his experience on team usa. Unfortunate luck with injuries for a few years and his consistency in blowing easy games was what shut him down. We're kinda wishy washy about the situation considering he was bound to improve next season but there's also gotta be an upgrade out there"
NOLAPelicans,35qad5,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue May 12 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda sad to see that happen right now but I think it is the right decision. He is a good coach and made it to the playoffs with us, but I don't think he really fits the team. If you have a player like AD, utilise him and don't play hero ball with evans. (even though that might not be Monty's fault he sure as hell should have done something)  I just hope that they find a good replacement and maybe find a good fit to davis. I like holiday evans and asik a lot and if gordon would want to stay for less money i sure as hell would keep him, but seeing that gordon will move we might want a SF and play evans as the two."

NOLAPelicans,35qd8h,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Tue May 12 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely sad to see Monty go. When he was first here and we had crap teams, I loved him. He always seemed to get those teams to overachieve and play hard. He's great guy and I know he'll find success wherever he goes. But there is a difference between inspiring a poor team and elevating a good team. I'm not sure Monty elevated the Pels but he didn't hold them back, in my opinion.  Moving forward, I hope that we can get a more solid, defined front office structure. It seems like Dell was involved in the decision to move on from Monty and will be spearheading the coaching search (if you believe his press conference), and that's encouraging. I know Loomis has said that he's not very involved with the Pelicans but the GM needs to have the ability to fire/hire the coach.   While I supported Monty, I always did want to play a more uptempo game, and that's the kind of guy Dell will be looking to bring in, which is exciting. If I had to choose between Monty and Dell, I would probably pick Dell. Not that Monty is a bad coach but I think Dell's philosophy is more suited for today's NBA.  I won't claim any expertise in coaching prospects, but I like the idea of bringing in an up and coming assistant. Messina sounds like an interesting prospect, especially because of his European background. I've heard the name Atkinson from Atlanta thrown around. I think these are the type of guys we should be targeting. We have the most new-school player there is, and now we can hopefully play that brand of basketball.  GO PELS"
NOLAPelicans,35qd8h,DRUNKTENNIS,3,Tue May 12 22:45:11 2015 UTC,Rivers had a bad game last night so idk hire Monty?
NOLAPelicans,35qd8h,danial133416,3,Wed May 13 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"You know what the more i think about it the more i think we should not hire thibs. First of all dell stated that he would like to have a fast pace game and thibs isn't a fast pace coach. He's a defensive minded coach who likes to grind games out. He's the better version of what monty tried to become. Plus he has a reputation of running his players into the ground like how he played butler 52 minutes in a meaningless game against the magic and he plays his starters too much minutes. No wonder why butler, noah, gasol, gibson, rose and others were banged up. The last thing we need is giving ad 40+ minutes a game. Which is why i think we should hire alvin gentry, hear me out in his first season as a head coach he took the suns to the wcf and he would had went to the finals if it weren't for ron artest making that gw off a airball and kobe making impossible shots at game 6 and plus he fits into dell demps description. Because amare left the suns and their management trading dragic he was left with a shit roster.  He's a offensive coach who likes to play at a fast pace and plus unlike tom thib he doesn't clashes with his gm. Honestly alvin would be the perfect fit and we should bring back mike malone to help our defense improve. What u guys think ?"
NOLAPelicans,35qd8h,acethewarhawk,2,Sat May 16 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"IF Thibs gets fired, I think that would be option number 1.   If not, I think we could look at his assistant Ed Pinckney, a prior NBA forward who has learned under Thibs.   I don't think they go college. People will say Cal because of his association with Reke and AD, but I don't see him leaving Kentucky. The only college coaches I could see them looking at are Ollie (who probably isn't leaving UCONN) and Bennett from UVA."

NOLAPelicans,35qd8h,BlackScienceJesus,2,Thu May 14 05:46:43 2015 UTC,I don't think this is a good idea. The team needs one leader. One person with the last say. Two co-coaches would lead to a feud and differing ideas. The players would be left not knowing who to listen to. If you want a defensive and offensive coach then you just hire one as an assistant.

NOLAPelicans,35qd8h,Levelupbuttercup,2,Tue May 12 17:57:43 2015 UTC,Here is the thing. If Dell got the coach he wanted already lined up then  sure fire Monty. If not then I don't know what the fuck they were doing waiting this long. I think the best thing we can do is keep tabs on him and when he gets a new job as probably an assistant send him something nice to his new team.

NOLAPelicans,35qgdx,DRphoenix99,1 point,Tue May 12 17:46:23 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing this more and more. That this was more a vote for Dell than a vote against Monty. Completely agree though, Monty is an amazing man. A great guy, and I hope he just takes the year, collects his check and just stays and enjoys New Orleans. He is an asset to any community.   But he had glaring deficiencies in coaching. Not stuff like rotation and play calling, stuff a high minded Bball head would need to know. He would make stuff that I, a basketball novice, I guy who can barely dribble, unsure of exactly what a jumpshot is, a guy who can tell you about running a inside trap with backside reverse to get the FS to bite for a second so the guard can get to second level and turn a 2 yard run into a 20 yard touchdown but can not tell you exactly what a ""pick and roll"" is, I could see the glaring coaching errors. At times you had to believe Monty was in over his head, so above it he assumed his player knew it and didn't bother to tell them, or he just wasn't actually paying attention.  So either fire him now, or let him get another year where he is doomed to fail. Lets face it, sneaking in to the playoffs as an 8 seed on the last day wasn't going to cut it. And other than the Mavs, who exactly would we overtake in west without major coaching growth? Give him till Jan to do what we don't think he can do? Let a good man go out, embarrass himself and get the ax anyway? See that picture on the sidebar? Thats the lasting image of Monty and while no one deserves to be dumped on a Tuesday morning its better to let him walk away with that image than the image of Game 3, 4Q. Cause you leave him at the helm I think its 70/30 thats what we get. A nut punching, stomach churning ""who the fuck did we let this get away"" feeling with only one man to take the blame, a man who is too nice of a guy to have that happen to.   Monty is leaving with fans who two months ago wanting his head crying that he is leaving. Thats what he deserves. We may not be a true new expansion franchise but it kid of feels that way. It felt like CP3 was ripped from us due to George Shinn's nonsense. This is a new era, new star and we needed a good man to Captain this ship. He may not be Jean Luc or Kirk, but he definitely was a Sisko.  He came to this outpost in shambles and was the guiding hand to where we are now. He goes now to be with the Prophets. Glad that he came. Sad to see him go. Excited about what comes next."

NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,SteelOliver,0,Sat May 9 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't blame that on Monty though. Asik was garbage for almost the entire series, so I can see why he wouldn't put him in. Half of those missed rebounds were because none of the guards hustled to get them/ blocked out."
NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,Guyote_,3,Sat May 9 16:05:07 2015 UTC,We're up 20 and our leading rebounder doesn't see a single minute as we get destroyed on the boards. That's not good.
NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,SteelOliver,1 point,Sat May 9 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"We played small ball and didn't get out-rebounded at any other point in the game, so I'd chalk that 4th quarter fuck up to effort."

NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,Guyote_,1 point,Tue May 12 17:27:24 2015 UTC,And the Warriors adjusted in the 4th. We didn't.
NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,drdrizzy13,1 point,Sat May 9 16:56:05 2015 UTC,man Asik hands are bricks I think I can catch better than him.
NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,KGB_ate_my_bread,0,Tue May 12 17:20:34 2015 UTC,That's because houston are bunch of bitches and the refs aren't going to give Harden fouls for running into other players. Same shit happened last year in the playoffs too (with Harden)
NOLAPelicans,35d9ug,thejimmyst,-1,Sat May 9 13:42:45 2015 UTC,Which is because their coach and gm foster an environment that allows whiny players to exist. Contrast that to the fact that Dell and Monty have made an excellent locker room that has none of that.
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,SteelOliver,10,Fri May 8 18:53:34 2015 UTC,Good. Two things he needs
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,LieutenantKumar,5,Fri May 8 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't try to make him something he's not by insisting he can bang down low.  He's never gonna be Dwight Howard. He'll be skilled, lanky, and super quick and that will win him many an MVP."
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,Eman5805,1 point,Sat May 9 02:47:40 2015 UTC,Does Dwight have handles and can shoot threes?
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,sarnold95,2,Sat May 9 06:15:15 2015 UTC,"Nope. But I sometimes hear people say AD should be banging down low like he has the real frame for it.  He's such an oddly made person. Broad, wide shoulders. But a thin waist."
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,Eman5805,4,Sat May 9 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"I do think his low post game could use improvement. Would rather him turn into a Duncan (excellent on the block and a solid mid-range game) than Dirk (excellent mid-range game, solid 3-PT shooting) as far as skill set....though there isn't a reason he couldn't develop a 3PT shot AND a solid post game."
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,jetlife_,1 point,Sat May 9 22:50:36 2015 UTC,And stupidly long arms.
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,sarnold95,1 point,Sat May 9 16:10:55 2015 UTC,I'd rather he continue to work on his post-up game. We honestly do not need him shooting 3s at all. We have people for that.
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,Guyote_,7,Fri May 8 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"Its game theory.  Having a decent threat of a 3 pointer makes him way harder to guard than if he just removes it from his arsenal the way it is now.  He doesnt have to be a stellar 3 point shooter, just the threat of it now and again will pay off."
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,solinar,-1,Fri May 8 22:06:45 2015 UTC,It's also game theory that every second he's out on the 3 point striupe hes not getting rebounds.
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,Basketballsohard,2,Sat May 9 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say he should focus mainly on his post-ups... but if he just so happens to start hanging around after practice to shoot 3's I wouldn't be mad.  Really he should just focus on everything.  He has the potential to do so many things so why not continue to become more versatile every year?"
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,hubristichumor,3,Fri May 8 19:56:41 2015 UTC,I mean he said that in his answer. He wants to work on everything
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Fri May 8 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't have a chance to see the Q & A.  Glad to hear that was his answer, what with his unique skill-set."
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,hubristichumor,2,Fri May 8 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm a huge fan of him adding every tool he can. Post moves are great, but the game is moving away from them. Ball handling will really open up options for him and the team"
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,LieutenantKumar,2,Fri May 8 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"Agree, him being able to pass better will open up his game."
NOLAPelicans,35bi8n,Basketballsohard,1 point,Sat May 9 03:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, I want to see his game evolve to current Blake Griffin with a decent 3 pointer."
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,DRUNKTENNIS,12,Sat May 9 04:45:57 2015 UTC,Hes had games like this for us (not playoffs but still). This is one game vs so many others hes had with us where it's unbearable to watch
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,Sslagathor,9,Sat May 9 06:07:59 2015 UTC,I'm happy for him. Glad he found success somewhere else. Sometimes players just need a change of scenery.
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,haonamm,7,Sat May 9 05:53:41 2015 UTC,"Austin had good games now and then for us. And considering what we got in return for Rivers, I think we made out like bandits."
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,Guyote_,13,Sat May 9 07:14:24 2015 UTC,You've got to be fucking kidding me.. The season's over and you jerks STILL need to blame Monty?!
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,jjsdinerforminers,4,Sat May 9 05:00:06 2015 UTC,"I mean even after this game, he's scoring 9 points with 1.2 assists in 17.6 minutes per game in the playoffs. Which isn't bad, but its not  going to change my opinion of him as a player."
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Sat May 9 13:32:11 2015 UTC,"He averaged 5.4/1.1/.7 on 44% TS against the Spurs, which even by his standards is garbage. He has had 2 good games vs the rockets, and had a very costly error in game two. Suddenly this is a reflection on Dell and Monty? Get outta here. And this is coming from a guy who went through hell to defend Austin while he was with us."
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,LieutenantKumar,-1,Sat May 9 05:10:17 2015 UTC,He actually had 1 great game vs the spurs that helped the clips win. stop being sour
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,strive4success2014,3,Sun May 10 19:29:44 2015 UTC,Please point out where I denied that. Doesn't change that he wasn't terrible the rest of the series and throughout the whole season. Stop being reactionary.
NOLAPelicans,35d8ke,LieutenantKumar,1 point,Mon May 11 03:22:14 2015 UTC,Stayed by the wrong team is v real. It doesn't mean the team is wrong. Just that both sides aren't compatible.

We're really good at getting the best out of our guys. If we got the best out of Nick Young he could fill in the the SF position well. And he'd probably love NOLA.
NOLAPelicans,35cc52,KGB_ate_my_bread,2,Fri May 8 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he'd really want to play in NOLA either, which does the team no good"

NOLAPelicans,35cc52,danial133416,2,Fri May 8 23:08:02 2015 UTC,They were gonna give us gasol for ryno ? Holy fuck why didn't we take it ??

NOLAPelicans,35cc52,danial133416,2,Sat May 9 02:59:50 2015 UTC,I can't believe we refused to trade a role player for an all star
NOLAPelicans,35cc52,danceswithsharks,1 point,Sat May 9 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"Reading the whole article it does appear that was a bad season for Gasol. Ryno was good for us and I'm hoping he gets back to that point. It's easy to look back and think we should have done something different. He has been injured most of the past 2 seasons, sure it sucks but when he was healthy he was very dependable."
NOLAPelicans,35cc52,Guyote_,1 point,Sun May 10 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Paul was having a bad season because the lakers were forcing him to play the 4 stretch, the role that ryno plays but gasol wasn't a good 3 point shooter which resulted in alot of bad nights. Also the lakers had a bad lockerroom and a team filled with egos. This season the bulls were playing gasol at his natural position and he had a all star season."
NOLAPelicans,35cc52,jetlife_,1 point,Sun May 10 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I'm a little biased,  Ryno is one of my favorite players on the team and I'm just hoping he gets back to his old self that he has shown glimpses of since coming back from his injury.  I still think at the time it was the right move but if another opportunity like that came along I would not argue as well it was a good trade."

NOLAPelicans,352zrd,rephil0309,9,Wed May 6 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"I really don't see why Dell is under fire here. Sure, not every choice he's made was a home run, but show me one GM in the league who doesn't have a few trades/signings he'd like to take back.   Dell was in a no-win situation with signing Gordon a few years ago. If Gordon went to Phoenix and was anything more than terrible, Dell's an idiot. If Gordon stayed in NOLA and was anything less than spectacular, Dell's an idiot. There really wasn't a clear-cut right choice there.  However, Gordon's contract hasn't stopped us from building a competitive team. People complain about Evans and Asik, but we wouldn't have made the playoffs without either of them (and our defense is statistically better with Asik on the court). Davis doesn't need rookies and projects around him at this stage. Sure, maybe drafting Rivers or signing Salmons were bad moves, but he also turned those two into Pondexter and Cole, both guys I'm sure we're all glad we had on our team this past season.  I get if Loomis wants to get rid of the last remnants of the George Shinn era, but maybe he should look at Monty instead of Dell...  (sorry for the rant)"
NOLAPelicans,352zrd,SoItGoes504,6,Wed May 6 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize, you're 100% correct. Getting rid of Dell would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. He's not the reason we've struggled."
NOLAPelicans,352zrd,fireman225s,3,Wed May 6 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"I think its more Loomis wants a Bball guy as overseer of the Bball side of things. Loomis knows the business of sports, but does he know the business of basketball? Does Dumars want full on responsibilities? Now mind you Dell may not like having another person double checking his work, I just can't fanthom moving on from Dell. His moves more than anything got us into playoffs."
NOLAPelicans,352zrd,pottersquash,3,Wed May 6 21:39:14 2015 UTC,I love the argument that people bring up of us trading Noel for Jrue.

NOLAPelicans,352zrd,pottersquash,2,Thu May 7 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Jrue was durable when we got him, and Noel wasn't. I still support that trade, I love Jrue."

Not a good draft overall.  Bad pick, but not that many good picks that year honestly."
NOLAPelicans,352zrd,Mississippster,6,Fri May 8 15:35:52 2015 UTC,The only source is Zach Lowe's article which explicitly said rumors aren't going any where. A Pelicans source also said it this ain't true and that Dell is guaranteed till next year

NOLAPelicans,34a8jb,pottersquash,2,Wed Apr 29 17:13:33 2015 UTC,may you please describe to me who he is?
NOLAPelicans,34a8jb,BetterChild,5,Thu Apr 30 01:03:26 2015 UTC,He ended up being one of my favorite Pels. And those playoff blocks were Insane! I hope we do keep him.
NOLAPelicans,34a8jb,SteelOliver,2,Wed Apr 29 16:58:23 2015 UTC,This guy definitely needs to stay.
NOLAPelicans,34a8jb,Mississippster,4,Thu Apr 30 02:11:56 2015 UTC,"This is a cool thing to say and all, but it doesn't sound like it holds much weight.   I'm a Bulls fan and it reminds me of what Jimmy said. He basically said that he guarantees he'll be a Bull next year, while Cunningham just says that he would want to come back.  I'm just saying that if he isn't back, this comment shouldn't be held against him."
NOLAPelicans,34a8jb,OnceAteABurgerAMA,3,Wed Apr 29 16:20:06 2015 UTC,"Dante probably can't guarantee he'll be coming back though, even if he wanted to.

We're not getting anyone (aside from bench fillers) because the money doesn't work and we don't have anyone with good trade value.    This offseason and next season are all about continuity and staying healthy.  Those things are boring though, so we'll all talk out or asses about impossible fantasy trades."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,narnar2,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:13:22 2015 UTC,"Tyreke, holiday, anderson have good trade values. I am sure alot of teams would love to have tyreke considering that's he's a warrior and even plays through pain."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,danial133416,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:41:56 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.  Lack of trade value doesn't mean they're bad at basketball.  Just means that there's not a team who would trade for a player who could help us more.  Even if you trade one as a salary dump we don't have enough money to chase a star and re-sign the guys we need.  We're so much better off waiting until 2016 when Gordon will be off the books.  Personally I would love to trade Tyreke if we could swing some multi-team monster trade, but I don't see it happening.  If Holiday and Ryno can start playing like their old selves it'll help us more than any trade."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,narnar2,12,Thu Apr 30 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"CP3 isn't coming back. We should put that to rest. If the org is willing and has an opportunity to move significant assets for a superstar, it will be for one that can share a prime with AD, not be out of it while AD enters his."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,LieutenantKumar,4,Wed Apr 29 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, we have a better bench than the Clippers which may change if we trade for CP3."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,ahungrybatman,2,Wed Apr 29 06:55:51 2015 UTC,"Do we really have the ability to make some big moves though? If Gordon opts in, which he will, we'll only have about $8 million in cap space. We'll use that to sign Asik. We have Asik's bird rights so we can pay him a bit more than that. But if we were going after free agents, $8 million isn't getting you too much. After that we'll pretty much only have our MLE left. We'll probably use at least part of that on Cunningham. After that we still have to hope Cole signs his QO to return. Then make decisions on Ajinca and Babbit. And fill out the rest of the roster with min contract guys.  The only way we make any big moves is through trades of one of our core guys (Evans, Holiday, Gordon, Anderson). And at least from Monty's interview yesterday that doesn't seem like the plan."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Wed Apr 29 12:36:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hope we don't sign Asik, I'd rather a center who can make a layup and not miss passes.  If we do go for CP3, Holiday might be traded being that we don't need two all star point guards."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,Trolljaboy,9,Wed Apr 29 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"You don't understand. Bringing back Asik is not just a roster move - its a move that gives us place holder to upgrade. If we don't resign him, there is not a single competent center we can acquire. If we do resign him, he is someone we can move at a later date. He isn't ideal, but given what we have to work with in the FA, we can't do better. Only way we upgrade is by trade, and we need to sign him to be able to do that in the first place."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,LieutenantKumar,3,Wed Apr 29 14:59:06 2015 UTC,That makes more sense when you put it that way.
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,Trolljaboy,2,Wed Apr 29 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"People always want an upgrade at Center not realizing that you can count the truly athletic difference makers at that position on one hand. It was like this when we had Okafor, everyone thought he was a disappointment because he wasn't a star (and he was a step down from a healthy Tyson Chandler, no question).   The thing is, for an average Center with average skills and above average strength down low Okafor was paid roughly market value and gave roughly what you'd expect out of him every night.  Asik is like that. I hate the way he gets that confused look on his face when he grabs an offensive board, double clutches and tries to dribble once like he's taking a free throw. He blows 2-3 shots a game with that nonsense. But he has 2 things going for him: great size and great strength. That's important both for what he does clogging the lane and for what other teams can't do, which is beat on AD like he's a human pinata. No one can get to frisky with that monster around, and for a team with a star that's important."
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,backgrinder,4,Thu Apr 30 04:18:44 2015 UTC,OK well that only gives us 8 million dollars to sign another center. And I'm not sure you getting a whole lot of trade value from a guy that missed 90 games the past two years. I'm just trying to be realistic here.
NOLAPelicans,3490zj,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:18:35 2015 UTC,Right. I wouldn't mind trading Reek for a better pg or sg.

NOLAPelicans,347ggn,Levelupbuttercup,2,Tue Apr 28 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"I think we saw what happens when Asik isn't in much in games 3 and 4 when we got OBLITERATED on the boards and no one boxed out. Asik was never intended to be a weapon on offense, but his defense on bigs and his rebounding are what is important to us.  I firmly believe we win Game 3 if Asik isn't on the bench for the ENTIRE 4th Quarter. It was evident what we were missing."
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,Guyote_,2,Tue Apr 28 22:35:56 2015 UTC,Problem is going forward when we hit the playoffs. Every possession matters so much on both sides of the ball- Omer is good at getting those boards and guarding the rim but we can't be a top tier team without a center who can play both ways.
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,PairofDoctors,2,Wed Apr 29 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"I'm really confident in Omer going forward. His post-allstar numbers were great and I think the more time he spends here, the better he'll be. Monty has made comments saying something similar at least a couple times."
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Tue Apr 28 22:39:56 2015 UTC,Guys how many times will asik get blocked we he tries to score ? I wouldn't mind bringing him back for the right price but in no way i am paying him 15 million.
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,danial133416,2,Wed Apr 29 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's getting paid 15 but only counts against the cap for 8. I'd more than happily pay him 8 but expect him to get 10-12 and I'm fine with that."
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:04:42 2015 UTC,He's not worth 10-12 million.. He used to be elite at defending but he's slowed down ever since he left the bulls.
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,danial133416,2,Wed Apr 29 00:08:08 2015 UTC,Well that's what he's getting so probably time to get used to it. He's had a pretty major effect on our defense this season. And if you look at post all start numbers he's been huge.
NOLAPelicans,347ggn,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Wed Apr 29 00:20:32 2015 UTC,I'd still rather have Greg Monroe...jussayin

NOLAPelicans,342i02,urdu_grundle,10,Mon Apr 27 20:08:17 2015 UTC,"I think the breakdown was from lack of playoff experience and complacency. There were a number of things in game 3 that we did wrong. Yes AD missed that free throw, but there were costly mistakes and bad choices made by the players that helped give GS the win (not that you guys didn't earn it). A lazy Norris Cole pass late in the 4th quarter comes to mind. GS easily stole it and scored on a fast break. That play alone could have cost us the game.      I personally was a big fan of Asik, but it seems he only shows up for 30% of the games. One game I'll be screaming ""LOOK AT THAT BOY WORKIN' HARD. YEA SON!"", the next game I'll be screaming some not so nice things. I think he is a liability unless his matchup is more than favorable. Whenever he has to deal with a more dynamic, athletic big man down in the paint, he has problems. I think that if we could get someone that can score at the position and has more coordination, it would be a game changer for us.      As far as Cole, he played really well for the most part. He had 1 down game, but his experience helped us a lot. I may get hated on, but I'm not a Tyreke fan at the PG position. When he's on he's on, but it tends to get sloppy. If only Jrue was healthy. Some of the flashes of what he could do in the finals really got me excited.      Gordon played great for a lot of the playoffs, but he should not have taken that 3 point shot when we were down by 1 and there was about 14 seconds left on the shot clock. Yeah he makes that shot all the time, but that doesn't mean you take it in that scenario. We easily could have took our time and gotten it to AD to take a higher percentage shot.      I had a blast watching Anderson ball in game three. He has skills.       I don't think Monty is to blame. I think a lot of went wrong were dumb mistakes made by players. Monty is a good coach. I also seriously doubt we would get rid of Monty after we offer Davis a max deal. The two of them have a great relationship.      So to sum up, I think our downfall was inexperience in a real playoff environment coupled by immature mistakes. We have the talent, and now we know what it's like to face the #1 seed. There is no margin for error in the NBA playoffs. We were far too complacent."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,Chovinson,3,Mon Apr 27 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel too, we can't say Monty is the sole reason for that loss in game 3. It was a combination of a bunch of stuff. This is the best summary I have seen written up about that game. Nice job."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danceswithsharks,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:14:59 2015 UTC,Thanks man
NOLAPelicans,342i02,Chovinson,2,Mon Apr 27 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed answer man. I agree with you on Monty and Asik, I thought they got unfairly shat on by a lot of people. Asik definitely has his weaknesses though."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,Levelupbuttercup,2,Mon Apr 27 22:56:16 2015 UTC,I'm glad NOLA got into the playoffs. I'm glad they were as competitive as they were. But honestly I'm not a big fan of the season as a whole. I know we had a lot of injuries but I don't even think healthy that the majority of guys around AD could have carried this team very far if KD stays healthy. I'm hopeful that the front office thinks this way as well. Right now and in the summer is when the next season is won or lost.
NOLAPelicans,342i02,SteelOliver,2,Mon Apr 27 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"Some of our role players were fine. Pondexter and Cole were great even though their 3's weren't falling as much in 2nd halves. Anderson had moments where he was on fire but then he'd play like garbage the next possession. I thought that this wasn't the series for Asik. He didn't look interested, he was being beaten down the court by Bogut, and he wasn't really mobile enough to guard on the perimeter. And he negatively affected offensive effectiveness. I mean we were a young team in the playoffs for the first time for most against the best team in the NBA. I thought Monty made some mistakes, but I don't think that changes the outcome except maybe in game 3. There are times I wish we got AD the ball more in the 4th quarter or we pressed the issue. I know he can create for himself without necessarily being so hands on, but the best player should have the ball in his hands. Also last thing, we got murdered in the fast break points all series."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danceswithsharks,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"yeah Bogut doesn't have the prettiest play style or gaudy numbers, but he will fuckin beat you up defensively. I don't think Asik was ready for it this series."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,Levelupbuttercup,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"I don't usually get too critical when thinking about the games but I am happy with how things went, of course I wanted them to win and make it further, who wouldn't. At the end of the day though, I knew that the goal for this season was to make it to the playoffs. I don't care if people say it was a lot of luck because OKC went down with injuries or what the situation is, we made it in. Every game we at least had some really good quarters, and of course some bad ones. As long as we are able to take all of those as a learning opportunity I am fine with our playoff run. We got the experience that many of our guys needed, agains a GREAT team that we at least performed close to. We need to pay or dues and hopefully next year make a more serious run in the post season."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danceswithsharks,2,Mon Apr 27 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah even though KD went down it was no cake walk into the playoffs. It was stunning actually. We defiantly paid ""The Iron Price"""
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danceswithsharks,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"We were like 3 or 4 games back I believe toward the end and many, including myself, felt like it was over for us. It just seemed like we had too much going against us at that point. That kind of ties into why I want to give Monty another chance, let him run out his contract then make a decision. He had to make a lot of adjustments with our team changing a lot. I understand why people aren't happy with him, I think we have too much to lose if we got rid of him now, after improving from previous seasons. That kind of changed subjects a bit."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danial133416,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:34:15 2015 UTC,How do you feel about Monty? I felt like half of you guys were calling for his head and the other half were ok with him.
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danceswithsharks,2,Mon Apr 27 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'm in the half that is ok with him. I can't deny that there have been cases where he probably made some not so great calls. I just don't feel like we should just to wanting him out. To me, the 20 point lead that we lost in game 3 was everyone just got too comfortable. Monty, AD, everyone. They felt like we had it and let their guard down, in my opinion. I want to see if we can keep a healthy team next year what he can do. Like I said, he has had to adjust all season to guys going out and coming back in and us getting rid of guys and getting new ones. It takes time to figure out who works best with who. I'm sure with people looking on paper it would seem easy to pick lineups but there are some many unexplainable things that factor into how guys work together. One more season on his contract, I think this is the year people can make more solid judgements. The guys like him, let him finish out the contract then decide."
NOLAPelicans,342i02,danial133416,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"Good point about getting too comfortable. I think that has a lot to do with team playoff experience, and a perfect example of that was the 4th quarter in game 1 vs. game 3. You guys came this close to coming back from a bigger deficit than we did. I think you got within two at one point. The dubs weathered it and the Pels collapsed. Just experience man. On the bright side, AD is young and beastly so more experience is likely coming."

His ""One game at a time"" mentality is what really got the Pel's to overachieve this year. Fuck it. I'm off the fire Monty train."

NOLAPelicans,33zpvf,Guyote_,2,Mon Apr 27 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was at Game 3. People were booing Monty during introductions. I'm like, this is our first home Playoff game in years...why the fuck are Yall booing him before the game even begins?!?"
NOLAPelicans,33zpvf,Guyote_,2,Mon Apr 27 16:36:33 2015 UTC,I was so pissed off at him (still am) after game 3. So I did what any sensible person in my position would do. Sold my tickets and did not go to game 4. Not show up and make an ass out of myself and make the franchise look trashy by booing the man.
NOLAPelicans,33zpvf,danceswithsharks,2,Mon Apr 27 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"I was gonna go to Game 4. But while at Game 3 and witnessing the collapse, I decided to save my money :("

Edit: ""Fuck Monty and anyone who defends him"" - you not even a week ago. That shit genuinely pisses me off. Talking about another real person like that.

I don't boo him at games, because I do know his family is there. You act like someone can't be critical of a coach without hating him. I dislike his coaching.  And I don't understand why we were booing him in our first home game in the Playoffs, before anything had even happened. The series was far from over at that point.   Edit: and I specifically said before the game even started. Going into Game 3, everyone was pretty positive. It just caught me off guard that people would boo at that specific moment and time."

After the way he coached the 4th quarter of game 3 i am suprised that no one even threw a bottle at him. The fans boo'd him out of fustration. If ad didn't have any love for him monty would have been long fired. We have a once in a generation type player in a.d and monty can't even use him right. Honestly if durant wasn't injured we wouldn't have made the playoffs and maybe idiots like u wouldn't be defending monty. U want him back ?

NOLAPelicans,33ytkn,ADMVP23,3,Mon Apr 27 01:36:00 2015 UTC,"Not aboard the Monroe train. Although AD is the prototype to put next to him, he is a middle class DeMarcus Cousins. Just not as good in the post or on the boards, or shooting for that matter. The youth intrigues me but his ceiling as a defender is extremely low. Team needs a Roy Hibbert or Joakim Noah."
NOLAPelicans,33ytkn,LieutenantKumar,2,Mon Apr 27 16:07:12 2015 UTC,I agree we need to let asik walk
NOLAPelicans,33ytkn,danial133416,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:15:34 2015 UTC,I think our priority to sign this off season should be Monroe then Robin Lopez then Asik if we miss on the those.

NOLAPelicans,33ytkn,TheBrutalBrit1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"Defensively he protects the rim better than Asik, and we both know Omer isn't bringing as much offensively."
NOLAPelicans,33ytkn,Levelupbuttercup,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"Monroe has been one of my favourite players since joining the league because of his intriguing skill set on offence. I wouldn't be upset if the Pelicans signed him but this team is already a top 8 offensive team in the league WITH Jrue missing 40 games and others (Gordon, Anderson) missing significant amounts of time. Monroe has active hands but can also gamble too often, can't protect the rim, help defense isn't there. He is much worse than Asik on defence, the same way Monroe is much better on offence but I feel like this team even with Asik is incredible offensively that they still need a quality defender at the center.   Especially until Davis improves on the defensive end, his help side defence, rotations, sometimes Isolation all need work to become a true defensive anchor for this team. If Hibberts available I go for him over Asik, also another option would be guys like Robin Lopez, Kosta Koufos. I just don't think Monroe is the ideal fit but I wouldn't be upset if he was signed, he's still talented."

Even though I put that game 3 meltdown squarely on Monty (and all the other blown leads this season) I know that the personnel decisions are out of his control."
NOLAPelicans,33ytkn,rps215,2,Mon Apr 27 03:09:47 2015 UTC,Demps has been great this season. He turned Rivers and Salmons into Qpon and Norris Cole. Also he added Cunningham.

NOLAPelicans,33x2tf,Levelupbuttercup,4,Sun Apr 26 13:41:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really like how people still say the same shit about our supporting cast. Tyreke wasn't as effective as usual but this was probably one of the worst matchups for him. He excels at driving to the paint and finishing at the rim. Is it that surprising that he struggled against the best team in the NBA at defending the paint? Gordon played better than I expected despite a few clanked 3s in crunch time. We still haven't seen healthy Jrue back in the lineup. Qpon wasn't his usual self for the entire series. Despite all this we held our own against not only the stiffest defense but the hottest offense. AD could definitely use another bonafide star beside him but we can't write off Jrue just yet. When he was healthy we were one of the best offensive teams and that was before Tyreke had meshed with the team. It just takes time and this playoff series was perfect for the team. If our team is struggling next year then I will finally yield that our team is AD and scrubs.   My big question mark is Asik. I love love love what he brings defensively and he's a rebound swallower... But that offensive game. Yikes. If we sign him again, are we hoping he develops his game under the rim? It doesn't help having a center that excels at grabbing his own rebounds if he blows the putback EVERY TIME"
NOLAPelicans,33x2tf,IReallyLikeFootball,5,Sun Apr 26 15:26:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should expect Asik's game to develop in anyway. He might get more comfortable in the system and with the rest of the players, which is why I think he did better in the second half of the year. But he's 28. He pretty much is what he is at this point."
NOLAPelicans,33x2tf,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Sun Apr 26 16:20:39 2015 UTC,Imo we should go after another center like robin lopez who can finish around the rim and take some pressure off Ad on offense.
NOLAPelicans,33x2tf,danial133416,3,Sun Apr 26 16:57:34 2015 UTC,center like robin lopez   how weird this would have sounded 3ish years ago. Most of us wanted him gone haha

NOLAPelicans,33vu1a,DeliciousPaste,3,Sun Apr 26 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"These should still be happy times.  You guys got the next MJ/Kobe/Lebron type player. If AD is on your team for the remainder of his career you will win at least one or two titles. You had no pressure on you this series and you fought a historically good team in every game.   Don't worry, be happy."
NOLAPelicans,33vu1a,RadioGuyRob,2,Sun Apr 26 06:57:04 2015 UTC,"It's just hard saying goodbye to another season.   But you're right. In the wise words of Rubio, I just need to change my face. Be happy. Enjoy."
NOLAPelicans,33x1bk,speni194,3,Sun Apr 26 13:22:55 2015 UTC,"We're going to offer AD a 5 year extension this summer. He has a qualifying offer for next year so his extension wouldn't kick in until the year after.  Because of the way the CBA is set up we'll be able to give him a significantly larger deal than anyone else, approximately 30% of our cap. On top of that, the year his extension will take effect is the year of a major cap jump. Last estimate I saw had the cap going up to about $82 million. So with those numbers he's look at a contract starting at $25 million per year and escalating each year.  No one has ever turned down this contract. Kyrie signed his last year before he knew about LeBron and Love. And KLove wasn't even offered this contract when he came off his rookie deal.  So yes, I think in a few month he will be under contract for the next 6 years. Now, that being said, we have about 3 more years to get into contention. Just because he's under contract doesn't mean he can't ask for a trade or want out.  This off season we don't have too much we can do. Resign our guys, hope to make an addition with the MLE, go into next season and try for better injury luck.  The Summer of 2016 is where we'll really have to make our move. Gordon and Anderson's contracts will be up and all of our draft picks will be available as assets. So at the end of that summer we'll really have an idea what the future of the team looks like.  If we can't build a contender around him in that time frame, then he can and should want to try somewhere else. I wouldn't hold it against him in the slightest."

NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Levelupbuttercup,5,Sun Apr 26 02:57:31 2015 UTC,Well I mean. He has to sign his extension this off season. A contract no one has ever turned down. And his will be for a lot more than previous 5 years designated max contacts.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Sun Apr 26 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"What a lot of people don't realize is that we can offer him the biggest contract. Also if he does not sign with us, he will be giving up about 50 million dollars of potential career earnings."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,rephil0309,7,Sun Apr 26 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"My plan going forward.  2015 offseason:   Bring Anthony Davis his max extension. Resign Asik. $10 million per year. 3 years with a team option. Hope Cole takes his qualifying off for 3 million. If not, I'd be willing to pay him as much as 4 per year but that's it. Resign Ajinca for $3-4 million per year. Would consider 5. SF with the MLE. Dudley, Mike Dunleavy, those type of guys.   2016 off season:   Gordon and Anderson's contracts end. About $22 million in cap space from that. Plus cap jump. But AD's new contract will kick in so that will take some of that money. Go after a big time player here."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Sun Apr 26 03:01:12 2015 UTC,You know how I feel about your spirit animal Omer but as much as it pains me to say it. Number two is right. I think the guy just needs to get his head straight and watch some tapes of Patrick Ewing. But the front office still needs to put feelers out for a new big man. HARD! But I don't think they will find one.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Levelupbuttercup,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:06:18 2015 UTC,Robin Lopez will be a free agent and after Portland's collapse against the Griz he might be willing to sign else where. Also Lopez is younger than Asik.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:40:54 2015 UTC,No Asik. He's been bad all season. Looks uninterested. We need to take that money from his expiring and sign a better rim protecting big man. I'd also like to see some trades from Dell Demps this offseason. Maybe move Anderson or Reke. Try to fill some holes.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,BigEarl139,2,Sun Apr 26 03:08:39 2015 UTC,"Asik has not been bad all season. Asik was bad in this series and also had bad matchups. Without him we don't even sniff the playoffs. He may not be a great rim protected statistically but he's a smart sound defender. And as the rest of our team learns to rotate properly, he'll look even better.  I'm also all ears as to who this other big man is."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,0,Sun Apr 26 03:11:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know what games you've been watching, but Asik has absolutely been bad this season. Sure, we wouldn't be in the playoffs without him, but add any decent center to our lineup and we're probably in the same place.   And there are plenty of good bigs going into free agency this year. Look at a list of expiring contracts and you'll see what I'm talking about."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,BigEarl139,5,Sun Apr 26 03:46:29 2015 UTC,"I have looked at the list. Gasol, Jordan (max contracts no chance). Tyson Chandler (31 and never leaving Dallas). Robin Lopez (would love to make a run at him but I'm skeptical he leaves Portland). Greg Monroe (Will be in the $15 million dollar range and not a true C). Kosta Koufas (Could be interesting but only if he's cheap. Downgrade from Asik). Did I miss anyone?  And you its as simple as looking at numbers for Asik. What he did for our defense, especially in the second half of the season, was huge."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Sun Apr 26 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"Only one you missed was Brandan Wright but he's not big enough to really bang down low, but he does bring rebounding and athleticism which would be nice. I think the best plan is to go hard after Lopez. Portland is not looking too good right now and the Aldridge rumors aren't helping so maybe we can convince him to leave. If we miss out on Lopez then I wouldn't mind Asik or Monroe. Monroe and AD would be scary offensively at least."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:45:38 2015 UTC,Yeah my only concern with Monroe is that he's get another guy that'll take shots away from AD.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:56:35 2015 UTC,Monroe would take a lot of pressure off AD on offense though because the other team has to guard him. Also Monroe is fantastic at grabbing offensive boards and putting it back in. On defensive we would lose a little but Monroe is certainly not bad. He can play good 1v1 defense. Monroe was also born in Louisiana which is really cool. I could see this being perfect for the team except for the money issue. Mostly likely Monroe wants too much so we just resign Asik. Although I would definitely be okay with trading Anderson to open up more money because I think Monroe fits that well.   Edit: Monroe is also 24. He really is the perfect option for us.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,BlackScienceJesus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"If Aldridge leaves then Lopez is leaving imo. Roy Hibbert could be an option because I think he's done in Indy. Mozgov is a free agent, but he won't leave if they win the title. Brandon Wright is another good option. Speights is also a good center, but not a great rim protector. We could also try to make a trade for a draft pick for a big man. There are plenty of options. Asik is not working for us. Especially at that price."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,BigEarl139,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:08:55 2015 UTC,Not paying someone who's terrible at offense for 10 million. I would go after another center like robin lopez or brook lopez.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,danial133416,2,Sun Apr 26 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"With our injury problems I wouldn't touch Brook with a 10 foot pole. If we could get Robin, I would absolutely be on board.

NOLAPelicans,33vna4,danial133416,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:28:58 2015 UTC,"If he leaves I could see him leaving too.  In all seriousness though, he'll get a max contract and we can't afford that"
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:30:10 2015 UTC,Robin lopez is worth around 5-8 million and we are paying asik 15 million... Use that money to sign lopez or another decent center who can finish around the rim.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,danial133416,2,Sun Apr 26 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"Robin Lopez will get +10 million if he has an agent worth two shits. We're technically paying Asik 15 but his cap hit is only 8. And we inherit his bird rights which allows us to go over cap to keep him.  Again I hate these ""sign a player like this."" Yeah it sounds doable in theory but when you go look at the realistic options there's not as much selection as you think."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:39:37 2015 UTC,I just feel like there are much better centers out there for cheaper prices. Greg monroe is pretty damn solid. Big phyiscal defense and is a wayy better version of asik and he's made 5 million this year and yet we payed asik 15 fucking million. We could make a run at tyson chandler too..
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,danial133416,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"Again. Asik's cap hit is 8 million. Thats really the only number that matters. TC is like 31 and super loyal to Dallas. I think Monroe is an interesting one but would cost $15-17 and would be a downgrade defensively, but an upgrade overall though. But Monroe has played mainly PF in Detroit. Would he want to play C full time? Would that even be a good idea? Idk, but I wouldn't mind exploring that route."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,8,Sun Apr 26 03:47:55 2015 UTC,a true #2 sidekick to AD.  I love Evans but he can't be your 2nd best player on a contending team.  Pelicans need to trade Holiday or Evans because they don't fit.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,10,Sun Apr 26 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"I fully believe Jrue CAN be that guy. But he hasn't been healthy. Hell, no one here has really..."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Guyote_,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:56:34 2015 UTC,No way Holiday can be your 2nd best player on a contending team especially not in the tough Western Conference.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,5,Sun Apr 26 01:57:26 2015 UTC,He has been great when healthy. People just haven't seen any of him in 2-3 years.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Guyote_,-4,Sun Apr 26 02:01:11 2015 UTC,Holiday when healthy is a good player and he made the allstar team in the East. But lets be honest even if he is 100% healthy he still wouldn't be a top 5 pg in the West.  Curry/CP3/Lillard/Conley/Parker are all better.  If I was the Pelicans I would be trying to trade for Carmelo Anthony.  The Pelicans need another elite scorer to pair with AD. A Melo/Davis duo would cause havoc in the West.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,9,Sun Apr 26 02:02:35 2015 UTC,Yeah fuck getting Carmelo. Dude makes a gazillion dollars per year and plays the same position as AD and zero defense.   I'd take healthy Jrue over both Conley and Parker.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,0,Sun Apr 26 02:11:51 2015 UTC,Lillard is playing injured. When he is healthy he is a beast.  I know because he torched us last year in the playoffs.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,-3,Sun Apr 26 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Did I say anything about Holiday?  I know Holiday was playing hurt the whole series, and I said when healthy he is a good player. I just don't think he is a top 5 pg in the West when everybody is healthy."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,2,Sun Apr 26 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"Who gives a fuck if he's not a ""top five PG"" - that's nothing but emotional conjecture. He's a very good PG, top five or not."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,jetlife_,3,Sun Apr 26 02:39:17 2015 UTC,Almost all of those guys are much older the Jrue. Lillard is the same age but can't even touch Jrue when it comes to defense.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Zzzonked_Out,2,Sun Apr 26 02:43:38 2015 UTC,If I was the Pelicans I would be trying to trade for Carmelo Anthony.   And this is the moment you lost all credibility.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,jetlife_,0,Sun Apr 26 02:46:33 2015 UTC,Lillard and Parker are trash.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,-1,Sun Apr 26 06:36:52 2015 UTC,"Again Lillard and Parker are playing hurt and Holiday is as well.  I'm talking if all players are 100% healthy, you can't convince me that a healthy Holiday is better than Parker/Lillard. Hell a 100% healthy Parker is arguably the best pg in the NBA."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,jjsdinerforminers,3,Sun Apr 26 02:48:34 2015 UTC,you can't convince me that a healthy Holiday is better than Parker/Lillard.   Since you clearly haven't watched Holiday play this year...

NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,3,Sun Apr 26 02:52:29 2015 UTC,Shaq and Kobe Jordan and Pippen Lebron and D-Wade.  Anthony Davis and ??? You nailed it my friend.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:53:18 2015 UTC,If only you guys could bring back CP3.  Speaking of CP3 if both CP3 and AD were coming out of college at the same time and same age who are you taking to be the face of your franchise?
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,TheCoco,4,Sun Apr 26 02:51:43 2015 UTC,Its not even a question. Anthony Davis
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,danial133416,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"Elite big man over elite point guard, every time. The guard spot is the deepest position in the NBA, especially PG. Davis has a higher ceiling than Paul ever had too. I'm not sure what ADs ceiling is to be honest."

Lebron, Durant, Davis, Curry, Paul, Harden, Westbrook as of now IMO  But I get your point, AD with another star player is deadly. I think Jrue is capable of reaching that star level he just needs to stay healthy"

NOLAPelicans,33vna4,mooncolours,2,Sun Apr 26 10:45:56 2015 UTC,"Hell yes!  But no way the Kings will trade the best center in the NBA. Cousins is right behind AD as the best young big in the NBA.

NOLAPelicans,33vna4,KarmaPoIice,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:20:31 2015 UTC,"Evans for sure. Gordon could be a solid SG for us. When Evans is on his A game he looks elite, he's just so fucking inconsistent and plays so dumb too often. Second half of the year he was more of the good Reke; attacking the basket and distributing. I like the roster to be honest; a solid addition at the 3 and experience like this will go a long way."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,ULTIMATE_GULBIS_FAN,2,Sun Apr 26 02:15:10 2015 UTC,An athletic center that can shoot and a healthy jrue holiday.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Good_NewsEveryone,5,Sun Apr 26 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"Smart players. I'm still not a fan of Monty, but we did win 45 games being ravaged by injuries. I would like an upgrade at coach, but I think smart players is the simplest answer. Staring at the backboard and not attempting to rebond, not fouling when the coach clearly is tell you to, Tyreke's decision making in general, etc. These are all IQ problems, hard to win games when the overall team IQ is so low. Hopefully experience helps that."
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Levelupbuttercup,2,Mon Apr 27 20:02:21 2015 UTC,I want Deandre Jordan
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Rocketz1Bruh,0,Sun Apr 26 04:21:12 2015 UTC,We are fucked   No one wants holiday or Gordon. Trade anderson. I think Evans could stay but I'd listen to offers for everyone other than Davis. If we could just get two bonafide stars and fill in the gaps we would be better off. Unload as much money as possible and throw everything into getting another Allstar (perhaps one who can make it out of the west this time)
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,yungJoc,10,Sun Apr 26 10:52:46 2015 UTC,Wow could I not disagree more.  Did you see Tyreke in that game? Play 10 feet off and he's a non factor. Every team will make that easy adjustment in the playoffs.  We don't have to go from 8 seed to dominant contender in one year. Next year is the last year of Gordon and Anderson's contracts. We'll lock up AD and go into the biggest free agency ever with a big bank roll after next year. 2016 is when we make our big play.  Holiday and Evans will be on bargain contracts with the cap jump. All of our draft picks are now fair game as assets.
NOLAPelicans,33vna4,TheCoco,5,Tue Apr 28 01:45:48 2015 UTC,Now we're talking my friend. You said everything I was thinking without my usual pessimism and venom.

NOLAPelicans,33vna4,Levelupbuttercup,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"Carroll should absolutely be a target, although I think he will sign with New York. He'd be an outstanding addition. Thomas/Lawson, not a chance unless they get rid of a guard here."

NOLAPelicans,33vsj5,A_Hint_of_Lemon,3,Sun Apr 26 17:31:42 2015 UTC,The thing that makes it hardest for us to be a 3 seed is playing in the Southwest. We'd have to win the division.  But I agree with what you're saying in principle. There's a bit too much panic around these parts. The team played well. And Holiday still isn't even there at 100%.
NOLAPelicans,33vsj5,Bihmerz,5,Sun Apr 26 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the radio on the drive home from the game and they brought up a great point that I completely agree with. It sucks that it went down this way, but go back to the beginning of the season, if we were told that we would be a 45 win team, AD would explode, and we get into the playoffs but lose to a great Golden State, would you take it? Everyone said of course and it makes sense. Last year we were what, 34 wins? This season was a success for us, we have seen things that we need to improve on and AD got his first taste of the playoffs.

You probably already figured that out. That said, we gather tonight not to win the series, not to celebrate what we have done. We gather for the Pride of the Pelican. We gather for the Blender, the Nest and the Brow. We gather because the Anthony Destiny is just beginning, we gather cause we took the best team in the NBA and we have out played them for more quarters than not. We gather because the League is now on notice. The Prophecy has been fulfilled. The Brow has risen and New Orleans can be a Basketball town.   Lets Flap for this one. I want one. Just one. I want to taste sweet Playoff victory. I'll be honest, I probably won't even watch a Game 5. California doesn't deserve my tears. But Game 4 I will be watching. I will be screaming. I will be flapping like a Pelican should.  I say we got one more Pimp walk in us before this season is done.  No one on the injury report. Pels are truly Stacked tonight.

But that doesn't mean people should be calling for our coaches head. This lose is 90% on the players. Sure, he could've disrupted their rhythm with timeouts or fouls. But that's something players should be smart enough to do as well. Every time we lose people want Monty fired. But when we win you hear nothing."

NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Guyote_,5,Sat Apr 25 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"My point is I feel like we're in the same situation. Yeah, we're a good team with Monty (and GS was a good team with Jackson). We've made the Playoffs. But after watching Monty for 5 years now, I know he isn't going to suddenly change.  His best years were with CP3+DWest and this year with AD. We are in the Playoffs BECAUSE of those players, not because of Monty. Do we want to be a good team, or a great team? Do we want to barely make the Playoffs, and be content with a few wins? Or do we want to compete for championships, like GS upgraded to?  I will be so damned pissed if we stay like this with Monty, and AD decides to leave at somepoint because we couldn't get shit done. But hey, at least we kept Monty around. He's had fucking issues with his situational awareness and rotations for so long. It's been years now. We know what we're getting."

There's a lot of things to hate monty for, this one is absurd.   Also, this is the NBA we're talking about. Talent wins."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Guyote_,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"I dislike Monty because of his rotations, lack of consistency, and ability to maintain leads.  I'm simply stating that, in the NBA, the players matter more than the coach. That's why a team coached by Mike Brown went to the NBA Finals. They had LeBron. A great coach paired with a great player makes a huge difference. But a team can win with a poor coach. They just won't win it all."

NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Guyote_,3,Sat Apr 25 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"I'm basing it off the same issues Monty has had for the past 4-5 years? Rotations, blown leads, etc."

NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Guyote_,2,Sat Apr 25 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"I've already addressed that. AD is the reason we are in the Playoffs. Not Monty Williams. Same as the CP3 being the reason we were in the Playoffs. Not Byron Scott and not Monty.  We improve because AD gets older and older, more experience. More training."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,jjsdinerforminers,0,Sat Apr 25 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"Lol. Then why do you want him fired?!?! According to your logic, the coach means literally nothing!"
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Guyote_,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:50:32 2015 UTC,"In the NBA? Superstars matter more than the coach. This isnt college ball. A star will take you farther. Couple that star player with a good coach, and big things will happen.   You can't be afraid to move on. OKC is doing it. GS did it. Think KD is worried? Fuck no."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,MarchMadnessisMe,3,Sat Apr 25 05:07:22 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely. AD and the team getting better is the reason we're in the playoffs. A coach using the proper rotation and knowing how to control the situation to maintain a lead is the difference between us being down 3-0 and us being up 1-2.
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,jjsdinerforminers,-1,Sat Apr 25 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"I love how Golden State is your model of success. You're aware they haven't won shit yet, right? So if that's your proof that firing coaches is a super cool idea, you should probably bite your tounge until they actually win a single playoff series lol"
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,cleanindustry,0,Sat Apr 25 05:22:25 2015 UTC,"No. The difference is when we lost, our fanbase didn't turn on Mark. We were just happy to be in the playoffs to be honest. It was the ownership that had the issues and obviously fired him because of it. No one blamed MJ for our losses, we lost Bogut 2 weeks before playoffs last year to a rib injury.  It's a slow build and your team is on the cusp of being really good. Take a deep breath and enjoy this series."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Guyote_,2,Sat Apr 25 08:58:23 2015 UTC,"Do you think this is the result of 1 game, or years of these same issues?"
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,SteelOliver,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"""Only hate him because Bill Simmons told you to hate him."" Or it could be watching games where he lets the other team go on 10+ run and refuses to call a timeout even though plays out of timeouts is what he's supposed to be good at. It could be watching as a he trots out bad lineups that he knows won't play well. It could be that he never seems to motivate the players when we play against below .500 Eastern conference teams. I could hate him for saying AD needs 20 shots a game and then doing nothing as he only gets around 14 for the next few games. You've seen fans rag on Monty before Bill Simmons even mentioned them, so don't act like this is some new thing."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,jjsdinerforminers,3,Sat Apr 25 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"What coaches could come to our team and make us a contender? Every player needs to be motivated. Unless they have the super drive like Kobe, Jordan, of Westbrook now, they need to be motivated. And AD is only in his third year man, that is not his prime. Not even close. Most players peak between 28-31. He's 22. We aren't squandering anything. And yeah, small market teams thrive through the draft, so blame Dell Demps. He's the one trading our draft picks in two of the best drafts in recent memory."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,KidCunner,4,Sat Apr 25 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"AD isn't going anywhere. The only player to ever turn down their extension after their rookie contract was Shaq, and that was because they low balled him because ""no man was worth $100 million"". AD is coming back. He obviously loves the city. And players aren't jumping to big markets anymore. We aren't losing him for a while."

If anything, his inability to draw up plays is his biggest fault besides rotations. And everybody knows it. If anybody was listing Monty's strengths, the ability to draw up great plays would certainly not be one of them, and it's not even up for debate."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Good_NewsEveryone,5,Sat Apr 25 03:04:58 2015 UTC,Look at the stats. Number one is plays of out timeouts. That qualifies as great to me.
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Sat Apr 25 04:15:52 2015 UTC,And everybody knows it.   Actually I think you're the only one who doesn't seem to know that Monty is tops in the league in drawing up plays. Look it up.
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Good_NewsEveryone,-2,Sat Apr 25 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"I have been waiting for a post like this and I do understand where you are coming from. I think the reason I'm so salty is cultural. I'm a transplant. I don't buy into ""Bless you boys"" ""Who Dat"" culture and all that ""Believe"" B.S. If we as a fan base are not ""salty"" then we deserve what we get. We have to be vocal about wanting our hard earned money to go to a good product.  In the season ticket survey from the NBA there are questions like ""How happy are you with the product on the court and does it affect your decision to buy tickets next year"" As a fan you better not settle for mediocrity because if we do that's what were gonna get. I moved here from Cincinnati where fans of the Bengals are so busy shouting ""Who Dey"" And buying every ticket and piece of gear possible but still wondering why the Bengals get bounced in the first round every year. It's because the fans give them no reason to improve. I'm a rabid Pelican's fan. But we have to be honest with ourselves. This is not just about last night. But about bad free agent pickups and trades. And every blown lead throughout this entire season that made last night inevitable."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,Levelupbuttercup,4,Sat Apr 25 03:38:48 2015 UTC,"While I do understand where you're coming from, I disagree completely. The Pelicans don't have some massive fan base that supports them not matter what. We're middle of the pack in attendance at best and we're one of the smaller markets in the NBA. This teams needs success to gain a fan base and they know that.  If anything the FO may have tried too hard to give us a good product on the floor."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,danceswithsharks,2,Sat Apr 25 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. This is where it should be pointed. I'm salty as well. But our mediocrity as a franchise is not Monty's fault, as so many people claim. It's managements fault. Dell Demps has been terrible up until this year, and that's only because he stole Pondexter and Cole. He is terrible at hiring people to work in the franchise (as shown by our medical staff), he makes either never makes trades all year or makes bad trades that actually hurts us, and no one is doing anything about it. Dell Demps is the real reason we aren't succeeding, and people need to see this. He has the ability to put a great roster together, but instead he trades away every draft pick for 4 years for guys who aren't good enough to warrant that (though I love Reke and Holiday)."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,KidCunner,2,Sat Apr 25 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion on Dell: he took a major risk. We built a top heavy roster which is risky and it hasn't panned out as planned. But what we saw for 3 quarters last night is the evidence for his vision of this team. And not even the full thing with Holiday on minutes restriction.  Its another situation where: do you judge him on pure results or do you judge him by some other standard. At the time of every move he made I was on board.  Again, I feel like we're playing the blame game though. Looking for a scapegoat. There's plenty to go around. We just have to hope we learn from the mistakes. A look forward to realize there's still a bright future."
NOLAPelicans,33rrtl,jjsdinerforminers,3,Sat Apr 25 02:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I was on board when he traded Chris Paul for Eric Gordon. I thought we were going to get an future superstar for our current superstar (as did most other people). But I haven't liked any of the other trades he's made. Trading our first rounder in Nerlens to the 76ers for Jrue was not a good decision to me at the time (I know we wouldn't have drafted Nerlens if not for this trade, but I still didn't like it). The Tyreke signing had me excited at first, because I thought a change of scenery would rejuvenate him, but I never realized how ball dominant he was until he got to our team, where we had him running the bench squad (which would have been great if he actually accepted his role). Then we traded our first rounder to the Rockets for Omer, which really pissed me off. Omer had a couple decent seasons, and a first rounder from a team that wasn't looking like it would have made the playoffs was a high price for him. And during this entire ordeal, all of our players were getting injured left and right. All these injuries made it pretty obvious we needed a better training staff. But Dell just wouldn't get us one. In my opinion, if we had a better training staff, Gordon would be the superstar he was expected to be, and Jrue wouldn't be missing so much time.  I agree that I am just playing the blame game, but I honestly believe a lot of it is on Dell. Monty will take most of the blame because he is the coach, and coaches always take most of the blame. And sure, Monty deserves some of it, because he isn't great. He's average. And our players deserve some of it, because they don't always play up to their standards. But if they were really underperforming, Dell would have to recognize that and make some changes."

NOLAPelicans,33p9va,Good_NewsEveryone,5,Fri Apr 24 14:07:39 2015 UTC,I guess he's blaming his teammates but its just the truth. I don't think any of the other players would argue with him. But that's why I love having Cole. He knows what I takes to win these games and he knows we didn't do that.

NOLAPelicans,33r8y5,Levelupbuttercup,3,Fri Apr 24 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"OK. So what do you suggest we trade Eric Gordon for? Its easy suggest but finding a real trade is much more difficult. Same goes for every ""underperforming"" player. Can you realistically trade them for something that will improve the team?"
NOLAPelicans,33r8y5,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Sat Apr 25 02:18:13 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is they need to offer Draymon Green a max deal at the end of summer?
NOLAPelicans,33r8y5,Breakemoff,2,Fri Apr 24 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"first time we make playoffs with AD against a historically good #1 seed, doesn't go to fans liking BLOW IT ALL UP SHIT IS BROKEN MUST WIN FIRST TIME EVERY TIME    no one realistically had the pels as a chance to take this series. no one had us taking anything away from the two @GSW games other than 0-2. The hope was we could get a game or two at home. First game home we don't get the win, suddenly it's like expectations were Pels would easily take the series and GSW are nothing. Drama queen much? Definitely things to work on our team, and pieces to change, but it isn't going to happen overnight. Just be happy we are in the playoffs this year and being very competitive, we only made it by the skin of our teeth."

NOLAPelicans,33ogie,danial133416,9,Fri Apr 24 04:48:24 2015 UTC,1) Keeping tyreke in when jrue should be the closer.  2) NOT FOULING IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS WHAT THE FUCK  3) Not putting in your best rebounders and ADJUSTING FOR THAT in the last 6 minutes!!!  WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,fittitthroway,2,Fri Apr 24 05:02:51 2015 UTC,He says he told them to foul though. I don't get how Speights doesn't get wrapped up on that rebound when your coach tells you to foul.
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,jhueckel,3,Fri Apr 24 06:18:54 2015 UTC,On the warriors CSN broadcast you can clearly hear MW telling the team to foul.
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,jtmoneybags,2,Fri Apr 24 18:06:01 2015 UTC,Asik wasn't in AT ALL in the 4th. Fuck Monty
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,Guyote_,-9,Fri Apr 24 05:06:15 2015 UTC,"Wait, why? They hit insane shots... And got calls all game long.  EDIT: I mean seriously. What do you do differently as Monty? Foul on the last play? That's really the only thing I see. That doesn't put the 20 point comeback on him  EDIT2: Monty said the plan was to foul"
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,Good_NewsEveryone,4,Fri Apr 24 04:57:11 2015 UTC,"The play/passing strategy at the start of the fourth was terrible. It lead to an easy 6 points within the first minute. Defense stopped boxing out, which lead to a HUGE amount of offensive rebounds by the Warriors. Cole was out of the game [or so it seemed] which hurt us in the fourth since he was making very smart plays on both side of the ball.   The Pelicans seemed lost in the 4th and in the OT. They made boneheaded shots and wasted far too much time on getting fouls when they needed the most. It felt that in the 4th/OT that Davis disappeared due to the ball not being directed to him. It felt like he was at 20 pts in the 3rd, and only hit 24 in the 4th.   During the period where we held and maintained our lead, we were driving into the paint. This was forcing the Warriors to play very hard on the defensive side. They were creating contact, getting fouls, and having to accept charges to slow the Pelicans down. This play style was completely abandoned in the 4th/OT, despite it being the reason the Pelicans were doing great prior.   If the players were tanked for energy, then it's a matter of not managing the Bench players properly. We had a 20 point lead, which should have provided ample time for everyone to rest when needed. Play was flat coming out of Time Outs.   When things got close, there seemed to be no strategy to slow down the Warriors. No Fouls, no defensive changes, nothing."
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,-Ran,15,Fri Apr 24 05:03:42 2015 UTC,"I know posting in this thread with this flair is asking for it but Monty shit the bed. Not telling them to foul so many times is just bad coaching.  I would argue that the refs bailed you guys out with that intentional foul from Klay at the end but I wouldn't dare on your sub.  Anyways, amazing game from my perspective. AD is a fucking beast."
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,the_dinks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:01:34 2015 UTC,I agree we should have fouled. But what is the bigger problem: losing a 20 point lead or not fouling?

NOLAPelicans,33ogie,the_dinks,4,Fri Apr 24 05:18:50 2015 UTC,Did u watch the final minutes down the stretch ? warriors missed their first shots but 2nd chance points got them back into this game. And yet monty didn't make any adjustments. Honestly ask anyone they would blame this loss on the coach.
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,danial133416,5,Fri Apr 24 05:02:02 2015 UTC,So Monty should have hustled for the rebound? Or put in Asik which is the exact opposite of what everyone has been calling for?
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,Good_NewsEveryone,2,Fri Apr 24 05:04:06 2015 UTC,"Asik can grab boards, we don't need asik to score when we are up by 20 points in the 4th. Yes he's been terrible at offense and contesting shots but rebounding is the best thing he can do. Honestly monty fucked up badly, everyone knows it even the people in this sub who's been defending him all season are admitting that he fucked up. It's time to move on.."
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,danial133416,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:08:34 2015 UTC,I just don't see how he fucked up. Asik got 20 and Anderson got 30. That's exactly how I want it.
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,Good_NewsEveryone,0,Fri Apr 24 05:13:16 2015 UTC,Everyone is not the head coach of an NBA team. Monty tried to go small ball in the 4th and got obliterated on the boards. He didn't adjust at all. Shit coach.

NOLAPelicans,33ogie,Guyote_,5,Fri Apr 24 05:11:26 2015 UTC,I just don't get these criticisms. If he sticks with something then he's not adjusting fast enough. If he doesn't then he's not consistent. Dude is in a lose lose.

Move tyreke over to the 2, Pondexter at 3, Ryan Anderson (NOT asik, why bench him when he is on FIRE) and ad playing center. Imo that should have been the lineup from 6 minutes left on. Also I think they waited WAY too long to put ad back in the game, we'd already squandered like 10 points of our lead at that point."

He's one of my favorite players but even though I'm a warriors fan it kinda also broke my heart seeing how exhausted and upset he looked in the post game conference. He's STUPID young and every year my team will fear him because he can only get better.  PS Ryan Anderson you cold blooded son of a gun

Like last year when mark jackson got fired the players loved him but they got stev kerr and look at them now, best team in the nba and are the favorites to win the title. This game is a pure example of why monty isn't ready to coach. Yes he's a good person but he's not ready to coach. He's better suited on being a assistant."

I know firing monty will upset ad but if we get a coach that can take us to the next level then ad will forget about it like when the warriors did. Like they say winning cures everything.

He is fantastic at developing players and getting the most out of them.  AD still needs to grow.  This team still needs to grow.  If we fire Monty, who AD loves, and hire a coach that the same or worse, does AD stay? Worse case we keep Monty until AD is extended to buy time to find the best replacement."
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,danial133416,0,Fri Apr 24 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Is there a coach that's a sure thing. NBA history is littered with coaches that look like sure things but turn out to be busts. Unless you know there is another Steve Kerr/Thibodeaux/Budenholzer out there on the market, it's very dangerous to make a change with a team that has talent like this.  Unfortunately, there aren't ever as many A-tier coaches as there are teams with A-tier talent. (See what happened to the Chargers with Norv Turner for example.)"
NOLAPelicans,33ogie,Freaky_Styley,0,Fri Apr 24 05:20:31 2015 UTC,Honestly the only thing that can save montys job is if they comeback and win this series 4-3. Otherwise he should be getting the boot if loomis actually wants this team to win a title..

I'd give him some of Pondexter's minutes.  It'll be interesting to see how they come out after such a brutal loss tomorrow."

NOLAPelicans,33q4qq,KidCunner,-1,Fri Apr 24 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"Monty got booed during the introductions yesterday. I can't imagine any other head coach of a playoff team getting booed. He is not very liked by the fans, and that's cause he continues to struggle with the same problems for 5 years now. Can't coach with a lead, fails to make basic adjustments, consistently blows 20+ point leads. I'd take him as an assistant any day, but I don't want him as the head coach of this team any longer.  And I'm not saying a new head coach magically fixes everything either. Our guys are still young, don't have a lot of experience playing together, etc. But they are being managed poorly, and are probably the least disciplined team in the NBA. That falls back on the coach."
NOLAPelicans,33q4qq,danial133416,2,Fri Apr 24 17:49:46 2015 UTC,"Dwane Casey and Randy Wittman probably face more or equal criticism, although not great company to be in. I think most of our flaws are more reflective of our players than Monty but he's certainly not blameless.  My only concern is: who are we going to hire that's going to make a significant improvement next year? Unless there's a coach out there that the FO really likes, it just makes sense to keep the current system and build continuity."
NOLAPelicans,33q4qq,KidCunner,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yea that's the only thing, can we find a better coach? Idk. We're a mess right now. Monty doesn't exactly have the smartest players to work with, so I don't give him full blame, but these guys can't be THAT dumb as to not execute the simplest of things. Attempt to rebound, box out, foul, get back on defense...you don't have to have a high bball IQ to execute those things, you just have to be disciplined, and that falls back on the coach."
NOLAPelicans,33q4qq,Mississippster,2,Fri Apr 24 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"That's true and I think there's basically two sides of the debate.   Monty is not controlling the players with a playstation controller that can just make them do whatever he wants. This has been a year long problem and not just a single incident. So while he can't control the players directly, that sort of pattern is not encouraging from a coaching stand point.   In the end, I think it falls somewhere in the middle ground. I think this team is leaps and bounds ahead of where they were at the beginning of the year and they've shown some seriously impressive stuff in this series. Get a summer of Jrue rest, Cole and Pondexter on the team, AD's continued escalation, and all around chemistry; and I think this team comes back very very strong next year.  Monty has been in this league a long time and had success with very smart franchises. He knows what it takes to win. But just because you know how to do something doesn't mean you can teach it. But step one was to put ourselves in a position to learn, which is where we find ourselves now. And you generally learn from failing. I'm hoping we learned a lot last night."
NOLAPelicans,33q4qq,Mississippster,2,Fri Apr 24 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"Yea I mean if Monty is back next year, as hard as it will be, I'm still supporting the team. I don't dislike Monty, I just haven't seen anything that says he's the guy to lead a team. He can't control the players, but how do other coaches do it? If Monty for whatever reason doesn't possess the ability to get his players to execute simple instructions, then he has to go eventually. It's either him, or our players are just that inexperienced right now. Maybe with more time to play together and learn how to play as a group, we will become better. Only time will tell, but one more year is all he has left, tops."
NOLAPelicans,33q4qq,KidCunner,-2,Fri Apr 24 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Monty gets booed every game, it's nothing new. I've been there enough to hear it, especially last night.  I'm not basing it off just this game, I've seen us meltdown in the 4th quarter consistently for the past 2 seasons. Even though we pull out the win sometimes, we continue to fight tooth and nail in games where we should've easily put our opponent away. This is a consistent thing, not a last night thing.   I didn't say Monty is an idiot, I said he is not a head coach. I'd take him as an assistant anyday. Giving him credit for our play as of late would be like giving Mike Brown credit for the year the Cavs made the Finals. We have an abundance of raw talent on this team, and one of the best players on the planet. That's how we get by. Our offense looks lost almost all the time, and we don't play defense to save our lives. I don't understand how anybody can watch us play and think that we are properly coached, we look absolutely fucking silly more times than not. We might go blow for blow, but when a lot of our shots stop dropping, and the other team adjusts, we literally are like a sinking ship. We go into the 4th up 20, and allow a team to score 39 on us. It's an inexcusable collapse. Monty doesn't make adjustments when other coaches do, he waits until it's too late and the momentum is already long gone. I will not defend this dude anymore, I'm sorry."

This team has to be one of the least disciplined teams in the NBA. They can't execute the simplest of things. That has to fall back on the coach, that's just the way it is. I fail to believe a properly coached team would shit the bed this much."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,KidCunner,2,Fri Apr 24 07:41:50 2015 UTC,"yep. the team lost all of its composure. the players and the staff. everyone went into panic mode and the fear creeped into their blood. once that happens, the game is over. the nerves are shot and the brain can't function properly, and you make mistakes that cost you the game. the pelicans should have won this game by a large margin. they were doing everything right to beat the warriors. their failure to keep their nerves in check just cost them the series and they'll be swept 0-4 because this team is simply not mature enough and coached well enough to overcome such a devastating loss."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,hanni90,2,Fri Apr 24 11:18:11 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel that players shitting the bed has something to do with Monty's 8-man rotations. AD, Reke, and Gordon are all exhausted at the end of games, particularly last night after playing so much. I'm not saying Babbitt, Ajenca, or Douglas are our saviours, but if they're good enough to get us wins in the regular season, they should be good enough to give our starters a solid 10-15 real minutes of rest."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,SoItGoes504,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"Monty's rotations have always been his biggest fault. I don't blame the 8-man rotation though. Ajinca can't defend, and his offense is spotty at best. Babbitt can't defend either, but he usually can knock down a 3 or two if he's open enough. Douglas doesn't really help or hurt, he's just kind of there. It's hard to rotate other guys in when they don't bring anything to the table really."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,KidCunner,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:59:35 2015 UTC,"No I hear you. I'm by no means suggesting that Ajinca or Babbitt would have been our saviors. But those guys each started in wins against good teams during the year. They could have at least seen a few minutes each to rest Davis/Anderson/Asik (same goes for Douglas helping with the guards...really, the only Pels we should never see on the court under any circumstances are Jimmer and Withey, but I can be talked into Withey). I also don't like the idea of their reward for working hard and contributing what they can all year is for their coach to lose all faith in them as soon as he no longer needs them as they stand idly by and watch the starters and primary bench guys lose steam and blow a 20 point lead. That's not a way for people to buy into your system long-term."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,SoItGoes504,0,Fri Apr 24 21:26:57 2015 UTC,"This team has to be one of the least disciplined teams in the NBA   No surprise when your oldest player is 29 and your three major pieces have never seen the playoffs. The Mavs, Spurs, Grizz all have average ages older than our oldest guy."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,LieutenantKumar,11,Fri Apr 24 15:05:13 2015 UTC,Monty just said in the post game conference the team was supposed to foul. This is a lack of communication which is still on the coach.
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,ahungrybatman,3,Fri Apr 24 05:26:30 2015 UTC,Why didn't you guys just fowl immediately?  That's a dumb way to lose a game.
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,drunkenfaggot,2,Fri Apr 24 06:17:40 2015 UTC,"I tried to get to Curry in a hurry, but his shot release was just too fast."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,ahungrybatman,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:02:30 2015 UTC,Never hurry the Curry.
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,drunkenfaggot,4,Fri Apr 24 07:03:49 2015 UTC,"On top of Monty just not being the guy for the job, you then give him a team that is hard to work with.  You have 3 ball dominant guards, and then AD. Reke and Gordon need the ball to effective, and they're low IQ players who tend to make a mistake for every 2 points they give you. Gordon is too short to defend other SGs, and Tyreke can't defend if his life depended on it. And to make matters worse, you have 100 million tied up between these two guys.  Then you have Asik, who sometimes is a force on defense, and on the boards. But he's a disaster on offense. He has to be the most blocked 7 footer of all time. Can't complete a simple putback. Half the time he leaves 5+ rebounds out there because he can't secure a goddamn ball. He literally can not catch a basketball.   So then the dilemma is, playing Ryan more minutes over Asik. Ryan  has no defense to speak of, but Asik has no offense to speak of. But then Ryan is inconsistent on offense, but then Asik is also inconsistent on defense. There's never a right answer there.  Then you have the bench, who tonight was amazing, but most games fails to help at all.   And then there's AD, who for the most part does everything well, and is younger than everybody else. But he can't do it alone. The only other guy on the team who plays solid all around basketball is Jrue Holiday, but he's never healthy, which leads to having Tyreke run a professional offense, which he simply does not have the IQ to do.  Monty definitely has to go, but Dell Demps hasn't exactly assembled the smartest team either."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,KidCunner,3,Fri Apr 24 08:00:37 2015 UTC,He literally can not catch a basketball.     This makes me the most angry/upset about Asik. JUST GRAB THE DAMN BALL!
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,fuzzywallrus,2,Fri Apr 24 11:21:11 2015 UTC,Or just fucking jump. JUST JUMP for gods sake.
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,Levelupbuttercup,3,Fri Apr 24 13:40:40 2015 UTC,I really like Monty as a person.  Seems like a good guy.  But as a coach I just don't understand some of his decisions.  He doesn't call timeouts right.  The players didn't foul Curry??? why??  Monty should have went out there and tackled Curry himself.
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,drdrizzy13,5,Fri Apr 24 15:10:32 2015 UTC,"It was a choke by everyone. No single person besides maybe Ryno on offense stepped up. Monty was the biggest fuck up of all, though. Asik didn't see any of the 4th and half of OT, as GS got rebound after rebound. He never adjusted. He saw Kerr going small and thought he could outsmart him. He didn't stick to our advantage, and he should never coach another game for us again."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,Guyote_,2,Fri Apr 24 05:14:25 2015 UTC,No need to put a maybe by Ryno. Dude was killing it tonight and should've gotten more touches
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,DaggersKnuckles,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:18:08 2015 UTC,"I said ""maybe"" because his defense and rebounding were sorely lacking, whereas his offense was great."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,Guyote_,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:11:16 2015 UTC,"My bad, I read it as you saying nobody stepped up on offense, specifically, except for maybe Anderson. But even then, Ryan isn't out there to play defense. He did what was expected of him and that was to be a threat on offense so I think you can say he stepped up tonight."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,DaggersKnuckles,5,Fri Apr 24 08:28:45 2015 UTC,"(Warriors fan i come in peace) Did you guys see his post game interview? He knows he lost his job. I have always liked him, feel bad for the guy. But yes, he's not a great coach."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,IReallyLikeFootball,2,Fri Apr 24 05:25:10 2015 UTC,"He is a likeable guy, no question about it. I feel bad too. If he loses his head coach job here hopefully he can find work elsewhere in the nba."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Fri Apr 24 05:29:54 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to hire him as a assistant for the Dubs. I honestly feel really bad, almost all the Pelicans players and coaches were in near tears."
NOLAPelicans,33oisw,CorporateKnowledge,2,Fri Apr 24 05:32:17 2015 UTC,"I just watched it and honestly thats just how Monty is. This situation sucks though. We were up 20 and I dont think any of us were giving Monty and credit but as soon as we collapse he gets the blame. He does deserve blame, but he honestly cant win here. If we win it's in spite of Monty's incompetence but if we lose it's his incompetence that killed us."

I was so frustrated that GS kept missing but had multiple put back dunks that looked unchallenged. Very disappointing game but hopefully they take away a ton from this.

NOLAPelicans,33ombn,Guyote_,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:19:28 2015 UTC,"This is  the one thing I actually kind of understand. Ryan Anderson's defense in the middle is just as good / bad as Omer's. So you're not losing anything there. But you get a 3 ball and a guy who can get hot. But when you're up by 20 why are you not putting Omer in for the rebounds (hopefully, mabey, if the moon and stars align) I like Anderson starting at center until we can get a big man that is not afraid to you know.... Jump and dunk every now and then."
NOLAPelicans,33ombn,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Fri Apr 24 13:33:04 2015 UTC,Do you really think Anderson is just as good as Asik on D? I strongly disagree.
NOLAPelicans,33ombn,Good_NewsEveryone,-1,Fri Apr 24 14:37:14 2015 UTC,Good is not the right word. Both are bad. One can sometimes  give you offense. Thats all
NOLAPelicans,33ombn,Good_NewsEveryone,3,Fri Apr 24 14:43:08 2015 UTC,Just going to have to disagree on this. Asik has been the backbone of our defense for the majority of the season.

Frankly, I like to think LA is stealing all the water so they won't have any. But truthfully, its just all the salt drying up shit out there. Fuck'em. Right in their Golden State. And can we clear something up? Why does a team called Golden State wear yellow as a color? Are they too stupid to wear gold??? ITS RIGHT THERE YOU MORONS!!!! I digress:  Its back to the Blender and I am Flapping mad!!! Mad cause I was told the Pels didn't belong. I was told Pels couldn't hang. I was told it should be the Thunder not the Brow. I was told Curry was the MVP. Well, the only Curry I saw was a towel sucking bench guy who let his bench do all the work. Meanwhile Brow Almighty was giving 40 minutes of work, with no help from the refs, putting it all on the line. IT PISSES ME OFF!!! IT MAKES ME MAD!!! AND NOW IMA SEE RED!!!!!!  Time to ""Bloody up the Blender"" Flock and show California what a real sports town can do. Sure, we don't sell out every game, but its cause unlike Oakland there are actually other things to do in our city.  But when it comes to loudness. To passion. To fans who will air fuck your brain, AINT NO FLOCK BETTER THAN MY FLOCK.  This game is about US  Its about the Flock flapping at once and turning Warriors into Smoothies. Its about the Nest rocking as Davis is dunking. Its about every wing, in unison flapping until the buzzer. SO I HEREBY CHALLENGE ALL FLOCK. Even those who do not hear/see my challenge!
