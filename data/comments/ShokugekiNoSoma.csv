ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,RandomFreakout,5,Sun Jul 19 01:22:00 2015 UTC,They have to use Eizan or we wont get Mimasaka.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,Nintentohtori,2,Sun Jul 19 07:24:13 2015 UTC,they skipped an arc? I must've missed that....
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,JoeyJojos_Wacky_Trip,2,Sun Jul 19 14:35:38 2015 UTC,The arc where Soma travels back home and goes up against the Karaage shop in the train station.  The anime skipped it and is going straight to the Autumn Elections.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,Pit107,4,Mon Jul 20 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, that one. That seems like something that could be an OVA/Special episode perhaps because it's not entirely necessary for the story to progress. But it was an enjoyable arc, that I would like to see if possible"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,JoeyJojos_Wacky_Trip,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like they could probably shoehorn him into the anime without using the plot from the arc they skipped. He still has to try to recruit Soma, after all, and his reasoning for that could just be that Soma's a big up-and-comer."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,ASCIt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:33 2015 UTC,He has a role in the schematics of the Autumn elections
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,ayunooby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:54 2015 UTC,He probably won't be aggressive towards Soma though. Since Soma didn't ruin one of Eizan's businesses.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dsk9q,ag487,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:31 2015 UTC,But maybe he'll still Spoilers after reading the reports on what he's done since entering Totsuki. And because Soma's answer won't change he'll try and target him.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,kurosaki004,8,Sat Jul 18 10:11:42 2015 UTC,Even the manga so far hasn't mentioned anything about Soma's mother. I guess the manga would be very close to ending if the author decides to reveal Yukihira's family mystery.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,Falco_Lau,5,Sat Jul 18 10:20:17 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about this earlier today as well.  My thoughts are that Jouichiro was nick named ""The Demon"" during his stay at Totsuki. I think that he met this mysterious Yukihira towards the end of his senior year and that caused him to change his style of cooking to a more gentle not so demon like cooking. That may have also caused his down fall in a Shokugeki which made him unable to finish, but allowed him to start up his restaurant.   We can see that Soma has learned 90% of this cooking from his father. Soma cooking as always had a gentle side. Maybe not to the extreme as Megumi, but it isn't at cut throat as others.   This can also be referenced back when Soma first got to Totsuki and Jouichiro wanted to tell him he needs to find a women to cook for to make him a better chef. Maybe that is hinting towards Yukihira and how she influenced Jouichiro.   Also I will recognize that we haven't really heard much of Erina's mother, so they may be the same person. I also want to point out the picture that Erina had at the start of this episode. She was relatively young it in. I don't know the actual ages, but her and Soma are in the same grade, hince being close in age. So, we can assume that picture was taken after Soma was born. You can chalk that being Jouichiro visiting an old friend, old friend being Erina grand father, or visiting his daughter. I am hoping for old friend.  Honestly I would be crushed if that happened, because i am 100% behind the Soma x Erina ship.  We really won't know until either Jouichiro and Erina run into each other(I personally can't wait for this) or we learn more about Soma's past.   EDIT: Wait... Soma has a scar? Can I get a reference for that? Cause I completely missed it."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,frohawk09,4,Sat Jul 18 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"I've always thought he left Totsuki after losing to Dojima for control of the First Seat, then traveled the world for a way to surpass him. When Soma was born, that was probably when he disappeared from the front lines."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,YukihiraSoma,4,Sat Jul 18 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"It might be that something happened to Soma's mother, either at birth or with a couple years, since there's no indication he knows his mother."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,DrShocker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. We havent really heard Soma talk about his mother at all. So something had to have happened when he was born or shortly after.  I feel like it couldn't be that she died, because there is no guilt or agression from his father that usually accompanied postpartum events like that."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,frohawk09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"Soma knows his mother, there's a family picture, you just can't see his mother's face."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,Boupe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:20:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, you're right.  Maybe the writer is just waiting to decide what his mother looks like/ what her role is, or maybe he's just lazy?"

ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,338388,2,Sat Jul 18 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"Iirc I read somewhere that at some point in jouichiro's world tour, he worked as a chef for nakiri, which is why erina knows him (and admires his cooking)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,ZerozakiIshiki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"Technically, his nickname wasn't 'demon', but 'shura'. Shura is one of the six realms in Buddhism. Wikipedia says it usually gets called the Asura realm in English. The demigods in this realm are motivated by jealousy and envy, and their lives are generally depicted as a constant struggle.  I can see why they chose not to bother getting into all that in the translation (I hardly claim to have any real understanding of the concept myself) but it does fit the character a little better than demon."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,RedRaptorZ,3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with that theory that Yukihira and Jouichiro met at or though Totsuki. Yukihira could of been a part of the top ten or common but well respected talented student or a fan of his cooking.  I really agree with frohawk09 view of Yukihira toning down Jouichiro's style since they're having a really strong romantic interest which may have caused Jouichiro to not graduate due to losing Shokugeki's and adding on to that... Jouichiro traveled the world to leaned more about cooking and himself with or without Yukihira by his side.  Which leads to 2 options. When Soma's was soon to be born, the traveling stop, Jouichiro takes up Yukihira name to go into hiding and focus more on his new family and created the restaurant.  Or it could of be tragic story in where bad stuff happened and it was Yukihira or Jouichiro's dream was to create a restaurant that looks like any other food place in the town but was know for their quality and taste and possibly named in her honor.  I also believe that Jouichiro is the only chef to make a dish to test to 110% satisfy Erina's palate that goes beyond her knowledge of food in where she looks up to him as an idol in the cooking world. I can't wait when the connection is made between between Jouichiro, Soma, and Erina. As many of you guy expect, she might start falling for Soma at that point and also try Soma's nightmare experiments, hehe"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,goldenhearted,3,Sat Jul 18 20:41:32 2015 UTC,">Was she also the origin of Soma's scar?  In the latest arc in the manga, there was a flashback of Soma and his dad Spoilers"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,erosa63,2,Sun Jul 19 04:46:57 2015 UTC,"Wait, have we met Erina's mom yet?..."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,Falco_Lau,6,Sat Jul 18 11:07:38 2015 UTC,"No, either. I even notice some people suspect Soma and Erina were siblings but I think this theory is going too far."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,DrShocker,2,Sat Jul 18 11:24:27 2015 UTC,"I think something was mentioned about her mother in the manga, but I might be thinking of her cousin."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,solarwings,2,Sat Jul 18 17:12:01 2015 UTC,I think the only time Erina's mother was mentioned was during her introduction episode where it's said that Erina rejected her mother's milk
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,YukihiraSoma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:11:47 2015 UTC,Spoiler shows up as a judge later on.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,ToFurkie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:12:18 2015 UTC,Gin's minimal familiarity with the name suggests that she might not have been a student or at the very least not a member of the Polar Star.  Soma's scar is most likely a knife accident and a dramatic flair to the character though it's possible a story might develop behind it.  He probably never wonders about his mom because she may have passed away early in his life/disappeared(?) (sometime after he gets the scar).
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,frohawk09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:25:04 2015 UTC,Its an anime. Of course something that small and hard to notice is going to have a huge impact. Haha
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dq3o2,ToFurkie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's sort of why I added that the mother's departure happened after the scar (refer to chapter 1 for confirmation).

So, that's his strategy. As I though, selling outside his spot is forbidden, but giving the food for free is not. He understands the need to advertise his product well.  What is this? Alice actually listening to what someone says? Amazing. Also Ryou is just resigned to his lot in life isn't he?  I though it was weird that Souma just given up on mapo tofu after Erina's verdict instead of trying to improve it. Glad he went back to that."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3dprbm,WilliamTuft,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:15:10 2015 UTC,I think it's possible they turn that short arc into an OVA. At least I hope they don't let it go to waste.

If you have problem browsing this site, try this mirror. - This week's Weekly Shonen Jump has been released earlier thanks to Marine Day, a Japanese national holiday.      Summary of this chapter:     Soma and Nao quickly become friends because they are birds of a feather, you know.   Team Soma has been giving visitors free samples of hujiao bing at night. Inspired by some visitors' feedback on day one night, he used the dough and pork for hujiao bing to make noodles similar to dan zai noodles (another popular snack in Taiwan). This new noodle dish helps increase Team Soma's sales on day two.   Criticized by Hayama, Alice realized she should make food that makes visitors happy instead of playing with technology. (In the past Kurokiba spoiled Alice rotten.)   Soma realized his mapo tofu was limited by the the style of Restaurant Yukihira and he needs to make a more impressive dish to beat Kuga. Inspired by the moon, he decided to develop new mapo tofu.       Edit: Add a mirror."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3dhk5j,Daishomaru,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"One thing that you should keep note of is that Soma's noodles are handmade.  Why is this important, you ask?  In reality, handmade Taiwanese/Chinese noodles takes YEARS of training, and you have to have extraordinary hand-eye coordination to pull it off, especially noting Soma's technique on how he made it.  It's not a very easy thing to pull off (Just to give you how hard it is, GORDON RAMSEY HIMSELF couldn't do it in real life.  It's really that hard in real life to get the perfect hand eye coordination).  But if one can do handmade noodles, you're guaranteed to get noticed in real life, because handmade noodles, aside from being cool to look at (I spent hours one time staring at a chef doing this work, it's that mesmerising), also has a much better texture than machine made noodles.  Also, Soma Szechuan Vs Kuga Szechuan?    Theory:  While I still believe Kuga's own downfall will be caused by his own Szechuan cooking, I believe Soma will take advantage of Kuga by making a milder but more savory Mapo Tofu compared to Kuga.  That's the only option Soma really has to be honest."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dhk5j,Dogwithrabiez,2,Fri Jul 17 20:35:12 2015 UTC,"Man, you're fast on the uptake. I'm seriously starting to regret not taking my Chinese classes seriously now.  That being said though, looks like he's making soba noodle soup of some sort, and is using a kiri. Noodle soup is pretty amazing with hujiao bing...  Wonder what the threesome are up to now, besides arguing a lot. I see they've only made 20k so far, and it's causing a lot of distress."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3dhk5j,Noobie-I-Am,2,Thu Jul 16 09:47:13 2015 UTC,This week's release is faster because the Weekly Shonen Jump has been released earlier this week. You can check my comment for details.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,victoryahead,21,Tue Jul 14 16:06:57 2015 UTC,They do attend general cooking classes and  college style lectures. But the school also seems to focus more on hands on experiences such as the training camp and the stagiaire period.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,Blademaster247,15,Tue Jul 14 16:34:06 2015 UTC,showing them sitting in a class is boring so that all gets skipped
ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,Forikorder,5,Wed Jul 15 02:27:32 2015 UTC,"Same as in every manga - school is boring so you don't get to see it, except if it happens to be important for the overall plot. Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga, so that's what is shown in the panels mostly. We actually do see a bit of school in one of the recent chapters, Soma even remarks that he and Erina often meet in classes lately."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,KHlover,6,Wed Jul 15 08:56:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the middle shcool division is more focused on teaching them the theoretical side of cooking. Once they get to the high school division its more about how they can use what they've learned in a real world environment and how they can grow and learn on thier own. They won't be in school forever and they'll need the ability to learn and adapt in a real high stakes environment to succeed after graduation.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,TanithArmoured,2,Wed Jul 15 03:59:32 2015 UTC,"I would assume that as they are at such a prestigious school, they are already expected to be able to cook at a level similar to that of a high-class restaurant, therefore require no schooling, and Totsuki is put in place simply to find the best in an already capable group. The manga always seems to promote each students' creativity, so they must value individual evolving rather than teaching a mass group the same recipe/methods, therefore rendering classes unnecessary."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,Rnorris22,2,Tue Jul 14 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"They are shown taking normal non-cooking classes, but the nature of the story leads it to focus more on cooking and less of the misc. stuff."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3d9mse,solarwings,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"While it's true that they do attending classes as showed randomly, and very briefly, I found it quite weird that Souma didn't learn anything at all from those classes, which were supposed to be taught be very great chefs.  Chapelle-sensei should be masterful in French cuisine, a level that much, much higher than Shinomiya. He appeared once to teach ""Boeuf Bourguignon"", then just disappeared. If Souma and the gang really ""attend"" the classes, he shouldn't be so foreign to French cooking techniques and full course process until the Stagiaire Arc.  But as we saw, all of Souma's and others' improvements were from battling and struggling with non-class activities. I think the school doesn't get the attention it deserves. Instead of all those hellish training camps and festivals, some dispute in the class itself would be interesting enough. However, the author seems like he put the ""major characters"" too far ahead of the others no classmate could ever matter in this manga anymore."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,mystry08,8,Sat Jul 11 16:16:51 2015 UTC,I feel like Soma's strategy involves pulling customers from other areas but that in itself should be super risky next to Kuga.   I also wonder if it's illegal to sell dishes during hours that customers are generally supposed to go home?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,fatmatt75,16,Sat Jul 11 17:15:17 2015 UTC,Maybe he isn't selling them in the after hours but is instead giving them away in order to increase his customer base?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,Daishomaru,6,Sat Jul 11 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"Noting how Kuga's aide said that Soma is selling noodles...  Japanese cuisine does have a lot of basis in Chinese cuisine.  Chinese and Japanese noodles are connected in history.  the Japanese noodle came from Chinese Buddhists monks who brought noodles, tea, and shoyu (soy sauce) from China to Japan during the Tang Dynasty.  Naturally, all three of these ingredients became integrated and essential to the world of Japanese Culture.  Japanese Ramen noodles were descended from Chinese Lamian noodles.    Naturally, the taste of Chinese and Japanese foods are very interchangeable.  It's a reason why Chinese food is one of the best selling foreign cuisine in Japan.    I thought this was a particularly interesting move by Soma to add noodles to his menu, considering Japanese noodle origins in Chinese cuisine"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,Ultimate_Broseph,4,Sat Jul 11 21:28:55 2015 UTC,That would be really smart!
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,TanithArmoured,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"That was my first guess, give the people free food as they are all leaving and reap the rewards in the next day"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,LuBru,5,Sat Jul 11 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"I think in conjunction with giving away free samples, I thought it was interesting that Souma is introducing a new dish on the second day.  Looking back, Souma has a habit of rehashing old ideas in new ways. For example, the omelette souffle and his dad's vegan ramen in his curry omurice or his pike rice dish with the soy milk poured over it was like what he did with the sauce and nori bento.  I think part of the answer will be that Souma is building 'anticipation' like he did with the nori bento and the pike rice with soy milk sauce. Not only is he giving away free samples to his grow his base but he's also advertising ""hey, each day I've got a new food item. Come check out to see what it'll be!""   This not only serves as advertisement but encourages repeat customers to come again and bring along friends to try it out and see what the new item will be. I imagine many people will not come to Kuga's chinese cuisine club day after day because once they've had it, they have other shops to try. But with Souma's cart, you drop by, pick up an item, and eat it on your way to your next destination. This is similar to what Souma and Arato had to do together in making food not only fast but convenient for rushed customers.  I think part of the explanation will also involve 'cultivating a fanbase/regulars' like what the smelly-witch Nao is doing.   This is the perfect sort of strategy to crescendo on the final day when Souma can topple Kuga and his chinese research society's food. I suspect Kuga will realize Souma's strategy early on but since Kuga has been stuck teaching his disciples how to replicate dishes on a perfect and mass scale - something like that takes time and training which Kuga clearly can't reproduce even once he figures out Souma's plan. He can't deviate from his menu as easily as Souma who's team consists of two people and both are experienced chefs. Kuga has to deal with a club and ensuring the quality is consistent which he can't mid-festival."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,Daishomaru,7,Sun Jul 12 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"this is my observation notes and Wild Mass Guessing today people.  Enjoy!  I kind of saw Soma using the cart's mobility but selling  noodles....  It makes a lot of sense.  Japanese Noodles and Chinese noodles do have a lot in common after all.  During the height of the Tang Dynasty, Japan and China traded with each other a lot.  The advent of Japanese noodles was said to have came from Chinese Buddhist monks, who brought along noodles, tea leaves and shoyu (Soy sauce).  Naturally, all three ingredients became the basis for a lot of Japanese cuisine and ceremonies.  Ramen itself is based of the Chinese dish lamian.    Recently in Japan, as far as I know, Chinese people opened so called ""lamian shops"" which is like Ramen, but to show the Chinese ethnic side to the flavor.  It is a currently rising trend in Japan for Chinese people living there making a few bucks off people.  Naturally, Soma, being a commoner, this would be not only ideal, but beneficial to him.  However, I know that despite Soma making his way up, Kuga will eventually probably have their sales go DOWN, because it's a bit of Economics involved.    And I still think that Kuga's downfall will be his own Szechuan cooking.  If I was a chef at a food festival in Japan and I had to make a profit, and you give me the theme Chinese, Szechuan would be the LAST choice I'd pick for a menu a Chinese menu.  And the reason is that most Japanese people don't have the spiciness tolerance of Szechuan cooking as the people of Szechuan province themselves.  Hell, even most mainland Chinese people themselves can't handle Szechuan cooking!    While yeah, I would certainly gain profits, and there will be a steady stream of people coming to my place, I suspect that Kuga will eventually make a peak profit and then fall down, because the restaurant will have its customers going out to try other food places, because that's what you do at food stalls: you go to a stand, buy food, eat, go to another place, eat, rinse and repeat.  Soma is going to MOST DEFINITELY take advantage of that peak and fall moment.   Now I know you are probably wondering why I said that ""Kuga will peak despite getting more customers than yesterday"":  Kuga had to close because of problems with his inventory.  Naturally the people who want to try his food yesterday would come and say, anybody who liked Kuga's food, but I think that eventually, at some point would cause some peak and fall.  EDIT: Fixed some grammer, changed some wording because I mixed up some foods."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,mystry08,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"Kuga will eventually probably have their sales go DOWN, because it's a bit of Economics involved.    Definitely. But I'm a bit worried about Soma's win condition. Does he just have to outsell Kuga for a single day? And if so, how will Soma have enough inventory to even pass Kuga?    And I still think that Kuga's downfall will be his own Szechuan cooking.   I generally agree. Maybe not a complete downfall but it's a limitation of sorts. I'm also confused as to why intense Szechuan hotness would be enjoyed so heavily in a Japanese food festival. I know for a lot of people, the sweat and intense flavor profile of such hot food leaves them exhausted. Spicy food is also not a very friendly option, as it tends to upset stomachs and aggravate acid reflux. Kuga's alienated young children and older people completely with such cooking."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,Daishomaru,7,Sun Jul 12 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"I think Soma's goal right now is to get up to the point where Kuga would definitely see him as a worthwhile threat so that way Soma can get the shokugeki.   I generally agree. Maybe not a complete downfall but it's a limitation of sorts.   Well, it's definitely for SURE going to backfire on Kuga at one point or another.  I know they will add more ways to show Kuga's flaws, but knowing Szechuan cooking, it's definitely a very big factor that will get Kuga to fall at least enough for Soma to catch up to him   I'm also confused as to why intense Szechuan hotness would be enjoyed so heavily in a Japanese food festival.   It's a food festival.  People want to try food, but food festivals like these give people the opportunity to try genuine Chinese cuisine.  People are natural born macochists, after all.  We find a way to eat things that are never meant to be eaten, such as potatoes, nutmeg, and rhubarb.  And while Japan enjoys Mapo Tofu ever since the famous chef Chen Kenmin (Father of Chen Kenichi, the Iron Chef Chinese) brought Szechuan Cooking to the world view, people get curious because they want to know the ""real"" flavor of Szechuan Chinese cooking due to the fact that most Szechuan chefs who serve their food have to ""numb"" the taste, losing its flavor.  So naturally, going to Kuga essentially gives you the ""full"" flavor that you would normally never get until you make  a trip to China.  It's kind of like the same thing like the ""British Curry War"" that is happening right now in England.  The Indian population of Britain, the biggest minority in the country claims that ""British Curry is so soft because they add milk, killing the subtleness of indian spices used to add in curry"" so they end up opening businesses in Britain to show ""the real essence of curry"".  The British Curry makers (The guys who make Curry for the British people) tell the Indian population right back that ""Indian people make the curry too spicy, so the British population can't enjoy it, the milk may kill some of the flavor to the curry spice, but it's a fine line because you can still taste curry"".  The British common population, curious about which curry is ""true"" in essence, will end up going to the Indian curry shops ran by Indian people to see what their curry is like.  Of course, a lot of British people will say ""yeah, this is how curry was meant to be.""  Famous chefs such as Gordon Ramsey and Heston Blumenthal in real life say it themselves that ""True Indian curry really opened their eyes on how the curry they served was meant to be"".  However, other British people that can't handle spiciness admit that while they like British Curry better, eating Indian Curry with all the spice still gave them an impression.  It's sort of like the same thing with Mapo Tofu in Japan.  There will definitely be a lot of people who will then look for the genuine taste of Chinese style mapo tofu and eat it while others will still like the ""numbed"" Japanese mapo tofu, but admit that Chinese Mapo tofu opened to how complex it is.  You also have to keep in mind about Japanese history.  Aside from the Isolationist period of the Tokugawa clan and the Late Taisho-Early Showa era, Japan has always been a curious country.  In the early histories of Japan, they traded with China a lot.  In the Meiji Era, the Japanese maintained contact with Britain and got curry spices and such, adding and changing Japanese food forever.  Even today, many Japanese people go to France, an already hectic business due to how elitist the cooking community there is JUST FOR LOCAL PEOPLE (Shinomiya's past just shows how RACIST it can get as well) and how hard the jobs are to find, because Japanese people are naturally curious.  Japan probably produce probably some of the biggest curious gourmets, other than France and America.    So yeah, despite the Szechuan cooking not being in the Japanese tastebuds, it makes a lot of sense on why people would come to Kuga to enjoy the food."

She's even concerned for Souma of all people - she really softened up without even noticing.   Also, she got 2nd place in the hardest area even though she only takes people with reservations and not focusing on profits.... that's Erina for you I guess.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,KHlover,0,Mon Jul 13 22:02:44 2015 UTC,So day 2 just passed by and Souma's rank went up without ever showing what he did that day.  Are the mangaka going to keep us in the dark about what he's doing till the last day of the festival?  Though that point Erina made about how Souma would need a bundle of pine tickets to try anything at her restaurant just reminded me of how unrealistic and asspullish it would be if Souma beat Kuga in sales: He sells cheap street foods while Kuga sells expensive gourmet Chinese cuisine. There's a huge difference in both the quantity and monetary value of the sales.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,thelazyreader2015,0,Mon Jul 13 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"Who said Soma would end up ahead in raw sales though? Kuga's shop will most likely end up ahead in sales, but construction, ingredients, energy etc. will all eat into his profit margins. Soma has a smaller tiny stall, thus much lower operating costs. He may pull ahead of Kuga there."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,TotalEconomist,0,Tue Jul 14 07:51:45 2015 UTC,Nope. Like I said the high price of Kuga's dishes compensate for his costs. Like Erina's stall people going to his pavilion probably have to fork out 500 plum tickets per meal or so compared to 1 for a bun from Souma's cart.  So more customers x more money per customer equals gigantic lead in revenues for Kuga.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cx7i4,thelazyreader2015,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"While I do understand the unlikelihood of Soma passing Kuga in profit, why do you insist of missing the basic economic concept of profit?

ShokugekiNoSoma,3cvfdx,felipegbq,6,Sat Jul 11 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"Well for starters the anime is currently on Chapter 34-ish more or less a few chapters.  As for your second question, I would say the anime is doing pretty well adapting to the manga since it goes roughly around 2 manga chapters per episode. If you're really impatient like me then you could read the manga chapters and each chapter comes around Friday-Sunday?   Otherwise you can just wait for the anime episodes."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cvfdx,ProBeastCupcake,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"In the last few episodes I think it covered about 3-4 chapters, skipping some pages and such."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cvfdx,tsuchinokolove,4,Sat Jul 11 11:11:51 2015 UTC,"The anime just covered chapter 33. And if you ask me the manga is better than the anime.   The anime isn't bad, but it really can't compare to the manga. The mangas artwork is on a really high level and the anime can't quite compare to that + that the manga has more content to provide you since the anime usually skips less important parts or just barely includes it in SOME cases. In my opinion you should read the manga, if you don't prefer anime over mangas.  I've read the manga 2 times and it really is amazing. But I still follow the anime every week since this is one of my favorite series I've ever encountered. So start from scratch if you don't find it a bother, it's a completely different experience IMO."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cvfdx,imsparkly,3,Sat Jul 11 02:46:27 2015 UTC,"You have to admit though, they are doing a pretty good job with the anime.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first heard the announcement of an anime, but it's not that bad.  The manga is definitely better though.  I've noticed they leave out small bits of dialogue every now and then as well."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cvfdx,CkPhX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:41:16 2015 UTC,"I watched all the way up to Eggs before Dawn and then started reading the manga and I was not lost at all.  The Anime Adaptation is VERY faithful to the source material and going back to read the chapters I missed cause I watched the show, showed me that I barely missed anything at all."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cvfdx,LegatoSkyheart,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"I would still recommend to start from scratch if you liked it - you might notice little things that pop up later. Also, the anime will be skipping the next mini-arc (which involves one of the most delicious snack foods IMO) so it's definitely worth reading that section."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,Mreaper300,5,Sat Jul 11 07:00:41 2015 UTC,"Well leaving aside that I don't know how successful SnS is in Japan (which is the real measure of whether this will continue).  SnS is really easy to have potential filler for. Easier probably than a lot of shonen jump series. New foods and cook-offs are easy to find, and the anime company could get their own chef consultant to bring out more content. The characters are in a fairly standard school life setting, and the drama and tension between arcs doesn't have enormous carry over. Character evolution is slow for the most part, and the cast is so large that there's plenty of content you can create.  I mean, do you remember the last time Soma was in a classroom with an exam or a test? I don't. There we go, filler episode.  Marui only cooked one dish to the audience. Give him an episode.  Etc etc.  So in short: the series is perfect for filler, and filler has potential to be just as good as the rest."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,abittman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:29:07 2015 UTC,"I actually kinda hope they don't have filler and just give the authors until next spring to put out more content. But I'd be okay with a couple OVAs in between. And I hope they don't finish the Autumn Election this season. I think it would rush that arc way too much, I think if they just go through the preliminaries this season and tease the finals as a cliffhanger for next season it will be way better."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,ag487,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well that's from the pov of a manga reader. If you only watch the anime episodes it's an absolute pain to wait that long, and the impact in S2 won't be as strong when you watch it because you lost all that build-up. So I completely disagree."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,DarkExorcist,2,Wed Jul 15 07:09:06 2015 UTC,Are any new episodes coming out soon? Or it it probably going to be a year or two if at all?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,CaptainBeer_,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"Shokugeki is getting a total of 24 episodes this season. This past Friday we didn't have one because the studio had a scheduled break to promote the Blu-Ray, introduce a new voice actor for the upcoming anime and overall recap the series. This Friday's episode should have a new opening and ending as well, so perhaps they needed more time to prep for that as well"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,ag487,2,Mon Jul 13 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Shokugeki no Soma is ranked 15th in the top selling manga's for the first half of 2015. The anime is likely to boost this so we can maybe expect around rank 10 at the end of the year. So Shokugeki is very popular in Japan. However if they end with the autumn election they will be somewhere around chapter 100 of the current 126.   While Shokugeki is popular it is not on the level of Naruto and One piece popular which are 2 of the longest running shows with filler episodes. While creating filler episodes is really easy like /u/Abittman said it isn't popular enough to turn into a long running show like Naruto, One Piece, Detective Connan etc.   So my guess would be that they will end at the end of the autumn election and thats it. Currently we're on chapter 126 and they will adapt roughly 100. If it sells well they got 2 options. Either they make a single cour (12 episodes) run which can be confirmed as early as the end of 2015. However it is likely that they will wait for enough source material to create another 2 cour running season which can take 2 years for the source material to be created."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,FailerQt,3,Sat Jul 11 17:04:38 2015 UTC,God I hope they don't end with the Autumn Elections. I rather it end with Spoilers
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,TotalEconomist,2,Sun Jul 12 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like they wouldn't want to burn through the material that fast. I'm not sure where they will stop, but doubt they will use up the first 100. Maybe they'll go up to 75-80ish, which leaves them enough material for another cour. And presumably, by next year, there will be enough material for 2 cours and more."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cw3i6,SShirodkarMD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:00:44 2015 UTC,I feel like they'll go through the single cour choice and just keep adding as source material keeps coming. Kind of like what they did with Saki. Hopefully the wait won't be as long as Saki...
ShokugekiNoSoma,3csuwq,fortevn,6,Fri Jul 10 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, Iron Chef. It was/is a really popular show (especially in America) and likely the basis for Shokugeki no Soma."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3csuwq,TotalEconomist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"Also, the tense scenes in Shokugeki no Soma have the Iron Chef music thing going on, which I thought was a nice touch."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3csuwq,Dogwithrabiez,-5,Sat Jul 11 01:31:55 2015 UTC,Still is really.  I've seen more people talk about Iron Chef Japan than they do with Iron Chef America.    Iron Chef Japan helped me appreciate Shokugeki No Soma more mostly because I'm able to spot things that nobody else unless they have cooking experience would notice.

It's probably one of the main reasons I love the manga and the anime. I should go back to rewatching some of that again.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3csuwq,ToFurkie,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:44:28 2015 UTC,"Iron Chef Japan, Best Only good Iron Chef show (ICA?  What's that?).  Also, Michiba for life.  Probably my favorite of the Original 7 Iron Chefs (Second would go to Sakai (another badass in his own right and used to be my favorite but nowadays, I still think Michiba is better if only because Michiba is just that badass), Third would be Chen, 4th Morimoto, 5th is Kobe, 6th is Nakamura and 7th is ishinabe), mostly because of how influential the dude was IRL in the real world.    I've been encouraging a lot of Shokugeki No Soma readers to watch this because Iron Chef Japan taught me many things about the cooking world.  If anything, Iron Chef helped me appreciate Shokugeki No soma more because I'm able to spot or notice things in Shokugeki No Soma that other people may not notice.    Now if you ask whether I like Iron Chef Japan better or Shokugeki, I'd say I like Iron Chef Japan better due to how political in the food world it got because of that show and how much influence it has on the cooking industry even to this day."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3csuwq,Daishomaru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:18 2015 UTC,What kind of things for you notice in the manga with your knowledge? Also how did ICJ affect the food industry?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3csuwq,GreenishApples,0,Fri Jul 10 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of examples.  One example is why everyone was shocked when Megumi used a goosefish in the Autumn Election arc.  Although Goosefish curry exists, Megumi preparing it was rather impressive because in Traditionalist Japanese cooking, most professional chefs usually learn to handle goosefish after years of training.  Most chefs wouldn't even give a goosefish to Megumi because goosefish is just too expensive (Mostly because of the liver, the liver costs 2/3rds of the fish alone).    Another example is that Shinomiya's backstory is actually very similar to the actual Franco Japan relationship dealing with actual forigners trying to get into the French food business, one of the most elite businesses of all time.  It is indeed VERY racist like that in real life, because everyone is trying to compete for apprenticeships in real life.  My theory on how Kuga will lose to Soma in the new Shokugeki No Soma chapters   is based off interviews from Chen Kenichi and my own experience with     Iron Chef Japan did expose a lot about the cooking world nobody in real life would notice, such as the Traditional Japanese and Neo-Japanese chef rivalries, the origins of how Sichuan cooking got into Japan, and the show is said to have introduced mayonnaise into Japanese cooking.  It also shown back-then revolutionary ideas such as vacuum cooking and basically exposed the side of cooking that nobody would ever see.  Also, it was the big granddaddy of cooking duels.  Iron Chef Japan was also cited to be the cause of a rise in interest with sushi in America, and in the world, the reason why Japanese food is rising to known prominence in the world cuisine.   So yeah, in real life, Iron Chef Japan is a VERY influential show"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3cshbu,rastogishubham,7,Fri Jul 10 12:19:28 2015 UTC,"Summary    Day one     Team Soma×Megumi and Team Hayama×Kurokiba×Alice, five of the best eight autumn election candidates, were in deficit and ranked last in their respective area on day one, which really pissed Erina off. What an irony LOL.   Soma used the rest ingredients to make hujiao bing as late-night snacks for him and his friends. After that, however, Megumi noticed the leftover ingredients were much less than what she had expected. Did Soma do something else secretly?  2th and 9th seat didn't appear on the ranking. Where were they? Soma secretly met and gave a mysterious person a key in the Polar Star Dorm at night. Who was that?    Day two     Team Soma×Megumi's ranking rose from #40 (last) to #35, and they seemed to add a noodle dish to their menu.     That Soma's face... He really looked like a cunning villain."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Ricardo1991,13,Sat Jul 4 21:52:21 2015 UTC,Megumi was so cute this chapter! I'm curious on what strategy Soma will employ to tip the scales in his favour. Clearly battling head to head with Kuga will not work out too well..  Random thoughts: Since he's going with a Taiwanese themed stall maybe he could do a bubble milk tea with his buns? The milk in the tea would help with the spiciness from Kuga's stall.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,hyroglyphixs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:22:52 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that he'll be a travelling stall to gather costumers from different parts of tootsuki
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,LastKill,2,Sun Jul 5 06:26:15 2015 UTC,"I doubt the stall is allowed to move around, since there is this strict of a reservation system. Also, It would be chaotic as hell if every stall does that."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,DrShocker,2,Sat Jul 4 22:31:55 2015 UTC,What if he's going to the expensive area?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Finn_Tha_Hooman,10,Mon Jul 6 20:45:39 2015 UTC,"Here's my theory on how Soma will get out of this situation.  One thing that Soma has over Kuga's advantage is that Kuga has the Sichuan cooking style, which is a bit of an acquired taste due to the spiciness.  Soma's Taiwanese food has a milder flavor, and knowing the Japanese tongue, a milder flavor would suit the Japanese tongue, considering how ""Japanese Mapo tofu"" is considered less spicy than an actual Chinese Mapo tofu (Kuga's style) if I recall to fit the Japanese taste (Kind of like British Indian Curry).  Soma also has the distinct advantage of mobility.  He can always move around, advertising, and he can get many people's attention.  I do know that is another big favor for him.  The final advantage Soma has is the stall itself.  While going out to restaurants are fine and all, stalls have a certain charm to them, kind of like how in the training camp, he made his servings for omelettes for the people.  It has that flair to it.  Naturally, I suspect Megumi will play a key role in advertisement of the stall."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Daishomaru,2,Sun Jul 5 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"He's famous and good enough to not get decifit. What I wonder is how he would ""defeat"" Kuga. (If the author really plans it)  Because from my point of view a stall like this beating a restaurant like that in sales (total profit) is impossible. What Kuga got in day 1 already surpassed what that stall could produce in months."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,fortevn,2,Mon Jul 6 06:45:05 2015 UTC,"I can think of a few factors off the top of my head.  First of all, it is a food festival.  Most people would go to a store/shop/restarurant once and then try something different.  My hypothesis would be that they all go to Kuga's place or all the top people places and try all the food there once (Judging by the coupons they give to people) and then the next day they will go for the lower stall.  Soma would probably take advantage of that moment to get all the coupons he need.  Second is that Kuga already placed himself in a disadvantage by using Szechuan/Sichuan style cooking.  While Mapo Tofu is a popular food in Japan, Japanese Mapo Tofu is a lot lessened in flavor compared to Chinese Mapo Tofu, which is what Kuga specializes in.  to Quote Chen Kenichi from Iron Chef Japan, who is a Szechuan Chef, he says that during the show's run, his Szechuan-style cooking puts him in a slight disadvantage, so he always has to adjust the spiciness level to suit each of the tasters.  Japanese tastebuds are not as built for spiciness.  While others would probably try his Szechuan food, (Such as the unfortunate people who did not get to try Kuga's cooking or the people who didn't try it yesterday since they were at other places) Kuga would likely get somewhat fewer customers than than the first day because while Szechuan food is good, the guests would want to eat something else more fitting to their palette.  A third factor is that food stands/carts are on the rise a lot lately.  In Asian countries, food stalls, while seen as common food, are also seen as the festive and fun side of cooking.  With stalls, you can see the food being made, and seeing a young teenage boy (Soma) and a young teenage girl (Megumi) will have that charm factor.  When you see people cook, you tend to get curious.  That's why stalls usually show the men sweating away, cooking orders.  There's that charm in watching people work away.  I remember when I was a kid and some of my favorite food experiences was watching the chefs cook.  Nostalgia factor also comes into plahy in that regard.  Another thing I can add to this point is that in recent food trends, the concept of small food stalls are a rising trend amongst teenagers working to get to the food industry and college students.  There are two reasons for that.  One is that it is a lot easier to set up a stall and clean up shop when the day is over.  The second is say, if a famous person notices and trys their product and likes it, it will have 2 effects: One is that more people will come and eat at the stall more often, and 2 is that the recognition from the young chefs by famous people may get these young chefs up the food social pyramid, as a chef may come and investigate the student for possible apprenticeship.  My final point I would like to add to this is that the Japanese and Chinese have a romantic view of food stalls.  Quite a few food origins in Japanese cooking have been said to take from food stalls (Such as Wanko Soba) and the Kansai Region's (Especially Osaka) Merchant Culture of Japan (Home of the Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, and many other foods) take pride in their food stalls and foods, indeed there is a stereotype amongst Kansai and Osakan people that ""Kyotoites spend too much money on clothing, Osakans spend too much money on food"".  Many Chinese foods have also been spread due to the influences of food stalls, when merchants and explorers from Europe would go into the Chinese markets to refill on food and thus come back, writing about Chinese stalls.  So while Soma may have the disadvantage now, I can definitely see some windows Soma can use to make some money to make enough for Kuga to definitely notice.  Stalls are an important aspects in Chinese and Japanese cultures, and I have a feeling the stall will play an advantage to Soma, especially if he moves around while Megumi advertises."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Daishomaru,2,Mon Jul 6 08:10:00 2015 UTC,"While I agree on everything you said, I'd also like to share some of my arguements:   While it's true about Japanese tastebuds vs foreign food, someone at Kuga's level shouldn't be unaware of it. Any chef that specializes at one theme would know about ""people that doesn't like the food"" first hand and have to work on it intensely. Being in the E10 would mean Kuga already came over that part after countless battles with judges that don't particularly love spice. My point still stands because it's about the money, not food. Everyone needs to buy ingredients to cook, then sell the food and get sales. The more you buy, the more you cook and then the more you sell. I literally can't see Souma getting enough resources to make food that can gain bigger sales that Kuga. He can cook better food, he can attract more customers, but when he's out of stock, closed. That's it. Even if he has 1 million customers vs Kuga's 500,000, what could he do if he can only sell up to 400,000?"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,fortevn,3,Mon Jul 6 08:32:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I'd like to say a bit too.   While yes, Kuga is indeed an elite ten and is probably aware about the Japanese tastebuds, he wants to serve authentic Chinese.  If he claims he specializes in Chinese Cuisine but makes something like Sweet and Sour Pork, which, while is indeed Chinese, is more catered to say, Americans, Chinese Gourmets will look to Kuga as an idiot and somebody who only caters to the masses.  He can't do Japanese-catered Mapo Tofu to appeal to the masses because he's an elite ten.  When people go up to him, they expect genuine Mapo Tofu.  This is a reason why, for example, here in America where I live, there's a social cast amongst Chinese Restaurants:  one that serves catered food and one that serves Chinese Food.  And anybody who wants to enjoy Chinese will definitely go for the latter.  I know this because people. but especially food lovers, are natural masochists.  We literally evolved our own bodies to eat what other animals could not, such as potatoes and spices.  And true gourmets would literally train their own bodies to adjust their tastes to enjoy the authentic flavor of Chinese Szechuan cooking, even if it's too spicy for them, because that's what humans are.  These people would put away their expectations on Japanese Mapo Tofu to enjoy the hot sizzling spiciness of Chinese Mapo Tofu.   So there's a pride element that Kuga has to maintain himself that he can't serve Japanese-catered Mapo Tofu.  Also, Szechuan Chinese Chefs pride themselves on spicy food.  I remember a bit of a saying on Chinese food that if it isn't spicy, it's not Szechuan.  The Szechuan region prides themselves in spicy foods, and while Kuga may b able to cater to judges to control the spice levels, he can't do that with actual people.  As a chef that serves genuine Szechuan cooking, he can't adjust spiciness per plate.  And even if Kuga could, it seems that it would be against Kuga's pride to do so, especially as a Szechuan chef.  Keep in mind in the chapter when Kuga shows Soma his dish, he says it's not diner flavor the Japanese are used to.   So it's shown that Kuga not only can't serve Japanese-catered Chinese food, he does not want to because it would be limiting the flavor.  Keep in mind that Kuga said that he would accept the Shokugeki if Soma can beat him in cooking.  I'm pretty sure Soma has a backup plan in case his attempt fails, such as going to the lower areas to sell more food to advertise his food, but maybe he's trying to outdo Kuga in food liking.  While people may enjoy Kuga, they may only ""like it"" because it's authentic Szechuan while if the people eat Soma's food they may ""Love it"" and Soma would gain more popularity for Kuga himself to notice.   I am pretty sure Soma has a card up his sleeve and I do know that he is going to use it somehow."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Daishomaru,11,Mon Jul 6 09:32:21 2015 UTC,"Souma getting off to a bad start? Who could have guessed? Kuga has such an overwhelming advantage that I can't imagine any plausible way for Souma to breach it. He seems to have a plan, but still.  I'm interested in the top 3 stalls thing. I wonder what will be the significance of that."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Shlugo,3,Sun Jul 5 03:40:35 2015 UTC,Soma will mysteriously be a part of the top 3 stalls for his district along with Kuga. This will drive Kuga crazy and distract him from his own shop enough where Soma will be able to surpass him for the remainder of the festival.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,AsianMist91,5,Sun Jul 5 09:03:47 2015 UTC,"Is Soma only battling Kuga when he's open? I'd rather be open from early morning to late at night like what an actual food stall would do. Better yet, travel around Tootsuki! Their stall is mobile enough to do so, so it could be like a different location a day kind of thing, but we know that won't happen :("
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,chillitomatocakes,5,Sat Jul 4 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"No, I think Soma is doing what you saying. Guess we will find out next week"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,TotalEconomist,3,Sat Jul 4 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"That makes sense and it seems like what he's doing right now. Kuga's restaurant may have notoriety and reputation, but the area they're working on does actually mean they're limited to people who have heard of them and people who are just passing through. Not to mention, they closed pretty early and there will be people who will get bummed about that.  Soma seems to be roaming around as a vendor, meaning not only will he be able to cover a larger area selling his buns, but also he will be selling them to people at their most convenient. Plus, buns are small enough to carry and eat on hand while still being able to enjoy to take a walk. I wouldn't be surprised if Soma's pepper buns would reach even outside the Central District. Let's not forget, a festival isn't over until it's over."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Bragior,3,Sun Jul 5 03:44:29 2015 UTC,"Moving his stall might be a good idea, but I seriously doubt that Souma would do that. After making a point of choosing a place right in front of Kuga and choosing Chinese cuisine - basically throwing declaration of war right in his face - moving cart would be a tacit admission that he can't compete with Kuga head on.  Hell Kuga himself suggested doing that. Souma is much too proud to do something like that."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Shlugo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"He's fully aware that if he doesn't do something, he will hit the red and be expelled. So the strike at Kuga's ""back"" seems to be the tactical decision he must employ to win this (food) war."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Bragior,2,Sun Jul 5 17:30:27 2015 UTC,"Well, no matter what, it is impossible for a stall to win against a restaurant. Even if it's good and have a lot of customers, the ingredients will run out in a flash. In case both of them sold all the food, I doubt Souma could make a win (as he wants to beat Kuga in sales) at all.   Actually, as far the academy rules go Yukihira only need to get a bit of profit and he's safe. I don't mind he losing here, since it should be clear between his and the E10's power. Say, Erina is a great cook and I have a feeling she can beat Yukihira quite easily. And she's only 10th. Losing badly against Kuga is fine. Just put up some good fight and don't get expelled. (imagine how pissed Shinomiya would be at him if he does lol)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,fortevn,2,Mon Jul 6 06:40:25 2015 UTC,"I think what Soma is trying to do is utilize the mobility of his cart during the night to sell his buns.  Kuga already used his ingredients for the day so he can't sell any food during the night.  However, an extremely popular part of Taiwanese Cuisine is night markets, where stalls are set all over in the evening.  Soma is going to sell his food during the night and travel to the different sections, building a customer base and achieving his sales goal."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,WiiCat,4,Mon Jul 6 08:58:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pleasantly surprised that Souma didn't just pull a plot asspull by somehow rivaling the Chinese Food Society in sales.  I'll get downvoted for saying this, but he had this coming to him. He's been really lazy and sloppy with his preparations this arc. Look at Takumi and Isami, Ikumi and the Donburi club. Even they took the effort to recruit helpers and build a big stall and develop hype for their products though they're not even competing with the Elite 10.  Souma did nothing. He didn't really research Chinese food beyond some street dish he made with his dad in childhood, and he put zero thought into building a stall and getting helpers. If Megumi and Hyoujou hadn't come forward on their own initiative Souma would be alone, spreading a towel on the ground opposite Kuga's Chinese restaurant to sell his snacks.  There is a limit to having a cocky 'Don't give a crap' attitude. When a hot dog cart challenges a Michelin 3 star restaurant without even making any changes to their food, stall, presentation etc. this will be the obvious outcome."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,thelazyreader2015,3,Sun Jul 5 09:31:06 2015 UTC,"I kind of got that impression too but I don't think it was intentional. Pretty much every other story arc focused on the food preparation. I think this one is trying to be different and focus on the logistics and marketing aspects instead. I think that's why we didn't see much research and testing.  As for not seeking out helpers, I think that's just Souma's style. I'm pretty sure his dad's shop was run by him and his dad alone. Souma just seems like the type of guy who runs solo."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,916expat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:49:27 2015 UTC,"Souma's dad ran a small shop but he also cooked in large restaurants across the globe. The whole point of his time in Tootsuki is for Souma to broaden his horizons and recognize the need to learn other kinds of cooking and know more about the food industry.  For example more than a few times we've seen him acknowledge the need to alter his fast food recipes(like the beef stew) for a high class audience. He couldn't tell he needed a proper stall and helpers to take on Kuga?   Heck, look at the Aldini twins! They also run a small family eatery but they still recruited lots of helpers and built a big stall for the festival! Souma needs to understand and adapt instead of sticking to his 2-man diner routine all the time."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,thelazyreader2015,2,Mon Jul 6 13:59:28 2015 UTC,Isn't there also the problem about profit. Kuga has a restaurant which requires alot more upkeep the festival is about profit right. I bet it will come down to subtracting the huge cost of opening a place that big for kuga and Soma will win cuz his stall has no real cost to it
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,9o_o6,5,Sun Jul 5 08:34:37 2015 UTC,"Hah, sure. What's more profitable, the 3 star restaurant or the street cart standing outside it? If you're a chef and you want to be rich do you open a hot dog cart?  Souma's costs may be low, but his customer intake is negligible and he sells cheap street food. Kuga runs a massively profitable gourmet restaurant selling expensive high class dishes to wealthy clientele."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,thelazyreader2015,2,Sun Jul 5 09:32:36 2015 UTC,Just saying since I'm working in a 3 star restaurant. You will earn more money with a fast food restaurant. A 3 star Restaurant has such high costs it's not even funny.   An owner of a 3 star restaurant can be happy when he earns as much as he paid for the whole month. Of course shokugeki is fiction and not real life but please don't think that keeping a 3 star restaurant is lucrative.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,Turmkopf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"A successful 3 star restaurant will still be more successful than the average McD outlet. And certainly moreso than a hot dog cart.  And yes, this manga is in a universe where Hayama Akira was offered a salary of $1 million or such for his gourmet cooking skills back in the curry contest, so I imagine running a successful restaurant can be VERY lucrative for a top chef here."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,thelazyreader2015,0,Sun Jul 5 20:26:59 2015 UTC,lol this is a festival that last for under a month time. Kuga needs to serve a decent amount of people every day just to make profit. Suma might be making profit every single day depending on what he is going to do. You obviously have no clue what the business model of a restaurant and a hotdog stall have
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,9o_o6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:17:04 2015 UTC,I am sure Kuga will have no problem running a successful restaurant for one month. You don't even have common sense if you think a street cart is more profitable than a restaurant.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c54sv,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:38:52 2015 UTC,"He might possibly use Kuga's restaurant for seats as its closed before evening, it also serves as a landmark attraction to other districts if he does travel and advertise. Hence on the following day, the customers would seek Kuga's restaurant, and eventually find Soma. That is assuming Kuga does not shut off the doors to his restaurant"

ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Ricardo1991,15,Fri Jul 3 19:34:53 2015 UTC,Umm so... more than 600 students passed and each had to do 200 dishes. So that is a whooping 120000 dishes that tootsuki had in their hotel.  Is that amount really possible to have in a hotel?  Also i feel sorry for the dish washers who have to clean all of that...
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Banh,8,Sat Jul 4 00:28:55 2015 UTC,Don't forget the number of dishes of the people who didn't quite make it. That makes it over 120k dishes.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Bragior,5,Sat Jul 4 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"Consider the dish Alice served or even Erina. Those are pretty small dishes to fill a person ""in a buffet"". So I would divide that number by 3 (considering those people would eat at least 3 times), then I would consider the buffet lasted for about 4h (8am-12am) so let's say the total amount of people is then divided into four groups. That would be at least 10.000 people per hour, that is not considering that Erina and Alice had 100 plates more than everybody else and the people that didn't make it to 200. So yeah that would be one pretty massive hotel to say the least"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,rgp11,3,Sat Jul 4 03:40:12 2015 UTC,Well i can only imagine how many eggs each person ate...

ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,LegatoSkyheart,8,Sun Jul 5 17:48:39 2015 UTC,I'm finding I like Alice a lot more in the anime than I do in the manga. Is she acting any different? It's been a long time since I read these chapters.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Doublethree1,6,Fri Jul 3 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"I think the VA is spot on with Alice, which makes the character more alive."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,TotalEconomist,2,Sat Jul 4 00:08:59 2015 UTC,I do agree.  I feel there is a little more emotion?  or something with this Alice.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,angelbelle,6,Sat Jul 4 05:53:20 2015 UTC,"Well, this was quite a valuable experience for Souma: probably for the first time since coming to Tootsuki  he had to face his own inadequacy.  He almost failed simply because he made a rookie mistake."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Shlugo,0,Sat Jul 4 00:23:53 2015 UTC,Seemed kinda weird that they let him pass. Surely that soufflé does not qualify as a good/surprising buffet dish for the hotel.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Tomhap,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"The requirements for passing:  i. making a dish to with a surprise factor using eggs  ii. serve buffet style  iii. have 200 plates (this being the main factor for passing)  Souma passed the first condition, messed up the second and with his experience was able to make up for the 3rd. I see no reason why he shouldn't have been able to pass."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,JWT_88,0,Wed Jul 15 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"He passed the rules, but his dish isnt actually a dish they could serve in the buffet at the resort (the main point of the challenge)."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,Tomhap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"The main task was to create a breakfast dish, with eggs being the main ingredient, worthy of Tootsuki's fame. Buffet was the choosen format so that the school can gauge whether the student's creation was worthy of that prestige.  Serving 200 dishes is the most notable way to gauge for the assignment, for it shows that the student was able to create a worthy dish. Since Souma's dish couldn't retain it's shape and texture it was a huge handicap, as buffet items aren't necessarily eaten right away, so to make up for the disparity. Souma's used his experience to put on a show to attract people to reach that 200 passing mark.   Also there are buffets that having live cooking and serve to the customers, so in that sense Souma technically did serve a dish in a buffet format."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3c0yj9,JWT_88,5,Thu Jul 16 00:29:11 2015 UTC,"We get to experience Soma's side of every battle, but if you think about it, every student that fails has their heart broken and their carreer ended. Pretty messed up."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bza7d,Falco_Lau,17,Fri Jul 3 10:36:57 2015 UTC,"Summary:     Meals are paid by coupons only in the festival.   There are three prices of coupons: 500 yen, 1,000 yen, 10,000 yen.   Every evening, sales of each restaurant will be calculated and ranked, and the top 3 of each area will be announced. Food price level: main street 500-1,000 yen/serving, central 1,000-5,000 yen/serving, uptown 5,000+ yen/serving.   Price of Souma's hujiao bing: 500 yen/serving. Souma completely lost the sale on day one since Kuga's restaurant was overwhelmingly appealing.   Kuga closed his restaurant early on day one because their ingredients ran out very quickly.   In the end Souma seemed to have a plan, and some visitors noticed his cart disappeared in the evening."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bza7d,ag487,3,Fri Jul 3 11:52:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah even though Soma is not in the Elite Ten, if he saw the Autumn Election and has seen the recommendations Soma has gotten from alumni then he probably knows that Soma is Elite Ten material.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bvicj,338388,6,Thu Jul 2 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, the reason the anime and manga say it's different is because poêle does only really mean frying pan, or sautee pan. According to my Prentice Hall Dictionary of Culinary Arts that I'm using for the first goddamn time, the only definition of poêle exists in poêle chinoise(French for Wok), translated as Chinese Frying Pan, or poêler, ""French for to roast in a covered pot with butter and sometimes aromatic vegetables; the closest English translation of this very specific French culinary term is pot-roasting. See casserole braising.""  There's yet another term called poelon, which is ""a small uncovered French earthenware or metal casserole with a short, stubby handle and a pouring lip"".  So, what would be the technique then, exactly? Well, in classic French cuisine, one is expected to hold the fish down for the first seconds of sautee in order to cook the skin evenly and to prevent the fish from curling up, hence creating uneven heating. On the other hand, there's the technique of pan basting, which is pouring the fat atop the protein in the pan in order to brown and help cook it evenly.  I'm not entirely sure why they'd be surprised at either technique, as Japanese cuisine utilizes similar techniques, though their basting tends to be with a brush rather than a spoon."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bl5ss,ajmaghirang,2,Tue Jun 30 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"I think the buns might varying in flavor and/or spiciness to cater to the customer's taste versus cooking something one way that 'you will eat what I cook the way I cook it and like it!' which seems to be Kuga's deal/ideology.    It's a street vendor food from a small cart, which means he might be able to walk the line waiting for Kuga's restaurant so it's a snack that's light and can be eaten with one hand, something they could grab and hold in their hand while they wait in lie for Kuga's restaurant who is serving more of a meal.  This plays a few parts differently than the large stationary restaurant of Kuga, Souma cart can be mobile and go to the people that want his food in Kuga's line and snipe customers (he'll be okay if they try it but still stay in line for Kuga's super spicy food) since they tried his as well he'll get people he knows might try it since they're in line for spicy food.    His product is something unique, whimsical and fun if you will in comparison, they're going to order/eat Kuga's for a dish they know is going to be extremely spicy since they've had it before or heard about it and they've just tried Souma's.  If they're hungry for Kuga's food tasting Souma might make them want it more, they're already salivating.  Souma's product is different since it doesn't have the bleeding from your eyes spicy and the kicker... people might be talking about it when they walk into Kuga's or start comparing it to Kuga's food even though it's different from what they order in Kuga's which might get under his skin even if it's not a direct compare.    Souma is playing a different game, he's not playing the who can make the spiciest dish or the most profit, otherwise he'd have teamed with Alice to get a chemically designed/driven product out to the people or the 9th seat who is all about the money money money (like Himekawa from Beelzebub).  He (Souma) wants people to eat his food and decide 'This is good, I'm glad I tried it', and tell people it was good.  Kuga makes his food the way he wants and watches people come back for it or try it and even though it's very spicy they eat it due to bravado, gutso, or a glutton for the pain/feeling of eating really spicy food and 'surviving'.  What he doesn't try to achieve with his specialty is making people happy with his food or a memorable experience.  It's for his enjoyment not theirs.  He seems to me want impact and praise for the end results x thousands of people daily, y thousands in profit, their preference and opinions of food don't matter, Kuga makes and tells them what they want.  That is what I think Souma brings to some of the upper elites of the school, the reminder of the relationship between the chef and the customer."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bl5ss,RemnantX,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"He's going to need to draw attention to the stand first since it's being overshadowed by Kuga's in terms of shear size. He'll need to do something to take the crowd's attention like he did with the breakfast buffet challenge. However it looks like Kuga made a deal with the first seat so the real question is, how will Soma counter whatever that deal is?"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bl5ss,ag487,3,Tue Jun 30 04:25:24 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the deal had nothing to do with soma
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bl5ss,_uare,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:57:07 2015 UTC,"I feel that the deal has something to do with the current festival, but it was something that was planned long before Soma's challenge. And this deal could boost Kuga's stand and overshadow Soma's at the same time.   But we'll see what is what over the next few chapters. Trying to beat the eighth seat is going to be difficult, and he will at least come up with a new trick when Soma starts eating into his sales too much."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bl5ss,ag487,2,Tue Jun 30 13:13:09 2015 UTC,i think its a deal for shokugeki not about souma... if kuga meets certain quota tsukasa will agree for shokugeki for the 1st seat...cause at that leaf viewing thing he mention how hard it is to challenge guys above them...
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bl5ss,clafelallerizu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:55:47 2015 UTC,"The deal with the first seat seemed rather personal between them two and not Souma...but yeah to even gain attention from his little cart, I would think that he'd make Tadokoro go around and offer the buns to passing customers, but that's all I've got."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhnap,Forikorder,2,Mon Jun 29 09:44:48 2015 UTC,its only 4 chapters in and the chapters are monthly so its not much of a commitment either
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhnap,RemnantX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:01:38 2015 UTC,It's a spin off and at four chapters even if you don't like it there's the reasoning you have in your head afterwards when you look at the alumni and how they interact with each other.  It's like an origins story where he went from a good chef with a bad attitude to an exceptional chef who's a world class narcissist. cough Gordon Ramsey cough  Plus it's once a month.  Easy to fit into a schedule.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhmib,ofekme,2,Mon Jun 29 08:07:09 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly it was stated in one of the chapters on the basis of an example that if Souma were to beat Isshki  than he would take over his seat. The elite 10 are seated according to their cooking skill. Your idea makes little sense. If Souma had for example beaten Isshki who is 7th than this would imply he is a better cook than 8th, 9th and 10th seat already who could not beat the previous 7th seat. Why would he than be seated lower than them? The better you cook the more influence you have in Totsuki, that is one of that schools laws."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhmib,Kogutus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"with the shokugeki system it could just mean that seat 8 9 and 10 couldnt get the 7th seat to actually face them but the outsider managed to  kuga mentioned something about a promise and at the tea ceremony he mentioned that they were busy just trying to challenge the higher seats so i think just getting them to wager there seat is half the battle, it might be why Erina has been gobblinb up so many clubs trying to create enough assets to get someone to face her"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhmib,Forikorder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:45:52 2015 UTC,"That is a good hypothesis, it makes sense and seems quite possible. Well it probably will become clear sooner or later in the manga how things work."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhmib,Kogutus,-3,Thu Jul 2 11:41:55 2015 UTC,you are right but for that logic what happens if seat 10 beats seat 9 ?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bhmib,Kogutus,2,Mon Jun 29 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"Tenth becomes the new ninth but I cannot say what happens to the leftover 10th seat as it was not made clear in the manga. If an outsider gets a seat than he kicks the previous owner out untill that previous owner wins a seat back but as to what happens if one seat beats a higher one, that  I cannot answer."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Ricardo1991,40,Sat Jun 27 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"So, Souma put a tiny, independent Taiwanese food stall, right next to the giant Chinese one?  Trolling Level: World Politics.  Erina is right, those two look half dead before the festival even begun. Alice is really fired up this time. Well if it's those three, they'll dominate the main street area no problem. With Erina in Uptown Area and Souma in the Central Area they have no serious competition to face.  Speaking of Erina, it will be interesting to see how she compares to rest of E10. After all no one expects her to stay the tenth seat forever."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Shlugo,6,Sat Jun 27 23:46:59 2015 UTC,I can see her jumping up a seat but not alot. Considering the third years are extremely likely to graduate before Soma is gonna join the elite ten.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,FailerQt,6,Sat Jun 27 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, I think Soma has to get into the Elite Ten before they graduate so he can actually be recognised as one of the best and that he didn't get in just because there were clear seats."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,reggit_,3,Sun Jun 28 16:06:57 2015 UTC,I think that you are correct. Soma is going make more money than Kuga in the festival. And I think that will make him really angry so he will challenge Soma to a Shokugeki with a Chinese/Taiwanese theme. And Soma will have to be expelled or Kuga will have to give up the 8th seat! And we will see Soma take the 8th seat
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,aKaFinale,4,Sun Jun 28 19:24:08 2015 UTC,main street will be the alice group vs the aldini group vs the polar star dorm group (im pretty sure the polar star group was in the main street but could be wrong)

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,ag487,19,Tue Jun 30 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"Whoa, I just thought of some massive trolling potential. So there's already a small Taiwanese stand next to a large Chinese one. Consider this possibility:  -Kuga's deal requires the Chinese RS to reach some goal during the festival   -they are falling short due to Soma and Kuga laments to Soma  -Soma points out that since the cart belongs to the Chinese RS, his sales count as well  -Kuga meets his goal, heart melts, respects Soma, etc. (you know, the standard stuff when a character who seems like an asshole but has just had some childhood issues is defeated by the protagonist)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Shokugeki123,9,Sun Jun 28 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"...I didn't think of that, but that's totally plausible and how now I think it mind end up.   Also, I now just thought of a stipulation for a shokugeki in case Soma loses to Kuga: Soma is forced to join the Chinese RS. This way, Soma can further home the art of Chinese Cuisine (one of the big three cuisines with French and Turkish)."

I don't think we heard anything about Subaru, whom I think is the only Autumn Tournament Contestant we don't know about."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Tiresieas,3,Sun Jun 28 01:10:17 2015 UTC,I'm dissappointed that after 3 chapters of showing hardly any preparation or knowledge on Chinese food it looks like Souma is going to win this challenge due to a convenient memory of some magical recipe by his dad.  It looks like Kuga's caught on to what Souma's planning and is pulling some shady favour from the 1st Seat to crush him. Of course Souma will beat him in spite of that.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,thelazyreader2015,2,Sun Jun 28 12:29:16 2015 UTC,That's an over simplification of what Soma always does though. He is taking things he knows and then making new dishes using his knowledge from school.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Codydarkstalker,3,Sun Jun 28 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Early on in the series he just drew from his experience in his dad's restaurant but later on we saw him reconizing his shortcomings and doing research and practicing to master new recipes and cooking techniques.  Not so in this arc. He made very little effort towards understanding Chinese cuisine(summed up by 3 short conversations with Erina and Megumi) and his experiements with mapo tofu(Which, in his own words, just involved adding chillies) went nowhere. Ultimately he was saved only because he remembered what may turn out to be a winning recipe from his dad."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,thelazyreader2015,2,Sun Jun 28 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping it comes down to service. He is facing a bunch of mindless robots that can only make things in an identical manner. Maybe Soma edge will be adjusting the sauce to each persons taste, or providing some other service to customers. We saw with the karaage adventure that he knows how to sell a product people want and tap into the desires of diners. Also Megumi is great with service, maybe that will matter more here."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Ranzma,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"It translated as [peppered buns] but those look like Sen Jian Man Tou (meat buns that are steam/fried simultaneously, and seasoned with sesame and spring onion).   Its a very popular breakfast food you can buy off street vendors in Shanghai so I don't know about that Taiwanese bit being 100% accurate. Nonetheless, its extremely savory and filled with juice/soup from the meat when cooked right, so I can see how it can compete with Si chuan cuisine."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3bcpac,Hsrock,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:44:24 2015 UTC,"Shenjian mantou is an entirely different dish.  However, the dish itself does come from China, like the page 8, mentions that most Taiwanese foods have Chinese roots. The Hujiao Bing itself originated from the Fuzhou, in the Fujian Province of China. Taiwan has been a sort of melting pot for Chinese peoples, especially after PRC won the Civil War. It makes sense that it would mistakenly associated with Taiwan since a lot of Taiwanese cuisine adopted food from the Mainland. A considerable number of Taiwanese can trace their routes back to Fuijian (many fled to Taiwan after the fall of the Ming and the rise of the Manchu rule) being from Hakka and Hoklo peoples, subgroup of Han ethnicity, and is why Hokkien (""Taiwanese"") and Hakka are unofficial languages."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3b85sz,Shlugo,2,Sat Jun 27 05:37:37 2015 UTC,Funny how they try to make Erina and Alice encounter look dramatic and foreboding when in hindsight that's just their usual banter.  Alice's voice is more childish than expected. Then again she is really childish.   I love how they hammed up the effects of Erina's dish to amazing proportions. The animation and music makes the deliciousness leap off the screen. Really taking advantage of the medium.

It's confirmed Souma will make hujiao bing (black pepper cake/pie). It's a popular Taiwanese snack and here's the previous hypothesis I posted. His father once made it during a street festival in the local shopping district when Souma was still in first grade. (Btw Souma didn't have that scar on his eyebrow at that time.)   The Aldini Bros. will open a restaurant with their classmates in the main street area.   The first seat had made an unknown promise to Kuga before.   The Moon Banquet Festival didn't start until the end of this chapter."

She respects him as a cook and mentor, and he backs her up and exposes her latent potential.  Erina... Erina's already good. She thinks lowly of Soma because of his upbringing. Yet Soma's so adamant in making her believe that his cooking is good that once she finally admits it, she'll be in love.  That coupled with the fact that Soma is literally the spawn of the man her heart desires...."

In any romance manga, the main girl always turns out to be the one who's grown alongside the main character and also helped him to grow. So while Soma did tell Erina that in the beginning, I think she's more of a ""goal to reach"" in cooking, whereas Megumi is the one who's helping Soma to learn more and who he wants to help learn. I think we're gonna see development in this arc for Soma x Megumi since they're working together (heck, we already did three chapters ago!)"

ShokugekiNoSoma,3b1z69,Ricardo1991,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:49:42 2015 UTC,So it comes out twice a week?
ShokugekiNoSoma,3b1z69,ag487,5,Thu Jun 25 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"So what he means is that on Saturday we get the first translator group which is ReadManga Today. However now that ReadManga has entered the translating picture they only seem to care about increasing their own site traffic, so they rush their content and it is just filled with mis-translations and grammatical errors, most of which could have been fixed with proof-reading. Even though it's kind of bad you can still understand most of what's going on  But after that, generally on Monday, we get the Casanova Scans version. This version contains the most accurate translations for the manga, and if something didn't make sense with the version that came out on Saturday, it will make sense when you read the Casanova Scans version. Their translations very closely resemble the official Viz translations, while there are some differences it is mostly in sentence structure so their is practically no difference.   And the official Viz translation (that you have to pay to get) also comes out on Monday I believe."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3b1z69,solarwings,4,Thu Jun 25 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"The readmanga team seems to translate from the Chinese scans(which are very accurate in translating), however, 2ndhand translations are not so accurate as they are relying on turns of expression which already had been once translated into Chinese.  It sounds fine in Chinese(as the translation was Japanese->Chinese), but when rendered into English, it's just not as accurate(because Japanese->Chinese->English). Plus, their QC seem to be inconsistent...  So yeah, it's better to wait for Casanova/Viz"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3b1z69,ag487,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah if they are going from Japanese>Chinese>English there are going to be things lost in translation generally. I remember when another scan group tried to get Boku no Hero Academia out faster than the Fallen Angels group, and they went from Japanese>Spanish>English and it was just so awful that the hugely negative feedback from the community made them stop putting out their version of translations"

I ate it and I literally couldn't feel anything else. Actually I could, but everything (especially boiled chicken) tasted like shit. Water didn't help at all.  It's not even spicy, it's like covering my tongue with a chilling plastic condom that has tons of spikes on the inside."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3ao59m,fortevn,6,Mon Jun 22 10:18:35 2015 UTC,Hua jiao is meant to numb your tastebuds. That's the 'ma' part of the mala seasoning anws.  But i agree with you. Its ok if its large. But its tiny and sticks on the food which makes it hard to remove. Not to mention what it does to the tongue...
ShokugekiNoSoma,3ao59m,BaconCheezSandwich,2,Wed Jun 24 11:19:24 2015 UTC,"""Ma"" literally translates into ""Numb"", Mala meaning ""Numbing Spiciness"". Chinese cuisine uses heavy flavors for most of their dishes so it's not a problem most of the time.    Having grown up with it, You learn to ignore the spices, just shake it off on your plate, a little of it won't kill you. The trick is to not choke on it by breathing while swallowing, it could cause some serious suffocation/pain if it gets into the sensitive areas."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3ao59m,AlllRkSpN,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"I am a native chinese speaker. I do know that mala means numbing spiciness.  I mean there are just a few dishes that makes huajiao really hard to notice.    e.g:http://themalaproject.com/chengdu-challenge-14-xinjiang-cumin-lamb/   Lamb meat is dark in colour tone, so does huajiao. If you are really careful, fine. If you are not and you cant bear the taste of it, the very moment you feel a distinct ""crack"" while you are chewing you know you are a goner for sure.  Many restaurants outside of china believe the recipe for a good szechuan dish is well; lots of hua jiao. Believe me, i went to chengdu once and the difference is huge, way huge.  As for breathing while swallowing, i experienced it multiple times xD. Its insufferable.  Btw /u/Falco_Lau you are spot on.

Being that these can be made en masse beforehand and cooked/distributed very quickly and easily, I'm very much inclined to agree with you.  The strategy then, going off /u/FailerQt 's suggestion, would likely to be to poach customers off the long lines at Kuga's place-- If he has someone(Megumi?) handing them out while taking money, they don't even have to get out of line to pay for his stall.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3aiqgy,ayunooby,2,Sat Jun 20 22:41:29 2015 UTC,I figured it was a dumpling steamer base. He was probably planning on making dim sum to go along with customers who just finished eating from Kuga's store or those who are still waiting in line. This way he can leech them off.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3aiqgy,ProfBamboo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:44:51 2015 UTC,I believe it's those furnaces made specifically for Woks used in Chinese cooking. It looks similar to the ones I see in Chinese restaurants. The flames that it produces are larger than your ordinary stove. I believe its made like that to utilize the wok's thinness to deliver a cooked meal in minutes.

ShokugekiNoSoma,3afocg,John137,2,Sat Jun 20 02:58:14 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, they did get 3 chapters from the manga animated. So that's a really good pace compared to some other anime. The chapters animated this episode are 25,26, and 27."

ShokugekiNoSoma,3afocg,MobiusSeven,4,Sat Jun 20 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"The 3 judges unanimously voted for Shinomiya's dish instead of their dish so technically, they lost. It was his first ever lost in Tootsuki. He would accept losing so many time against his father but not on Tootsuki. It's a reality check on Souma.  He should have been expelled if not for Dojima's intrusion."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3afocg,Reikakou,2,Sat Jun 20 05:02:15 2015 UTC,I haven't read the manga but i expected him to lose. to think a teenager would out-cook one of the best chefs in France was pretty naive

ShokugekiNoSoma,3afocg,MaouriGremlin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:51:01 2015 UTC,I don't think the manga implies that he believes that he could ONLY lost to his dad but more that it's his first actual lost after arriving to Tootsuki
ShokugekiNoSoma,3afocg,JWT_88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:57:00 2015 UTC,"As someone who hasn't actually read the manga and went into this episode not knowing how the shokugeki would be resolved, I'm pretty happy with how this episode went! Because on the one hand there's no way Megumi and Soma would've beaten Shinomiya, but it's also pretty obvious that they don't get expelled... I was kinda worried about how they were gonna make it work, but the story didn't force anything impossible to happen"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3aei33,Ricardo1991,13,Fri Jun 19 13:50:07 2015 UTC,Gotta love Alice and Erina interactions and then Soma just calling them nakiri's.   Megumi is adorable as always and Soma being carefree is why I love his character so much.  Now correct me if I am wrong but the Chinese RS booth is indoors right?  If that is true I think Soma's open air stall/cart whatever you wanna call it is a good choice considering his budget. People will head towards the Chinese RS booth without question. However personally I have experienced that the smell coming from an open air stall can drag me away from my path to an indoor eating place.   This could be a legit way for Soma to beat the Chinese RS booth by using the smell that comes from his cooking to attract customers on their way to the Chinese RS booth. He can then use things he learned in the past like live cooking to capture the attention from customers and at the same time show his progress to us.  Him dragging customers away from the Chinese RS booth could be a way for Soma to earn the respect or wrath of Kuga and then challenge Kuga to a shokugeki or get challenged by Kuga to a shokugeki.  However if the Chinese RS booth is outdoors this kinda goes out of the door.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3aei33,FailerQt,4,Fri Jun 19 14:05:54 2015 UTC,"i dont think Kuga will ever challenge him, he knows that souma will definently challenge him so he has no reason to get aggressive  i wonder if souma is gonna have to find something he can use as a bet against the ""8th Seat"" or if risking expulsion would be enough for him"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3aei33,Forikorder,3,Sat Jun 20 06:25:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Souma will draw even with Kuga in the festival and thus not making the technical requirements for the Shokugeki, but he will earn Kuga's respect.   Honestly, I believe Eizan will be the current Elite Ten member that will lose to Soma. To me, Eizan is the true enemy to Soma, something Soma needs to beat before entering the 2nd year. Followed by Erina beating Soma to jump a spot of ahead of him. (I believe Soma and Erina will have plenty of Shokugekis over the course of the 2nd and 3rd year).   Kuga vs Soma will happen in Soma's 2nd year."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3aei33,TotalEconomist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:00:12 2015 UTC,"Considering Kuga is a member of the Elite Ten, even tying him could be seen as defeating him. Hard to say if Souma would earn his respect or piss him off by tying him, but Souma's stock would definitely rise in the eyes of the rest of the school. Either way, Kuga would likely accept/challenge Souma to a Shokugeki simply off of pride.   I think Souma will go through Kuga before he takes on Eizan. Eizan seems like he's set up to be a longer lasting antagonist. Maybe he'll take the 1st Seat once the 3rd years graduate leading to his inevitable showdown with Souma/Erina over who is Tootsuki's top chef."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3aei33,AsianMist91,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:00:33 2015 UTC,"That's also a possibility since it's seems Eizan is more of a true villain character.   I think out of all the current 2nd year Elite Ten, Isshiki is the most important"

That saying about spiciness in Chinese is “四川人不怕辣，湖南人辣不怕，贵州人怕不辣。”    Don't be so tsun when responding to ""Nakiris"", Erina.    So the final quiz: What is Souma's pot for? I guess it might be used to make hot pot or even malatang because malatang is highly customizable (ingredients, spiciness, flavor, etc.) and can be taken away."

Erina and Alice arguing over rich people problems and Souma casually calling them Nakiris was hilarious. At this point Erina seems to basically given up on trying not to be friends with Souma. Time for Nakiris Cooking Theory Corner!  Souma seems to have an idea... but as always it looks like a crazy one. Whatever he preprepared it'd better be good because I can't imagine how that tiny cart could possibly contend with Kuga's temple sized restaurant.

ShokugekiNoSoma,39vuqr,squidhouse,2,Mon Jun 15 05:34:08 2015 UTC,Would have maybe looked better if you chopped the onions more finely. In the manga you can see how finely Souma chopped his http://puu.sh/ipNpW/56ed5a6f42.jpg. Here's a video on how to do it easily https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGS067s0zo I think you really need the juices from the onion enzymes to really get inside the meat for it to do its job. However it's frustrating me I can't find any source for why onions tenderize meat.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39vuqr,GreenishApples,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:34:04 2015 UTC,I'll definitely do this next time! Ty.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39vuqr,atiphysics,2,Tue Jun 16 01:20:56 2015 UTC,the onions are not as finely chopped as they should be. Should be like 8 times smaller than those huge ass chunks.

I can't wait to see how the stand run by those two potential Elite 10 candidates fairs. And how the other potential candidates, Kurokiba, Alice and Akira , fair with their stand. That is going to be a very dangerous stand."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,ag487,11,Sun Jun 14 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"Great chapter, but I really wished we could've had a page or so on Nikumi beating Nao in a shokugeki..  BUT! I'm so happy Restaurant Tadokoro is back for business! It's a really interesting point that Soma directly mentioned Subaru.. maybe he will ask him for help? Ahh next chapter is going to be awesome!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,hyroglyphixs,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:31:46 2015 UTC,I'm assuming with the shot we got of Nikumi during the stagiare training.  They didn't want to spoil what change in Nikumi 's style with just some random shot of her beating Nao.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,TonyRimor,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:40:15 2015 UTC,That's true. It just shows how much Nikumi has grown since the election. Didn't she and Nao both get 86 points (I might be mistaken)?
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,hyroglyphixs,10,Tue Jun 16 23:28:25 2015 UTC,"Finally we see Kuga IV/Quattro with the typical face distortion from Yu-Gi-Oh series.    It's still unclear how Souma will deal with Kuga's powerful Sichuan cuisine. The manga has mentioned the Eight Culinary Cuisines of China which are shown on the map of China on this page. Being too specialized in Sichuan cuisine seems to be a weakness of Kuga, so I Wonder if Souma will look for culinary diversity in his food stand menu.    (Btw I'm a Cantonese and I'm curious whether Cantonese cuisine will appear in future chapters.)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Falco_Lau,4,Sun Jun 14 14:12:37 2015 UTC,Looks like that is what Souma will do.  He'll diversify his menu and take advantage of the other styles and flavors of the other Chinese cuisines and beat Kuga.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,SSJZoroDWolverine,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:02:13 2015 UTC,"My theory?  He makes something that alleviates spiciness.  You know like how milk makes spiciness go away?  He'll make something that does that, but also tastes really good.  So the folks at Kuga's place look across the street, and see ""Hey, something that will make my mouth not on fire""...And that will be Yukihira and Megumi's dish."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,GalacticCow,7,Tue Jun 16 04:27:54 2015 UTC,"With Alice's gastronomy background, Hayama's spice background and Kurokiba's intense cooking style they will probably make spicy food that's on par with kuga-senpai.   This will work out for soma and megumi if they can focus on relieving the spiciness of their customers. By having both costumers from kuga-senpai and Alice's stand come to him he has the potential to beat them each individually."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Ultimate_Broseph,2,Sun Jun 14 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"im guessing hell also use a spicy dish but mellow it in a way that you dont suffer so people can enjoy the same taste without the extreme pain  if he just becomes Kugas ""second course"" he doesnt ""win"" against him he needs to prevent people from actually going to his stall and only going to his in order to ""win"""
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Forikorder,20,Mon Jun 15 07:10:46 2015 UTC,"Megumi once again showing why she is the best girl.   Erina getting character development, and Hisoka subtely forcing Erina to help Yukihara.  I can feel that the Waifu wars are going to start soon!  Soma and Kuga confirmed as perverts by Erina.  Great chapter once again and I guess we're soon gonna jump into the main part of this manga. Which is the battle with the elite ten.   So I think Soma is gonna be crushed by Kuga. He will do extremely well compared to every other 1st year but compared to the elite ten he will be far behind.   I am glad that Erina is getting character development and that we're learning more about Kuga."

ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Shlugo,3,Sun Jun 14 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"Gee all those people coming to Don RS. I wonder what could be the reason? Boing Boing  Very wise of Souma to ask Erina for help. He's the only one who would even think of asking the God Tongue for help.  Props to Hisako for being a great wingman.  Erina must feel really confused right now. Not only does she keeps running into Souma but somehow ends up helping him. She didn't even notice when she got on such good terms with him.  Btw, I wonder what she'll prepare for the festival. We know relatively little about the specifics of her cooking after all.  It's awfully nice of Megumi to help Souma and I mean it but I feel it's such a loss for her. She'll never become a first class chef if she won't become more ambitious.  Lol Alice does whatever she wants. Hayama just got romped into her new plan. With those three working together they'll dominate the main street area."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Fr0sk,3,Sun Jun 14 21:07:39 2015 UTC,Hisako and Souma being all chummy. Even Erina is beginning to notice that they have that mutual respect towards each other. Granted Souma did regain Hisako's confidence so it's only natural for her to at least let Souma mingle with Erina.

ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,pejobear,3,Sun Jun 14 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"uhhh, but the first time Tadokoro Diner opened they got absolutely crushed by Shinomiya."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Tiresieas,5,Sun Jun 14 18:34:53 2015 UTC,Crushed but they didn't get expelled. What I'm pointing out is that whenever they're together good things happen.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Laxus_Dreyar_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:42:28 2015 UTC,"But the contest was deemed a tie, and even with Shinomiya's stagnation, he still was the first seat and still one of the best in French cuisine, and the Tadokoro Diner got a tie for its modified recette with that home-cooked sensation. They were expected to lose, given their opponent, but they still made a great dish. Now, both have improved and grown during the autumn election and their Stagaire, they should be an even stronger duo now, as they're both now Elite 10 candidates. They should give a tough fight against Kuga"
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,MeowMixDeluxe,3,Sun Jun 14 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"In a straight one on one cook-off they definitely should not win, unless Souma went through a super saiyan level upgrade during the Stagaire Period, but that doesn't mean they won't come up with a special way to win (just like how they beat Shinomiya.) I believe they will beat Kuga and put up a tough fight in the festival, but when it comes to the shokugeki there is no way Souma should win it. So basically I'm saying that even though Tadokoro Diner may get crushed in the quality of the cooking like with Shinomiya, they will win regardless using another strategy because lets be honest here, its a shounen manga."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Dogwithrabiez,2,Sun Jun 14 22:15:10 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Soma will create a dish that quenches the spiciness of Kuga's dish. So he'll take all the customers that already ate at Kuga's.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39svy1,Pizzvgod,2,Mon Jun 15 00:06:55 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that Souma will be countering Szechuan cuisine with Hunan style spice, else he's going to go the opposite route and go with the Shandong province cooking. One or the other, but more likely Hunan since they're putting such an emphasis on spiciness."

ShokugekiNoSoma,39p4ra,ag487,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah readmanga is usually out on Saturday, however their translations are kinda bad. Since it looks like they don't bother to proof read or English is not the translator's first language. But Casanova has great translation which are very close to the official Viz translations and they are usually out on Monday."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39p4ra,bunnnythor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:57:20 2015 UTC,"Casanova's translations are better than the Viz ones, official or no. The Viz translations are clunky and laborious, plus they over-localize by dropping many (but not all!) of the honorifics. I'm sorry, but the difference between ""Erina-sama"" and ""Miss Erina"" is just too vast for me to take the Viz translations seriously.  If you are reading manga for the first time and you are starting with Shokugeki no Soma -- I'm sorry, I mean ""Food Wars"" (gag) -- then the Viz translations will make it a little more accessible. But once you start reading more than one or two manga, the honorific system becomes second nature, and the attempts to localize are like fingernails on the blackboard.  So as far as the translations go, read the readManga version to get it quickest, read Viz to get the art prettiest, and read Casanova to get the meanings the closest."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39p4ra,Derp_of_the_West,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:54:11 2015 UTC,Odd. They're usually out by now. Anyone know what's the hold up?
ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,John137,2,Sat Jun 13 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"It is far more likely that Erina will be the 2nd seat and Soma the 1st. Megumi can be anywhere from 4th to 6-7th seat in my opinion.  By the end of the Manga the elite ten will probadly  look somewhat like this:   Soma Erina Takumi (after an immense growth, right now he is far behind.) Megumi Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Hisako.   and then 9-10 will probadly be filled with characters we don't know yet. to be honest 4-8th seat can go in a million ways and I still accept it. 1-3 are in my opinion kinda a giveaway."
ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,FailerQt,4,Sat Jun 13 11:56:06 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like Megumi will come around and end up as #1 seat
ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,whiiteout,5,Sat Jun 13 20:56:38 2015 UTC,that would be a really big twist in the story. Megumi is best girl so I wouldn't be to mad :)
ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,FailerQt,3,Sat Jun 13 21:48:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind that at all. Though I do hope she gains enough experience and developments soon because I do think she has the shots and claim to be on the top seat. I'm not sure about the current top's cooking style but the previous ones were all 'bold' and 'manly' styles. I'd like to see a 'soft' cuisine dominating the fiery environment of the school.

ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,_masterBrain_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"I don't.  I said that the 4th-8th seat can go in a million ways meaning that Akira might aswell be 4th,5th,6th or 7th seat. The only obvious seats are Soma and Erina being the 1st and 2nd. Takumi being 3rd seat is mainly because he considers Soma as his rival though currently he is behind in skills but he will most likely catch up."

ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,BalefireX,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:28:36 2015 UTC,Oops yeah I mean Hisako.   Also I said that the 4th-8th seat can go in a million ways. That means that Akira can be 4th and ryo 8th or alice 4th and megumi 8th.   Soma being 1st seat and Erina being 2nd seat is kinda obvious. Takumi being 3rd seat is mainly because early on in the manga he declared Soma as his rival.
ShokugekiNoSoma,39nscm,FailerQt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:49:53 2015 UTC,"well mizuhara was second seat and shinomiya was first, and the interaction between them in episode 11 of shinomiya kinda mocking mizuhara and mizuhara not being pleased with shinomiya somewhat resembles soma and erina, though they are still pretty different."

ShokugekiNoSoma,396bg3,CrackLawliet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:04:08 2015 UTC,I'm personally very excited to see what the Polar Star Dorm stand comes up with. Knowing Isshiki I'm sure he's going to let every member come up with dish on there own. I like this idea since I feel like he is using his Elite 10 to make the Polar Star stand to bring attention to first year students who would normally be overlooked.
ShokugekiNoSoma,38wkzh,SymmetricalL,6,Sun Jun 7 13:12:38 2015 UTC,"Erina and Souma facing off in a shokugeki is a given, but because we expect Souma to win, a lot of people are expecting that as either the climax or second biggest battle in the series. So your idea of having it a lot earlier seems pretty original.  While I like the idea of more slice of life Erina scenes and changing character, I don't see why her grandfather would send her to the Polar Star Dorm. If her grandfather wanted to teach her a lesson or even experience a different world, Polar Star Dorm is not a good example of the archetype desert or wasteland, if you will. It's not a place where Erina will grow - she would still be thousands of miles ahead in cooking to everyone except Souma - and it's not even that impoverished. Compared to her affluent-oujo-sama life, maybe, but it's still within Toutsuki and she would be revered by everyone. There is nothing special about Polar Star Dorm besides Souma's high school friendship; i.e. Polar Star Dorm doesn't shape or grow it's residents, it's residents' perseverance and talent defines Polar Star Dorm. To me it seems unnecessary for Erina to be sent there, and the timing seems too early. I really like how Erina and Megumi get along now, because Megumi has worked super hard and deserves it. That being said, I don't want to see Erina becoming chummy with all the students, like the Polar Star Dorm freshman, until they do something like Megumi to make themselves special.    About Erina suddenly dropping her bitch side because she wants Souma to give her Asura's number, I would say she is already becoming a lot more likeable these last few chapters. As stated in the chapter discussions, she has more or less accepted Souma in her high school life, and she is much less of a severe tsun. It would be cheap and boring if she spun 180 because of 1 event, where Souma isn't even taking an active part in her transformation. In your scenario, her change is motivated by guilt she has towards Souma because she is dere for Asura. She doesn't learn anything from cooking, Souma, the MC, doesn't do anything to affect her, her character just drops the ball because she wants to look better towards Asura. If this is all it takes to tear apart her character, then her character was probably shallow to begin with. Personally I have higher hopes.   Sorry if any of this sounded condemning, I was just trying to be critical and give my feelings based on the manga. I am a little bitter about how boring and one dimensional Nikumi is, so that is partly why I hope Erina doesn't become remotely similar."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38wkzh,Neugdae1,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:39:41 2015 UTC,"No need to be sorry, i posted it for people to freely give an opinion. While it is true that i kind of imagined this early, i think it probably would happen. Also, i believe what u have said that even tho polar star is not good ,it would still benefit her. She is the ojou type char. and obviously doesnt even know how to interact/socialize with people (she has Arato as her friend atm). If she gets sended to polar star, she will definitely change for the better. The atmosphere in polar star is very sociable and friendly, and while its true that megumi deserves the attention, wouldnt it be unfair to say that the others dont deserve it yet? I mean, most of em have gotten a pretty high score in that one contest(forgive me for forgetting its name), and has (if not that acceptable) proven their worth. I agree that its too early, but i kind of think that its possible to happen, if the author decides to develop her character and changing her behavior.  Haha, I certainly do not meant that her drop of bitch side is for that reason. Given erina's admiration for Asura, she will drown in guilt and embarrassment when she knows that soma is asura's offspring. Indeed she is likeable now and i like it (ง ͠° ل͜ °)ง . What i wanted to say is that, if by any chance that she would see asura and soma, and will know that they are father and son, it would actually help shapen up their relationship. About her cooking, i really haven't thought that much about it. As per say, she already has achieved perfection in that aspect, so forgive me for not thinking that far :[  At the earlier chaps, i was rooting for nikumi hard, she was so cute and hot. But, as we all know, all other girls that will fall for soma are just gonna get dumped in the end cause of erina anyway."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38wkzh,Neugdae1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"idk ... im of the belief that the only areas Erina is lacking are her social skills and exposure to exceptional chefs from small beginnings. She knows how to serve customers, she can handle cooking pressure/schedules, she is one of the best chefs in Toutsuki, so given the fact that Asura isn't at Yukihara, I think Erina being there would be pointless. It would be interesting purely in the sense we could development between Souma and Erina, but I don't see why her Grandfather would send her there for that. My 2 cents is as baseless as yours, but I think in the remaining first year, Erina is going to be prepped to move up in the Elite 10, and the story as a whole is going to focus on the Autumn Election finalists learning from the Elite 10."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38vea3,Scooshers,13,Sun Jun 7 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"For both the title of the series (食戟のソーマ) and the character name (幸平 創真), it's technically Sōma. The ""ō"" indicates that the vowel has a longer pronunciation.  When this is transliterated into English, translators either drop the short line (because of typesetting or to reduce any confusion or convenience etc.) or add a ""u"" to indicate the lengthened vowel.  In another similar case, some Japanese transliterations repeat the vowel e.g. Tōtsuki to Tootsuki. As you can see this would be very confusing to English readers without knowledge of how the Japanese language works (Toot-Su-Ki? Too-Tsu-Ki?). And to those readers who do know how Japanese works, they're confused because it's not obvious whether Tootsuki is pronounced ""Tou-Tsu-Ki"" or ""Toh-Oh-Tsu-Ki"".  Translations are pretty tough. Back to your original question, ""Soma"" and ""Souma"" are both accepted translations."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38rla9,Bachi-Trust,7,Sat Jun 6 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"The duck tasted very much like a general honey-mustard grilled duck sort of thing(not a bad thing at all), and the salsa verde accented the darker and gamier flavors of the duck pretty well. The shiso gave it an almost minty flavor and the yuzu gave it a good citrus touch to it without being overbearingly acidic or lemony. With the addition of spring onion and/or leek into the salsa verde, it gives the sauce a mild crunch and texture, which was nice. Overall, a pretty good dish.  Soma's kaki seed coating was pretty awesome, as it gave it a great crunch, and the toasty rice flavors of the coating gave a good contrast to the lighter cod. Utilizing olive oil instead of soybean oil turned out to be a good choice, as the dish was in trouble of tasting very one-note, with all the fried oil taste. The extra pepperiness and floral aromas from the olive oil really gave it an extra kick, though the pink peppercorns didn't come through quite as much as I'd hoped. If the mayo were made using a neutral oil, the dish would desperately be needing some sort of acid to counteract the heaviness of it all, I think.  Taste-wise, they were both about equivalent, and everyone who tasted it couldn't decide between the two. I'd give the technical edge to Aldini, though, because Soma went with novelty. Oil/oil/oil/oil/eggs/egg yolk doesn't make for a particularly interesting flavor combination, and grows heavy real quick. Maybe I just don't like mayonnaise enough, but I'm really not a big fan of mayo with fried foods."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38rla9,ToFurkie,7,Sat Jun 6 19:08:17 2015 UTC,So... you're saying it was a draw...

ShokugekiNoSoma,38rla9,lulzmort,7,Sat Jun 6 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"Haha, well... I graduated culinary school about 5 years ago and worked the line in a Michelin star restaurant. Never did get around to being a chef though."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38rla9,glass_table_girl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"Hey OP,  Not sure where you live (which will affect its availability), but did you consider getting actual, pre-made kusaya? I know that Aldini made his own on the fly in the episode, but I was wondering if using kusaya would affect the salsa verde's taste in a positive way, unlike improvised ones. (Not that I'm not knocking your skills.)   And regarding the mayo: Why the choice to make your own Japanese mayo rather than buy it? (Again, not knocking the decision, just wondering about the reasoning behind it. Might be the same as the kusaya, availability?)  But I also wanted to say that I appreciate you giving the instructions on how to do the recipe with duck. I was pretty disappointed to find that the manga recipe was just with chicken thighs, so thanks for that! I've never cooked duck, so when I attempt this dish, I will definitely use you as a guide, same as last time."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38rla9,autowikibot,4,Sat Jun 6 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"No offence taken! Ask as many questions as you want, I'm a bit of a food nerd and love educating people about food.  Uruka is different than Kusaya, AFAIK. Uruka is generally salted preserved sweetfish(Ayu fish) entrails, while Kusaya is whole grilled and fermented fish.  Kusaya, like the elusive surströmming of Sweden, is incredibly hard to get due to the reluctance of importers to take a risk on such a niche and stinky product. Still searching for both of those. Let me know if you can get them!  My admittedly narrow knowledge of it is that while they're both preserved foods, Uruka is under the shiokara category of preserved entrails while Kusaya is part of gyosho, since it uses fermented broth.  Here's where I learned more about them.  Including any sort of preserved or pickled fish is intended to increase its umami content, or the ""savory"" or ""delicious"" flavor. Any inherent fishiness is almost always masked in some way or form, with the most successful cooks and chefs being able to introduce the ingredient without the unpleasant odors and flavors showing through. Might be just that I'm not as good of a cook as Aldini is! Personally, though, I believe that while umami has its place, some things don't need it and are in fact reduced by its addition. If the point of the salsa verde is to produce a counterpoint to the rich, fatty duck, then it should keep that role with the clean acidity and bright flavors rather than trying to contest the stage with the duck. Think of it like the donburi shokugeki-- Nikumi lost because she paired heavy umami with heavy umami, while Soma had synergistic flavors that highlighted the others.  The reason I made my own mayo is that I like making everything from scratch. Soma made his from scratch, and so I decided to as well. As far as making things go, I'm trying to emulate the manga/anime as close as possible. No point in buying things if you can make it yourself and make it better and cheaper! Going from scratch also allows the introduction of more flavors in different steps(such as utilizing high quality olive oil and the pink peppercorn). Trying to mix pink peppercorn into pre-made mayo wouldn't work very well.  ...  Well crap, that turned into an essay. Sorry! I just get excited talking about food. >.>"

ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,warincon,8,Fri Jun 5 20:13:12 2015 UTC,The entire first part of the episode was just a barrel of laughs. Souma and Erina are like a walking comedic routine.  Shinomiya is a dick.  Sigh... can't Megumi walk down the stairs without having to be rescued by Souma?
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,Shlugo,3,Sat Jun 6 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"I guess her role is to make Souma a hero :P Without her he wouldn't get chance to be cool, like in the ending of the episode!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,BlaineWriter,3,Sat Jun 6 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, Megumi showed an amazing amount of character development this episode.   She seemingly grew confident without Souma and had the clever thinking of cooking that seemed to be influenced by him with the cauliflower. It was very genius of her using her wits to fix a situation she had from a disadvantage, which is exactly what Souma is unique and applauded for. The only difference was that Shinomiya is an ass.   You should respect Megumi more, rather than be disappointed in her."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,XXShigaXX,5,Sat Jun 6 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"Everything continues to be on point and very well paced and animated. Couldn't be happier with how it's going!  Still though...

ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,ProfBamboo,2,Fri Jun 5 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"part of me feels like this was handled even better than the manga, i'm surprised. the whole soma erina comedy bit and megumi's getting expelled and the declaration of the shokugeki. damn. but honestly last episode felt lackluster animation wise, this episode felt like j.c. staff had a fxcking field day."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,John137,2,Sat Jun 6 08:32:18 2015 UTC,I love this show!

RESTAURANT TADOKORO OPENS!!!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,ToFurkie,2,Sat Jun 6 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, it's much more dramatic in the anime. Even though I already read this part on the manga before I still get chills on the part where he asks Shinomiya for a shokugeki"
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,jns701,3,Mon Jun 8 07:23:41 2015 UTC,"Anime Only:  I was liking the Megumi development finally doing things by herself but then Soma had to rescue her again.. C'mon… how does anyone think she is the best girl when Soma is always rescuing her… Erina best girl so far, even though she went all Tsundere but that's ok…   Also was Soma surprise that guy didn't have a foodganism"
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,wardaniel9,3,Fri Jun 5 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"She didn't get into trouble by doing anything wrong though, Yukihira was essentially calling out the teacher's BS."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,wardaniel9,5,Fri Jun 5 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"The guy made it impossible for every student to pass even if they had all been more than competent. Then when someone shows exceptional adaptability despite being one of those short straws, he refuses to acknowledge it at all? He left no other option, if he's gonna force some of the students to fix a broken ingredient he has no business penalizing them for doing so.  Megumi wasn't at fault."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,immijimmi,-4,Fri Jun 5 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"Getting there fast enough to pick the right ingredient was part of the test. She fail because she's not fast or strong enough to pass the actual test that includes more than just cooking... and all am hearing from you is excuses for Megumi. so far Megumi has been a disappointment. Like I said she was getting good development in this episode but she did hesitate at the start (which caused her to fail in the end) and almost ask Soma for help which would have cause them both to fail. AND in the end Soma will have to rescue her like always, Megumi just riding on Soma's coat tail.... I don't dislike Megumi am just disappointed. Humming Erina = best girl (so far in the anime) she is the only female character that looks promising."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,wardaniel9,5,Sat Jun 6 00:15:45 2015 UTC,"Soma was right. It was completely Shino's fault that there were bad ingredients, and even supposing there were, she showed incredible initiative and forethought to be able to take a less than perfect ingredient and turn it into something spectacular. That kind of cook is the kind of cook any chef would want in their kitchen.  Shino's fault lies in his own insecurities and his own arrogance, which he took out on Megumi. He took out his own failures as a chef onto her, which is completely unreasonable and unfair."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,Dogwithrabiez,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:38:47 2015 UTC,You're going to manga territory but that pretty much sums it up.

He took out his own failures as a chef onto her,.......   you got all that from this episode.   bad ingredients was part of the test, you need to be strong and fast enough to get the best ingredients first. and changing the recipe made it something completely different. the test was not to do something initiative (even though that is a good quality in a chef). she fail because she hesitated that first instant and didn't follow directions. And now she needs to be rescue by Soma, AGAIN... it's getting old Megumi need to pull her own weight..."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,wardaniel9,2,Sat Jun 6 01:20:25 2015 UTC,"Just because someone's a chef or a teacher doesn't mean they're right. There are bad professors and bad tests, and bad chefs and bad tests. Shino's one of those bad professors who give out bad tests, simple as that. No one's fighting for ingredients(towels aside) in an actual kitchen, as you need to work as a team to get things done. Pushing and shoving and making their way to the front the fastest doesn't teach a single thing, putting Shino in the wrong, rather than Megumi."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,Dogwithrabiez,-6,Sat Jun 6 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"All am hearing is EXCUSES, and a test is just way to show how you preform under extreme situation. it's not base in real life situation. Or else in an English (or any other subject) test you would be able to use your phone because in real life you can just use your phone to look up stuff you don't know... the test was meant to remove the weak, Megumi is weak and got fired.. oh but wait once again Soma to the rescue... Megumi what a disappointment... can't even fight her own fights.."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38pko2,wardaniel9,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:59:29 2015 UTC,Um but Megumi rocked that dish. She only needed saving because of improvement. And plus i don't see any other way to lead up to the epicness we will witness next episode without everything happening exactly how it did.

In fact she'll start showing a glimpse of her potential in the upcoming Shokugeki. Megumi's character is one of slow but steady development. And she knows she needs to earn her place on her own merits and not use Soma as a crutch.  I never considered her best girl until way into the manga and even then it wasn't until I started watching the anime and was reminded of how she started out. That is when I truly started to appreciate Megumi."

I haven't give up on her, like I said I like the development she was getting but in the end she is being rescue by Soma again.. am looking forward to more of her development.. and it does take much to change my mind..   I never considered her best girl until way into the manga and even then it wasn't until I started watching the anime and was reminded of how she started out. That is when I truly started to appreciate Megumi.    Ok so am not wrong to say that base on the anime ONLY (which is what I am) she still has a long way to go to become the best girl... seriously that's why I put anime only before my comment.

ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,ag487,10,Fri Jun 5 16:02:53 2015 UTC,What I hope happens:   Souma inspires Autumn election cooks to also hold their own booths across from Kuga. Autumn election cooks' booths collectively rivals Kuga's. Results leads to restructuring of Elite ten council. Shokugeki between two members of the council for their seat (Fingers crossed for Erina vs. Kuga).
ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,anonditer,6,Fri Jun 5 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"In the last page, Erina says that if his stand fails, he can be expelled. His reaction is priceless."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,cazoix,4,Fri Jun 5 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"I liked that Souma is actually showing reactions like this, instead of just being the cocky, confident invincible hero type again."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,PreparedPie,2,Fri Jun 5 17:28:09 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that have been covered by the Autumn Election?  Though it does seem proper to show how good the elite ten really are in a competition like this.
ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,hyroglyphixs,2,Sat Jun 6 01:19:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. They hinted in 120 how the difference between the elite ten and the rest is immense so I think it'll be shown to its full extent this arc.
ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,Shlugo,2,Sat Jun 6 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"But seriously, by now he should have expected that. Tootsuki gives away expulsions like they were going out of style."

ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,thelazyreader2015,4,Fri Jun 5 16:47:29 2015 UTC,Erina finally looks like a main character now. She's getting more screentime here than she's ever had in a single chapter. I wonder if the authors decided to make her role more prominent after seeing how she placed 2nd in the popularity poll.
ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,SymmetricalL,3,Fri Jun 5 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt she hasn't really been a factor for most of the series. I'm honestly surprised she got 2nd place. I'm excited that Erina is going to start having a larger role, since I feel that in their third year the first seat will be a shokugeki between Soma and Erina.   But she better not take Soma away from best girl Megumi..."
ShokugekiNoSoma,38omsj,Shlugo,2,Fri Jun 5 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"I wasn't that surprised about Erina being number 2 despite her lack of screentime. Japan loves tsunderes. ;)  But yeah, I hope this isn't a one-time thing and Erina appears and interacts with the main cast more regularly from now on."

ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Ricardo1991,11,Sat May 30 11:40:10 2015 UTC,Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,oddonly,6,Sat May 30 14:44:41 2015 UTC,It's all for the plot
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,RioA,3,Sat May 30 16:54:40 2015 UTC,Really? I thought for sure it was a sports manga.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Bragior,3,Sun May 31 07:23:24 2015 UTC,Sometimes you really need that reminder
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,cheese0r,7,Mon Jun 1 11:18:49 2015 UTC,"Lol, Erina is like ""You know nothing Yukihira Souma"" which is something she keeps telling him all too often. And indeed the reality seems to slap Souma in the face this chapter as he finds out he's badly outmatched in both dish quality as well as resources. Souma is way over his head this time, so how will he get out of this dead end?  Houjou returns, nice to see that the manga dosen't just forget it's minor characters like that.  Now I can't wait for the next chapter. Souma better think fast if he wants to accomplish anything."

ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Bragior,3,Sun May 31 07:28:54 2015 UTC,I hope this is gonna be a showcase of the gap between the elite ten and the rest. I actually want Soma to lose here and realize that the elite ten are no joke and he needs to step up his game.   1 chapter ago the mangaka implied that the distance between him and the elite ten is big and this festival will most likely show why.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,FailerQt,4,Sun May 31 12:00:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I want Souma to get crushed, to show just how good the Elite Ten are.  If he just pulls out some method to win out of his ass it's going to be bad."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Shlugo,5,Sun May 31 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yep this would be a really good time to do the typical ''shounen MC gets crushed'' arc, and get his character development."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,FailerQt,1 point,Sun May 31 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"Likely he's going to do really well compared to everyone else, and at the end be pretty confident about what he's done, and realize the Elite Ten did five times as much or something.  I wonder if this arc will also make Erina more vulnerable as she tries to keep up with the rest of the Elite Ten and make her more humble/willing to work with Souma."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Dogwithrabiez,3,Mon Jun 1 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting the opposite - this arc will start Erina's climb to the top. By the time Souma gets on the Elite Ten level she'll have a far higher seat than the tenth one.  Remember, she's supposed to be the most talented student to ever attend Tootsuki, it would make no sense for her to be lagging behind."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Shlugo,2,Mon Jun 1 10:23:50 2015 UTC,Don't forget this minor character!
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Chat2Text,2,Sun May 31 02:04:55 2015 UTC,You know nothing Yukihira Souma   Souma = Jon Snow confirmed
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,jns701,13,Tue Jun 2 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"Erina is slowly getting less tsun for Soma and I love it.   So I guess Soma will need to form a team for this festival- Subaru, Takumi, Megumi, Nikumi, the Polar Star crew minus Isshiki are probably going to be on it. Hisako I think might join.   I like that idea because it fits the usual shounen progression of enemies from initial arcs joining for tougher arcs."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,YPaladin,2,Sat May 30 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"That's probably as safe bet. Subaru peeking in on the crew on the cover page probably is a hint that he is gonna join. As for Hisako, I agree that she'll be on the team since Erina is part of the Elite 10 stalls."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,hyroglyphixs,2,Sat May 30 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah that would be a good way for her to start ""walking alongside"" Erina instead of beside her, if she actually joined a faction fighting the Elite Ten rather than just working for Erina.  Plus it might emphasize the ""loneliness"" hints we've been getting for Erina's character arc, pushing her to change as her only friend starts making other bonds."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,YPaladin,0,Sat May 30 15:27:19 2015 UTC,Very good point on Erina. You could tell that she was a little disturbed when she saw that Hisako and Soma are now friends..   Hopefully soonish we'll get to see Erina in dere mode..
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,hyroglyphixs,1 point,Sat May 30 20:27:08 2015 UTC,If this happens and Soma ends up selling well it will probably be because he gave his team more freedom to creatively add their own to the dishes they make vs. the rigid perfection Kuga demands.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,BoredomHeights,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:23:38 2015 UTC,the only way i see him win is you get 5 dishes and each knows how to do it.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,ofekme,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"Takumi is very keen on being Souma's rival, no way is he going to work at his stall. And Hisako just went back to Erina, no way is she leaving her now.  I wonder if the answer will be as simple as just calling his friends for help at all.  Wouldn't be much of a challenge if that all it took."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,Shlugo,1 point,Sat May 30 21:43:11 2015 UTC,But it wouldn't be that simple- just because his friends are good cooks doesn't mean they can work together and synchronize like Kuga's can. The challenge would be Souma trying to get everyone to work together and become a leader.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,YPaladin,6,Sat May 30 22:19:23 2015 UTC,am now seriously hyped for next chapter

I love how Souma was put in his place there in the end. I was always annoyed at the swagger he had over how he was a professional who'd faced customers and hence wouldn't lose to anyone at Tootsuki.  Guess what Souma, most of the guys in Tootsuki are also professionals from families involved in the food business! And the Elite Ten all run successful businesses growing vegetables, consulting for restaurants etc. Your experience in a diner is actually pretty miniscule in comparison!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,37u1tj,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Sat May 30 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"I still wonder why soma didn't let tadokoro ride his motorcycle instead of using her bike from last chapter. Probably, no helmets?"

IRL experience tells me that having multiple vehicles is the best option most of the time, in the case where they need to split up, Soma won't have to worry about Tadokoro's mobility."

Last chapter, the big five (Souma, Alice, Ryu, Takumi, and Akira) were pretty fired up and a collaboration wouldn't sound dismissive to them. But I want the Polar Star tenants to get their spotlight again, after the Autumn contest and the brief panels from after the Stagiare week."

ShokugekiNoSoma,37rdjl,_Holz_,1 point,Fri May 29 22:55:10 2015 UTC,This was the best Episode yet.  Manga Spoilers
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,shauryab98,10,Fri May 29 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"something i got from a previous discussion from episode 1:   He said お粗末 (おそまつ, o-somatsu) after having ""killed"" the land sharks. It literally means something like ""It is low-grade"" or ""It is crude"", or more colloquially ""it is lousy"". In actuality, it is used as an expression of humility. For example, when one gives a gift and someone says ""thank you"" (arigatou gozaimasu), one often responds ""ieh, somatsu na mono desu"". That means ""No, it's just a low-grade/poor quality thing"". If someone gives one a compliment or thanks one in Japanese, one always negates that compliment. The translators rendered this ""o-somatsu"" as ""hoped you liked it"", which is totally wrong, and ignores the subtext. ""somatsu"" always implies that the thing being referred to is poorly made, making it particularly ironic in this case, when combined with Souma's smug face. The intrigue of the phrase also comes from the fact that the first part of ""somatsu"" sounds very similar similar to ""Souma"", which is his name. It could be compared to something like ""You've been Souma'd"".   If you want the full thread.:  http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/31cdax/spoilers_shokugeki_no_souma_episode_1_discussion/cq0egq6"
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,wardaniel9,2,Fri May 29 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"|You've been Souma'd  I lol'd  I do like the translation of ""It's low grade,"" because it truly represents Souma's character. He works at a diner, and has the best ingredients he can get his hands on.  I'm sure he'd been using that phrase long before the land sharks came around, or even before he started going to Tootsuki. But his long-standing passion to create elegant meals with cheaper ingredients and his wickedly clever creativity really make that the best catchphrase for him."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,kayneargand,3,Mon Jun 1 02:51:29 2015 UTC,"I like ""It wasn't much"" the most probably. Although, it doesn't help this situation that the anime translates it to something different every episode..."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,DrCoolGuy,3,Fri May 29 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"depends, ""inadequate service"" or ""it wasn't much"" is technically the literal translation, but, i mean it's the shortened version of a much longer phrase that people only say because their culture has ingrained it on them, and taking that phrase by its literal definition is like taking ""you're welcome"" or ""don't mention it"" by their literal meanings. ""it wasn't much"" is probably the best because it's something that still makes sense to say in english and still has the actual meaning of the phrase in it, but ""happy to serve"" or ""glad you liked it"" make more sense from a localization standpoint. translating it is like trying to translate ""itadakimasu"" or ""gochisou-sama""  they're just phrases you say for particular situations, yes they have literal meanings, but just like when you say, ""you're welcome"" or ""don't mention it"", it's hard to think up phrases like that in your language, you don't mean to say their literal meaning, but their colloquial meaning, though just like in any language, but a bit more prominent in japan, i think, there's a lot of weird overlap between colloquial and formal. like take refering to people as ""anata"" meaning ""you"", you use it with people really close to you to make it seem like you're close, but you also use it to be overly formal with people you don't like. it's confusing, but then there's always confusing cultural stuff to every language."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,John137,1 point,Sat May 30 07:38:56 2015 UTC,"This is substantially correct. ""It wasn't much"" or similar expressions are a nice compromise between the literally meaning of the Japanese phrase and natural English, but from a localization stand point, ""Hope you like it"" is a better fit, as a native English speaker confident in their dish but being nominally modest/polite/not overselling it would be more likely to say something like that.  Although frankly I'd be equally fine if they just went, ""Enjoy."" With translation, sometimes it's better not to get hung up on the literal meaning of words, and write for the character; if Souma was a native English speaker, ""Enjoy"" seems more like what he'd be likely to say when serving a dish, particularly given the type of restaurant he worked in."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,ZerozakiIshiki,1 point,Sat May 30 19:00:46 2015 UTC,It wasn't much.  Who the heck would say 'Inadequate service' after proudly serving a dish to a customer?
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Sat May 30 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"""Happy to serve"" comes from the Viz traslation right? So I would say that is the correct translation.  Not to say Casanova's ""it wasn't much"" is wrong because they have a solid translation too, just that ""official"" carries more weight to me.  Speed scan's ""inadequate service"" is flat out wrong though."
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,Tru_bearshark,7,Fri May 29 14:40:45 2015 UTC,It wasn't much sounds way cooler.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37q1jd,Tru_bearshark,1 point,Fri May 29 15:37:51 2015 UTC,"They are both great, ""happy to serve"" has a more professional air to it and "" it wasn't much"" plays to his confidence in his abilities.  I like them both but I personally give more weight to the viz translation."

ShokugekiNoSoma,37jscx,Vyleia,1 point,Thu May 28 03:26:44 2015 UTC,Not sure how you want it said without spoilers but my guess is since we've averaged about 2 chapters an episode probably around chapter 50 but that's in the middle of an arc so I'm not sure.
ShokugekiNoSoma,37jscx,Doublethree1,1 point,Thu May 28 03:41:52 2015 UTC,Okay. Just wanted to see how fast/slow it was compared to the manga (to see how much will be left basically after the anime ends).
ShokugekiNoSoma,37jscx,Doublethree1,1 point,Thu May 28 03:44:02 2015 UTC,I'd guess a decent amount will be left. The manga is currently at chapter 119 and has done an arc as well as start a second since the arc that would be during chapter 50.

The last one to join will probably be Hisako  who I think will grow a lot now that she's not holding herself back mentally. Takumi has yet to prove he can even surpass Subaru and all in all is probably the least skilled of the group. Subaru has to reinvent himself because the petty tricks he relied on till now won't cut it at this point. Megumi main problem is that she lack guts and her skills are still kinda sloppy but if she worked on those points she has a good chance to making the cut, if not now then in the future.  Of course there's still a chance that one of the students not in the current top 10 of first years could improve themselves but I'm not sure who's most likely to do that."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,Shlugo,5,Sat May 23 22:33:19 2015 UTC,I think your observation on Megumi is correct. I feel that her confidence is rising at a great rate. The latest chapter for example Spoilers

She's been getting a lot of focus latetly and if she's supposed to ""walk besides"" Erina like Souma said, it'll only make sense for her to become part of Elite 10.  Megumi... don't get me wrong she's a good cook for sure, but she lacks the sheer brilliance that being in Elite 10 implies. This might change in the future but I'm not sure."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,lulzmort,4,Sun May 24 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"I think that is who is gonna join, but now the question is what seat will each hold?"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,AsianMist91,5,Sat May 23 23:20:34 2015 UTC,"For the first years I think Erina will move up to the 5th Seat, Akira to the 6th, Soma to the 7th, Alice to the 8th, Ryo to the 9th, and Takumi to the 10th.  Right now I think Erina is an unreachable goal for the first years and I don't think she'll have major problems until their 3rd year so she'll take the vacant 5th seat. After all of the remaining hopefuls are evaluated I think Akira's victory in the Autumn Election will propel him over Soma for the 6th seat. Assuming the Campus Festival that is coming up is a new sort of challenge that is open to the public, I think that Soma will shine and propel his stock over the other first years making him worthy of the 7th seat. In that same festival I believe we'll see another Alice and Ryo showdown but with Alice just barely edging out Ryo giving Alice and Ryo the 8th and 9th seats respectively. And I think Takumi will raise his stock drastically in the Festival, if it is for the public as his restaurant is a restaurant of the masses, and he'll put himself further in front of other first years allowing him to just slightly edge out the other first years for the 10th seat."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,Neugdae1,6,Sun May 24 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"That honestly makes a lot of sense, I agree the Erika is going to be above all of her peers in term of seat until 3rd where I believe near the end Erika will be 1st and soma 2nd, then after hearing that Erika's tragic past and being condemd to narikira household he will challenged the Dean to a shougeki and win the family's head seat"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,TheRandomNPC,2,Sun May 24 00:13:17 2015 UTC,And her hand in marriage.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,treestero,2,Tue May 26 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"I was rereading Shokugeki no Soma, and I thought there was something a little ominous about Chef Doujima warning Akira in page 8 of chapter 104. Ignoring the fact that the next 6 months will also affect the first years' placements, I unfortunately think it's possible that Akira isn't the guaranteed 2nd best first year. I liked your reasoning for all of the students though!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,chillitomatocakes,4,Thu Jun 4 01:16:23 2015 UTC,I wish I could say Aldini but another of the current 2nd year student could always end up as an elite 10 when they get to 3rd year. They could be worse then Erina but better then the other current 1st years
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,DONGAAA,1 point,Sun May 24 02:35:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it's tough. I'm sure there are other very formidable 2nd years that have yet to be featured. Unlike the ones that challenge Soma to Shokugekies
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,chillitomatocakes,5,Sun May 24 03:27:45 2015 UTC,Guys they are called the jewel generation for a reason so probably they will start kicking some people out of the elite ten before the school year end
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,Bragior,3,Sun May 24 13:46:05 2015 UTC,"I can see Erina taking first seat LATER ON since she does have God's Tongue on her side. Also, I think the main reason why she hasn't advanced up the top ten at the moment is because the second years don't really wanna bother with her and are focusing on taking out the higher seats. I mean, third years would not look at you if you lost to a measly first year. Also, it'd be a great way to end the manga for Soma to beat her and make her accept him.  All in all, I do think the top three are a given, but it'll be tough competition between Alice, Megumi, Hisako, Aldini and Subaru. It really does depend on their character progression but I'd definitely put my money on Megumi and Alice."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,FlappingFalcon,2,Sun May 24 09:41:01 2015 UTC,I wonder what erina reaction be when she learns who soma's father is since she is a big fan of somas father
ShokugekiNoSoma,3713nh,amazn_azn,2,Tue May 26 08:23:18 2015 UTC,"She'll probably wonder why his dishes are so low class I guess, and then ask Soma to let her meet him (but he'll probably be AWOL as usual)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,lulzmort,8,Sat May 23 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"I like to think that, despite his stray cat mentality, he left Totsuki early to experience the outside world so that he could one day beat Dojima. But that's me assuming that in all of their showdowns, Jouichiro never won. But then during his travels he met the woman who would become his wife and she was able to change the man known as an asura!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,ag487,5,Sun May 24 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"Senzaemon Nakiri didn't approve of the relationship between his daughter and Joichiro and was pressing them to break it up. Joe said fuck it and left the school, changed his name, and had Soma. Probably not true, but that's what I'm hoping."
ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,Just_a_prank_bro,7,Sat May 23 23:27:02 2015 UTC,How does that make sense? Souma's mums name must be Yukihira since Joe's surname was Saiba.
ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,FlappingFalcon,1 point,Sun May 24 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"Hold on..... Quite a few prestigious chefs recognize the Yukihira name, has it been confirmed that perhaps it wasn't Souma's mother who ended up in the first seat? I may have missed a important chapter."
ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,Always-Agnew,3,Sat Jun 6 20:44:41 2015 UTC,So Soma is Erina's cousin?   I don't think a Jump manga is gonna get into wincest.

ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,Baghieb,5,Sat May 23 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"probably a shokugeki where his expulsion was on the line (that reminds me of someone) even as a second seat ... he tried a new dish (the old hag from the dorm said something that he did that often in a shokugeki and lost because of it) it failed .. and yeah he lost the shokugeki ... maybe a shokugeki vs Gin ( first seat or expulsion) .. maybe it's a hidden rule ""When you challage the first seat in a shokugeki your expulsion is on the line"""
ShokugekiNoSoma,371d9n,pejobear,1 point,Sun May 24 08:47:59 2015 UTC,"I support this theory but its not actually a hidden rule but more of in the lines of something equal to Gin's first seat. Jou wanted the first seat but Gin placed an equal wager of having Jou expelled.  Well, he lost as we all know and he didnt graduate... thus traveling the world to discover something he needed or wanted. I would not be surprised if Jou would challenge Gin one more time in the future chapters."

ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,Ricardo1991,15,Sat May 23 11:36:31 2015 UTC,"Love the personality of the 1st seat of the current elite ten. At one point he is nervous and depressed and when he explained some things about the elite ten you can see when it matters he can get serious.   So we got an upcoming event where even the elite ten are gonna contest in right?   So if that is true, this is the first chance for Soma to go face to face against an elite ten and will most likely happen. Anyone thinks he actually has a chance of winning? I personally think it is abit to early for him to join the elite ten since we're only in the 2nd or 3rd semester of the 1st year. The earliest I can see him joining is at the very end of the 1st year.   EDIT: when I mean first chance I mean in an actual official competition. Forgot about the time he went vs Ishikki in the polar star residence."
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,FailerQt,7,Sat May 23 11:43:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think Soma is going to be able to beat an Elite Ten member just yet. He may be better than some of them at a few techniques, but overall I don't think he's there yet. I agree the earliest he'd be able to be a part of the Elite Ten is when the 3rd Year students graduate."
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,ag487,5,Sat May 23 21:21:20 2015 UTC,Good thought process. Since we don't know how the choosing of the elite ten is done we can only guess. Is there a competition being held at the very end of the year to decide the elite ten the next year? It seems reasonable for that to happen. It is pretty obvious that the top 5 of the elite ten will graduate.   So my guess would be that there will be a competition amongst everyone who is not graduating. Either every 2nd year and 1st year are able to compete and the top 10 of that competition will be the elite ten or only the notable people of the 2nd and 1st year are able to compete and the top 10 are the elite ten for next year. Either options will most likely include the 2nd year elite ten members while the third year elite ten members will graduate as their seat.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,FailerQt,4,Sat May 23 22:43:43 2015 UTC,"While that's true, its still unclear how much Shinomiya's teachings helped him. It could've pushed him to a whole new level.."
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,hyroglyphixs,12,Sun May 24 07:20:51 2015 UTC,Yugi-kun already set up his death flag. I like the first seat and the second seat is being intentionally mysterious.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,BmDragon,4,Sat May 23 14:28:45 2015 UTC,He and Eizan are probadly gonna be the stepping stones for both Soma and Erina.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,FailerQt,6,Sat May 23 17:21:41 2015 UTC,Erina's face face when the rest of first years get fired up is perfect. You can just tell she's thinking they all need to chill.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,Shlugo,3,Sat May 23 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"So I'm guessing either Tsukasa will have a ""berserker mode"" like Kurokiba or, my personal reference, he is always afraid, and his fear makes him cook better.  And now we get a school festival. Interesting."

ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,chillitomatocakes,7,Sat May 23 11:47:31 2015 UTC,Not sure if you really need to spoilertag a post in the latest chapter discussion.  But I totally agree Soma should easily win in making the worst dish.

ShokugekiNoSoma,36z9vt,chillitomatocakes,4,Sat May 23 12:01:41 2015 UTC,"On my first read, I was a bit disappointed because of how this chapter lacked the typical cliffhanger or conflict resolution we've come to love from this series. However, upon further readings, I kinda like how this was done. Kuga/Yugi's challenge conditions really make it interesting to see how and when Soma will exploit surpassing him in ""any one aspect of cooking"" and forcing him into a Shokugeki, or at least just take him down a few pegs. The main cliffhanger comes in the form of the Campus Festival, a mysterious event we know little about. My theory is that, unlike the autumn festival, the upperclassmen will be participating as well. Furthermore, someone like bestgirl Megumi will get the chance to show her stuff and face off against one of the bad-mouthing senpai she wasn't happy about, possibly even Kuga. Just remind them of how cooking good food can make them feel happy or w/e shonen magical lesson without needing status or prestige from the elite 10."

Almost everyone guessed 1,2,&3 and 4&5 were interchangeable in the guessing.  Think it would have been way more fun if the artist (or any artist) drew up the character designs then just randomized their numbers. Imagine if big guy was number 1.  Did find 1st seats stressing over his position causing him to forget the fun of food interesting tho."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3700xv,Hsrock,11,Sat May 23 16:24:12 2015 UTC,What? That doesn't make sense....
ShokugekiNoSoma,3700xv,dependsonreally,3,Sat May 23 17:22:51 2015 UTC,Would be pretty cool since it is likely that the red hair that Soma has comes from his mother side. However wasn't it alluded that his wife has died while Soma was still young? They could indeed be cousins but half siblings  would be crossed out if the mother is indeed dead.
ShokugekiNoSoma,3700xv,FailerQt,2,Sat May 23 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"Soma's hair likely doesn't come from his mother's side; it looks like she is a blonde according to this image.   Rindou and Soma don't share any features, nor does she share features with Joichiro. Maybe they'll end up being cousins, but there isn't anything shown so far that would suggest something like that.  I think there's a little bit more evidence that suggest Soma is related (cousins) to Erina and Alice; the mom is blonde, they met during school that the grandpa runs, and Erina met with Joichiro for a time. Though I don't really think that'll end up panning out either; for one, why wouldn't Joichiro introduce Soma to Erina and Senzaemon if they are Soma's cousin and grandfather and Joichiro was going to their house regularly for a time."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3700xv,Just_a_prank_bro,1 point,Sat May 23 20:26:31 2015 UTC,They do share features. Look at their hair color and eyes.

ShokugekiNoSoma,36s8au,Theeubernoob,2,Thu May 21 19:20:46 2015 UTC,Yeah and it gives more insight into his character and it gives clues as to why he is the way he is. I find it pretty interesting so far!
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,dzhsck,5,Mon May 18 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"She is in the 10th seat. From what I understand, she chose to sit with the first years because it's supposed to be a gathering session between first years and the Totsuki 10 Seats, so it's more appropriate that she sits with the first years.  It's not implied but she probably feels grateful to Soma for the shoujo manga + persuading Hisako to go back to her."
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,Enthalith,4,Mon May 18 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think she knew about Hisako though, judging from her reaction to Hisako talking with Soma"
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,dragonian456,1 point,Mon May 18 17:43:18 2015 UTC,Yeah She was wondering why Soma was being so friendly with Hisako lately so she probably had no idea that Soma was the reason Hisako came back to her. And my guess is that Erina is slowly starting to accept Soma maybe?
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,Alden0,4,Mon May 18 19:54:14 2015 UTC,Maybe. But the tsun is strong with this one.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,dragonian456,2,Mon May 18 20:16:40 2015 UTC,My guess is that she accepts him as not being a horrible cook that she needs to force out since he made it to the Election finals and showed that he is one of the best 1st years.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,TheRandomNPC,4,Mon May 18 20:34:13 2015 UTC,I thought I counted 10 people though in the one shot of all of them walking towards the seating...  EDIT: NOPE IM RETARDED THERE WAS 9 THX BRO

Any one else winning would be pretty ass pull imo"
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,ToFurkie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Since the first question has been answered, I'm only going to answer the second with my thoughts on it.  It goes without saying that she still has a lot of animosity towards him. Her first interaction with him in the chapter drives that point home. However, when Souma asked her about why she was on that side, she was answering on behalf of Totsuki and explaining that before she is a 10th seat, she is a first year.  To address her current relationship with him, it goes without saying she has at the very least acknowledged him as a chef. Because she hates him, she was watching him closely in order to see him expelled and his reaction to his failure. However, it's only lead to further cementing the fact that, as a low class family restaurant cook, he's able to stand toe-to-toe with elites."
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,Scooshers,1 point,Thu May 21 05:47:41 2015 UTC,I think we should see some sort of romance start to develop when nakiri sees that the guy she likes is really right in front of him. It's a bit weird that she has a crush on jouichirou but u know i guess thats supposed to be more buildup to soma maybe. This is supposed to be a romance so i would like to think that erina starts to eat soma's cooking more and/or finally admits its good and then from there they move forward. I think we could see that like chapter 150 or something but right now i get the vibe they are trying hard to still develop soma and his fight for a spot on the elite 10. I think after he gets on the 10 erina will spend more time with him.
ShokugekiNoSoma,36dvcl,Msrito,0,Sun Jun 7 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"It's more complicated. Erina can't stand the fact that she liked his common food and his cockiness. If you have notice Erina get nervous only with Souma and sometimes with Alice, so she doesn't hate him. She wanted Souma out of the school cause he is into her skin."

If anything, it will lead to Erina finally acknowledging Soma as a worthy cook, although she'll probably keep that to herself. Maybe she'll even start to develop feelings for Soma after she sees similar aspects between Soma and his dad. Erina will decide to forget about the Prequel to get with the Sequel"

ShokugekiNoSoma,365uba,Dogwithrabiez,7,Sat May 16 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"Mackerel Burger: Kind of dry, surprisingly crumbly/tender, sort of fishy. Damned hard to cook through without burning because of how dry it was. I actually tuned down the bread crumbs instead of what the recipe said because it was way too much. Sauce was surprisingly good, but a bit hard to balance, flavor-wise, since everything in it was pretty strong. Turned out well in the end though.  Pepper Mackerel with a Purée Garnish: I was lazy and didn't get the ""Japanese pepper""(likely togarashi?) that it called for, since it was so damn vague about the whole thing. Also, consomme granules are baaasically bullion in granule form with extra MSG(nothing against MSG) involved, so I skipped that and added some reduce beef stock left over from making the Boeuf Bourguignon instead. This dish surprised me a lot, as I have to admit, I was rolling my eyes a bit at the cabbage, but wow, that ended up really tasty and helped cut through a lot of the fishiness that the mackerel had. Not something I'd serve as an entree because of how tiring the strong mackerel flavor gets, but definitely one of those things that wows you with the first few bites. Also, nappa cabbage has trouble blending smoothly, though I didn't really bother to cook it that long(because laziness).  Filleting those smaller mackerel I got at the market kind of sucked though. Stupid brittle pinbones.  Boeuf Bourguignon: Pretty much the most boring of all of them. It's a pretty basic beef stew, with the french mire poix and the general french aromatic bundle in there. Didn't notice a difference with the honey, though I have to say, the honey does really change it up and make it a different kind of delicious, but you have to add a staggering amount of the stuff to be able to taste it through the beefiness, and that got expensive."

The way I see it, it's a guaranteed loss. It has to be. I believe in Souma's capabilities but a win in his first bout would completely undermine the Totsuki hierarchy. The only one that he would remotely be close to winning against would be Eizan merely for the fact Souma has already pseudo contended with him.  Now, though I strongly believe Souma would lose if he went against one of the Top 10, he'll lose 2-to-1 when the judges vote. By having at least one of the judges choose Souma over a Seat member, it further amplifies the idea that he's at least able to contend against people that are meant to be juggernauts on effort alone.  I look forward to the next chapter. I want to see more of the interactions from the First Years and the Seat members. I'm most curious about the Loli, Muscles, Smiley, and Nose Scar. Speaking of Nose Scar, how the hell do you get a scar like that without legitimately fucking up your nose? Actually, how the hell do you even get a scar like that? Was he in some duel or was it actually a cooking accident?"

I gotta say, the dishes really do get better as it all goes on.  Still though, episode-wise it was a lot of fun to watch. Still though, the, uh, excessive way they portray Nikumi is...

ShokugekiNoSoma,363cp3,CrazyZach,1 point,Fri May 22 06:16:44 2015 UTC,"I've googled some substitutes for the red wine and found out that anything that has the same properties is fine.  I've seen such suggestions as red wine vinegar and cranberry juice.  As long as they're sweet, acidic, and have body, they'd work.  However, I'm the person who cooks by just adding whatever and pray they mix well.  For umeboshi, I don't have a New Seasons where I am and the Asian supermarket I go to regularly doesn't have it for some reason.  I probably just not looking hard enough."
ShokugekiNoSoma,363cp3,Saucy_Totchie,1 point,Sun May 24 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"Dang, well I hope you try the recipe regardless because it was very tasty. The substitute for the wine you talked about should work fine since it's just to add a little flavor to the onions later anyway. The plum paste tastes mostly like bitter salt but you might just be able to get away with just seasoning your bed of rice with whatever you like. I made some omarice the next day with the leftovers and I just added ketchup to the rice in a pan with some sausage and heated it up. Hard to mess omarice up since you can use any sauce you want really since all you want is to make the rice soft again."

ShokugekiNoSoma,35kksu,Airmanken,5,Mon May 11 06:39:28 2015 UTC,"I remade that recipe at work for a few of our dishwashers. They loved it. The one thing the manga sorta gets off track is the method of production for some of the recipes gets lost in translation.  First....The Japanese method of pickling varies. The method use to pickle plums is pretty far out there. It starts out as a normal curing method (Salt/herbs for days), but as the process continues, the plum's natural sugars and acidity mixed with the salt; makes it's own brine...So these plums literally pickle themselves.  The recipe I've used to make this stuff is a bit different than a traditional recipe. Don't be afraid of my wall of text, its super simple. Traditional pickled plums use red shiso, but I like using red sweet basil (Thai basil), since it brings out the plum's natural sweetness more.  Ingredients   Plums- 12-15 each Salt- 1/2#-1# (Coarse sea salt for days....Iodized does not work here) Rubin Basil (sweet basil, Thai basil, red basil)- 2 bunches Cheese Cloth (found in any grocery store), or kitchen towel. Vodka -in a spray bottle Water bottle- 1-2L Cling wrap Strudy container- (Glass, or plastic...metal gets iffy when dealing with acidity over time)   Start by cleaning plums, making sure to clean the area where the stem was; then soak overnight in water. This will draw out some of the plum's acidity.   Once soaked, dry, then spray with vodka to kill off any mold spores (Important as a mold is not your friend in this case). Cover. Reserve.   Gently wash basil, and lightly spray with vodka. Let air dry, reserve.  Sanitize your container, and begin layering.  Start with a 1/4th inch thick layer of salt, followed by a layer of plums (keep it to 3-4 per layer), and finally by a layer of basil. Repeat the layers until you're out of plums.  Cover with cheesecloth, or kitchen towel. Add weight ( i normally use a small cooling rack to make for a more even press). The weight should be half of what is in the container...I suggest using liter sized water bottles, as if you have too much...just drink a bit, but make sure it is sealed and sanitized before you put it in the container...Again moldy plums makes for bad taste.  After you add the weight, cover the top of the container with cling wrap, and tie it tightly (just make a cling wrap rope and tie it around...just make sure it's air tight.)  After this; find a dark cool place, put the container there, and forget about it for two weeks.  This is more a curing technique atm, but as the liquid is drawn out of the plums, it will create its own vinegar brine...Brutal right?   Anyway, once the liquid reaches the top layer of plum; you're set. This whole process will take about 20 minutes or so of prep, 2-3 weeks of curing/brine, and about 3 hours of drying (optional...but recommended)...Save the vinegar...that stuff is golden.  If you want to dry the plums after the curing/pickling process, which I would do, since it concentrates the flavor even more; You can do it in a myriad of ways....The quickest would be a slow oven dry. Sheet tray> plums> Oven set at 200*F with door slightly ajar. for about 3-4 hours, or until the plum's size reduces by half.  Or you can take the long way, and let them air dry in the sun for a few days.  Either way is fine...  To make the special rice from the manga...you can either throw some of those dried plums (and a little bit of the vinegar from the pickling process) in a food processor or blender, and then just add that to your rice.  Or you can juts cut it finely and throw it in with a little bit of heavy cream or creme freche. That's my favorite way of making it. The fat from the heavy cream is cut by the plum's vinegar...GG  Leaps and bounds better than any pre-made stuff you'll find out there. Anyway; that's how I make them at work. If you don't have time or patients for this...Try looking up a local Asian market, they will most likely have some available...Plus, I think everyone should go to an Asian market at least once in their life.  This recipe works well with peaches too if you guys wanna get creative."

ShokugekiNoSoma,35e8x3,dragonian456,2,Sun May 10 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I'd be kind of bummed if Erina turns out to be the ""final boss."" I'd really like to see more growth from her as a character, and I feel like her becoming more connected with Soma and the Polar Bear Dormitory might be a nice way to go about doing that...but she needs to be taken down a notch first lol."
ShokugekiNoSoma,35e8x3,zephia,0,Fri May 15 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"Well, with how much she has been hyped with her ""God Tongue"" and skills, it'll be extremely hard to knock her down a peg"
ShokugekiNoSoma,35e8x3,dragonian456,1 point,Fri May 15 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'll clash more than once throughout the series. I figure he'll take her on since she is the lowest ranked of the Elite Ten and the closest to him in age. They'll compete and Soma will win or tie her which gets under her skin enough for her to want to improve so she won't lose to him again. Or maybe she starts to accept him a little after their match, but still puts up a cold front towards him."
ShokugekiNoSoma,35e8x3,AsianMist91,1 point,Sun May 10 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Soma will probably surpass her at some point. I mean, she's already literally the gourmet god, so she's probably not going to be the n1 chef also."

ShokugekiNoSoma,35e8x3,chillitomatocakes,1 point,Sun May 10 06:50:35 2015 UTC,Not to my knowledge. I'm guessing they're doing something right about now since there's only a handful of them

ShokugekiNoSoma,34jxhi,nKaProtoType,1 point,Sat May 2 00:14:27 2015 UTC,The little 10ish second snippet (13:37 time stamp) when Isshiki and co. walk in on Soma: we heard it back in Episode 2 as well (when Soma was presenting his dish to Erina). Do we still not have a name for the song?  Edit: Looks like it also plays during Soma's declaration to Erina in Episode 3. Anybody?
ShokugekiNoSoma,34jxhi,jhoudiey,0,Sat May 2 13:03:28 2015 UTC,half way through decided to drop the anime. so uhhh... not really into it.
ShokugekiNoSoma,34gs25,Solzic,6,Fri May 1 00:46:03 2015 UTC,"My recipe is:  8 - White potatoes. The ones I got were about the size of a golf ball and came in a bag of about 10. I sliced up the other 2 and fried them in duck fat while I was waiting for the roast pork. Steam the potatoes until they're a little under done, they'll finish in the oven.  12-14 - Pork Belly slices. You don't want to use bacon, because it's smoked and I feel it takes away from what Soma wanted to convey with the dish (and it muddies the flavor). Get a belly cut by your butcher to 1/8"" slices, and ask him to remove the rind/skin and only leave the fat. Weave the bacon, if you can. Bacon weave is life.  1/4 cup assorted mushrooms. I used a mix of 1/2 shiitake and 1/2 oyster mushrooms, finely minced.  1/4 cup white onion. I used Vidalia onions because they are ridiculously sweet and work very well with the dish.  1 tablespoon rosemary. Mince and mix it in with the potatoes, and line some fresh leaves on the inside of the pork before adding the potato mixture. Trust me, it adds way more flavor than just having it sit there.  Roast your ""pork"" at 200 for 30-40 minutes, then finish at 450 until the outer layer is golden brown. Alternatively, broil it at the end. The slow release of pork juices over a long period of time just adds that extra oomph to the dish.  Optional: 1/2 tablespoon garlic. It just adds a lot of flavor.  Put your mushrooms and onions (+garlic) in a hot, pan with about a tablespoon of butter, and saute them for a bit. Once the onions are translucent, lower your heat and let the mixture reduce, in order for the moisture in them to completely get pulled out. (this is known as a duxelle, iirc).  Make sure you chop the potatoes rather than mash them and DO NOT ADD BUTTER. The mushrooms are meant to absorb the fat of the pork, and butter will just get in the way of that. Season with salt and pepper and move on to....  The sauce:  1/2 cup Cabaret Sauvignon. It's just what I had on hand. I'll be experimenting with other red wines soon. Let it reduce by half.  2 tbsp. Soy sauce. I use full sodium, but that's up to you.  3 tbsp. Sweet Sake. The sake they're referring to in the recipe is Mirin, and can be found at many supermarkets in the Asian (or Oriental) section. Odds are, if a place has Kikkoman, there's mirin there.  Optional: More Rosemary! Only about a teaspoon this time, added to the red wine+soy+mirin before reducing.  Butter - There's no exact measurement for the butter. Just make sure you treat it like a risotto after that butter goes in - KEEP IT MOVING and make sure it doesn't stay on the heat for too long. Personally, I added almost half a stick of butter. Paula Deen it all the way. This is known as an emulsification.  Owagari yo!  EDIT: Formatting and one other thing."

ShokugekiNoSoma,34evsk,chillitomatocakes,2,Fri May 1 13:33:10 2015 UTC,That would be a really cool omake to read! I'm imagining Sanji vs. Isshiki or Erina. Either would be hilariouis!
ShokugekiNoSoma,34evsk,chillitomatocakes,1 point,Fri May 1 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of Sanji vs. Kurokiba, since they'd be both fired up for different reasons which would be hilarious!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,34evsk,chillitomatocakes,1 point,Fri May 1 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"That would be a fun one too! I was thinking Isshiki would be good because he would have a lot of women cheering him on and flirting with him, which I feel would piss off Sanji since Isshiki would would every girl's attention on him.  I also thought of Erina because at the start of the match Sanji would just hit on Erina, but once she started cooking he'd realize that she is the real deal when it comes to cooking and not hold back against her. But once the showdown was over he'd go back to flirting."
ShokugekiNoSoma,34evsk,dragonian456,2,Fri May 1 16:48:29 2015 UTC,The Sanji vs Erina scenario actually sounds like a battle he had in one of their filler episodes!  All I know is that Isshiki and Franky would get along really well! Loincloth/Underpants unite!

ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,Ricardo1991,10,Sat Apr 25 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else find the pacing for this arc wierd?  Like we get Soma in 2 restaurants getting better, then in 1 chapter we skip the rest of the training and fast forward to everyone returning home.  It seems rushed to me."
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,boylesan,6,Sat Apr 25 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"It has been a bit weird. I think it would have been better to save Shinomiya's restaurant for last or second to last. Would have also been cool to see Souma get paired up with Erina for a restaurant at some point, but at least Souma seems to have a new confidence about him. Maybe they'll do flashbacks to the unseen two weeks in a future chapter."
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,AsianMist91,8,Sat Apr 25 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"Well it makes sense to me, shinomiyas was probably the hardest part, and the most important. Maybe it would be better if it was last i guess."
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,sora677,7,Sat Apr 25 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"I actually consider this a good sign that the novel won't stagnate in terms of pace.   The small time-skip gives readers a chance to be surprised by the advancement of characters. Sure, watching Soma grow would have been fun. But giving us a taste of his growth with 2 restuarants and then starting a new arc seems much more dynamic.   It does feel rushed but I feel like it's bringing even more life into the manga, which I didn't think was possible."
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,mystry08,2,Sun Apr 26 03:06:50 2015 UTC,Well some people did find the last arc quite long. Though it is too bad they decided to skip this arc. It would have been fun to see some of the other characters who didn't get to do much last arc to shine.
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,TonyRimor,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:02:23 2015 UTC,"I think what is happening is that they want to slowly flashback the experiences at the last restaurant since it might be more important that we would like to think. Perhaps he found his 'style' and all the Shokugeki's he has accepted will show what that is (plus gives airtime for Takumi so he can get back the mezzaluna).  Shinomiya's got such a good treatment probably because of his spinoff, Shokugeki no Soma: L'étoile, and he's a familiar character who gives an excuse to bring in alumni Elite Ten members."
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,Goldprint,4,Sun May 3 23:01:22 2015 UTC,He's definitely looking older. And surely Shun isn't going to fail right? That part has me a bit worried.
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,Justletmesubscribe,2,Sat Apr 25 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Having read the Casanova Scans translation, it looks like an issue of the restaurant failing in spite of Ibusaki's best efforts, not that he's necessarily failing himself."

(Unless it literally just meant he was the first one to make it back to the dorm after everyone finished)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,33tweo,338388,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:00:12 2015 UTC,I think the mini Time Skip was a good thing.

I was pretty apprehensive about it before the spring season happened, but after 4 episodes all of my doubts have been dispelled. Now I get to look forward to Shokugeki No Soma being one of my most anticipated manga chapters AND anime episodes of the week.

Like if you said Chapter 109 spoilers Possible Souma will be at Shinomiyas restaurant?  People who hadn't read 109 didn't even know Shinomiya was gonna be in it. Just like people who haven't look at 116 didn't know there was going to be anything in 116 where, I'm guessing, the characters look older."

For a start, to have a sudden unannounced time-skip without any explanation seems rather far-fetched don't you think? I only stated it as a possibility in the title to draw people's attention in.   Besides, if you actually viewed the spoiler image in question, it hardly gives anything away.

ShokugekiNoSoma,33arlb,Neugdae1,0,Wed Apr 22 00:28:30 2015 UTC,sounds good will it be this season ?
ShokugekiNoSoma,33arlb,Neugdae1,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:41:17 2015 UTC,for sure! It should be within the first 12 episodes
ShokugekiNoSoma,33arlb,ag487,-1,Wed Apr 22 05:10:54 2015 UTC,cool then i will atleast watch untill then :D
ShokugekiNoSoma,33arlb,brettbri5694,2,Wed Apr 22 05:29:01 2015 UTC,There's only 3 episodes out so far. The total episodes is unknown at the moment.
ShokugekiNoSoma,336r5x,Ricardo1991,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:46:34 2015 UTC,This is part of a project by the ColorKages's of /r/Naruto.  We got together this week to color many manga we love.  Check out the entire thing! http://imgur.com/a/vRFOo#0

ShokugekiNoSoma,3370o9,Ricardo1991,2,Mon Apr 20 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or does the food preparation descriptions get more and more gratuitous as the series goes on? This chapter's ""how it was done"" explanation was staggeringly long and info-dumpy compared to the ones from before."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3370o9,Dogwithrabiez,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:03:14 2015 UTC,"I guess it's Soma's way of showing Shino that he actually can learn and apply the techniques that he learnt there, although it's a tacky way of doing it I'll admit."
ShokugekiNoSoma,3370o9,chillitomatocakes,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:25:12 2015 UTC,I noticed that too around the tournament arc.  I often just skipped it when I get a good idea on what they did with the dish. Having to read all that can make the story too... Straining. I'm sure it'll be easier to digest when they show it in the anime
ShokugekiNoSoma,3370o9,TonyRimor,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:13:33 2015 UTC,The Casanova Scans version came out already. Not sure if you saw it yet or haven't been able to update yet.

ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,CkPhX,3,Mon Apr 20 01:24:01 2015 UTC,I laughed so hard when I read Shino's name for the new dish!
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,dragonian456,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"haha yeah, it was a nice touch to a good chapter. I didn't think Souma had to assist at three separate restaurants though. I bet you next week we'll see him have to up his game to accomplish something even more challenging."
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,Forikorder,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"i dont get how it could get even more, the whole ""visible results"" means if they get put in too good of a restaurant they got no chance  even here it only worked because he was trying to do some french/japanese fusion and looking for new menu ideas since its a new restaurant  if he has been in his flagship he wouldnt have placed visible results  plus this is getting kinda old i hope the next one just wizzes past"
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,kayneargand,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"Stagiare get very old for us cooks, too. Sometimes it takes 10 or more times working for free until we get a decent job."
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,verycrafty,2,Mon Apr 20 05:56:06 2015 UTC,"So apparently there is another training week after this, I wonder where could Soma go, maybe next week it will focus on other characters.   Great Chapter."
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,twinnedcalcite,2,Mon Apr 20 02:07:17 2015 UTC,I really need to stop reading this manga when hungry.  The food looks so good.
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,TonyRimor,2,Mon Apr 20 02:50:20 2015 UTC,And here I thought we were gonna have another chapter or two to cover everyone else's dish. Well this is nice to since we can proceed with the story faster.  Any guesses on who'll be joining soma next time?
ShokugekiNoSoma,336jna,kayneargand,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:11:48 2015 UTC,Bet money it'll be Erina.

ShokugekiNoSoma,32zlqs,3llyphant,2,Sat Apr 18 02:10:38 2015 UTC,I'll reccomend u start from the beginning since 6 chapters isn't much and it will help you get a better feel for the manga
ShokugekiNoSoma,32zlqs,kayneargand,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:45:24 2015 UTC,Read it from the beginning. The one shot was amusing.
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,Ricardo1991,7,Fri Apr 17 20:08:17 2015 UTC,"After all the hate other shows are getting about their adaptations, I think this show is doing a really good job."
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,iScrtAznMan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are really keeping the flow of the manga and the cooking scenes are intense! And write now even though they added a few things, they are small so they work well and it doesn't feel forced."
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,ag487,5,Mon Apr 20 21:15:51 2015 UTC,That episode was great! I think Megumi's voice actress is perfect. And I loved seeing all the other characters featured in the crowd!
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,ag487,6,Sat Apr 18 00:50:37 2015 UTC,"I had totally forgotten she was supposed to have a different dialect. It really took be my surprise, but she is adorable!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,ag487,2,Sat Apr 18 01:18:54 2015 UTC,It is! It's making me want to go over to team Megumi!
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,TonyRimor,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:37:26 2015 UTC,You weren't?
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,ag487,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:36:09 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm a bit of a Nikumi fan... But the anime is switching me over.
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ylkq,cheese0r,2,Mon Apr 20 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"Great episode, the intro song is really growing on me.  Small correction about the chapters, they used 4 and 5 this time!"

ShokugekiNoSoma,32vsde,Dogwithrabiez,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:02:44 2015 UTC,How long did you leave the onions on the beef?
ShokugekiNoSoma,32vsde,kayneargand,2,Fri Apr 17 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the recipe says 30 minutes. I'm more or less going by the recipes for now, as they're there. Soon enough I'll have to be winging it, heh."
ShokugekiNoSoma,32vsde,kayneargand,2,Fri Apr 17 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"Winging it is way more fun, let me tell you."
ShokugekiNoSoma,32vsde,Ricardo1991,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:23:21 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's awesome. I really should try making on of those myself"
ShokugekiNoSoma,32vsde,SinSZ,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:10:45 2015 UTC,Wow! Your attempt at the dish looks really delicious. I made several mistake on mine. One of them was that I grated half the onions which made the steak too wet therefore not able to sear properly. I need to try this dish again. What is your plum to rice ratio? As in how many teaspoons/tablespoons per cup of rice?
ShokugekiNoSoma,32vsde,SeeOtter,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"Just tried this to day and I'm 60% sure the onion thing makes a difference. I did one piece with onions on top for 30 minutes and one piece without. The steak with onions was a little softer, but that might have been from inconsistent tenderizing."

ShokugekiNoSoma,32rm1h,kayneargand,2,Thu Apr 16 06:23:32 2015 UTC,Could you imagine an episode of Iron Chef or Chopped where they had to used dried squid and peanut butter?  How hilarious would that be?!
ShokugekiNoSoma,32rm1h,kayneargand,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:38:32 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, just rehydrate the dried squid in some form of flavored liquid or alcohol before grilling or cooking somehow. Peanut butter is actually extremely versatile, as it can be used(and is often used) in both savory and sweet applications. I'd say it's one of the easier combinations out there compared to some of the things they've pulled before.  Now, squid and strawberry jam on the other hand... I'm still stumped on that!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,32rm1h,alien_pussy_sampler,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:42:57 2015 UTC,"I thought of fried calamari with a spicy strawberry ketchup. Call it Ika Ichigo, or something.  Haven't tried it yet, but I think I'll take a pass at it!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,32rz97,jumpxman,5,Thu Apr 16 06:04:44 2015 UTC,well blame the people for not reading one of the best mangas these days
ShokugekiNoSoma,32rz97,pgy,2,Thu Apr 16 20:49:23 2015 UTC,We just need to get more people to read the manga to the current chapter.  Which I did last week.  So worth it.
ShokugekiNoSoma,32c9ym,noxiimus,2,Sun Apr 12 15:50:33 2015 UTC,"The album seems to be empty.  That said this is probably the recipe I most wanted to try.    How was the flavor?  Was it really bacony or did it taste like an actual roast pork?   Also how about the texture?  It seems to me it would feel like bacon on top of potatoes (not really how pork feels when you eat it).  Was there a notcieable difference in texture.  Also wtf man, where is your full page semi-nude reaction pic?"
ShokugekiNoSoma,32c9ym,boylesan,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"I just fixed the album link let me know if it works.   Flavor was great the potatoes absorbed the bacon flavor and they tasted really good.  Texture was also great it was really crispy on the outside, I think I could have crisped it up even more but it was still very crispy.   Sorry for no semi-nude orgasm reaction pics :D but I promise it was good! I will probably make it again sometime and it will turn out even better."
ShokugekiNoSoma,32c9ym,boylesan,2,Sun Apr 12 16:18:36 2015 UTC,Sweet im definitely going to have to try this some time.  So whats next for you roast squid and peanutbutter?
ShokugekiNoSoma,32c9ym,tokkyuuressha,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:32:15 2015 UTC,Hahahaha :D that looked so gross xD although i'm sure it doesnt taste as bad as they made it seem.

ShokugekiNoSoma,32ciww,Ricardo1991,2,Sun Apr 12 17:09:30 2015 UTC,Why don't they want chapelle to know of the shokugeki in the training camp?
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ciww,dragonian456,2,Sun Apr 12 20:01:07 2015 UTC,Because wasn't he the head teacher during the training dorm at the time? If he found out that the alumni held a shokugeki with a student behind his back then it basically means he couldn't do his job properly and maybe get fired?
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ciww,chillitomatocakes,2,Mon Apr 13 02:02:14 2015 UTC,I totally forgot he was even related to the training camp. I guess it makes sense then
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ciww,dragonian456,2,Mon Apr 13 02:23:55 2015 UTC,Man I finally caught up and this is the chapter it stops me at what a cliffhanger
ShokugekiNoSoma,32ciww,Justletmesubscribe,2,Wed Apr 15 12:09:28 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT! A donburi?! This just got intense!!!
ShokugekiNoSoma,32auo0,CasualCharlie,3,Sun Apr 12 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"I think this dish will go over well, Shino did say he wanted to get back to his Japanese roots after all, and a meld of French and Japanese style would be perfect."
ShokugekiNoSoma,32auo0,TanithArmoured,2,Sun Apr 12 04:18:54 2015 UTC,Hundred percent. There's no way he'll fail the test after going learning all he has over this arc. I'm looking waaay forward to the reactions next chapter
ShokugekiNoSoma,325ya5,FlappingFalcon,2,Fri Apr 10 21:23:03 2015 UTC,Nice color on the dish. I have tried making it once before but the broth jelly came out a darker brown instead of what is in those pictures.
ShokugekiNoSoma,325ya5,SinSZ,2,Fri Apr 10 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"Without seeing how you approached your dish, I think it could be due to the soy sauce."
ShokugekiNoSoma,325ya5,CVUnknown,2,Fri Apr 10 23:34:04 2015 UTC,Very likely the soy sauce because I used chinese light soy sauce instead of japanese since I only had the chinese one. Japanese soy sauce would give it a much lighter color. The oil I used could have factored is as well. I may have used black sesame oil back then.
ShokugekiNoSoma,325ya5,SinSZ,3,Sat Apr 11 00:23:57 2015 UTC,Japanese and Chinese light soy sauces have the same color. It's most likely that they're using white shoyu in the picture.
ShokugekiNoSoma,325ya5,Dogwithrabiez,2,Wed Apr 15 09:23:42 2015 UTC,I see. Time for another round of experimenting and adding the white shoyu to my shopping list.

You should try to make one that you can actually get all ingredients for.  Another suggestion is to re-read the manga, making the dishes as they appear."
ShokugekiNoSoma,31q34k,Ricardo1991,2,Tue Apr 7 09:58:40 2015 UTC,i made the curry risotto omurice and i think its one of the easier ones. i think ill try some more in the summer when i get time.
ShokugekiNoSoma,31q34k,kaidynamite,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"I had a thread similar to this a a few weeks ago. But honestly any of the curry dishes are worth a shot. The spices are so versitile they can be used in a variety of ways. Like Akira's Curry Pot Pie with Garlic Naan crust. Or the Curry Rissotto Omelet Soma made.  If you watch the anime (just came out, only one episode so far, updates on Fridays) they go into more detail for the first main dish, the ""Gotcha Pork Roast"".  Also if you do grilled squid tentacles in peanut butter and post a video of you eating it I will give you Reddit Gold."
ShokugekiNoSoma,31q34k,ag487,6,Tue Apr 7 16:02:51 2015 UTC,Grilled Squid Tentacles in Peanut Butter will be made shortly.  Is Octopus acceptable as a replacement?

It probably would stink up the place but I want to know if it is possible to make a dish like that and how it tastes.  Aside from that, some of the dishes I'd like to see made are the Curry Risotto Omurice, Mini Soufflé Omelette, Evolved Nori Bento, White Potage Curry Udon, and some of the donburis like the Chaliapin Steak Don and the Dongpo Pork Curry Don. I have tried my hand at making the Chaliapin Steak Don but the result is not as good as expected due to my skills."
ShokugekiNoSoma,31q34k,dlrdlrdlr,2,Wed Apr 8 07:41:42 2015 UTC,"Jet Black Curry Laksa is very similar to Tom Kha, which is also a soup made with lemongrass, coconut, and a smelly but umami rich fish sauce. If I can get my hands on some Kusaya, I'll give it a shot!  I'm pretty terrible at making noodles though..."
ShokugekiNoSoma,31mkp4,Ricardo1991,4,Mon Apr 6 13:45:28 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see what kind of dish Soma is going to present to Shinomiya. He has really settled into the pace of things in this restaurant. I do still hope we'll get to see what some of the other characters are going through.
ShokugekiNoSoma,31mkp4,ag487,3,Mon Apr 6 18:37:15 2015 UTC,mangapanda I think has a better translation then readmanga's while we wait for Viz

ShokugekiNoSoma,31mkp4,ag487,2,Mon Apr 6 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was surprised they put it out early, maybe they are going to try for a sooner release date since the anime will make popularity rise and other scan groups could take views away from them."
ShokugekiNoSoma,31cdly,Ricardo1991,9,Fri Apr 3 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"Man, this was even better than I thought it'd be! The only problem is that it went heavier than I would've liked with the food-gasming, since now its more embarrassing to share it around lol"
ShokugekiNoSoma,31cdly,dragonian456,3,Sat Apr 4 08:47:18 2015 UTC,Those scenes are definitively much longer than what i expected them to be

From what I've noticed it typically ranks within the top ten in rankings for Weekly Shonen Jump. I want to support the anime so they continue animating it until the manga is complete.
ShokugekiNoSoma,318csp,FrozenFyre,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:10:44 2015 UTC,To be honest I'm going to be extremely surprised if CR doesnt sub it but if it does happen then you'll have to go to one of the illegal streaming sites to watch it. It'll be subbed by a fansub group I'm pretty sure.

I'm also wanna stalk /r/anime to see when they put their discussion thread up and try and ask them to join this subreddit and discussion.
ShokugekiNoSoma,30sxd0,Ricardo1991,6,Mon Mar 30 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly enjoyed this chapter. It really showed Souma's growth as a chef and how he was progressing over the week. Let's hope that he smashes it next chapter!  For next week's chapter, I predict that he'll stuff a dish up, and then have to fix it up quickly since there's not enough time. Of course Shino will be pissed off but since they can't do anything about it they have to serve it out and the customers somehow like it. Of course, that'd be a dream."
ShokugekiNoSoma,30sxd0,chillitomatocakes,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be something along the lines of Soma changing one of Shinomiya's recipes on purpose to see if he can improve it. That Chef Abel will be pissed off to all hell, but Shinomiya will ultimately allow it because he'll remember how Megumi and Soma made good changes to one of his dishes."
ShokugekiNoSoma,30sxd0,ag487,3,Tue Mar 31 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"Loving this arc. So much growth! Can't wait to see how Megumi is doing, as she couldn't do much last time."
ShokugekiNoSoma,30sxd0,Tommyhanksy,3,Tue Mar 31 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"While this is an exciting time for Soma, I can't help myself from wanting to see the other kids. A few panels would do. I miss my Megumi-chan~"
ShokugekiNoSoma,30sxd0,faythsin,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah same here! I wanna see how the other characters have grown during this period. I wanna see if Megumi was placed with another that kind of clashes with her personality, like Kurokiba."
ShokugekiNoSoma,30st23,Bragior,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:28:32 2015 UTC,i think it's super important that soma is not 'overpowered' because it would get boring then i think.  so far the author is doing a great job to keep soma in place
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,Ricardo1991,3,Mon Mar 23 15:55:34 2015 UTC,Soma served 200 plates within 30 minutes before! He can do this!
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,Bragior,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:39:12 2015 UTC,Wow that was a tense chapter! This restaurant is a completely different style than Soma has ever handled before. I never realized how differently a full course kitchen has to operate. I can't wait to see how things end up at Shino's.  I'm also curious if we'll get another quick look at how some of the other students are doing again. I wonder how someone like Kurokiba will be in this training when he goes into berserk mode.
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,ag487,3,Mon Mar 23 16:20:17 2015 UTC,kurokiba will just terrify everyone into letting him do it his way
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,jhoudiey,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:59:03 2015 UTC,But head chefs seems to be scary too. Its going to be a standoff until the end hahahaha
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,faythsin,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:04:56 2015 UTC,"True! I want to see how the other students handled this trial to see how they've grown, like how we saw Megumi show signs of starting to make herself stand out."
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,ag487,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:54:14 2015 UTC,I think this chapter finally bumped Shokugeki no Soma into my top 2. Honestly it's got me fist pumping the air every chapter
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,CasualCharlie,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:31:18 2015 UTC,"Also, did this chapter release later than usual or is it just me?"
ShokugekiNoSoma,300tru,CasualCharlie,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:32:26 2015 UTC,Does anybody know when the release date of the new chapter? Btw: Awesome chapter! It's the first time I think that it's gonna be tough for Soma.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zvsxi,Kazehaya,2,Sun Mar 22 06:23:31 2015 UTC,Mmm. I'm liking the OP and ED songs already.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zvsxi,Bragior,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:53:52 2015 UTC,I am so excited over this! I hope the anime does justice to all the amazing food reaction scenes that we've seen in the manga so far.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9rxv,ag487,3,Mon Mar 16 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"I've tried my version of the Takikomi gohan. Obviously not the same kind as what Soma made, though. Haha! I would love to recreate it if I could actually get my hands on some of the ingredients, particularly the saury.  Mine called for carrots, mushrooms (fresh shiitake), onion leeks, eggs (scrambled) and canned tuna. It tastes alright, though I think I needed to add a bit more soy sauce next time. I think my mom's version of the Kamameshi (which is cooked in a similar way with different ingredients) is superior than mine, but not to say mine isn't tasty."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9rxv,Bragior,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"Oooh very cool! And yeah some of the ingredients they use call for some kind of out there stuff. But some of it can either be substituted or omitted and still give that sense of satisfaction.  Oh and the other week I tried Hayama's trick of roasting spices to create a stronger aroma and different flavor. It totally works, I made stir fry for my roommates and used the same ingredients and they said the taste was completely different. Give it a shot if your curious!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9rxv,Bragior,2,Mon Mar 23 03:05:29 2015 UTC,"Mmm, yeah. I think I overlooked that detail in the manga, but it's definitely true. Even with just garlic, sautéeing and browning the garlic first gives it a slightly bitter, spicier flavor than adding the garlic while already simmering, which makes it sweeter, milder and more tender in comparison. I imagine the same with spices."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9rxv,kayneargand,2,Mon Mar 23 05:09:32 2015 UTC,"I did ""Gotcha!"" Roast Pork today.  I fell in love with the manga not only because I'm a line cook, but also because of how fun all of the recipes look to make.  Lessons learned:   Don't MASH the potatoes. After steaming, chop them up with a spatula or fork. My going theory is that it will help the pork flavors permeate more thoroughly through the potatoes. I didn't add butter to the potatoes, and I recommend against it: Adding fat will overload the mushrooms and all that pork flavor is just gonna drip off. Use more mushrooms and onions. I used a combination of shiitake and oyster mushrooms, and (through my own lack of preparation) one tiny little onion. The ratio should be 2:2:1 potato, mushroom, onion. Adding a little bit of garlic to the sauteing onions and mushrooms also added a little more depth of flavor. Use a thicker cut of pork belly. I went to my local Japanese supermarket and picked up some belly strips and it was really thin. I don't recommend bacon because it's been cured and smoked, and that will muddy the pork flavor. Ask your butcher to slice a hunk of pork belly to about 1/4-1/8 inch slices. You'll need about 12 slices to make an adequate bacon weave. While tying the rosemary sprigs onto the pork does add a bit of flavor, you sacrifice surface area to brown. Chop the rosemary and add it to the potato mixture instead to maximize that flavor. Cabaret Sauvingnon is the best red wine to use for the sauce, imo. 1/4 cup of Cab plus 2 tablespoons of mirin and soy sauce works wonders. Roast your 'pork' at about 150-200 degrees for about 30 minutes FIRST, and then crisp up the bacon at 500. The low and slow rendering of the fat means more goes into the mushrooms and less drips onto your pan.  Finally, while wrapping the potato mix in the pork, position your pork in a diamond rather than a square. While this isn't necessary, it will add a layer of classiness to the finished product, as well as making it easier to tie up the meat."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9rxv,SinSZ,2,Thu Apr 16 06:31:07 2015 UTC,"I have tried 2 recipes: the Transforming Furikake Gohan and the Chaliapin Steak Don.  The Furikake Gohan is easy and delicious but it does take a while for the broth to harden so you should only be cooking the eggs after the broth turns to jelly. Really good tasted but in my opinion seems to be using a lot of soy sauce. I usually don't use that much but turns out alright.  I have only tried making the Steak Don once. I may try it again because my first attempt didn't turn out so good. Steak did not sear well due to too much liquid on the surface of the meat, sauce was not too good maybe because I grated the onions instead of just chopping them and may need to find a good plum to rice ratio since recipe didn't really say how much. Also, the cut of beef I got had might not be well suited for the recipe. Next time I will try just chopping most of the onion and grating just a bit to get some juices and getting a different cut of meat."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9mgj,TanithArmoured,3,Mon Mar 16 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Since nobody posted it, here it is!  Man I hated Shinomiya when we first met him, but he's really grown on me!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9mgj,CasualCharlie,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"He's become a character that I look forward to seeing, yeah. He just seems badass, even though I thought he was an idiot when he was first introduced too"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9mgj,chillitomatocakes,2,Tue Mar 17 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Souma is going to become a beast after his one week with Shino. From his experience with his father that was a 2nd seat to Shino, a 1st seat, his experience will be off the charts! But I wonder what kind of dishes he'll be making from now on."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9mgj,ag487,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:45:12 2015 UTC,That was a good setup chapter. It will be fun to see what Soma will come up with in the week he has with Chef Shinomiya!
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z9mgj,Seffer,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:10:42 2015 UTC,Fantastic chapter. I really like the hints of growth to shinomiya
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zb7io,Ricardo1991,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:09:30 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see Soma's pair for this week. What if it's Takumi lol.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zb7io,faythsin,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:47:37 2015 UTC,Actually he might not even get paired with anyone for this. During the explanation about the Stagiaire system they said that Tootsuki evaluates the status of the restaurant. After that they decide how many students they need and they mentioned that being alone is a possibility.   But if he is paired with Takumi here or at any other point it will be amazing!
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zb7io,ag487,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:25:15 2015 UTC,Oh I must have missed that explanation. Thanks for the heads up. I suppose the people who were helping in fixing the restaurant were just the few who are in the top staff members. It'll need a bit more hands.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zb7io,faythsin,0,Wed Mar 18 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"eh, chapter was kinda stale. i'm sure the next few will be more exciting though."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2zb7io,jhoudiey,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was just to kind of set up the personalities Soma will work with and to show how different Chef Shino is after the Training Camp Arc. I'm sure it'll pick up next chapter!"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2z4nbq,HiImSasuke,3,Sun Mar 15 15:19:02 2015 UTC,Damn sexy smug face is sexy.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2ytnm3,ag487,2,Thu Mar 12 18:48:23 2015 UTC,Yes! Something else to look forward to! Thanks for the scans casanova!
ShokugekiNoSoma,2ytnm3,chillitomatocakes,2,Fri Mar 13 04:29:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it'll be pretty fun. I already like how he can't get Megumi  and their Shokugeki out of his head.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2ytnm3,CapAmerica33,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:59:37 2015 UTC,I think it'll be interesting to see how Chef Shino will get out of the rut that he was in. While the art isn't as good as the main series I think it will be fun to see what exactly has changed from the Training Camp Arc to the Stagiaire Arc.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2ytnm3,CapAmerica33,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:12:07 2015 UTC,Do you know how often they will be releasing chapters for this?
ShokugekiNoSoma,2ytnm3,autowikiabot,2,Thu Mar 12 20:06:42 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. On the bottom of the last page it says that the next chapter is scheduled to come out on March 20th. But I'm not sure if that's when they expect to have the next one translated or the original published.   I'm guessing it's when the original will be published because according to the Shokugeki wiki the first chapter was published on February 20. So based off that and what it says on that last page I'm guessing this will be a monthly thing.

ShokugekiNoSoma,2ulx4d,faythsin,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"Just speculating here.  I wonder if the last page was some sort of foreshadowing. Previously in the chapter we saw the hierarchy of the first-years, with Nakiri Erina on top. The voiceover from the old man somewhat said that if you do not encounter new experiences, you won't grow as a chef. Perhaps this could mean the new arc will address how Erina has remained stationary for too long that it will lead to her downfall?  Mmmmm, I am so excited indeed."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2ulx4d,IrvineInsomniac,1 point,Wed Feb 4 05:39:12 2015 UTC,A beautiful chapter.   The development of Soma as a chef beyond his usual creative tricks.   The path to the top isn't about merely staring at your own dish by yourself but learning from others.   Soma isn't anywhere close to being an amazing chef but his potential for growth is what Isshiki finds scary.

It made me think back to the beginning of the series where Souma only says he wants to become a chef that can take up the helm of the Yukihira shop.   He's got the talent, the intelligence, the creativity but lacks the kind of heart and bond some chefs like Ryou or Akira have with the own cooking."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,mystry08,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:14:40 2015 UTC,Huh?   How did Soma take the news? I didn't really get what his last few lines were
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,Amerphose,1 point,Tue Jan 27 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"He's taking it as a sort of challenge. Remember that Soma wasn't born with innate talent and meanwhile his father and Hayama were. ""My own cooking"" refers to what the judges were saying when they were talking about seeing the face of the cook in the dish which was what the whole flashback was for this chapter. (At least this is how i interpreted it)"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,geos121,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:20:19 2015 UTC,Oh that makes sense thanks. I was just expecting a bigger(more sentimental?) reaction from him since he was always so passionate about winning. Maybe we'll get a bigger picture of his thoughts at the next chapter.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,Amerphose,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"Well, if you consider the fact that Soma has one thing going for him: he won't back down. He is not afraid to lose, but determined to do better next time. I anyhting, it's a challenge and a wake-up call. He did great, but his choice of ingredients wasn't good enough. The other chefs just presented not only a better set of basic skills (judging ingredients) but a more present personality as well.   Don't get me wrong, Soma was very good. He improved an ingredient to the level of being able to compete with better ingredients. But it didn't show Soma's character as a whole. It showed some facets like persistence, ingenuity and creativity. I think the result was just. Hayama(?) showed that he is able to adjust his cuisine within his own style, while the other guy just does the same, but with different ingredients. I think we will soon see an arc of Soma finding his own thing. His signature dish or technique. Something to showcase his character, beyond the run of the mill specialty of the day theme."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,Socratov,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. I think Tsukuda made a typical manga miss a step by focusing on Hayama's story just before the announcement. I feel like it broke the narrative. Like... when you watch the original Iron Chef, they build the chefs up in the beginning. They re-highlight their accomplishments at the end. Then they do the judging. In this arc, they basically spent the first half touting the sense of smell of Soma's competitors, building him up as the underdog. Then they had the judges go one a spiel about personality in food. Only then do they explain how Hayama's past and his feelings for his teacher tie in."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,salientmind,1 point,Mon Feb 2 14:25:25 2015 UTC,Once I saw the flash back start I knew what was up. Pretty much skimmed to the end to see my suspicions confirmed. Damn! I wanted my OP cook to win!
ShokugekiNoSoma,2trleu,splode27,1 point,Tue Jan 27 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"its exciting to see what soma's gonna come up with after this loss. i imagine him training to improve his skills in determining the best ingredients first. maybe ask nikumi for an intense meat 101 session, or megumi for her familiarity with herbs/veggies."

ShokugekiNoSoma,2sz0xw,Ricardo1991,3,Mon Jan 19 20:36:20 2015 UTC,ARRRRGGGGG STILL NO CONCLUSION.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2sz0xw,jhoudiey,2,Mon Jan 19 20:47:04 2015 UTC,"can someone pls get me this recipe, i wanne try to cook it so bad"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2sz0xw,Ka1to,2,Tue Jan 20 01:19:34 2015 UTC,Betting Akira will win.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2sz0xw,RandomFreakout,1 point,Sat Jan 24 14:43:58 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Souma will still lose. If he wins now, then the end of the manga should not be so far away."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2sz0xw,doombadger,5,Mon Jan 19 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"why would it end soon?   he is still far from winning against his father. If he wins, this will only give him a chance to enter in among the elite ten most likely the 10th seat. Amongst the current 10 we have only seen seats 10, 9 and 7. so plenty of high level cooks yet to be  introduced. Soma is in 1st year out of 3 years.   i imagine the next arc will lead up to the end of their first year where soma witnesses the cooking of the current 3rd years in the top 10 and realises just how much he needs to learn to compete at their level."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2sz0xw,jhoudiey,2,Tue Jan 20 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"i still like the ""well souma, you were outside the time limit and as such, you're disqualified. there are rules, son"""

ShokugekiNoSoma,2sarot,CapAmerica33,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:19:55 2015 UTC,The raw should come out on Thursday or Friday.  Jump was on break last week.  The translated version will depend on the Casanova scanlation team.

ShokugekiNoSoma,2sarot,kg06,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:21:48 2015 UTC,some snapshots are up. looks like winners will be announced next week.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2rfhw4,Ricardo1991,2,Mon Jan 5 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I started reading this manga three days ago and just got up to date.... WHAT A CLIFFHANGER!  .... I need more"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2rfhw4,TanithArmoured,1 point,Mon Jan 19 04:37:02 2015 UTC,What a tease!!!
ShokugekiNoSoma,2rfhw4,MrCh0w,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"Damn, I have no idea who is going to win. There has been so many win and loss flags for soma, but I do believe it is slightly in his favor. I hope the BAMF that is Yukihara Soma will continue his nearly unblemished record. So excised for what the Author decides to do with his series."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2rfhw4,enun,1 point,Mon Jan 5 21:00:55 2015 UTC,I need more...
ShokugekiNoSoma,2rfhw4,igboy,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"comeon, this is such an incredible cliffhanger I can't wait for the next chapter to be published."
ShokugekiNoSoma,2q4r0b,Kazehaya,3,Tue Dec 23 02:06:44 2014 UTC,A better view of the chapter.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2q4r0b,VeritasSociety,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:11:47 2014 UTC,How do yall find translated chapters so quickly?  A lot of thr big scanners take forever to release translations
ShokugekiNoSoma,2q4r0b,Kazehaya,3,Tue Dec 23 08:42:28 2014 UTC,I'm a subscriber to Weekly Shonen Jump from Viz.
ShokugekiNoSoma,2q4r0b,barfix,1 point,Tue Dec 23 17:29:10 2014 UTC,I got soooo excited from this chapter and when soma showed up I got even more excited but then chapter ended... Too bad we need to wait now for 2 weeks for the next chapter T-T
ShokugekiNoSoma,2q4r0b,Amerphose,1 point,Tue Dec 23 19:06:55 2014 UTC,"2 weeks. Damn. In a way, I really regret discovering this manga before it's been finished. Now I got to go through the pain of waiting"
ShokugekiNoSoma,2pyx6o,Ricardo1991,2,Sun Dec 21 12:50:30 2014 UTC,o!  The hype is killing me!  Though I imagined Souma and Megumi with a different voice..
