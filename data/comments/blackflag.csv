This is moot point though because he wasn't banned just for that comment. The original proposal was to warn him, but people chose to ban him for a) spamming and b) using a new account to circumnavigate a ban.

I don't know what word you live in where faggot does not have homophobic connotations but even when it is used to mean ""jerk"" it is homophobic. People call other people they don't like faggots because they are equating them with gay people.

However, workers in Skilled Fields sacrifice a lot more opportunity cost to obtain their advanced educations, as well as providing services which are much more difficult to find qualified labor in.  A neurosurgeon must complete University with competitive GPA/Test scores, and measure up in standardized tests, then complete Medical School and spend nearly a decade in various internships and residencies.  These standardized professional admissions exams, such as the MCAT, LSAT, PCAT, DAT, Etc... are extraordinarily information dense and difficult. Preparation for these exams can cost thousands of dollars. The hours and effort put into learning these trades is far in excess of what is considered menial labor, even the most complex, such as Electricians, mechanics, plumbers, etc. do not hold a CANDLE to the complexity and difficulty of the material required of skilled professionals. Not to mention the cost of Graduate level schooling.  It's not a matter of ""which work is more important"" it is a matter of how much of one's life must be sacrificed in order to obtain the skills necessary and the amount of time and personal liability that is put into professions like Law, Medicine, high level business, etc.  This is why Doctors are paid more than electricians and construction workers. The opportunity cost of becoming a doctor absolutely dwarfs the opportunity cost of becoming and practicing as a construction worker.  EDIT: I didn't even mention the post-Graduation exams. The bar for lawyers, the USMLE with its various steps for doctors, the constant re-certification exams, etc. A construction laborer can go home after work and drink a beer and spend time with his family, etc, while an established, practicing Physician may have to separate him/herself from their family in order to study for the next re-certification exam, the learning NEVER ends, and the consequences for failure are disastrous both personally and to clients."

All you can do is list the schools of thought that have influenced you rather than define you. For myself the main items are pretty typical: syndicalism, mutualism (in its socialist varieties) and to a lesser extent anarchocommunism (in the sense of community politics) and individualism (in its less dogmatic and rhetorical form). Above all I'm a gradualist. People who have influenced me in that direction include Proudhon (most of the time), Pi y Margall, Colin Ward, Joan Piero, Paul Goodman and a few others. Also many people who don't carry the @ label such as Jane Jacobs, Ivan Illich, Maurice Brinton and a few libertarian Marxists."

There are religious sects like that as well. The Jehovahs are the great example.  No doubt even anarchism sheds adherents over time, and this is nothing new. All that I can say to that is rather than going down the old 'rejection road' it is perhaps better to seek out a better anarchism to replace the childish one first adopted.

It also fits in very well with her general point of view that individuals are much more important than institutions. It's the way she views the world.

Goldman is principally concerned here with the execution of (pragmatic, expedient) decisions and policies which don't adhere to the ethical and ideological axioms fundamental to the revolution (and espoused its guiding party etc.) This critique, prescient and reasonable as it may be, has little to do with Nietzsche. One can interpret Nietzsche a myriad of ways and emphasize different aspects of his critique of morals according to one's taste; under no circumstances, however, is transvaluation reducible to decision making which contravene one's ethical axioms (whether sincerely held or duplicitously stated). I won't reproduce the a subsection from the SEP, but the recognition of the arbitrariness (and instrumentalization) of existent ethical systems and choosing to embrace a self-affirming, creative, liberated, and authentic life is not the accusation Goldman makes against actors in the Russian Revolution (which we might call a devaluation of ethical consistency or something).   One of my closest friends is a vocational Nietzsche scholar, which has led to my spending countless evenings assembling Nietzschean support for (leftist) social revolution. This task is nontrivial and demands one creatively account for many statements which superficially seem to disparage compassion, enforced equality, etc. I was excited to encounter a professional handling of this project, but this survey is nothing if the sort.
