ios,3e4b4m,Jaytinga,7,Tue Jul 21 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Sure! So overall, MoodTools is 6 different tools combined into one.   Information - basic information, psychoeducation, and online resources. You can learn about a lot of cool therapeutic techniques and this has been shown to, by itself, have a significant effect on lowering depressive moods.   Test - track your symptoms  Videos - helpful videos such as guided meditations and a ton of TED talks on depression.   Thought Diary - based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, this app allows you to reframe your thoughts by identifying the cognitive distortions within them. This has commonly been reported as the most helpful feature within the app.   Activities - This allows you to select a helpful activity or enter your own and then rate your mood before / after u complete it. Thus you can track which activities increase your mood the most.   Safety Plan - this is for people who are dealing with suicidal thoughts. You can fill out a safety plan that you can follow when coping. There's also a detailed guide and a bunch of phone numbers / local places you can find in a crisis."

You unlock achievements in it just like Game Center, but then you ""level up"" as you get more achievements. I'm a level 15 Archmage in it, whatever that means. Plus, it ties in with that terrible Google+ social network, so I at least can compare scores to friends without having to do anything extra.  Game Center on iOS? It's not tied to any social network. I have ""points"" but they aren't used for anything. It's been pretty much unchanged since iOS 4.x. It's just there. It's not really doing anything or improving games that much. Yeah, I get achievements, but it's like getting achievements/trophies on my Wii U - no one will ever see them. On Google Play they go to my Google+ page. On my PS3 it would post them to my Facebook wall. People could see what games I was playing and then either join me or just talk about them. No one knows what I have in Game Center.

My original question still stands re the archiving problem as - as you can see here - it states you need an archived backup to downgrade.

Screen should go black, let go off power button and continue holding home button.   iTunes should recognize iPhone in recovery mode, you can put it back to iOS 8.4 and put it back to iOS 9 if you choose. It sounds like a bad install.  That's how you downgrade.  To answer your other question if you have a backup that wasn't made on iOS 9, you can use that.

ios,3deu9t,metalhaze,2,Thu Jul 16 11:18:32 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking of the timeline....you're right, timelines have the most recent to the right, but you generally read a timeline left to right still because you're building on a history. The information is shown in a historic view where this happened, then this, then this...   The current task switcher timeline has home screen hidden (it's not visible without swiping) , followed by most recent then going back...  I think that if the timelines goal is reverse historic, it should go desktop (ephemeral / always there)  > recent > 2nd recent. Still left to right.   I agree that the cards themselves though are a step forward. They work really well to view the state of an app without switching to it.  I don't know, the right to left with home page on right just seems really counter intuitive to me, coming from the background of someone who has been using software since they were 9-10 years old and working as a product manager professionally. Maybe I'm off base, Apple certainly knows more than I do about usability and they have likely focus grouped this. However, I will say that I agree with 99% of their design decisions and I viscerally hate this one."
ios,3deu9t,LUMiNARY_ATL,2,Thu Jul 16 12:22:48 2015 UTC,"Another paradigm I would say this mimics is the concept of flipping pages in a book to get back to a page you already read.   The home screen is always representative of the current page you are on.  I would say this analogy makes a bit more sense because when you flip backwards in a book you are scanning right to left.  I mean obviously, as humans, we are all different and perceive things differently. And sometimes it's just a matter of getting used to change. It's hard to tell if it's a successful decision or not until we get to use it extensively for a while to see how natural it is or isn't.  But, personally, to me it always made sense and I am just wanted to share points of view to other people about how to think about it in a way that might help it make more sense to them as well.

ios,3dfb4h,jonnymilba,4,Wed Jul 15 20:40:11 2015 UTC,I had the same issue which took me weeks to work out...  Turns out (for me) that the iOS 8 backup isn't overwritten by the iOS 9 backup so there are two different sets of backup for the same device.  The problem I had was that I couldn't see the old iOS 8 backups in any of the iCloud control panels to delete it.  To fix I deleted iOS 9 backup then downgraded back to 8.4 - my old backup was sitting there for me to restore from.  Once restored I deleted and was back to the full 5GB free again.

Were you watching on the same Netflix account that was on your phone?   If the above two are true then... Some apps (Youtube, Pandora, and I'm assuming Netflix, although I've never tried it myself) have the capability to stream from an iOS device to a smart device (Blu-Ray player, Smart TV, Chromecast) connected to the same WiFi network. For example, when I watch a YouTube video in the Youtube app on my iPhone 5S at home, I can tap the AirPlay button (looks like a box with three curved lines) to stream it to my Smart TV, since they are both on the same network. My phone then acts like a play/pause remote for the content.  It's possible that the Netflix app on your phone detected that you were watching content on another device on the WiFi network under the same account. So, Netflix threw up a Now Playing screen on your phone's lock screen to act as a play/pause interface for content you were watching on your account. That's my best guess, based on past experience with my Samsung Smart TV."

Choose a model with a bit more RAM and you can handle the generation of graphical assets (Photoshop, Sketch, non-3D intensive graphic design tasks) with only the occasional spinning beach ball of ""you have to wait for an indeterminate amount of time because Steve says so"". The Mac mini I develop on at my place of employment only ever makes its presence on my desk known when I am doing some moderate to intense export stuff in Adobe Premiere (it's the higher end model though with an i7, 1 TB SSD, 16 GB RAM).  Before a corporate entity splurged on my poor man's Mac Pro though, I worked on the entry level mini and the only setback I have had was a hard drive crash. Sometimes I had to wait to wait around for a tick when editing lots of layers in Illustrator, but you're mostly talking about dev work so I think you'll be more than happy with that config. Also, highly recommend going refurb if you can find one with the right spec you want as they basically pass QC twice. Then you can use the savings to go toward an economical second display that will make your coding life much more enjoyable.  Best of luck. Most of the developers I know use Mac's because of the Unix connection and seem to be very happy with it. It isn't a ""fashion"" thing contrary to what some might think.

Plus, refurbished items go through more quality control so there's actually a better chance the one you get won't have anything wrong with it. The warranty is the same, the only difference being that if you have major problems that can't be fixed, they'll continue to try to solve the problem but you can't get it switched out for a new one.

This would be an example company: http://www.macincloud.com/ (but there are many more...it was the first google result, no affiliation whatsoever.)  They specifically state that you can run Xcode on it, as a selling point.  Maybe that would be an option...just to see how it works out for you, before you actually invest in Apple hardware.

ios,3d9spm,nezia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:33:21 2015 UTC,This might be a good way to cut costs. Do some price comparisons obviously. Also start out with the smallest commitment first just to test the server and connection speeds. You can probably weed out a few services that just don't have the pipes you need/want.   Paying 20-50 bucks a month for 6 months might be worth it. Even with a developer account that's less than 200 bucks.  I'd probably recommend something like this if you can't find a good computer for free or on Craigslist.
ios,3d9spm,Yeats,2,Wed Jul 15 03:37:49 2015 UTC,Can't you just emulate OS X for free with virtual box and a dev account? I mean that shouldn't be more then 100 bucks right?   Otherwise I'd get a used or refurbished Mac and use that to play around. Just make sure it will support the latest versions of Xcode and OS X (shouldn't be hard).   If you really want to try and cut it your local school or library might have computers you can use / borrow.   Also maybe reach out the friends and family. They might have older macs that they aren't using or would sell.   I'll try and think of other ways to save you money. The Mac mini should be a solid enough device if you can get a cheap one.

ios,3d9spm,nezia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:31:37 2015 UTC,"Virtualbox is a free VM client, which runs on all major platforms, but getting your copy of OS X without the hardware is not allowed by Apple's EULA.   I've never looked into virtualization of OS X, but I bet there is some information on http://www.hackintosh.com/ for that as well.  Even though ""hackintoshs"" mainly focus on running OS X bootable (just like windows or a unix distribution) on a non-Apple computer.   There are tons of tutorials on how to do that, however not every hardware is suitable and from common experience you will run into a lot of issues, such as missing driver- or hardware-support (in general) etc. Especially with notebooks it seems to be tricky...for most wifi and bluetooth will never work, from what I've read when I was looking into that.

Slightly more technical answer: Gmail used to support the Microsoft Active Sync protocol which Apple used for push. Google removed support for that a while ago, and while Microsoft has negotiated and engineered a workaround (I think a Microsoft server keeps a connection to your Gmail open and then prompts Outlook to fetch when it sees new mail) Apple doesn't have the relationship with Google or incentive to do so."

ios,3d6wlm,maizirinid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:35:34 2015 UTC,"Microsoft most likely just uses Gmail's IMAP to do all the fancy stuff. The GMail IMAP clearly supports IDLE for push emails, and at the same time, Outlook for iOS supports push on other IMAP servers now as long as they support IDLE.  It is just Apple who somehow resisted to support IMAP IDLE in its stock email client, which is probably the only email client that can have a persistent background process on iOS. Meanwhile, Google no longer wanted to provide EAS or implement Apple Push for free GMail accounts. So IMAP fetch the old way is what were left."
ios,3d6wlm,NEDM64,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:54:08 2015 UTC,IDLE is not push and is frankly a terrible idea on a mobile phone as a means of simulating push. The battery drain would be abysmal. I don't doubt that Microsoft might be using IDLE but they're doing so on a server somewhere and then prompting the phone along side sending a push notification.
ios,3d6wlm,theidleidol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:39:25 2015 UTC,"IDLE is a push mechanism, bro. ActiveSync (or even Apple Push) works in the more or less same way - keeping a TCP (HTTPS) connection open, pinging every several minutes to keep the connection alive, and waiting for the incoming packets from the server. That's said ActiveSync managed to coalesce folders, other services and device management together in a single connection with its protocol design, and this gives it an edge over IMAP IDLE.  By the way, Microsoft is doing exactly what you said with its Outlook for iOS, since everyone knows it has a cloud component. Outlook's cloud accesses mailboxes via IMAP IDLE (or fetching if IDLE isn't available), perhaps Gmail API and ActiveSync, and new messages and inbox count is pushed through Apple Push to your phone by Outlook's cloud."

ios,3d3cw6,Yeats,3,Mon Jul 13 05:11:51 2015 UTC,"For battery problems I always recommend putting it to 100% first before you go to bed, unplugging, and turning on airplane mode. That way you can see what the standby battery drain is like for 5-10 hours. If you wake up and your phone is at 20% you have a hardware problem- if it's still very high you may have an software issue.   Another thing you can do before that is go through notifications and background app refresh. Turn off lock screen for anything you don't ""need"" and same for background app refresh. There's no reason for silly apps to be waking your radios up just so they can grab new articles or try and advertise to you late at night. In general many MANY people are totally unaware of this. Besides the radios, the screen is by far the biggest drain on the battery. Keep those sucker OFF as much as possible.  Example: Some random game or news app. Unless you play it all the time it probably doesn't need to give you notifications or have access to background app refresh at all- ever. I always get chills when I see Notification Center on a friend/family members iPhone. It's a mess because they just simply don't understand what they're accepting. Location data is another people just don't even think about. Of course some emojis app needs my location, of course.   Joking aside: Do that first just so we can rule out anything obvious- like a bad battery (it happens). This will also give the phone time to complete indexing and other post update processes if any were occurring. Finally with battery issues you want to be looking at trends and not single days. You can't really get much information from a single battery cycle - unless the battery is defective of course."

Sometimes it simply won't let me go back/forward using the -15/+15 buttons. Sometimes, it won't even let me scrub around the chapter. 90% of the time, things have worked fine."
ios,3cz9at,CarlChronicles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:36:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not a power user of audiobooks like some (use of audiobooks to compile together smaller books, pod casts, or other related but still individual content) so my issues are a little more generic I suspect:   audiobooks do not consistently remember position. If I'm listening and start / stop without really using my iPhone for anything else during the stopped period then the book position will likely be lost and restart from the beginning. The use of the command centre, headphone remote, or iBooks app directly doesn't change the behavior. Causing the audio source to switch while listening to a book for example starting a YouTube video from reddit while listening is pretty much guaranteed to cause this behavior. It feels that if iOS swaps iBooks out of foreground user space then the behavior occurs.  the above is aggravated by iBooks not indicating position in a particular track. The position marker is always at 00:00, scrubbing works in that position in the track changes but does not change the time indicator. Sometimes the command centre indicator shows the correct time, sometimes not.    Those are my gripes that had me googling for 8.3 downgrade only to find it's no longer possible."

ios,3cuj31,davemee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:38:01 2015 UTC,"Couple of tips for you, based on being a (former) EE customer who had their iPhone stolen: these may also help others   Never be an EE customer. After I reported my phone stolen, they locked down the IMEI on a fully-paid separate iPhone I had instead, claimed variously they had and hadn't, and did this for nearly 8 months. They dragged the dispute out as long as possible. 8 months when your main business phone, and partner's phone, are unreachable and unusable is not good. Keep well away from them, they are indescribably incompetent (and have the worst customer ratings in the industry). Don't give the police your Apple password. Police computers are still running IE6. They can't even log on to the iCloud site, let alone look up your phone. Enable FindMyPhone. Disable the ability to change settings without a passcode. Make your phone automatically join open wireless networks. This way, if some vermin steals your phone, even without a sim card, it will sing about where it is as soon as it goes near an open network. I've found stolen Apple gear this way before (only for the police not be able to do anything about it).    Otherwise - I hate to say - you're straight out of luck. Note the IMEI and check out shops in a likely catchment area. The IMEI is etched on the back on more recent devices, so unless the thief has replaced the back (which is easy, with the right tools) it can be found this way - but needles, haystacks, I'd imagine. Sorry - but hope the other information provides peace of mind in future."

However, you can use these steps to help protect your data:    Change your Apple ID password. By changing your Apple ID password you can prevent anyone from accessing your iCloud data or using other services (such as iMessage or iTunes) from your missing device. Change the passwords for other internet accounts on your device. This could include email accounts, Facebook, or Twitter. Report your lost or stolen device to local law enforcement. Law enforcement might request the serial number of your device. Find your serial number: On the original box or receipt, On My Support Profile (supportprofile.apple.com) if you registered your device with your Apple ID Report your lost or stolen device to your wireless carrier. Your carrier can disable the account, preventing phone calls, texts, and data use.    Find My iPhone is the only way that you can track or locate a lost or missing device.

ios,3ct358,Airricks,2,Fri Jul 10 15:32:44 2015 UTC,It's been the same since iMessage started. I've had to turn it off on my wife's iPad because when she's at work she doesn't have a data signal on her phone. Her iPad that's at home receives the message and it never arrives on her phone. The way I believe it was supposed to work was that the message was duplicated by apple and sent to each device on the Apple ID BUT! any that don't get delivered get timed out by the looks of it as long as one has been delivered. They need to put something in place that says if it's an iPhone it must deliver and then they could allow the others to time out.

ios,3ct358,nickhue,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"I don't see why iPhone should be the main receiver for iMessage because many people use it on their mac and ipad or iPod even while having it on their phone. I don't understand why it shouldn't say delivered either. How does it know you arent on your computer? My mac doesnt get the messages and everything until i sign into my account then I watch all the messages I was getting on my phone flood into the mac app until everything is caught up. I'm surprised you are having this issue. Do you leave your mac on at home because that might be causing the computer to think you are on it. have you tried logging off or shutting it down or something when you arent on it? I know a lot of people just leave their desktops running.  I think if you turn off imessage on your iPhone in settings it will default any messages your friends send to sms automatically (this should also end your link with the mac imessages too but I'm not sure. But I would imagine if the number linked to imessage is deactivated then the mac would lose that number to receive imessages from. It might be easier to just start turning imessage off when you dont want to use it on your phone rather than completely turn it off on your mac?  You could try to remember to quit the messages app when you aren't using it on your phone, logging off or simply closing your laptop (without turning it completely off) when you arent using it. I honestly think you are having the issue because you are leaving messages running (even if in the background). If you completely quit the app you should stop receiving the messages. I know sometimes i get texts sent to my phone from people with imessage when it doesnt reach my phone, and I just close my laptop when I'm not using it.

Also it hasn't been enough time to accurately say anything yet. Most devices are still indexing, etc. You really need two or three full cycles (at least) before you can even start to see a trend.   Also in general you need to wait if ""battery life"" is something that's preventing you from updating. Especially since it's been less than 48 hours.   Edit: also in the future please add more information so we can help- like iPhone model, carrier, capacity. Takes 30 seconds."

I average about 3-3.5 hours of usage, and 14-15 hours of standby daily before I charge it, and on iOS 8, I would typically be at about 45-55% battery life at the end of the day.  With iOS 9, I'm sitting anywhere between 65 and 70% at the end of the day, battery LEFT.  Battery life is such a sticky subject - you can't ever really compare battery life with another user unless the two of you are using hte same apps at the same time connected to the same network, sitting side by side, having removed the device from the charger at the same moment, with a battery that had the same available capacity the day they were purchased...

ios,3cqtfh,iOwnYourFace,3,Fri Jul 10 01:05:26 2015 UTC,"With regards to the music bulletpoint: I believe in iTunes they have a manually manage option which is essentially drag and drop instead of ""syncing"". But you are still using iTunes. I don't know what you mean by native (built in or is downloading an app off the app store ok) but if you download another app like for Google Music you can sidestep iTunes altogether. You haven't NEEDED iTunes for a few years now (I personally don't find an issue with iTunes and prefer it to drag and drop). I know on my 5S I have yet to sync to iTunes since restoring it in January, but my 4S which gets used as an iPod I do use iTunes. I just use Google Play Music on the 5S if I need music. It saves space on my phone and I actually hid the default music player on my 5S. However I do find GPM to be somewhat annoying. It doesn't have the best UI imo on the web app or on mobile, but its convenience trumps my minor issues with it.Just your initial uploading to Google's servers is the effort you have to put in. You are kind of swapping a Apple iTunes for Google's own program though.  For the internet downloading: there are apps in the app store that download off the internet. Basically just safari/chrome on iOS doesn't let you but other apps do and you can sort of use the file structure within those apps. I jailbreak and use a tweak to have it on Safari and Chrome so I can't share my experience with you, but I know my sister uses these apps constantly.  Jailbreaking: while I don't find jailbreaking mandatory, I do still jailbreak. Mainly its just minor aesthetic stuff that I like not necessarily for a specific tweak though. Some tweaks are more useful than others but if you have been gone from iOS for a while I can say with some confidence that the majority of tweaks you used to use are baked in now, so you can find tweaks to further iOS in other ways. Do you just not want to jailbreak specifically or is it the annoyance of having to do it that is bothering you? Jailbreaking imo noly takes like 5 minutes MAYBE...more or less the time it would take to reboot your phone twice if you needed an estimated time for how long it takes nowadays. I find the tinkering and micromanaging settings on android to be more of an annoyance than having to jailbreak personally, but I guess it is because I view the advantages of jailbreaking as optional rather than necessary. I can see how NEEDING to jailbreak is a lot worse mentally than just wanting to."

Drop the fanboy nonsense, it's no way to go through life. Apple, Google, Microsoft, are all just companies making great stuff, lighten up.   How do you use external storage?   Simple, I don't. I have no reason to use external physical storage or jailbreak my devices.  For music: Spotify, Apple Music, Google Music, Amazon Prime Music  For photos: Google Photos  For files: OneDrive/MSOffice, Dropbox, and Google Drive/Docs  For videos: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, iTunes, Google Play Movies, Vudu, Plex   For email, contacts, and calendar: Gmail  I have a 64GB iPhone 6 and an iPad that I fill with apps and app data, I have no reason to store photos, music, videos on my phone or iPad when I can just access/edit them from any device instantly in the cloud. If you live in a place where you still have a need for local offline storage for large amounts of data then an iPhone is probably not a good fit for you.  Using a USB thumbdrive with my iPhone seems so anachronistic, I can't imagine a situation where I would need/want to plug a physical drive into my phone. I have used the iPad SD card reader dongle though in order to transfer photos directly off my camera to my iPad while on vacation once though, it worked great.

ios,3cn0wt,Maridemi,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"Understand, I started out admitting I'm an outsider specifically to get that out of the way. I've seen serious threads derailed all over reddit because of an outsider coming into a close-knit community. Thanks for the advice, though, and for future reference, here, I'll get straight to the point if need be. EDIT: I made minor edits to the OP, though, since the way I worded it certainly could've brought more harm than good. I'd posted this shortly after a heated discussion with an Apple fan on this exact topic, so perhaps I wasn't being the most fair.  Onto the topic at hand: How well did the SD-card reader work? Could you easily transfer photos stored from the card to an iDevice, as well as delete them off the card to free up space? And, more specifically, would this work fine with an iPhone? I notice in reviews some were complaining of it only working with an iPad, yet the use-case I would need this for would be iPhones. The use-case I'm looking for is some people have approached me with the need to connect camera cards to iPhones, as it's the only computing device they own. Further, I use USB sticks between Android devices both personally as well as with friends (<3 OTG hubs), yet some people get left out because of using iDevices, and I want to know how well iOS could fit into our personal ecosystem."

ios,3cn0wt,Maridemi,0,Thu Jul 9 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"In these specific situations, we often have limited to no connection to the internet, and sharing large (multi-gigabyte) files via cloud is not feasible even if we did, as most have stringent data caps. (The average amount of data I share with friends in a day when we're face-to-face would do at least half my data cap.) Oh, and good luck getting everybody to sign up for the same cloud-storage service. Usually, even in cases where we don't use flash drives, we're using Bluetooth FTP, which AFAIK iOS doesn't support. Plus, I ask, ""why not use a flash drive?"" It's cheap, faster, more secure, and works with everything (except, obviously, iDevices, or else I wouldn't be here today), especially when you're just throwing some files around and don't need them for long-term storage.

For those wondering why I want one - much easier to put large video files on something I can connect directly to my Linux PC than trying to spin up iTunes in a VM and copy files via the app. Since I'm essentially pulling content from my DVR, I really don't have a need or desire to shove large files to the cloud just to pull them back to my phone 4 feet away.   Kingston Wi-Drive is now obsolete. As I recall, the app wasn't great.   I apparently got a product that did exactly what I needed - 30 pin connector, lightning connector, and provided a normal and micro-SD reader so I could sync content to a card - until it was determined to be a pirated version of the PhotoFast products and no longer worked with their app.   The PhotoFast equivalents require Lightning adapters, or are fixed in size, and are honestly too expensive for the capacity they provide.   Still looking for the optimal way to take my TV backlog with me when I travel for work.  Probably be easier once I upgrade to a Lightning iPad."

It was all fine until I started deleting the playlists and discovered that only the playlists got deleted and all the individual songs were still in my music library.

My prototype device is, yes.   So the http proxy is only accessible via VPN?   It is. And I can't open it up to the public. ;-)   Do you have an example of your current on demand config?   I generated it on our outer firewalls/VPN gateways, which are Sophos UTMs (basically just an iptables firewall with lots of add-ons). They officially support this, and when I access some internal website through Safari this actually does connect to the VPN. It doesn't support certificate based auth though, so that's not usable really. But it's a start.  // on a sidenote, I haven't been able to connect anywhere using VPN profiles generated by MobileIron, even though they seem correct. There's probably some secret logic to that, which I just don't recognize.  The on-demand-part of that mobileconfig:  <key>OnDemandMatchDomainsAlways</key>     <array>         <string>intern.mydomain.net</string> </array>   Also, I have a ""Global HTTP proxy"" profile in MobileIron, which sets the proxy to ""proxy.intern.mydomain.net:8080"". This works fine when my phone is on the internal network.  So basically, what you're saying is I should just put * in my on demand profile and hope nothing breaks, right? Won't that force the device to be connected to the VPN permanently, as iPhones always try to keep some sessions (e.g. the phone-home-tunnel to Apple and APNS) open?"
ios,3cjnea,Trune,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:48:13 2015 UTC,"Hi, No, a large range of traffic to apple bypasses VPN entirely, this cannot be configured, so APNS won't open connections unless it is triggering a command to load a internet based resource. Also local traffic doesn't go via on-demand VPN's. If your global http proxy works internally, then thats spot on. Its just the VPN you want to sort.

ios,3cfaqc,Boysenberry,6,Tue Jul 7 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"iOS admin for a very large school system here:  We have almost 25,000 iOS devices and growing.  Is it possible that somebody bought 10k copies?  Yes.  Is it likely? Probably not on a very regular basis.  For us, every school is its own business entity in a way.  Each school has their own VPP accounts. We just help them understand the process, get the apps on devices, etc.  So the only time we'd ever purchase that many at once is if it was a purchase at central office.  And this does happen occasionally. In that instance, it would typically be a few hundred to a few thousand licenses.  So it's definitely possible that some school system decided to purchase your app.  Do you mind sharing the name of the app (perhaps in a PM)?  As for ways to scam it?  It's simple, at least on paper.  If the education pricing is half off after 20 copies and they ask for redeemable codes instead of using a token with an MDM, they could sell the codes.  Once a code is used, it's burned.  It's no different than purchasing an app. for somebody else.  So, say an app is $4 normally. If the developer offers education pricing, I get it for $2/ea. if I buy 20 copies or more.  So I send $40 instead of $80 on 20 copies.  Then I sell the codes for $3.  I spend $40.  I sell them off for a total of $60.  I net $20. Buyers save $1, so the is value to them if they get out from me.  Now multiply that by hundreds or thousands.  I don't think that's likely, but it's definitely possible.  I think it's more likely that a school system bought 10k copies than somebody is going to try to sell off thousands of redemption codes.  Plus, the person buying would have to have an education account.  Certainly not too difficult to get, but they'd have to jump through some hoops.  Edit: something else I just thought of. Our fiscal year runs with the school year, which just ended.  It could be that somebody needed to spend leftover money.  Unfortunately, states don't make it easy to ""give back"" unspent money without losing it next year. So instead of putting it back in the budget, it gets spent on shit that's not needed to assure they get the money next year when they may actually need it.  It's a shit system, but happens all through government.  So you could be seeing school systems off-loading budget surplus."

ios,3cfaqc,sin-eater82,2,Tue Jul 7 13:55:16 2015 UTC,"School funding is tight enough as it is, schools purchase the number of copies they need when it comes to paid apps.  If a school wants to use iMovie for their video class and that's the only need, they don't purchase 1,000 copies of it even if they have 1,000 iPads.  They purchase it for the iPads associated with the class.  There are different iPad deployment models of course. They could be assigned to a classroom, sets that are checked out by teachers, or assigned to specific students.  And each would present slightly different app. deployment models depending on what equipment/management tools the school/school system has available.  But it's be very surprised if one teacher or school wanting app X caused the school system to buy it for every device.  It would have to be some big, district-wide initiative to use the app.  Or maybe somebody needing to spend money.  Our fiscal year  runs with the school year, which just ended. Somebody may have had a need to spend a lot of money.  Note in case the iMovie example causes confusion:  iMovie is free on iPads purchased after September 2013.  But it's 4.99 for older devices."

Safari used to crash whenever ANY videos were present and my PLEX server I run here at the house was unusable on my 4s since I upgraded to 8.3. 8.4 fixed all of those issues I'm confident to say now that I've been on it a few days.  I used to run into times when my phone would crash and respring every few days but it hasn't slowed down like it normally did before that would happen on 8.3. I've been holding out for the 6s when it drops this fall; this thing needs a new battery and the screen is cracked. If iOS 9 keeps making the kinds of improvements like 8.4 I might be able to cheap out, spend $40 for a new screen and battery on Amazon and hang onto this phone for a while longer.

Try finding something a little more niche. Heck, don't be afraid to talk over it with your own voice. The ""On [windows logo]"" at the beginning felt awkward and forced.

Either way, it comes off as cheap when your English is horrific. Try and find a better way to either translate or proofread. You could even resort to no text at all, just simple graphics you made in paint would be better than the broken English you currently have. The profile picture is some random anime dude I have no idea about, and it adds to the cheap feeling I described before. Make that the logo you fade in and out from your intro that I talked about before. Get more opinions than mine. I could be an idiot for all you know.   Hopefully I'm not.   Keep making tutorials. Keep practicing. Keep doing it. Keep getting feedback from people other than yourself. Eventually you'll get better. Right now, just focus on doing everything you can to make more videos.

ios,3caihj,tiprya,2,Mon Jul 6 11:59:16 2015 UTC,"I think the next evolution of graphics in mobile (and console) is ray tracing. A jump in performance is always nice to have (and we are always working to deliver better performance) but if you can deliver photorealistic graphics across a range of devices, then people will finally get the leaps made by GPUs in the last decade.  I also wouldn't say that the all the low hanging fruit have been picked; there is still room to grow but I think claims of massive jumps in GPU performance are unrealistic (or should be carefully analyzed).  Another point is about efficiency. You need to make sure the architecture scales well (from wearables to game consoles) but also is not out of balance in terms of power consumption.   Overall, I expect to see:   ray tracing leading to better looking games and VR on mobile (and beyond) improved efficiency that will enable mobile GPUs to scale beyond their initial markets (i.e. phones and tablets) into consoles, automotive, wearables and even compute servers."

ios,3caihj,glteapot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:58:17 2015 UTC,"When it comes to APIs, we're agnostic and try to support everyone. We work closely with every hardware vendor as well as various standards groups (e.g. the Khoronos Group, the HSA Foundation, etc.) to ensure our GPUs (and other processors) are able to support any upcoming API.  Developers have been demanding low level APIs for quite some time so the recent announcements (DirectX 12, Metal, Mantle, Vulkan, etc.) have been a nice validation of those requests."

ios,3caihj,justllamaproblems,2,Mon Jul 6 12:04:39 2015 UTC,"I think the performance difference between desktop and mobile is mostly due to memory bandwidth not raw performance. For example, our 16-cluster PowerVR GT7900 delivers over 1 TFLOPS of FP16 performance. Have a look at this chart here and you will see what I mean when I say that memory bandwidth is the main limiting factor.   Speaking of feature sets and APIs, we were one of the first companies to show the Vulkan API running on PowerVR GPUs at GDC 2015. Furthermore, the latest PowerVR GPUs support up to DirectX 11_2, OpenGL 4.3, and OpenCL 1.2 FP.  So I think we are pretty much on par with the desktop guys."

Mobile is driven by cost (even at the high end we're still talking about economies of scale) so I don't think it's going to happen in the near future. The trend right now is to adopt the smallest node possible for power efficiency reasons but maybe (someday) HBM will make it into mobile."

ios,3caihj,ltron2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"There is a little bit of disagreement between those of us that follow Wizard and I was hoping you could clear it up. I believe the RTU is modular to a point and can be slotted with other PowerVR GPUs without too much problem. Some believe the only design for license is the GR6500. The disagreement we had is that if someone licenses the RTU now and if license to product takes 2 years then the GPU in the GR6500 might be outdated by time it arrives.   Our question is how easy is it to swap the GPU for example to use a 6 cluster series 6 or add a Series 7 GPU with an RTU? Is the GR6500 just an example design out of many or is it the only design up for license right now? Could a company take out a RTU license to use with a Series 7 GPU today?   Question 2. Partly linked to question 1. I assume Series 8 is being worked on and just around the corner at least in IP terms not products. Once its announced at a later date, will companies be able to license Series 8 with an RTU element from day 1?  Question 3 I am assuming you cannot go into detail and I don’t expect any company names. But I am going to ask anyway in hope I can get more then the hints you gave me last time. Has anyone licensed the RTU or at the very least has there been progression in the interest for it?  Has the interest moved further along even if its not at the license stage? Is the interest 1 company or more then 1 company? Perhaps you could give us few, many or lots?  Thank you for any info you can provide and I understand if you cannot go into detail."

Spotify did something that was entirely unheard of before. I still have trouble describing it to Pandora users sometimes. ""You mean… you can just pick the song? And it plays?"" Unfortunately, that's really the only reason why Spotify is so great. You pick a song, and it plays.  With Apple music, they based it on the curation of music discovery. It has a learning system, where I tell it what I like and it gives me more of that—in the form of playlists made by people that like music just like me. It also has Beats1, which is, frankly, brilliant. I've seen so many people fascinated at how much great music is played there.  UI can change. Fortunately for you, so can crabby attitudes."

As to your original question, you'll need to set up your gmail account in settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Once you have done that turn off Mail and whatever else you don't want on that account to sync with the native iOS apps, but leave Contacts on. All your gmail contacts will then sync with the iOS Contacts app and Outlook will pick them up from there.   I think that's it.

Apple made the Music app more cluttered for people like me who weren't planning to use Apple Music and primarily use the song library on the iPhone. I don't really stream music a lot on my iPhone and to have Apple group my music library into one tab while making 1-2 of the other tabs useless to me makes this upgrade one of the worst recently.

They want to make their radio and streaming so embedded with your own music that you'll be reluctant to ever stop the service once you start.   Fortunately for those of us who don't want to go in that direction, you can go to settings-> general -> restrictions-> Apple Music Connect to disable the connection/social media tabs, and Music -> Show Apple Music to remove much of that from the display.

Why is it necessary to copy the apps to a computer, then to the other device?  This would only copy the apps, not any data contained within the apps, that data is only copied when backing up/restoring.  Could you just download the App from the store on whatever device you want it to be on?    Are you talking about apps being developed that aren't yet available in the App Store?  That's a whole different process that I'm not familiar with.  Once again, what are you wanting to do?

ios,3bo61t,jeredye,4,Tue Jun 30 20:38:11 2015 UTC,I'm very disappointed with Apple Music. There's quite a few albums that just aren't there. There's no way to quickly determine which songs you've saved for offline. The UI is not very pretty in my opinion...

Gave up on that idea and tried playing a local track. It worked! Then I made the mistake of hitting the Connect button while the music was playing. Kicked me out of my track. Wierdly, I just tested that again and it worked this time.  Apple are really starting to lose the plot on quality and user experience.

You can add tracks from apple music to your iCloud library which combines with your purchased music and personal rips / downloads.   I guess the difference between that and iTunes Match is that it only works with songs already in iTunes music.

ios,3bn7dq,TommyWalker1237,3,Tue Jun 30 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"In iOS 6, when you selected an artist in Artists view, you were presented a list of albums in chronological order. It was great. Then, in iOS 7 & 8.0-8.3, when you select an artist, you were presented with ALL songs by that artist, in reverse chronological order. For artists with lots of albums, it made it tedious to select individual albums (or play individual albums without automatically then playing the next oldest album by default).   Now, in iOS 8.4, they've brought back the list of JUST albums when you select an artist in Artists view. They're still in reverse chronological order (newest at top) which I understand the rationale for, but would still prefer chronological order.   This appears to only be the view for artists with >2 albums. For artists with only 1 or 2 albums, it still shows you a list of all that artist's songs. Still an awesome improvement. Also, the ability to just tap an album and play that entire album rather than having to drill down to the first song of an album and select that one.   Great improvements to UI all around."

ios,3bnvat,TommyWalker1237,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"There isn't full email threading in Mail on iOS. Maybe it would be more clear if I called it ""threaded conversations"".   On iOS, you can see a list of all your messages, but you can't see the content of all of them in one threaded view. You have to manually go to the next message in the thread, and you can't see more than one message at a time.   Compared to something like this, which every other email app does, that allows you to see the content of the entire thread in one window. Mail on OS X displays threads properly as well."

You do not want any application to be able to see what you are running, what data you have or what pages you browse.   All applications are separate from one another and are limited as to what they can see or do in the OS.  Unlike the PC apps that usually have full access to all of the data on your PC and most of your hardware devices.  It's like having a repairman come in to fix your air conditioner but you have to go to work so instead of only giving him the keys to the garage you give him the keys to the whole house where he can go to any room and search, copy, steal any of your personal belongings."

It's still scary that deleting photos in the Google app deletes them from the phone's Photos app, which in turn deletes them from iCloud.   I haven't seen any duplicates yet though. It's just a little annoying that they don't make it more obvious what the app is doing.  It really shouldn't say backing up 10,000 photos when what it's really doing is scanning through them to see if they are already on Google.   It makes it seem as if it's uploading those photos which it doesn't seem like it did because I keep skimming through old and new photos and I don't see any repeats"

Head out the door, open music on my phone and there's the whole album fully integrated like it was something on the phone or itunes match. It's pretty seamless.

Swift is definitely better, but you NEED to know Objective C to be comfortable in development. There are a lot of libraries that are written in Objective C, and sometimes you need to modify these libraries.  So I'd recommend learning Objective C, and then Swift."

Once you have a foundation of that, swift will be easier to understand.  Even though swift is simpler and more powerful, you want to build up to that with a firm grasp of object oriented programming before you start.  You can also watch the iTunesU segment on Swift if you want. That gives a great overview, and even delves a little deeper. If you find yourself confused, go with objective c. If not, you still probably want to go with objective c, but at least you have a basic understanding of OOP."

Swift's runtime/type system is quite a lot more complex than Obj-C's.  Obj-C is verbose, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Verbosity often increases readability and particularly Obj-C creates a situation where you can usually read the code as plain English sentences.  The main issue with Obj-C is its syntax is very unique and hard to grasp for people who are used to other languages. But once you're used to it, many developers actually like it a lot.

Might want to make a backup, then restore to factory settings via iTunes. Try using it for a day without any of your content on it (If you can, I know it's hard to go without music/photos, etc) and see how the battery responds.   If the battery is back to normal, then it was your user content or something in the iOS that the restore fixed. You can then try to put your backup back onto the phone. If the battery is still normal, congrats. The restore fixed it. If the battery starts acting up after you put your user content onto it, then tough luck. It was something in your backup. You may want to systematically try to bring all your stuff back without using a backup.

Try rebooting and disable background activity for some apps in the settings if you don't need it.   If that doesn't help, restore the iPhone from a backup using iTunes.   These steps will solve the issue if it's software-related.   Edit: your screenshot looks like it's a software-related issue which could likely be solved by restoring from a backup or resetting the settings.

Firstly, PolyGen is a hybrid app done in Cordova, large part of its logic is written in JavaScript and sits in a webview. One of the third party libraries (tween.js) responsible for handling animation started to malfunction; it was constantly setting the animation start time to be very far off in the future. That library made use of window.performance API with a fallback to a polyfill and compared that to the time value from default animation loop (window.requestAnimationFrame). They needed to track two values in case the developer wanted to start the animation with a delay. In iOS 8.0 this worked fine, but in 8.3 these two values weren't compatible anymore. I didn't check which one changed and why (although this would be interesting), but the result was that one was a few orders of magnitude larger than the other. For my hotfix I've patched Tween.js and started using just one variable for tracking time (since I never start animations with a delay anyway).   Would be nice to check why one of the time values suddenly stopped being compatible with the other."

If you mean seeing other apps that feed data into HealthKit you can find that using the source of the items your query.   Also the Health ID. I guess you mean either the User Profile or Medical ID.

If you choose public, the image is viewed by all the users of WallaMe and also published on the website http://www.wallame.com (so, even those without WallaMe app can see it).  As a bottom line, the visibility of the image depends on the diffusion of the app. We are still in private beta, but the app will be published soon (and, hopefully, will spread all around the world).

ios,3au1zr,TypoKnig,0,Wed Jun 24 01:30:48 2015 UTC,"I can only send and receive messages via the Internet. And only to and from other iPhones. SMS doesn't work for me, I don't get green text balloons, just the blue ones. I've gone through all the settings to compare with other phones that work right, mine still won't. I'm suspecting it may have something to do with how my old phone was deactivated? Had a 4s, now have a 6. Hasn't worked right since I got the 6. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
ios,3au1zr,TypoKnig,2,Wed Jun 24 03:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well, shoot. First thing that came to mind is that Apple admitted they had a problem deregistering phone numbers that had once been associated with an iPhone, but the owner had moved on to a non-Apple device. SMS messages wouldn't work properly. So they released this website to deregister your phone number from iMessage. I don't know how you would re-register, other than turning it off first on your iPhone 6, running the tool, and then turning iMessage back on."

However, iOS 7 and 9 do not require your UDID to be registered, I registered my phone in advance just in case it wouldn't work, but it turns out I didn't have to.

""Hooking"" is basically where a developer takes an existing function that was coded in iOS or one of its apps and changes what that function does when it's called.  Any tweak that depends on it, which is pretty much every tweak in existence, won't work until Saurik updates mobilesubstrate."

I believe it doesn't respond for hours, but not holding it for hours, that's just silly.   My estimation would be he's either damaged it in the home repair (very likely the proximity sensor), or the aftermarket LCD/ digitizer is registering touch, which causes it to not respond, or is also obscuring the proximity sensor.    While it may not help, a DFU restore would fix any software issues it may have, if that doesn't correct the issue, it's the hardware, and I would assume the aftermarket parts."

Example: name@domain.se for general use/all devices. iphone@domain.se ipad@domain.se macbook@domain.se imac@domain.se    ...etc etc...  If you don't have your own domain/email system, you could always use a gmail adress and add +device to your email adress, since gmail uses the +whatever at the end of the username as a labeling option.

This way you just set the phone up as new and then they will all start appearing because you've signed in with iCloud.   Call History and Messages won't though but I don't know a way of doing that without a full restore. Out of interest why do you want call history?

ios,3ahvm7,MrHarryT,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:58:46 2015 UTC,No no. If you restore from an iCloud backup you should get everything back.  If you just setup your device as new and sign in with your iCloud account it will sync your contacts and photos to the device (as long as your using iCloud to store the contacts and iCloud Photo Library). But because it's a new setup it won't sync your call history or messages.

The iCloud Photo Library, the Photo Stream or the Photo Sharing? I'm not sure if the options are called like that in English since I'm not using English as the system language.

Also, does anyone have an article that talks about which of these vulnerabilities is specific to iOS. It seems like they talked about iOS and OS X hand in hand, but the videos and topics seemed specific to OS X. For example, they talk about Google chrome being affected, but they did not specifically say if it was chrome for iOS, OS X, or both. Thanks in advance!"
ios,3a5o8y,hastethechariot,-10,Thu Jun 18 17:25:05 2015 UTC,This is why i never use any password programs like keychain or 1password..
ios,3a5o8y,Tommonen,8,Wed Jun 17 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"This is a c&p of myself from another forum.  1Password has nothing to do with the OS X / iOS keychain. This attack was between the 1Password browser extension and the background process called 1Password Mini and their communication. The attacks on 1Password were only successful when the target user first downloaded the malicious app additionally, this malicious app has to run before 1Password Mini does.  As this and this post by Agile staff points out, almost all of the 'work' required for a regular user to get hit by this is done by the user, not being vigilant with what they install on their machine & not allowing 1Password Mini to run at login.   Like all of these services, they're actually only as strong and protective as their users. You'd be surprised how many people I know that use 1Password (on my own and others recommendation) and are using a simple 6 character password because it's 'easy to remember'."
ios,3a5o8y,ak1ngs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"A well secured machine should be secure against a user who doesn't have the password, even when they are in possession of it. If someone can be in the same office as you and figure out your password that's a vulnerability. Passwords are supposed to be absolute defenses."
ios,3a5o8y,twowheels,3,Wed Jun 17 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"KeePass and KeePassX don't use the OS keychain, so they'd be unaffected based on the short info here.  You're much more likely to be affected by a cross site exploit from a re-used password than by something like this, so I still think a passwords manager (and periodic password changes) is a good thing."
ios,3a5o8y,Tommonen,-4,Wed Jun 17 16:02:59 2015 UTC,"Did i say that 1 password uses keychain? No. I just used it as an example of an app that stores all your password in one place. Those places can be hacked like lastpass recently was. You can use one if you want, i dont care. Personally i prefer not to."
ios,3a5o8y,AndyIbanez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:28:14 2015 UTC,1Password stores everything legally unless you manually enable sync.
ios,3a5o8y,xales,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:23:39 2015 UTC,"This is only possible with Keychain because it is automatically decrypted with your login password for applications. It could not happen with 1Password and similar programs, as applications have no access to automated decryption. You must provide the key every time."
ios,3a5o8y,theidleidol,2,Wed Jun 17 14:49:57 2015 UTC,Except it does affect 1Password. The 9to5 reporting leaves it a bit ambiguous but other sites including MacRumors explicitly identify 1Password as a vulnerable app.
ios,3a5o8y,xales,0,Wed Jun 17 15:22:42 2015 UTC,"1Password isn't vulnerable to having anything taken unless you allow it (i.e., complying with a master password request when you didn't expect it) - because it's encrypted (presuming the encrypted data is, in fact, useless). This is untrue of Evernote, Facebook, etc.   The problem with Keychain is that it's possible to hijack the password entry without the user ever having any indication this was happening."

On the whole, I think Spotify is pretty well designed, but there have been some obvious exceptions. One that instantly comes to mind is that it took them forever to update album art for the MBP retina displays. Having big pixelated album covers looked really bad, but they didn't seem to be in any hurry to resize all of the album art photos, even though one person could do that job in a matter of hours.  The problem is not that the green is atypical, it's that it doesn't work for a music app. It jars against the usual aesthetic of album art, and it looks ""soft"" or even ""moldy"" in that context. Arduino uses a darker minty-green color, and there it works fine because in that context it looks like a PC board. Good design and creativity don't have to involve novelty per se, often they shouldn't."

Also, there's always an option to pick from, in most scenarios, i've found Apple maps and Google maps recommend exactly the same results.   FYI, there are instances in Google Maps where it recommends a quick 15 min detour in NY and it makes you drive through the shittiest neighborhood.

I can't remember off of the top of my head what it was but, if you're technically inclined you'll know it when you see it. It should currently say 9.0 since you're on iOS 9. Change it to say 8.3, and you'll be able to restore using that backup. I just did it about a week or so ago, after testing iOS 9.

ios,39qmiw,nfeld9807,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"So is their no way to fix this?   Cause I can easily restore to iOS 9 beta 1, and I'm currently running 8.4 beta right now.  HALP!"
ios,39qmiw,el3v3nty,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:52:57 2015 UTC,"I had this, it was a bad extract of the dl image. I would try unzipping the file again. I think you need to do a restore with the actual 8.3 .ipsw file. But next time, register as a dev with Apple. Hope this helps"

ios,39lyvd,charliewonders,6,Fri Jun 12 17:47:41 2015 UTC,Just want to say that Narwahl is the only reddit app I use and I've tried them all. It really is the best. I love the gesture based voting.  Can't wait for more updates!
ios,39lyvd,Bickell,2,Sat Jun 13 02:12:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you! It really makes me feel great to hear that and I hope we can make it even better for you. Cheers!"
ios,39lyvd,mattkin22,4,Sat Jun 13 02:23:53 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what's the difference between Narwhal and Alien Blue?"
ios,39lyvd,mattkin22,10,Fri Jun 12 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"First off, props to Alien Blue for being the granddaddy of all reddit apps. I used Alien Blue before I even used desktop reddit, so I don't even think I'd be here if it weren't for Jase and his badassness. And big congrats to him on getting acquired by reddit, well deserved.  As far as differences, our goal was to make a faster, funner, simpler app. Lots of gesture based interactions and an emphasis on speed, but also with a design that pays respect to the original reddit.com. Plus an excuse to make some fun narwhal illustrations and animations. :D  There is actually a version that's live in the app store right now, if you'd like to try it out. I apologize if the term beta was misleading at all, but the beta signups are actually for our future monthly updates that we need help with! Sorry for the rushed response here as well... my inbox is going crazy right now with requests! Ahhhhhhh!"
ios,39lyvd,Leandros99,4,Fri Jun 12 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, that alone made me go download the app, which is beautiful by the way. Very well done.  If you're still accepting testers I'd like to help. Sent you a pm."
ios,39lyvd,leemifsud,2,Fri Jun 12 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"I just want to tell you, Narwhal is amazing. By far the best Reddit app for iOS currently. Well done. I really like your recent additions, like sharing a link, and not the reddit comments."
ios,39lyvd,rintintim,2,Fri Jun 12 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so friggn much, that really means a lot. This day is so very unexpectedly awesome."

ios,39lyvd,FlapSnapple,2,Fri Jun 12 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"Great job with narwhal, I have been using for a long time now and would love to try it. I am a experienced user and using an iPhone 6 with iOS 8."

Great job on the App. Surprisingly though I was not able to add a comment on this thread through Narwhal, using Alien Blue for it right now. Also dint find a way to PM someone? I PMed you using Alien Blue for beta testing :)"
ios,39lyvd,crispychoc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I got your PM and added you. :) Currently you can add a comment to a thread by tapping the ellipse icon in the nav bar, then add comment, but we'll be looking to add a shortcut for this soon. You can PM by tapping the messages icon and then the + icon. I'd like to add this on user profiles soon as well. You're doing a fantastic job of beta testing already!"
ios,39lyvd,mgoerlich,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"What features do you currently have implemented for moderators?   This is the #1 thing I look for in a reddit app.  Right now, with Alien Blue, I can access:   Mod Mail Post/comment approval/removal Moderation queue See when something is reported   My dream app would allow me to:    View the actual reason something was reported (not just an orange dot like on Alien Blue) Assigning flair to posts Distinguish comments Sticky posts"
ios,39lyvd,staiano,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"(Sorry for the accidental early reply there a minute ago, my inbox is blowing up so I'm all frazzled.)  Hey Flap, I'm sorry to say we don't have mod tools currently, but it is on our road map. When the time comes I'd love to have you review em when we implement em. I totally understand if you have to stick with another client for now though.  We definitely want to get all those features in eventually! You can check out our todo list here and I'm happy to add any of your requests that aren't in there currently, later on, when I get a minute to breathe. :P  Thanks bud!"

(And documenting the process).  I've moved from AlienBlue after they f'd up with ads on the paid version. Currently fairly happy with bacon reader.  I'm currently running iOS 9 b1 on an iPad mini retina."
ios,39lyvd,rajasekarcmr,2,Fri Jun 12 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"Hey hey, it's iPhone only at the moment but we definitely want to do an iPad app eventually. BaconReader is really nice! For iPad you'll probably want to stick with them, unless you want to run the iPhone version of narwhal all jumbo and stuff, which my dad totally does and loves it (he's 73). :P"
ios,39lyvd,rebo2,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I'm fine with buggy apps... But super sized 2X is where I draw the line.  Are you not doing a universal app?, might want to look at the slide over and multitasking in iOS 9, if you can do that, I'm pretty sure you'll get quite a few users! (It's awesome!)"
ios,39lyvd,rebo2,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Haha, yea, jumbo iPhone apps on iPad are pretty silly. :P  We definitely want to do a universal app, it's just tough to find the time right now between work and family stuff. Someday we will though!  Haven't had a chance to install iOS9 yet but looking forward to it, looked really cool in the wwdc keynote!"
ios,39l0mp,the_Ex_Lurker,11,Fri Jun 12 13:47:54 2015 UTC,"If you see it as a legitimate issue, report it as a bug and they may change it or add the option to help accommodate left handed people. I mean that's why it's in beta right?"
ios,39l0mp,luckynumba77,4,Fri Jun 12 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"I don't really. I haven't used the OS, but it looks like it may be difficult to hit the slivers of cards stacked on each other, so I figured I may as well ask."
ios,39l0mp,luckynumba77,2,Fri Jun 12 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"I think it sounds like a cool idea, doesn't hurt. Plus if they do it after you ask you could say you had a hand in it :)"
ios,39l0mp,GeronimoHero,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, it does not. I've gone through all of the settings options (I always do this with a new beta, in order to find ""hidden"" features; like the ability to hide the iCloud Drive app) and didn't see anything regarding a left hand mode for the new app switcher. I'm pretty confident that the option does not exist."
ios,39l0mp,Aransh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"iOS 9 added RTL alignment across the entire OS, if you use an RTL language.... So go study Hebrew or Arabic if it bugs you that much 😂, as a right handed Hebrew speaker, I kind of hate it... But I can see me getting used to it, just like you'll probably need to get used to the opposite situation... Plus side is, maybe when an iOS 9 jailbreak will be available, some dev will make a tweak to use the built in RTL alignment on LTR languages and vice versa"
ios,39l0mp,cybrian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's crazy! I just switched my iPhone to Hebrew to try it, and it's like looking in a mirror! http://imgur.com/MMNgv6s http://imgur.com/0DfhFR  I don't speak any RTL languages, but I'd totally prefer an RTL app switcher. The reversing of everything else, however, would drive me nuts!"
