Of course, it wouldn't be Oklahoma without football, and I highly recommend going to a game during your stay here.

oklahoma,3dy62s,kuar_z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:38 2015 UTC,Yea that's a good question. Personally i would rather we had the option to export it then not even if there is no place to send it currently.
oklahoma,3dy62s,xcomv01,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:41 2015 UTC,In that case it can be said that you're going to damage as many Oklahoma-based companies as you help since some benefit from the export ban keeping U.S. refineries going full tilt. Without being able to know the full consequences most people will default to not changing the status-quo. But since politicians are involved then they will of course side with whoever bribed donated the most.
oklahoma,3dy62s,LieutenantSnuggles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:58 2015 UTC,The damage is done to the producers who are hurt by prices that are discounted due to lack of global market pricing.

Oil prices are killing us but we used to be able to survive from our natural gas, but it is currently very cheap. If we could ship our gas to say Japan or West Europe at a premium, that would be great for our state and would save a couple jobs in our little company."
oklahoma,3dy62s,LieutenantSnuggles,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:09 2015 UTC,Gas exports aren't banned.  We are actually building LNG export facilities as we speak.
oklahoma,3dy62s,xcomv01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:24 2015 UTC,Ya but it is not a free market yet. /u/kuar_z and I discussed it below.
oklahoma,3dy62s,kuar_z,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:10 2015 UTC,I agree.  The market is far from being a free market but removing export bans will remove some of the barriers to us competing as a global producer
oklahoma,3dy62s,LieutenantSnuggles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:11 2015 UTC,"Most studies I've read in favor of removing the export ban state that it will help drive down gasoline prices in the United States. Unfortunately it would most likely be the opposite. Increased prices of crude would be passed on by the refiner to the the distributor who in-turn passes it onto the consumer. Crude exported overseas to be refined into gasoline would most likely stay local to the refinery area/country/region and not be sold back to the U.S. Seems like the only winner here would be the few companies pulling it out of the ground, with no obvious benefit to the consumer."
oklahoma,3dy62s,kuar_z,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"I see LNG being shipped off long before crude oil does. We have substantial demand for crude domestically and shipping is not cheap.  But natural gas is oversupplied currently. That may change if we switch from coal to gas at our electric facilities, but as of now we have too much gas.  We weren't necessarily drilling for it in the past five years but there is a ton of associated gas in the shale plays.  If we can get into the West Europe market (who has supply concerns with Russia) or even East Asia, that would be great for domestic producers."
oklahoma,3dy62s,LieutenantSnuggles,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:51 2015 UTC,But we already export LNG....
oklahoma,3dy62s,kuar_z,3,Mon Jul 20 19:12:44 2015 UTC,Ya but it is not a free market by any means.  I had no idea the numbers were that minuscule.  Exportation has to be approved by the DOE. Very slow process and the there are too few facilities that we could export from anyways. Apparently there is legislation in the works to speed up the process..

I'll accept that, but what part of history is being preserved? The one where a huge chunk of the country rebelled against the United States? Where the economy was sustained by slavery? Or where rebels were beaten by the United States? Or is it where a people came together, fought for what they believed in? Where it represents a spirit of rebellion like one that birthed this country from colonial times?   If one wants to wave that flag, they MUST accept and own up to how that flag represents an ugly history of repression and hatred. Those that wave the Confederate flag, when was the last time you talked to like minded folk about how the flag represents hatred and where you fit into that view point? When was the last time you talked to a black person about how that flag makes them feel? Do you feel hate towards blacks? If not, what have you done to own up and change how that flag represents an ugly history?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all about everyone having the right to fly whatever flag they want and I defend it. What I cannot stand, though, are bullshit arguements rooted in willful ignorance. If that Confederate flag does not represent hatred to you and yours, but you wish to fly it for historical reasons, you MUST own up to the fact that the rebel flag means HATE to many, many people. If you fly that flag without hate on your heart, I say you have a responsibility to change what that flag means in regards to that hate. Talk to a black person, try to understand what they go through in their life, try to do something that makes the hate nonexistent. Make that flag mean something more than what it is today. Make it something positive, something true.   Don't wallow in willful, ignorant bullshit. You just end up looking and stinking like shit."

If you want to line the maximum number of small shops right next to the road, you want the road as wavy as possible to maximize the length.

Bugs me that we keep building oversize streets halfway through instead of a similarly sized (in terms of area) complete street; the complete streets cost less than filling the whole right of way with one mode and saying fuck it before finishing it...   b.) Improved visibility (which you mentioned)   Winding streets reduce visibility.   c.) Reduce traffic incidents. A by product of A and B.

oklahoma,3dkms7,aaronbyard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:06:51 2015 UTC,Can you describe it? I wish I would have gotten involved in this presidential visit. I didn't realize his jet was so big but i guess I never looked it up.
oklahoma,3dkms7,TriceratopsArentReal,3,Fri Jul 17 05:45:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, here goes...  There's not a lot of information disseminated before the president arrives, at least not to the plebs like me. We usually hear what time he's scheduled to land or take off, but not much more than that. Yesterday was no exception. We had no idea whether he was arriving in a motorcade or being flown in on Marine 1, which was his mode of transport yesterday. I was told that when he arrived Wednesday evening he took a motorcade from the runway to the hotel downtown.  There were people along that fence line all day yesterday. Security forces was telling people to leave most of the morning. I guess they didn't want anyone taking pictures, but there's not a hell of a lot they can actually do to stop you if you're behind the fence. I've seen Air Force One take off and land a few times, so I wasn't too interested, but I was coming in from a smoke break and I ran into my director. She told me he was on his way and was expected to arrive in 5-10 minutes, so I hung around.  So we still don't know if he's driving in or flying in.  We see a OKCPD chopper flying around, and there are cops everywhere around the base. Someone even saw the bomb squad at the OnCue nearby. The OKCPD chopper clears the air space, and a marine chopper does a fly by. Then another marine chopper comes into view, and it's on approach to land. It does just that, and taxis over to the ramp area where AF1 is parked.   The ramp is on the opposite side of the runway from where I work, so you could hardly tell who anyone was, but they let the rotors spin down and a few people got out of Marine 1. They rolled up the stairs and the president and his people boarded AF1, then Marine 1 took off and cleared the air space.  Typically all aircraft have to taxi, wait for clearance, then take off. This was not the case with AF1. It's facing northbound in the picture. They pulled back the stairs, fired up the engines, taxied and made the 180 turn to take off southbound, then left without missing a beat.   I guess I kinda take stuff like this for granted, as I grew up on Air Force bases and I'm now a civilian employee. I've had the opportunity to ride in a KC-135 and refuel The Thunderbirds, and I've seen all types of aircraft take off and land. I dunno what made me hang around yesterday, but it was definitely a cool thing to witness. Everyone seemed so excited that the president was coming through and jumped at the chance to stand along a fence line on a very hot day just to catch a glimpse of him. Occasionally they'll select a handful of people from various squadrons to greet the president when he lands, but I didn't see any emails to that effect this time.   I hope that was a decent description. Like i told u/OsuTechie, if I'd thought about it, I would have brought a camera with me and taken some better pictures. Maybe next time."
oklahoma,3dkms7,TriceratopsArentReal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"Wow that sounds so exciting. I always hear about the commotion that the President makes when he travels anywhere because he is protected like crazy, but seeing it sounds like something really memorable. It almost sounds like a war zone, like every Presidential travel is the most important mission in US history. I would have loved to have seen all of the people employed to keep security and get to see AF1. That sounds like a day not soon forgotten. Great description. You made me feel closer to the experience than I will probably ever get to be."

She will preserve her political viability within the Oklahoma Republican Party no matter what.  In her view,  the job of government is to help the rich.  For example, her state tax cut disproportionately benefitted the rich and the slash in state spending disproportionately hurt the poor.  She wants the people of Oklahoma to be educated and healthy and then they will make better employees for business to hire.  She wants education and good health but she will not spend any money to achieve those goals and she even declines the Affordable Care Act (free) money for Medicaid expansion   She wants to reduce tobacco use because her mother died of cancer but she is afraid to take a strong stand against the tobacco industry.   On a personal note, she became engaged to her first husband while they were in the grotto of the Playboy Mansion.   When they divorced in 1998 it was with the allegation that she had had an affair with a state trooper who acted as her body guard (she was lieutenant governor at the time).  That trooper admitted that he had engaged in  unspecified improprieties on the job and resigned.   Mary Fallin has a 27 year old daughter Christina who is kind of a mess."

She talked to us for a while and even took a picture with my gf.    Unfortunately I think her the state GOP's politics are terrible for Oklahoma. On top of that, I feel that every policy or political battle she gets behind is for the purpose of positioning herself as a true conservative in order to advance her career. I wouldn't be surprised at all if she angles to get on the 2016 GOP ticket as a VP candidate or if she runs for Inhofe's seat when he retires."

It's not a liberal website. It's live science. Open your eyes and realize you've been lied to"

The South was making money from Cotton and thanks to Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin. This made the south a lot of money, so they were able to import goods from Europe and that the south owned 11 of the 12 major ports. That the North couldn't afford, which in turn caused jealousy issues among. So 1st issue Taxes and Tariff's were put on the Southern States. 2nd was the ruling of Nullification of federal acts played a huge deal in the start of the Civil war. Where States felt if a federal act was implemented, they should be given the right to vote on such laws. The Differences in beliefs political and social is the 3rd reason. Slavery was no issue, the south knew they could do exactly what the north was doing to the Irish. Exploit cheap labor for next to nothing. Yet their is a book out called ""the south had it right"" which is accounts of slaves back at the turn of the century. Talking about how their slave owners were kind, have them a home and paid them wages. This is also why so many black soldiers fought for the Confederacy."

Slavery was the reason for succession. Slavery was cited as the primary economical force in the south and they tried to destroy the union because they wanted to keep slavery. This whole glorification of slavery also kinda conflicts with the incredible  problem of lynching in the south. Go take your sack of shit elsewhere.

My forefathers fought a goram war to be a separate and free country from the imperialist British. In case you forgot, the colonies  won that war, and this great country was created. But make no mistake, the forefathers of this country were seen as traitors to the Crown, and would have been hung for that should they have lost the war.   Then, a group of seditious malcontents, with hatred for freedom and liberty in their hearts decided they wanted to destroy this great nation. Thankfully they lost, and this country demonstrated yet again that the forces of freedom and liberty will always triumph over the forces of tyranny and oppression. But, in one of the greatest mistakes in this country's history, the leaders of the United States decided to show kindness.  Those forces that had sought their destruction would not be held responsible for their high treason. Every single filthy rebel was welcomed back into the union as if nothing had happened. Something I can assure you the British would not have allowed.   Sorry you hate America bro, but please feel free to leave my country any time. I hear there are confederates and nazis down in Brazil.

All you liberal yuppies are ridiculous! Jeez I cried when the news came on about the Carolina massacre. Sincerely it is truly heart wrenching and terrible. That shouldn't be the cause or reason a piece of southern heritage and pride is being taken out of stores and off capital grounds. Why not look a little harder into crazy folks buying these firearms, that flag did not cause anything whatsoever. Crazy people are crazy, and those who chose to shoot children and adults, are just NUTS.

No one trying to prohibit the ability to fly the flag, even if you have some backwards ass attachment to the false identity you find in it. What's the point in this ""protest?""

I think the lack of action had to do with the programs he wanted to enact like you mentioned, but also with reelection. He had to consider reelection for his first four years. Also, the current divide in government is sickening. If he goes to far one way than there is no bipartisanship making it impossible to do anything.   Now it doesn't matter at all what he does because in six months both parties will separate themselves from him anyway. I would love to see this sort of domestic focus throughout a presidents term, but I don't think we will see it again for a long time with the current systems and divide in government."

I'm simply voicing the counterpoint.  Also pot head ideas?  Oh you mean ending $80 billion of our tax dollars spent on waging a war we can't win?  And that you clearly would like to continue waging and spending?  Yeah some Libertarian.

Also it is possible to understand that there are many hard working people that need and use food stamps while being upset at the abuse of the system. I pay a lot of taxes and seeing money taken out of my check to be redistributed to people who abuse the system makes me angry. This includes cooperate welfare."

What about social workers, cops, firemen, etc? They all do deserve to get paid way more for the shit they put up with, so are these people just not supposed to pursue careers in those fields and have no right to complain about the low pay because that was their choice?"

That's the lowest national overpayment rate since USDA began the current system of measuring error rates in 1981. The underpayment error rate fell to 0.6 percent, also the lowest on record.   Less than 1 percent of SNAP benefits go to households that are ineligible. In other words, more than 99 percent of SNAP benefits are issued to eligible households.   If one subtracts underpayments (which reduce federal costs) from overpayments, the net loss to the government last year from errors was about 2 percent of benefits. In comparison, 16.9 percent of taxes legally due in 2006 (the most recently studied year) went unpaid, according to Internal Revenue Service estimates.  http://www.cbpp.org/research/snap-error-rates-at-all-time-lows"

If you need assistance I think it should be there - however, if you're a dick weed and making me finance your lazy ass life style because you CAN work but DONT want to work then we have a rather large issue.  Edit:  Wow the downvotes are epic but typical Liberal thinking - that we should assist even those willing ready and able to work but choose not to - it happens and YOUR tax dollars are being wasted because of it.

That was an appalling and uniformed comment. Obviously you did not bother to know the majority of the 604,000 people receiving food benefits in Oklahoma are people who are aging, people with disabilities (including disabled veterans) and the working poor who are raising children. The able-bodied adults who do not have children can only receive food benefits for three months if they are unemployed or must work at least 20 hours a week to receive help beyond that point. Last month, only 13,000 or 2.1% of the total recipients were in this category. Food benefits are a very small amount and are not intended to be a person's entire food budget, thus the name ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program."" In fact, the average SNAP benefit is $4.27 per person per day or $1.42 per meal. The people who need this meager benefit are dependent upon it in order to keep themselves and their children from starving. Is that the kind of dependency you are suggesting we discourage?"""

Im friends with many of the people involved and have been at a few of the night shoots, and yeah theres alot of BS drama setup, but I can assure you none of the racing is staged. There have been arguments about certain races left out of the final cut or what not, and I cant comment on that part, but I can assure you the races you see are real.  Personally, when I watch the show, I condense it down to about 20min by FF all the commercials and other BS and just watch the races haha."

oklahoma,3ctzhk,scaryghosts,8,Sat Jul 11 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"Same here, it's sad seeing all the negativity here and people just constantly on the attack it seems. It's not a proper reflection of what our state or people actually are.  As for Oklahoma stories, some of the best memories of my life are from going to college at Oklahoma State. Some of my worst are from 2011 when my house got hit by an F5. It was a weird time but the community was very kind and helpful to my family when it happened. I love our sports, the Bedlam rivalry, the Thunder that brings both sides together, the way we care for our players and schools. I love the music scene, though I wish it could some day be half as good as Austin, it sure is cheaper to live here and i like that.  Despite the tornados I like the weather in general, we get a little bit of everything. I love the summer storms that don't wreck havoc on houses and other buildings, and I love a good snow storm. Our flag is pretty dope too, can't forget about that. I have a couple questions though, are we in the south, midwest, or south west? My vote goes for southwest, but I dunno. Also, do we have a food we're known for? I've heard onion burgers but again, I dunno."
oklahoma,3ctzhk,CodyHowellMusic,3,Fri Jul 10 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"Midwest? No--maybe the NE-corner, where things blend right on into KS & MO.   South?

I typed out 3 and it was a super long comment... but it was all people just helping each other out with no expectation of return or ulterior motive... so yeah that holds true about us.   *can also reply as others have done with a list of trivia stuffs. Warning.... this still turned out to be a long post :(   I had a history teacher who fought in Vietnam and wrote a book about Oklahoma veterans' perspectives on the Vietnam war. -He also gave a little insight that during the Depression and around that time, because of people looking for work, we had a surge of Oklahomans entering the entertainment history and that has kind of stuck with us.   the big names we all know--- Will Rogers, Gordon Cooper, Jim Thorpe, Woody Guthrie,  But then there's Clarence Nash, originally from Watonga.  You may know him better as the original voice of Donald Duck.  There's also a pretty awesome lady named Mary Blair. She is from McAlester.  She did the concept art for a few little random films called...oh...um... Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Cinderella, among many others. She is someone I cite when people claim Disney did not employ women in the 50s lol...  some of her work  There's Matthew Mungle- the guy who did the makeup for so many movies and is from Atoka--- just... here his his IMDB  there are too many to name but he has had a hand in makeup or prosthetics on so much cinema/film(okay Dracula, Fear and Loathing, the X-Files series, X-Men, Inception, American Sniper among others) but if you can't find one on that list you have seen you probably don't go to movies or watch TV haha  Mercedes Lackey a popular fantasy author is an Okie.  Larry Dixon, a popular fantasy illustrator is an Okie--- he did concept work on the Jackson LOTR franchise.  Nene Thomas.... for those RPG types... she is an Okie who started her career drawing Magic cards. She has had a booth at the Medieval Fair for several years (I have some of her work).   all of those off the top of my head >_>  (i had to look up the links for a couple) - Oklahoma has a creative presence in the rest of the world (and has for awhile!) and that makes me proud. Even if people move away... there is something in the water or something lol... Maybe the bad stuff is merely fuel for all the good songs and stories and art and athleticism and other content Oklahomans are creating?   also at the end of the day... I also really like that if I want to be by myself in nature and nice weather I love that I just have to drive, walk, or bike only a few minutes."

oklahoma,3ctzhk,Baseball_Catch,3,Sat Jul 11 07:12:42 2015 UTC,I'm with you OP. I lived in Caifornia 31 years and moved to Oklahoma in search of something better for me and my family. I think the reason you find a lot of people bitching about it on Reddit is due to the large majority 18-25 age group of the site's (and this subreddit's) members. I love Oklahoma.

As a transplant I have grown to love and respect what this state has to offer. Also, cost of living is amazing.   It has been an absolute pleasure watching OKC turn into a really cool place to hang out. Starting with the emergence of bricktown and now all the little enclaves( plaza district, midtown, uptown.) it's simple fun to watch the growth.   I also have the chance to travel to small towns all over the the state. It is so fun to meet people who enjoy being met.   This is a great state with good friendly people."

I love the natural beauty of Oklahoma. We actually have the most examples of different ecosystems of the states. Exploring lakes, caves, prairies, forests, mountains, deserts, and the stuff in between is fabulous. In Oklahoma you can experience small town festivals. My hometown used to make ""the world's largest pecan pie"" every year and throw a big carnival. You can experience cool and unique urban stuff in Tulsa, especially downtown. I love Oklahoma."

Possibly taking the case before SCOTUS.  http://www.ecapitol.net/viewtext.wcs?HB1330_INT~52nd  I think their defense will hinge on Pleasant Grove City v. Summum along with Van Orden v.

I could not convince him to try any of the local places he hadn't heard of since he moved from Wellston, where he was born and raised, to Portland, 20 years ago.  So we ate a lot at Sonic in Wilburton and Denny's in McA that week.

The other hot thing is Steak & Shake, which is not too bad, though after having a meal take 30 minutes to get to us once, we don't often go there unless we have a lot of time to spare.  I don't really know about the other taco joints in town. Living in OK has got me a little Tex-Mex'd out considering there are SO MANY Tex-Mex/Mexican places to eat everywhere.

oklahoma,3cokss,hoppierthanthou,0,Fri Jul 10 12:46:23 2015 UTC,Right. Because there are so many democrats in Oklahoma.
oklahoma,3cokss,BalooUriza,3,Fri Jul 10 13:32:58 2015 UTC,"There's enough that out of the 27 governors Oklahoma has had, Fallin is only the fourth Republican, and the first Republican to get re-elected.  Traditionally, Oklahoma's rural majority skew center to far left (western Oklahoma being a long-time sure thing for the IWW and the panhandle being the birthplace of the original Communist Party USA) and have been the bulk of the vote; Tulsa and OKC have traditionally skewed conservative and managed to carry a few key low-voter-turnout elections in recent years.  Also, keep in mind, in the last 5 years, the average number of registered voters has only been around 30% of the total population and voter turnout rarely exceeds half of that."
oklahoma,3cokss,hoppierthanthou,0,Fri Jul 10 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"You just said that the major cities are center-left, but that OKC and Tulsa are conservative. What other big cities are there? I have met very few like minded liberals since I have lived here."

It's crazy that we have so many elected officials in Oklahoma who apparently never took a civics class in middle school.

We do our best to make it look like we barely give a shit to share the same space with Native American culture. Everywhere it seems Native American's live in poverty in this state. If we valued things so much then why is that demographic probably the worst one??   Oklahoma: ""Yea we got oil, and some native american stuff too."" That's how I feel this state looks at itself. My opinion though, so I'm glad I guess somebody has a positive outlook on it."

Our state flag and even name are of Native American Influence. I think I learned about the trail of tears in what, 4th or 5th grade? And then deeper in high school. It's not enough, it's probably too late for enough people to care enough, but it's something I feel our state is doing better than most. If only because most of us share a % of that heritage."

And that ""the liquor distributors""  are just run by couple of very wealthy families here in Oklahoma. I'm not very versed on commerce and how liquor sales work,  but is there any truth to this?   It doesn't make sense as to why you can't buy beer,  wine,  or liquor at any store and on any day.  The other states that allow normal liquor sales don't appear to be bursting into flames... So I suppose that if it is not ""religion"" that's keeping these laws on the books,  then it's because someone is making more money now, and would lose money if the laws changed."

oklahoma,3c7tvy,Bigninja,4,Sun Jul 5 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"They lobby very hard to keep package stores from getting refrigeration. We witnessed that this last session. They will not allow refrigeration without abolishing dual strength, allowing them to sell any beer, and getting to sell wine."

oklahoma,3c7tvy,SomeRandomMax,2,Mon Jul 6 00:49:03 2015 UTC,"SB383 was originally just about allowing package stores to put in refrigeration, should they choose. After SB383 made its way out of Senate Committee, where it was questioned on the issue of fairness because it would allow package stores a special right (cold high point beer) that other outlets couldn't have), the convenience store and grocery store lobby worked to get the bill amended to abolish 3.2 laws and to allow them to sell wine."
oklahoma,3c7tvy,hiddenforce,2,Mon Jul 6 00:52:17 2015 UTC,That would be the most sensible. The current law is absurd.  Not directly related-- can you currently buy 3.2 beer on Sundays? Is there a time cut off for buying it?

oklahoma,3c7tvy,Leoofmoon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:05:22 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to abolish 3.2 laws is to simply raise the ABV cap on what currently constitutes ""weak"" beer.  Raise it to 15% and most beer and wine falls under the laws the currently govern low-point beer.  However, doing this alone would be all benefit for grocery/gas stations and none for liquor stores.  Also included in the deal must be the ability for liquor stores to sell chilled beer, later hours and Sunday sales, and also the ability for liquor stores to sell accessories like wine openers as well as non-alcoholic items."

Some of the changes that they made allow for 64 ounce growler sales on Sunday and bars are now allowed to sell hard liquor before 10 a.m. on Sundays.

They generally only sell low-mileage, high quality vehicles, and are very transparent about what is right/wrong with the vehicle.    You could probably buy a similar car for a bit cheaper at other dealers, but it'd take a lot more work to locate said vehicle in that condition and then negotiate down the price, which can be very difficult; for me I considered the whole experience and ease of buying part of the price, which was worth it for me."

With the new car interest rate being better than used it was almost a wash.   First narrow it down to maybe 3 cars you would like to get. Use true car to find what the price range is for it.   You can then use autotrader to search local inventory. I like to look in 100+ mile radius, I don't mind driving for a deal.   If you find one you like email the dealership. They will usually give you a ""no haggle Internet price"".  That's what they would like you to believe anyway.  They can always do better.   If it seems doable head up and go for a test drive.

Hit up a local credit union or bank for a preapproval. Go in with your guns loaded and make them beat your preapproval.   Just pay attention to what you're signing and you'll be okay. And if your gut says walk, Do it. There's another car just like it or better just around the Corner.  Just  do your homework. It's ok for the dealer to make money off of you, Just don't let them make it all off of you."
oklahoma,3c82sn,Random_CAPS_guy,-4,Tue Jul 7 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"You're better off taking the money you would put into a payment and put that into savings instead for two or three years, then just pay cash out the door (or at least such a freaking massive down payment that keeping the loan open is just building you credit for a couple bucks a month and that you can pay off pretty much whenever you damn well please).  Generally speaking, taking out credit should be considered an option of last resort when you're in dire straits.  You're better off them owing you interest (meager as that might be) and taking the bus or riding a bike in the mean time, than you are owing them between a few basis points and a few entire percentage points more.  Especially when you consider that owing money on a car usually greatly raises your insurance premiums to levels rarely seen by people who have their car paid off short of having a recent DUI resulting in a crash.  That said, when you go car shopping for a used car (and especially with a chain dealer like CarMax), be prepared to 1) either spend a lot of time and money fixing a car, if not getting stuck with a car that has a salvage title that can't be registered without a LOT of paperwork, if at all (seen this happen a LOT to carmax customers), or 2) independently verify everything.  Take it to a mechanic you trust and spend the money to get them to find as many potential reasons to NOT buy the car as possible and see if you can live with that result.  Don't trust their copy of the carfax, spend the money to run it yourself (and take it with a grain of salt, carfax invariably misses some shit)."

Volunteer at the food bank.  Take meals to the elderly.  Feed the homeless. Why work for free,  when you need money?  I'll explain.  When you give your time freely (and don't bitch and complain while you're doing it)  you make networking connections with people who can later help YOU.  You also grew and mature as you learn more about the community around you,  so you may become wiser.  Also,  if the courts see you volunteering BEFORE trial,  you can make a defense for yourself that there is something useful that you can offer to the community.    In the end,  you need to make yourself a better person in several ways.  Be smarter.  Be useful.  Be someone who can provide for others.

As far as I know I've never heard of a company doing another background check once you get in the door. (Well outside of jobs that require security clearances, government, and what not) be a good employee, work hard, and you'll have a good chance at working your way up.

oklahoma,3c6l6w,zombie_overlord,3,Sun Jul 5 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"Ever consider rehab?  I had to go last year because things that I thought I had under control escalated to no longer being under control.  Anyway, while I was there, I heard a lot of stories that sounded similar to yours.  I also heard a lot that were a lot more hopeless, but they started out like yours.  I'm not judging at all.  I did all those things when I was your age, too (and well past).  It took me a lifetime to finally realize that I was getting what I wanted in the moment (high, partying with people who were usually laughing AT me rather than WITH me) at the expense of what I truly wanted out of life - a good job, real friends, a family that wasn't always disappointed in me, and eventually a family of my own.  Anyway, getting fucked up just isn't all that much fun anymore.  I now have what I wanted - a good job, family, etc, and I almost lost it all, so I checked in to rehab for 30 days and dried out.  It's amazing the fog I was walking around in without realizing it.  It was also a good period of time for a lot of objective introspection.  I reminded myself of what really mattered to me.  On top of all that, if you decided to do something like rehab, judges typically view that favorably and that can be reflected in your sentence.  If you do have a kid on the way, you'll need all the favors you can scrape up.  If you or your family have the funds, Valley Hope in Cushing has literally saved my family.  My wife went there - she had issues, too - and she's got multiple years clean now, but more importantly, our problems are now just regular problems instead of earth shattering, life changing calamities involving law enforcement, attorneys, or hospitals.  I work 40+ hours a week at a fortune 500 company, my wife is relatively successful in her hairdressing thing she's doing, and our children have kid issues (homework sucks, that teacher is mean, boys are gross, etc) and no longer have to deal with adult issues.  If you don't have the funds, there are other places that will let you in, but there's usually a waiting list.  Anyway, I hope I'm not totally off base here.  Maybe you just sell, and never touch it, but in my experience, that's really rare.  Consider rehab as an option.  You will probably learn something about yourself.  Probably a lot of things.  Anyway, good luck with everything.  I hope things turn out well."
oklahoma,3c6l6w,projectFT,3,Sun Jul 5 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"People are giving you shit for being irresponsible...you're 16. You know you fucked up. What you need is some actual advice you can use instead of people telling you not to sell drugs. Here's what I would have told 16 year old me if I could have....oddly enough your situation is very similar to the situation 18yr old me found himself in.  You're life isn't over. You've fucked up and now have a lengthy criminal record, but you are under 18 which is probably the most responsible thing you've done. Being a minor when racking up drug charges is actually a good thing considering the situation. You're going to be on probation and stuff for awhile, but after you finish your community service and can move out of your parents place or wherever you currently live you probably want to get out of the neighborhood. Do it as soon as you can afford to and are legally allowed to. If the cops you drive past on your way to work every day know that you're a drug dealer they're going to make your life hell. Your best bet is going to be saving up some money and moving to a bigger city. In a big city it's easy to lay low and there are going to be more options for you as far as jobs and/or tech or trade school is concerned, which is not something you should be counting out at this point because you are too fucking young to be giving up on anything yet. If you already live in a big city, you probably know the areas you need to stay out of. Don't put yourself in situations that will violate your probation.  Some people are going to think that telling you to move is callous considering you may have a kid on the way, but you're just a kid. If you have a child that you want to be responsible for at some point, you need to get your shit together now. Staying at home mowing lawns all summer or working construction is not the right approach. Sure, it's a trade you can learn and make some money in, but you don't want to decide what you are going to do for the rest of your life when you're 16...and you especially don't want to pick that job because it was the easiest to get and closest to home. Get your GED or graduate from high school if that is still possible and then get into a tech program and learn something like coding or web-developing (you can do this on your own for free in a matter of months. Khanacademy is awesome or checkout r/wedev and r/learnprogramming) and develop a skill that can make you money. You can freelance webdev work even with a felony record, but that isn't going to be a problem because you are going to get all of your community service shit done, pass ALL of your piss tests and get off probation before you turn 18 so you don't end up in prison for a stupid probation violation as an adult.  If the kid ends up being yours, even if you end up being a deadbeat dad or it goes up for adoption, you're always going to know that you brought a kid into a mostly cruel world, with most of the odds already stacked against it. Judging from your post history you're into expensive video games and sneakers. You either fund those luxuries by selling drugs or you have decent parents at home that buy you shit you want and need, and you sold drugs because it was easy and profitable. If that's the case then let your parents or her parents help raise the kid while you get through school or learn some skills that can you can make a living with. Your newborn kid won't need his 16 year old drug dealer father as much as he needs his 22 year old father to have a decent job and a rational/mature outlook on life.   I don't like putting personal stuff on reddit, but I want you to know that the reason I wrote out this lengthy reply is because when I was 18 I didn't have anyone to tell me any of this shit. I was still in high school when my girlfriend got pregnant with my now 14 year old son. Then the spiral of self destruction that comes with accidently becoming a father as a teenager lead to multiple arrests, addiction, depression etc. If I were to introduce myself to that kid today, he wouldn't recognize me. He'd never believe the things I've accomplished, the places I've been, the relationships I've made over the last 15 years. Don't give up on yourself dude. You know how to use the internet, so there's basically nothing you can't learn to do or learn about if you're willing to put in the time and effort.   Also, use a fucking condom from now on. It sucks being a teenager and having to deal with adult things, but if you're going to hookup with a girl you need to not get her pregnant. Lookup ""plan B or the morning after pill and get a good understanding of how it and the female body works. This may also sound fucked up, but it's not and shouldn't be...if you are having casual sex with a girl that isn't on birth control you need to talk to her about her views on abortion and then consider if having sex with her is worth the risk of having another kid. You don't want to have an abortion, no one does, but you need to know if that's an option the two of you will have if you're going to keep having sex. Even protected sex. At the very least be able to talk to her about things like Plan B because it's cheap and can save both of your asses the day after a condom breaks or when you have unprotected sex. You don't want ANY kids in this equation, but you definitely don't want another kid. Basically, just don't make things harder than they already are. No more kids. No more drugs while you're on probation because it's risky to hold and you'll have to take piss tests that you need to pass or you'll be on probation longer. No more acting like a kid. It sucks, and you're probably gonna keep fucking up and acting like a kid for a while longer because that's what kids do. But, you can't do that shit forever and still have a decent life. You are better to realize that sooner rather than later."

oklahoma,3c4g6v,JohnDux,0,Sun Jul 5 21:22:56 2015 UTC,I can agree with most of what you said. Won't happen though so the actual steps being acted upon in our lifetime needs to be the correct ones. John Doe can try and sue all the fracing companies they want but it'll be an extremely long wait before anything is done. Where as there is technology today  that can clean the water and help limit the amount injected. Which would help with earthquakes if it's already not too late as it is. The people who sue aren't going to go for stopping fracing they are going to go seeking damages as it is. If you are going to go at the only industry in Oklahoma at least try and go for a positive result. The thought of killing oil and gas today and having renewable energy to take over tomorrow without any dependence on oil like wind energy does today is insane and would collapse Oklahoma.
oklahoma,3c4g6v,logicloop,7,Sun Jul 5 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure there are a lot of other factors trying to make Oklahoma implode, not just oil, but I'll grant you that if oil got sued into the ground, that would be the big giant match to the even bigger powder keg.    However oil isn't exactly altruistic in their endeavors, stonewalling and manipulating policies both at local and state level where they can gain ground to stall any and all attempts at renewable energies, literally throwing litigation at the wall and seeing what sticks.  I understand, they're a business, have shareholders to please, and they are in the business to make money and protect their bottom line.  Because of that though, I don't have to have sympathies towards them and the corner they've painted themselves into. Resources have to run out sometime, and them squeezing every drop they can suggests to me that they know it.  Instead, if they WERE altruistic and helped renewable energies along instead of hamstringing attempts to proliferate renewable technologies, I imagine that would also garner some good will from the state and its help to help inject funds, hopefully, to help incentivise them to keep it up.  Again, I know a lot of jobs depend on them and our economy as a whole, and I'm all for a business as a squirrel out to get their nut, but my understanding stops dead in its tracks when they start damaging property along the way.  While the fallout if lawsuits are successful may be unfortunate, at this point it's a necessary evil and they need a broken nose instead of a slap on the wrist.    Not saying kill them off entirely as they ARE needed, but they need to be litigated into submission so they are more compliant with the wishes of the public instead of just their own."
oklahoma,3c4g6v,JohnDux,-1,Sun Jul 5 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me Bruh. Although I know a lot of oil companies do help support some growth into renewables. Probably not as much a they should and probably not the right way but they are to a degree, whether that helps you or anyone out doesn't matter to me. There will be another well for my family and I, and those that I help along the way tomorrow. I just don't like the way everything falls back to fracing, just seems dumb overall  to pin point it on that. I guess I just get burnt out on the same thing getting hit when there's easily others to attack."
oklahoma,3c4g6v,logicloop,2,Sun Jul 5 04:12:50 2015 UTC,"Barring everything that we've already discussed about how it is a needed industry, at least for the time being, I think a similar way to phrase the argument is people are angry that bullets are killing people so they want to ban guns.

But Judge Joe Heaton said the image itself isn't religious. He said a ""reasonable observer"" would not believe that the state is trying to promote a set of certain beliefs.  ""A reasonable observer would likely assume something akin to what the evidence suggests Oklahoma was trying to convey -- that Oklahoma is Native America, or some formulation similar to that,"" Heaton wrote.

oklahoma,3bowl9,skipper14,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:07:35 2015 UTC,"Cameron Todd Willingham:       Cameron Todd Willingham (January 9, 1968 – February 17, 2004) was an American man who was convicted of murdering his three young children by arson at the family home in Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004.  Willingham's case and the investigative techniques were criticized by a 2004 Chicago Tribune article. The case was discussed again in a 2009 investigative report in The New Yorker.  This coverage suggested that the arson evidence was unconvincing. The 2011 documentary, Incendiary: The Willingham Case, also explored the case. According to an August 2009 investigative report by an expert hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission, the original claims of arson were doubtful.  The Corsicana Fire Department disputes the findings, stating that the report overlooked several key points in the record.   The case has been further complicated by allegations that Texas Governor Rick Perry impeded the investigation by replacing three of the nine commission members in an attempt to change the commission's findings; Perry denies the allegations.

Cases of wrongful execution are cited as an argument by opponents of capital punishment, while proponents suggest that the argument of innocence concerns the credibility of the justice system as a whole and does not solely undermine the use of death penalty.    A number of people are claimed to have been innocent victims of the death penalty.   Newly available DNA evidence has allowed the exoneration and release of more than 17 death row inmates since 1992 in the United States,  but DNA evidence is available in only a fraction of capital cases. Others have been released on the basis of weak cases against them, sometimes involving prosecutorial misconduct; resulting in acquittal at retrial, charges dropped, or innocence-based pardons. The Death Penalty Information Center (U.S.) has published a list of 10 inmates ""executed but possibly innocent"".  At least 39 executions are claimed to have been carried out in the U.S. in the face of evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt.   In the UK, reviews prompted by the Criminal Cases Review Commission have resulted in one pardon and three exonerations for people executed between 1950 and 1953 (when the execution rate in England and Wales averaged 17 per year), with compensation being paid.

In this case, the law in the OK constitution is actually more restricting than the US constitution, but it is absolutely consistent with it.  The only recourse they really have is to change the OK constitution, but even then the the monument would almost certainly be unconstitutional under the US constitution. The SCOTUS ruled that the 10 commandments on the Texas capitol grounds was legal because the monument itself was historically relevant. This monument was installed in 2012. It has absolutely no historical significance.   the AG is now trying to argue that the 10 commandments themselves are historically relevant, but that argument really does not hold any water at all. Other similar monuments have been ruled unconstitutional, so I see no reason to believe this one would be allowed, even with the current court.  Edit: It appears that the first paragraph is incorrect. You can try a state issue in federal court, but it is an entirely different legal process it seems. It would not be an appeal, and I think at this point they cannot use that route.  http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/legal-writing-scholarship/writing-center/upload/which_court_is_binding_painter-and-mayer-final.pdf  Edit 2: No, I was right the first time-- the ruling could be appealed to the SCOTUS if there was an apparent conflict between the state and federal constitution, though in this cases there is not.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court  ""Federal courts may overrule a state court only when there is a federal question, which is to say, a specific issue (such as consistency with the Federal Constitution) that gives rise to federal jurisdiction."""

If so, how would you feel if Christians were no longer in the majority (your numbers are declining) and you had to live by the laws of another religion when they came in to the majority, for example, if Muslims were in the majority.  Would you want separation of church and state then?  3.) You mentioned the gay marriage decision as an example of why God is turning his back on us in another post.  If we should be ruled by the laws of the bible, which ones?  Who gets to decide which ones ""God is really serious about""?  As you sit there you are breaking a law in the bible just a few versus from the ONLY line in the bible that can be interpreted as a law against gay relationships.  I'll bet 10 to 1 that your clothes are made from mixed fibers.  The bible makes no differentiation as to which of the two are more hellworthy offenses.  And what of the other laws in the bible?  Do you support stoning prostitutes?  What about slavery and concubines?  There are laws that grant people slaves and concubines as penalties for certain offenses.  How about polygamy?  It's all over the bible.  It's ok for a man to marry ten women, but not be in a comitted relationship to one other man?"
oklahoma,3bn5iq,jverity,3,Wed Jul 1 06:35:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's specifically in the constitution.  I was sure it was in a letter referring to the first amendment from Jefferson to a church.     The concept was not to prevent the church from interfering with the state, but the opposite.   That the state would not endorse any particular religion, so that Americans would have the freedom of practicing whatever religion, or non religion that they pleased.   I figure the idea that a church in America being able strongly influence government was a silly idea at the time, as was government endorsement.  I think it's wrong for a religion to influence government and vice versa, which is what separation of church and state is about.  It's why America should not give special amenities to any religion to maintain neutrality.   I think people who misunderstand  and misuse the origin and meaning of this phrase undermine the reputability of the idea and the boons we enjoy because of it.  If I'm wrong and this phrase actually exists  verbatim in the constitution, then I apologize,  but I don't remember this idea originating directly from it, but is supported by it instead, as a separate idea."

It's the establishment clause.  The first amendment.  Most definitely in the constitution.  It doesn't just mean the obvious, that congress can't endorse a religion by making it the state religion, or official religion.  It also means that you can't make a law specifically to respect a religion's beliefs, as in, if you can not justify a need for the law without using a religious text, then the law is enforcing your religious beliefs on people who may not share them and as such, breaks this clause.  It's unconstitutional.  Which is why all the gay marriage bans were doomed from the onset, there's no logical reason for them outside of religion."

The first link is an example of how alcohol prohibition was damaging to our society. The second link is the Portugal Experiment. They decriminalized all drugs, and then offered treatment to any users caught with drugs. Guess what happened? No, the answer is not that society went down the drain, everything failed, more people were on drugs...they actually have shown a DECREASE in drugs and crime, and have saved money on incarceration."

oklahoma,3bi6y6,theStingraY,4,Mon Jun 29 17:25:29 2015 UTC,Wrong again.  Are you referring to black market drug sales and its effects on your own community? Legalization breaks down black market sales; taxation provides state revenue; state revenue brings better education for all.

oklahoma,3bi6y6,CharlestonChewbacca,3,Mon Jun 29 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"If we knew each other you'd be surprised at how false that is. I used multiple links to prove that marijuana is not the cause of any community issues you might be currently going through. It is commonly used as a scapegoat by those who stand to lose money from its legalization. Here's what the facts show, particularly since Colorado's legalization has given us real world numbers:  Pros: Provided Colorado with $700 million in new tax revenue that has been used at all levels of state funding from education to infrastructure to healthcare to the police. It has caused a massive decrease in black market sales as well as teen use across the board. It has also prevented incarceration of people who have never committed a violent crime. It has been shown to help with many ailments and diseases including epilepsy, cancer, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's, chronic pain and inflammatory diseases, as well as PTSD.  Cons: More power to the black markets, further enabling their distribution and power over communities. More money for private prisons who don't care about individual livelihood. More money for insurance companies who use the system to line their pockets instead of providing medicine for their patients.  I understand that there will be a lot of people who will use marijuana recreationally, and that is their personal choice; although marijuana has no known permanent side effects, unlike alcohol or tobacco. As a personal example though - my cousin suffers from Crohn's disease. He developed it from the side effects of epilepsy medication he was given as a child. He has spent most of his adult life paying hundreds of dollars a month for medication to solve the same problems caused by these medication. Marijuana has been shown to be more effective than any other current medications for the treatment of Crohn's, and he could grow it in his backyard for 5% of the cost he is currently paying monthly.  My point with this example is don't let the current prejudicial view of marijuana keep you from allowing people to receive a more natural and side effect free treatment."

This article is focused on the benefits of a non-mind altering form of THC extract that has proven to be beneficial to the suppression of epileptic seizures with a cost of next-to-nothing. But you continue to bring up how it's economically immoral and nothing more. You look at marijuana like it's a danger to society because that's what you have been told all your life by programs that simply state ""Just Say No"" but never tells you why outside of being illegal. You state that the well of marijuana in black communities has harmed them. Do you not understand that the main harm comes from the fact that it's illegal and is a large buy and demand substance that criminals use to their advantage? Would you rather have a kid in a low-income community resort to selling illegal narcotics to other kids because it's a quick money game and risk prison time or learn to sell and produce something legally that has a large market and can make a possible future for themselves?  You seem like a very religious person, so let me ask you this.

oklahoma,3bk3hc,programwitch,4,Mon Jun 29 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"This article does a very good job of explaining the historical roots for the strong support the Democratic party has had in Little Dixie but, I think it falters when it tries to explain why it has declined.   Fox News and Racism probably aren't statistically significant when compared to the effects of the extreme polarization of politics on a national level we've seen in the last 20 or so years. I think it's entirely more likely that the Democrats lost Little Dixie because they have marginalized the social conservatives among them and pushed them out, the rise and decline of the Blue Dog Democrats pretty perfectly illustrates this. Little Dixie is just a microcosm of what's happening on a national level, where both parties have seen a transformation in which social policies increasingly decide your affiliation."

Built roads and school buildings and bridges. And of course, my grandpas remembered elder poverty, which virtually doesn't exist now.  The stories they told of the old days, weren't exactly nostalgic. And they were all New Deal supporters.  Like you, I was all pro-Reagan in high school. then, at some point, I actually read some 'history' , some factual accounts of the events of the 80's like cutting and running in Beirut, invading Grenada for the hell of it, CIA shenanigans in Central America, etc, etc, etc... Combined with a completely lackadaisical approach to the actual task of governance, this really made me question the value of the GOP. And while I didn't start the 90's as a Clinton fan, I ended the 90's as a GOP opponent. The ridiculousness of the GOP behavior when they didn't have the presidency was over the top, inexcusable. Newt Gingrich alone was reason enough to turn my back on that party, but David Vitter, Tom DeLay and a host of other unsavory characters sealed the deal.  And now 75% of my classmates are die-hard Fox watchers / GOP cheerleaders, and I hate facebook."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see.

oklahoma,3bfwtx,whaddup_pup,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:17:59 2015 UTC,"I'll be fishing from shore for a while before I can afford a canoe. I like to go after just about anything, bass, northern, walleye, etc. I'm from Minnesota so I'm not sure if the species are the same down south or not."
oklahoma,3bfwtx,whaddup_pup,3,Mon Jun 29 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"I'm down south of OKC and haven't done a ton of fishing up around Stillwater, but I can tell you that you'll have a lot more fun with a canoe or kayak anywhere in OK. Shore access can be pretty limited at a lot of our lakes and public piers/shelters get pretty crowded.   Depending on the lake you can catch largemouth, white bass (aka sand bass), perch, hybrid striper, saugeye (my fav for eating), crappie  (second fav), and blue and channel cats.   Keystone is a nice lake but it's a little ways away from Stillwater (like 45m). That'd be my first choice though. After that, McMurtry and Carl Blackwell can be good too. I've heard Sooner is good for striper and hybrid striper but I've never fished it.   Generally IMO the best fishing is in the spring when the crappie are spawning and the sand bass are running. It's a little slow in the summer but if you like drinking beer with a line in the water waiting on catfish then summer's good too. Get a cast net if you don't already have one to catch live shad. They're the best bait around here for stripers, cats, and saugeye/walleye.  I could give you better advice if you were in my neck of the woods but hopefully I gave you somethin to start with.    BTW forgot to mention that we had a ton of flooding in May and June and so most of the lake levels are really high. It's made fishing tough and a lot of public access areas are closed."
oklahoma,3bfwtx,route66,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Kaw Lake is not bad. It's up by Ponca City and may be a bit of haul from Stillwater but certainly no further than Keystone.

It was Disney's first feature film using live actors, who provide a sentimental frame story for several animated segments. The film depicts the character Uncle Remus, presumably a former slave, cheerfully relating to several children, including the film's protagonist, the folk tales of the adventures of anthropomorphic Br'er Rabbit and his enemies, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. The film's song ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Song, is frequently used as part of Disney's montage themes, and has become widely used in popular culture. James Baskett was given an honorary Academy Award in 1948 for his portrayal of Uncle Remus; the first Oscar (although an honorary one) to an African-American actor. The film inspired the Disney theme park attraction Splash Mountain.

oklahoma,3b550b,ghostfacekhilla,3,Fri Jun 26 13:20:27 2015 UTC,Oh I agree but it's the only way they have to get anywhere. Once it is accepted that it is not an evil thing then they can start a conversation about recreational use.   I think they are killing two birds with one stone so to speak.   Every state that has accepted decriminalization and legalization has had to first gain medical use. It is the only path that has softened rigid opposition to even allow a discussion.   People in the 60s and 70s tried with no luck for years. It's not their fault the general public has been so misinformed that they have to use roundabout tactics to change public opinion enough to even have a debate on the issue.

So kids can get their oil, veterans like Cody Young don't have to commit suicide by cop, and maybe I can the proper medication for my family members that have cancer.

oklahoma,3ay385,okie_gunslinger,2,Wed Jun 24 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"Kinda yes but kinda no at the same time. The rectangular battle flag was widely (and unquestionably) associated with Confederate soldiers, and in Oklahoma we had lots of migrant Confederate veterans, their reunions, etc. and that flag was pretty widespread and (I guess ignorantly) used to represent the South. It's surprisingly present in a lot of random stuff that I've seen from vintage Oklahoma pictures. I was poking through one of the old redskin yearbooks from OSU's online collection and there's this one picture in like 1950 that has these smiling kids holding the battle flag with the caption ""the South will rise again!"". In the early days of statehood there were lots of small Confederate reunions where the battle flag is everywhere and actually I think the national UCV reunion was held in Tulsa one year.   But ya that flag is typically not accurate in the context of government, but I doubt that it was really questioned when it was flown in 1966."

That is what I meant. Of course it has had a cultural significance to the people that lived here, but in the context of countries which controlled Oklahoma at one time or another it's out of place. I think it's historically interesting that the Battle Flag is viewed so universally as flag of the Confederacy, while the official flags are practically unknown to non-historians."
oklahoma,3ay385,okie_gunslinger,2,Wed Jun 24 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"I think the states that are just now taking down the battle flags have small memorials commemorating the Confederate veterans from each state and that's the reasoning behind the flag being there, while in Texas they fly the ""stars and bars"" to indicate that they were once controlled by the Confederacy.

oklahoma,3aytdn,RoninRobot,10,Wed Jun 24 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"Geologist here. The problem a lot of people have is that they don't understand the difference between injection wells and fracking, and many media reports on the matter conflate the two. Injection wells are the cause of the earthquakes, not fracking. Historically, Oklahoma has injected wastewater resulting from oil production (all oil production, not just fracked wells) into (edit: forgot actual formation name). This formation is the deepest sedimentary body in the state. The upside of this is that it removes any chance of contaminated water reaching the surface. The downside is it is lying right on top of the basement rock which has no permeability or porosity, and is the location of all of the major fault systems. When the sand gets overfilled, and the water has nowhere to go, that can trigger an earthquake. In addition, putting all of this wastewater down into the formation can lube up the faults so to speak. When production ramped up in the state, so did the need for waste water disposal. This is where regulatory efforts need to be focused. We thoroughly understand the formations we frack and produce from because we don't want to waste our money on a dry hole, but there is a tendency to just blindly place injection wells without a thorough study of the framework of the system."
oklahoma,3aytdn,hoppierthanthou,4,Wed Jun 24 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"the Misener sand. This formation is the deepest sedimentary body in the state   That is incredibly incorrect. The deepest sedimentary rocks are the Reagan sand (where it exists) and the Arbuckle group, both of which are FAR below the Misener (which is actually a production zone, not usually a disposal zone).    When the Misener gets overfilled, and the water has nowhere to go, that can trigger an earthquake.   Not quite how that works. I'll paste an old post of mine on the subject:  Geologist here. Any faults with enough stress to cause ""feelable"" earthquakes are going to be fairly deep. Like you pointed out earlier, the disposal wells go much deeper - more or less to the bottom of the stratigraphic section. I used to do mud logging on wells and sat a few Arbuckle disposals - we drilled all the way to granite.   There is quite a bit of stress in the continental interior which does cause earthquakes on occasion. Anyone who's interested in the extreme example of this should read up on the New Madrid Seismic Zone which has historically produced some monsters. These mid-continent earthquakes are relatively rare though, as we do not have active plate boundaries (e.g. California) or compressive tectonics (e.g. Himalayas).  The effect of disposal wells on earthquakes is this: Higher fluid contents make rocks weaker. When you saturate a porous rock with fluids, you greatly reduce the stress it can take before fracture. This is exactly what deep disposal wells do to the porous rocks that are sitting on top of motionless basement faults. Also, there is a decent chance that the fault zones themselves can soak up some of these fluids, making ""stable"" fault zones weaker (allowing them to slip) and the rocks above them weaker (breaks easier, which also has a slight effect on whether faults can move by offering a bit less resistance).   Fracking uses relatively small fluid volumes (that are also subsequently removed), and is usually done much closer to the surface than the rocks which actually matter in terms of faulting. If a well is fracked very deep or happens to be placed right on a fault, there is the potential to trigger very small earthquakes. In general though, it doesn't reach the depths necessary to activate important faults and doesn't have the fluid volumes or sustained effects on rock strength necessary to have a major impact on earthquakes. It's too shallow, too small and too fast.  Deep disposal wells, on the other hand, are pumping massive volumes of fluids deep enough to affect basement faults, and these fluids in some areas have now been present for several decades. You've got large volumes of fluid reducing rock strength over a non-negligible amount of time."

oklahoma,3aytdn,OKVoter,3,Wed Jun 24 18:22:02 2015 UTC,Sure. It will probably be best if I do it during the weekend so I have time to actually answer questions instead of just browsing reddit during my lunch break like I am now.
oklahoma,3aytdn,hoppierthanthou,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:27:57 2015 UTC,Here is a short write up I wrote that summarizes the difference between fracking and disposals.
oklahoma,3aytdn,LieutenantSnuggles,5,Thu Jun 25 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"Relying on oil or natural gas at all is a mistake. Our state will collapse when this bubble bursts. This year has been a preview of what is to come, and our leadership is doing nothing about it because they'll all be out of office or dead when the oil and gas money runs out."
oklahoma,3aytdn,metamars,3,Wed Jun 24 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the reliance of fossil fuels is a mistake, the problem is solvable, especially when it becomes too expensive to sustain fossil fuels. Look back to 4 years ago when gas was edging up to $5 a gallon and EVs, hybrids and alternate forms of transportation were getting major attention. Just today Tesla announced that Model S drivers have driven more than 1B miles. Electric cars have been around since cars were invented. It's the batteries that are the problem, which I believe science can solve when the big oil opposition cannot sustain it's suppression. Look at last year when Fallin signed the tax increase on people who used personal solar and wind energy. Then just two weeks ago I read that OGE is trying to pass a tariff on those same people. Why is that? They say it's a burden on the system. I think it's an attempt to sweep back the ocean, at least for a little while. The reality is that we are using fossil fuels now and will for the next 30 years at least. If it wasn't for oil, would our state have collapsed already? I'm old enough to remember the 80's collapse and how bad it was. There was still money and jobs, and if we plan for it and adjust, who knows?"
oklahoma,3aytdn,metamars,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"Is planning for things and adjusting really what our state does, though? Because it seems like our primary strategy is just barely doing enough damage control to keep the lights on."
oklahoma,3aytdn,OklaPie,-4,Wed Jun 24 17:56:35 2015 UTC,"While it's easy to dismiss government or big business, I do believe they know what's going on. They can't deny that fracking is causing earthquakes and they're wary of renewable energy, citing my examples above. As far as OGE is concerned, I can still afford my electric bill and can cut a large percentage of my usage immediately if I can't. Also I have owned my house for a long time and the longest I have been without power is maybe 3 hours... one time."
oklahoma,3aytdn,LieutenantSnuggles,2,Wed Jun 24 18:17:37 2015 UTC,If they really cared about energy security and knew what was going on then fossil fuels would have been left behind awhile ago.
oklahoma,3aytdn,xcomv01,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:48:00 2015 UTC,They can't deny that fracking is causing earthquakes   There's a difference between fracking and disposals sir.
oklahoma,3aytdn,hoppierthanthou,3,Thu Jun 25 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"I think if we can dial in the disposal wells in such a way that does not induce earthquakes, we can be at harmony again.  The problem is that the disposal wells are the only way to dispose of produced water which is being produced in monumental amounts right now.  If the oil companies continue to cause earthquakes they will find themselves liable in court over massive amounts of damage."
oklahoma,3aytdn,metamars,-3,Wed Jun 24 17:37:54 2015 UTC,We also need to talk about contamination of ground water. That's a serious problem that needs to be addressed as well.
oklahoma,3aytdn,hoppierthanthou,6,Wed Jun 24 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"How so? The fracking process doesn't reach anywhere near the surface. Spills are still an issue, but there's not a whole lot that can be done about lightning strikes which cause most of them."

oklahoma,3aytdn,xcomv01,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure. I'm a geologist not a meteorologist. Tanks getting hit by lightning is a pretty common occurrence, and it costs a lot of money to replace the tank and clean up the mess. Not to mention the cost of oil lost. I've asked about it to the people who handle that end of the business and they say it just doesn't work because lightning is so unpredictable. It doesn't always go for the highest point like people say."
oklahoma,3aytdn,Ancient_Dude,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"There's got to be a better way to build the tanks and/or prevent lightning strikes. If there isn't a way already, there are plenty of people out there that could be paid to find solutions.   The problem is that the cost of replacing the tanks and cleaning up the mess for the 1/1000 (guestimated, no real basis in reality but the lightning strikes have to be somewhat rare, right?) isn't as expensive as the R&D to safeguard for this kind of a thing. Build the R&D cost into a block of tax subsidies to promote oil & gas expansion, boom. Solution."

Stop at the Cherokee (Exit 108) to look at the buffalo. The Cherokee is a typical truck stop restaurant, but I do like their chicken fried steak on occasion.  The Stafford Museum in Weatherford is worth a visit. Tom Stafford was an Apollo astronaut and is still kicking.  Elk City... keep on driving. OK, there is a museum with a bunch of windmills.

Here you can check out some events along your path. Many of the small towns around here have really fun 4th festivals if you are looking for some small town adventures. July 3rd the OKC Philharmonic host Red With and Boom, if sitting at the fair ground with a large crowd listening to a live orchestra and watching fireworks is your thing. Edmond has the best fireworks in the metro.   2 small towns you should check out are El Reno (Get an Onion Burger!) and Guthrie. Both have pretty unique character to them. Also, Norman sounds like it may be a place you'd enjoy.   In Oklahoma City, the list of places you should eat is a mile long. Just get out and explore. You might enjoy The Mule or Saints, both in The Plaza District. Also look into OKC Rocks if you like rock climbing, a place to climb in an old grain silo.   As for Disc Golf I've only played a few times at Dolese Park in OKC, really enjoyed it. Don't know much about Breweries, usually go to Belle Isle if we are going out. I'm sure other people can recommend some better places.   And just be aware, our alcohol laws suck! We can only sell 3.2 beer is gas stations and grocery stores, if you want the good stuff you'll have to go to a liquor store (They will be closed the 4th and Sundays) but have a decent selection of local brews. Look into Mustang Beers. Restaurants and bars are fine, and stop serving alcohol at 2am. Also be ware, Sheriff Departments do DUI check points pretty heavily around the 4th.   Have fun on your journey through our wonderful state, and get off I-40 and find some nice state highways to travel.   Edit: The Museum of Osteology! Seriously cool place that doesn't require much time commitment!"

The problem seems to be here is that they were unaware of this fault at the time.  Even so the quakes injection wells seem to be capable of producing have capped out around m5 or so.

oklahoma,3aremv,Ancient_Dude,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:49:39 2015 UTC,Well I'm not a structural engineer but the scale is logarithmic so small ones are of considerably less power.  I think most of the damage potential is for cracks in driveways and slabs.

oklahoma,3aptli,Zomberry,2,Tue Jun 23 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"I can be independent the same way a person can be a prick to one to person and the sweetest to the next. It's not what you put on paper but what you are in yourself.  Oklahoma doesn't have any support for Independents as too many narrow minded people. Just look at the joke of a governor we have, look at the congressmen and women we have, they can be presented with facts and evidence and yet will do the wrong thing by the people.   They want only 2 parties in the state and have done a great job ensuring that it happens."
oklahoma,3aptli,okramone73,2,Tue Jun 23 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yes you can BE independent, but that's not the same as being AN Independent. To say ""I am an Independent"" means that you did put that on paper, it's registering as no party affiliation.    I was registered Independent for quite some time and even though I didn't get to vote in a primary, I did find solace in the fact that both parties are fighting for my vote and I felt that in numbers, Independents can make a large difference in general elections.    If you want a third party you're going to have to look more at Libertarian or Green Party. Independent is not a political party but rather a lack of one."

Luckily, it's right by the Wichita Mountains,which offers a lot of camping, fishing, and other outdoor things. Depending on the direction you're coming from, you may pass right trough Oklahoma City, which offers tons of ideas, such as the botanical gardens, river walk, and lots of restaurants/bars.

Meers is a must eat down that way. The wait can be long so try going in the off hours. Medicine Park is a must visit too. If it is Lawton you are traveling to, I'd recommend renting a place in Medicine Park. It's a lot nicer of a stay then Lawton. You might also look into Quartz Mountain over in Altus. It's about an hour away but the lodge there is absolutely beautiful, one of my favorite places to stay in the state."
oklahoma,3angdv,BalooUriza,8,Sun Jun 21 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"I have driven this road quite a bit when I had friends living in some of the farm towns north of there.  It is always busy mid-day, and is the only major road going to the north that doesn't have a stop sign every mile, and its the fast way to the western areas of Edmond from parts of the city.  Probably the 4-lane would help things out because the bottle neck is bad north of Memorial to where it goes back to 4-lane.  (Its also the last road I got pulled over on.  Why in the world does it go from 65 and 2-lane southbound, to 55 and 4-lane at the county line.  More lanes should equal more speed, or at least the same speed!  Yes, yes, I know, more metro area (if by metro you mean grass and turd recyclers), but still... dumb)"
oklahoma,3angdv,theradison,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:40:57 2015 UTC,I live in the area and they are so strict on that because that's been huge income from fines since the 4 lane was a 2 lane. I've gotten pulled over doing 3 over multiple times and ticketed once. Anything to make Deer Creek richer.

More lanes tend to get people to move faster, which is the opposite of what you tend to want in an urban or suburban environment where the road potentially has a lot of intersections, driveways, and traffic starting and stopping (or looking for an address, or waiting for someone to cross the street, etc)."

I remember thinking it seemed like they were setup for a big expansion when I first drove 74 north and all of a sudden the highway disappeared, was really glad to hear they were doing it."
oklahoma,3angdv,xcomv01,9,Wed Jun 24 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"I drive this everyday to work. The Parkway to 150th, and occasionally continue on what is now Portland to 164th. There's nothing on that stretch of Portland but a few neighborhoods and a couple of strip malls further down. I will say, though, there is a ton of traffic. It's nearly impossible to turn left. But I feel like any issues would have been fixed by just expanding the two lane road into a four lane, and I don't really see the point of expanding 74."
oklahoma,3angdv,spamtech,15,Sun Jun 21 23:26:04 2015 UTC,They are planning on future growth.  North Edmond is one of the fastest growing areas right now.  The overpasses and offramps will do a lot to kill the congestions.

oklahoma,3angdv,Infinite_Mobius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure an upgrade to an expressway for two more miles is going to help the situation, since that tends to instigate more traffic (get ready for bottlenecks at the new north end and the two section lines that will now be directly connected!).  I'd say an effective transit system would probably be a better long term fix, since you can't really build more lanes to get yourself out of congestion; it just moves it around.  Guess it's a matter of whether we're going to focus on moving people and goods, or moving cars...because if we want to do the latter, we're doing a fantastic job of setting that up.  But the former?  Not so much."

As someone that's in oilfield work, I know how hard it can be to take big equipment north, tiny highways cause accidents. Happens all the time. If this was 4 lane until hwy 33 that would make a lot of trucks get away from the i35 corridor to get out of town."
oklahoma,3angdv,Infinite_Mobius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"Which is probably the opposite of what OklaDOT wants to do, since for safety and maintenance reasons, they would prefer heavy hauling is done on the main highways as much as possible instead of the two and four-lane undivided stuff."

I'm glad big trucks have to go slow. It's the small cars doing 80 all around them that scare me.   Yeah, no joke.  I'm kind of glad to see the northwest states moving to VSL and VLR systems in the big urban areas with stretch goals of going per-lane, statewide (which is something I suggested for Oklahoma about two weeks before I caught wind of the statewide rollout plans in Oregon and Washington).  I've driven places with traffic management before, and they're plain fantastic for managing traffic.  Getting too many people driving alone clogging up the road?  Dynamically change a lane to HOV only.  Trucks getting caught up?  Dynamically add a truck only lane.  Accident ahead?  Reduce the speed limits and close lanes in advance of the accident to keep a smooth (albeit slower) flow.  It was unpopular when initially rolled out in the northwest (the diehard ""I wanna drive as fast as I want, whenever I want"" crowd actually went so far as to blame cyclists for it, even though the initial rollouts in Oregon were on the few miles of major urban freeway in the state that don't allow bicycles!) but after a few high-profile people got popped and had some pretty hellacious tickets stick (20+ over is a misdemeanor in Oregon with nasty fines and potential impoundment, suspension and jailtime) and people started to see traffic management in action actually make driving suck less, people just started rolling with it (even when it does mean getting onto I 405 when the signs are saying ""SPEED LIMIT 15"")."

oklahoma,3amt6n,Teekno,3,Sun Jun 21 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"Exit 83 is Chickasha. I would skip Chickasha itself, but backtrack 8 miles into the town of Amber on SH 92. It's a small town, but there's a restaurant there called Ken's that sometimes will have a line out the door. It's a BBQ place and it's pretty tasty. A bit pricey, but not crazy.  Exit 53 is Fletcher. There's a nice lake about 5 miles west on US 277 with lots of Jeep trails and a good place to just have a picnic. If you'd like to let him fish, unfortunately, you'll need an Oklahoma permit.  Exit 45 is SH 49. This is your best bet for something interesting. This is the Wichita Wildlife Refuge and Ft. Sill. No trip to the Refuge is complete without driving to the top of Mt. Scott. It will take about 15 minutes to get to the top and it's a good view.  Head west to the town of Medicine Park. Don't speed. Seriously, their cops love to write speeding tickets. The downtown of Medicine Park along the creek is very pretty with lots of boutique stores and restaurants. Buy a bag of fish food at The Riverside Cafe and feed the critters down along the river walk.   When you leave Medicine Park, keep driving west on SH 49. The scenery through here is amazing. Slow down and watch for buffalo, elk, and longhorn cattle. Also prairie dogs. Nice non-strenuous hiking at Sunset campground.  Some will recommend Meers as a diversion. I'm not a fan. It used to be an interesting place to see, but now it's a stop along the motorcycle tourist road. The owners are quite unpleasant but it's an interesting place to stop and get a beer. Last time I was there, it was cash only.  You can go about 20-25 miles through the refuge to US 183. 183 is a good road, 4 lanes in places, and you can take it all the way south.  If you continue on I-44 south of the Refuge, there isn't much interesting all the way to the TX border. Lawton is not a particularly nice town, even though there are some sights to see. I wouldn't overnight there. There are a couple casinos at Exit 5, if I recall. Last time I went through there, about 4 months ago, there was construction at the southern end to the TX border, but there isn't much traffic so don't worry about it.  One bit about the OK/TX border war. Okies have cheap cigarettes, cheap gas, low-alcohol beer and gambling. Baja Okies (i.e. Texians) have ""6 point"" beer and pornography stores at all border crossings and truck stops.  A little out of your way in Texas but close to Abilene is Possum Kingdom lake. I used to scuba dive here, many moons ago. It's the eponymous title of The Toadies greatest hit. The song is absolutely not about the family of vampires that live(d) there. Seriously. So don't be afraid to visit. Especially at night."

There's a neat cave around quartz mountain somewhere but it may still be off limits because of white nose mold affecting bats.

There's also Fort Griffin just north of us, still on your way to Abilene. They just opened a new interpretive center and my 8 year old thinks it's cool. Finally, we have a great restaurant, the Beehive. There's one in Abilene too, but the original is Albany. Other than that, I can't think of much else. I make the drive too often, heading to Oklahoma. I can warn you that you'll be without cell phone coverage for awhile between Wichita Falls and Albany, and that one of my favorite driving games through that stretch is ""Count the cars"" because you seldom need to go over 10."

For my state house district, if I wasn't a registered Republican, I'd have had no vote at all last time around, since my rep drew a primary challenger and was unopposed in the general.  I imagine I'll keep the registration where it is for next year, as again, the GOP will be the more interesting primary."

It can be an interesting debate and discussion, but the ballot box will be entirely predictable, since Hillary has much, much broader support than ol Bernie.

oklahoma,3acbgl,twistedfork,2,Fri Jun 19 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"This is the email we got at work last night at 6pm about it:  I-35 Corridor*** Drivers urged to avoid I-35 in southern Oklahoma due to multiple closures, detours and rock slide  Drivers and truck traffic traveling through Oklahoma should avoid I-35 and use US-81 or US-69 as alternate routes.  Local traffic on northbound I-35 in the Arbuckle Mountains is detoured to US-77 at mile marker 47 near Turner Falls and back to I-35 at mile marker 51 due to ongoing repair of an earlier rock slide in Murray County.  ODOT crews and contractors are assessing opportunities for stabilizing the rock face to prevent further rock slides. Additionally, engineers are evaluating options for reopening the highway, including one lane of traffic in each direction. The northbound I-35 closure in the Arbuckle Mountains is expected to continue for many days due to unsafe conditions.  Travel conditions in the area and detour routes close to I-35 continue to change due to additional rainfall and flooding, so drivers should check updates regularly at www.odot.org.  ODOT crews assess damage the rock slide on I-35 near the Turner Falls area in Murray County. Closed Due to Flooding  The following highways are closed due to high water. Updates will be issued as conditions change. Do NOT drive into high water. Drivers are cautioned to heed warning signs and to not drive around barricades.  Carter County  US-70 is narrowed to one lane in each direction in Wilson  Cherokee County  SH-80 is closed to through traffic about four miles west of Hulbert, between SH-51 and US-62.  Garvin County  SH-74 is closed one mile north of SH-7, south of Elmore City  SH-74 is closed to through traffic between Maysville and Elmore City. Detour on SH-19, US-77 and SH-29. Jefferson County  SH-89 is closed between US-70 and SH-32, south of Ringling  US-70 is closed eight miles west of Ringling  Johnston County  US-377/SH-99 is closed to through traffic just south of Tishomingo. While water has receded off the roadway, flooding and debris have damaged parts of the bridge. Water remains too high at this time for a full bridge inspection to determine the extent of potential damage. Traffic is detoured on SH-1/SH-22 through Ravia and US-177/SH-199.  Leflore County  US-270 is closed between Wister and Heavener and US-271 at Wister. Signs are in place and traffic will be detoured to Poteau and Heavener.  Love County  SH-77 Scenic is closed at Lake Murray State Park  SH-96 is closed south of SH-32 near Burneyville  SH-32 is closed at Mud Creek, three miles east of the Jefferson County line  Marshall County  SH-199 is closed at the Ft. Washita bridge about five miles west of SH-48  Murray County  US-77 is closed between SH-7 and I-35 near Davis  Westbound SH-7 is closed at the US-77 South junction in Davis  Okfuskee County  SH-48 is closed approximately one mile south of I-40, near Bearden  Okmulgee County  US-75A is closed the railroad overpass on the north side of Beggs  Pittsburg County  SH-31 is closed west of McAlester  Closed due to flooding damage  The following highways are closed due to high water. Updates will be issued as conditions change.  Grant County  SH-11 between US-81 in Medford and SH-132 is open to one lane with traffic signals while surface damage is repaired on the construction detour.  Kingfisher County  SH-33 is closed about three miles west of the SH-74F junction near Cashion. This closure is expected to last several more weeks while a contractor finishes a nearby bridge construction project.  Kiowa County  SH-54 is closed to through traffic just south of SH-9 near Gotebo after flooding damaged a construction detour near an ongoing project. Traffic is detoured using SH-19 to US-183 to SH-55.  Leflore County  SH-1 is closed between US-271 and US-259 through the Ouachita National Forest due to damage from a land slide.  McCurtain County  US-259 is closed at the Red River due to flooding-related damage on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the Red River bridge. Drivers must find an alternate route traveling into Texas.  Pottawatomie County  SH-102 is open to only local traffic between SH-9 and SH-59B as crews repair damage to surface and drainage areas of the highway. The roadway may reopen within a week.  Pushmataha County  US-271 is open to one lane south of Clayton as a contractor continues making repairs to shore up severe erosion after heavy rains in May damaged both the roadway and the road bed. Permanent repairs are expected to take up to eight weeks to complete."

The Legislature meets at the Nebraska State Capitol in the City of Lincoln, Lancaster County.  Nebraska's Legislature is unique in that it is both unicameral and nonpartisan; no other U.S. state has a single-chamber legislative body or a non-partisan legislature. However, the legislatures of two U.S. territories—the Virgin Islands and Guam—are unicameral. The Council of the District of Columbia is also unicameral; however, the United States Congress retains ultimate authority over the District and can overrule acts passed by its Council. At 49 members, the Nebraska Legislature is also the smallest state legislature (the next smallest is the 60-member bicameral Alaska Legislature).

oklahoma,3a8841,Dstrunk,2,Fri Jun 19 16:55:33 2015 UTC,Would we be left with a house or a senate?  I'd be opposed to senate as this would give small towns far too much control.
oklahoma,3a8841,Dstrunk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:53:33 2015 UTC,I'd gladly give up my voice (as a small town) for some goddamn roads/public services!
oklahoma,3a8841,Four_Months,3,Thu Jun 18 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"Having a voice in the legislative process is the only way that small towns can effectively lobby to receive funds for public services and roads. By giving that up you would practically ensure that the state would ignore and neglect you, because to them you wouldn't matter."
oklahoma,3a8841,Dstrunk,3,Thu Jun 18 15:08:11 2015 UTC,"You mean I actually matter? What? Nah, but seriously. If you think My Town of 1,900 people has the time and money to lobby for funding, and actually get the attention of even a State Legislator, then you have another thing coming.   I'm VP of the Chamber of Commerce, a local business owner, as well as a member of the Downtown Development Committee. I personally have experience in this. The fact is, Oklahoma Lawmakers simply do not care for improving much of anything in these small towns. Hell, we don't even have a stoplight in the entire County.  We've shut down 2 schools in the past 10 years.   And don't even get me started on the Oil & Gas boom around here. Sure, a bunch of people made a pretty penny off of it, but none of that will go back in the economy (the landowners will keep it in the bank for the next 20 years, and then it's inherited by their kids who live elsewhere). But now that it's basically slowed down to a dribble, we are left with the aftermath. Every road in the County is heavily scarred from the 24/7 trucking operations. Rural bridges everywhere have been compromised due to trucks crossing over them that are way over the weight limit.  All our service stations have been bought out. Every dime spent there goes to a company in Dallas that is owned by a company from India. Every dime that doesn't go to one of their employee's paychecks, leaves the county. Forever.   We don't have sidewalks, We don't have proper storm drains, We are flooded.. Old houses that haven't been occupied in years are falling apart faster and faster.   We've lost almost all of our Main street Businesses. Most of the buildings are vacant. 2 had their roofs collapse in the past 3 years. Now they're covered in tarps, yellow tape, and have ""DANGER KEEP AWAY"" spray painted on them in RED.   The only funds we'll receive is for the Bypass they'll build around us, allowing us to shrivel up and die peacefully. I don't buy into that whole ""They actually care"" thing. They want us gone. It's more tax dollars that they don't have to spend on us (like they do anyways..).   It sucks because this town has History. We have Culture here. My family has been here since the beginning. That's all going away. I'll be the last one here. Brain Drain, Bad politics, it just sucks. I should of just moved off after finishing school like everyone else in my class did. Seriously, You know who's left of the people I graduated with? The girls who got pregnant too early, and the guy's who did too many drugs. That's it."

Order a 16 oz can and pour it sometime to see how hard it is to actually fit the whole pint. The ""imperial"" pint, such as a Guinness glass, holds a full 20.

Wore a white 3 button shirt with his initials, leotards and ballet shoes. Had a head like Herman Munster. Chub and Linda brought him to school everyday in Caddy with long horns on the front of it. I remember her coming to school parties with furs around her neck and rocks on her fingers.   After the murder Chub became local legend. Got busted twice for cultivating marijuana, the second time was the largest grow ever busted, up to that time in the 4 state area. Again I had a distant connection to the story. When KBI, DEA, and a few other Feds came to bust Chub, (the 2nd time) he had already disappeared. I knew two people at that time that owned land adjacent to where Chub had his fields. A creek ran wound thru both properties that they hunted arrowheads on. They were using a road on Chub's land when heavily armed people appeared everywhere pointing automatic weapons at them. They would've been okay except the dude had a joint behind his ear. They took them to Wichita, tried to make them confess that they were working for Chub, then let them go.   Meanwhile Chub disappears for 30 years. Until cancer made him turn himself in so he could get healthcare. He'd been living under the alias of a man who was killed in WWII while working on a ranch owned by Ted Turner. George explains what happened.  The last connection is I'm friends with the ""Buffalo Dale"" mentioned that supposedly got a video confession. He's been telling and teasing me this for years. Said he couldn't say anything til after Chub was gone. Then he said he was writing a book. Then it was going to be a screen play. I was starting to think he was giving me the P.T. Barnum treatment. I was actually shocked to hear George say that he actually saw the confession tape. And now I hear Dale has the book financed and should becoming out soon.

Simply creating the lake, flooding roads that became ""boat ramps.""  Tiger Mountain Road is another.  I've personally driven a car into Eufaula at 5am while duck hunting near Porum.  I didn't know I was in the water til it started coming I under the doors.  I was able to back out  ."
oklahoma,390k8g,PoisonOkie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"I get that Eufaula is an artificial sea.  But still, seems like if you're going to leave a section line open as a boat ramp, there should be some kind of turn required to use it, and a barrier of some form to prevent exactly that sort of drive-off situation.  At a very minimum, on the approach, use the internationally recognized (including the US) sign for END, that being a red diamond sign.  Can even be emphasized with a steady burning red light.  I'm not going to blame drivers at night for following a road that, logically, should continue, into the water, given that pavement, even on section lines, is rarely marked due to cost, but to just leave a long-flooded-by-an-inland-sea road uncapped with inadequate warning is, both ethically and technically (by federal highway standards) incorrect."
oklahoma,390k8g,BalooUriza,5,Mon Jun 8 22:51:12 2015 UTC,Not a federal highway and they where inexperienced drivers to boot.   Not that I don't think your right roads like that should have a barrier before you get to the water
oklahoma,390k8g,racer951y,-2,Tue Jun 9 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"Not a federal highway and they where inexperienced drivers to boot.   That's not significant, even cycleways have to comply to these standards, if they're operated by a government entity.  It's what makes traveling on US roads, regardless of who operates them, uniform, as opposed to, say, mall and supermarket parking lots."
oklahoma,390k8g,BalooUriza,4,Tue Jun 9 09:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was worried that this was what had happened. After a few days had passed though, it couldn't have been anything else.  Flooded roads, and floods in general are serious stuff."
oklahoma,390k8g,290blenderreport,-20,Mon Jun 8 11:22:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was worried that this was what had happened. After a few days had passed though, it couldn't have been anything else.   I heard a lot of tinfoil hat type shit involving getting held up along the way, but, c'mon, two 30-something Okies made that seem super-extra unlikely.   Flooded roads, and floods in general are serious stuff.   No doubt.  I'm a little shocked that it's as common as it is here for people to get killed in floods and weather here, compared to where I come from (which is comparatively dry).  Swimming and knowing what to do in a major disaster are more considered recreational activities here rather than skills that, sooner or later, will save your ass..."

oklahoma,390k8g,phtll,3,Tue Jun 9 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"It is pretty shocking that so many people get killed by things like flooded roads. I think it's part of the ""Stand outside and watch the tornado pass by"" mentality that a lot of Oklahomans have, where they'll just try and tough out a flooded road. Apparently the two were also new drivers, so they probably weren't aware of how to handle the situation."
oklahoma,390k8g,290blenderreport,6,Mon Jun 8 11:51:52 2015 UTC,"The driver had his license only for a few months. The 80-mile road trip was the farthest he'd ever driven. A lot of experienced drivers have trouble gauging how deep a flooded road really is. A kid who's barely driven probably isn't able to make that judgment call, especially at night while lost. He just wanted to find a way out of there."
oklahoma,390k8g,Flying_Ligers,5,Mon Jun 8 18:42:34 2015 UTC,From highway 69 one of the more used roads to Okmulgee is Wainwright Rd south of Muskogee.  Likely could have forgotten what the road was named and took the wrong exit
oklahoma,390k8g,theradison,3,Tue Jun 9 02:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a rough driving situation. Hopefully this whole tragedy will encourage some more people to learn how to handle such a situation.

That was probably somewhere between 3.5-4 which is the minimum intensity that humans can actually feel and is incredibly unlikely to cause any damage. Your house is probably old and, like all buildings in Oklahoma, wasn't designed to withstand seismic activity."

It's called the close to home program or some shit like that it's 18/Year.  There's some lakes that will charge you an additional fee to fish those but those lakes are few and far between.
