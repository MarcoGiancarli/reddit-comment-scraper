hockeyjerseys,3e4dca,ShutTheChuckUp,4,Tue Jul 21 23:20:27 2015 UTC,The colour of the jersey is actually a lot brighter blue than a legit Jets jersey as well as having a bubbly crest (which is also off colour) and bubbly numbers. Looks kind of like the NHL shield is covered partially by the laces as well. Legit jerseys with laces have the shield placed in such a way that its no where near the top lace. Heres a picture from one of JerseyBaron's eBay listings for future reference of what an authentic jersey should look like.
hockeyjerseys,3e4dca,Kitten_Hammer,2,Tue Jul 21 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"Easy way to spot jerseys that use a shoelace tie down (like the one you've got pictured) - all authentic Reebok jerseys use colored rings that the laces go through that generally match the jersey color (or one of the colors on the jersey) - The Chinese knockoffs usually use metal colored rings.  The NHL logo in an authentic is always above the laces too, in your example if you tied the laces, it would cover the NHL logo."
hockeyjerseys,3e59ip,jamkk1023,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:20 2015 UTC,Good luck trying to find one. I imagine it won't be easy finding a jersey for an ECHL team that hasn't been around in 15 years. Once you find one I doubt it'll come cheap too.
hockeyjerseys,3e4z4v,Sal79,3,Wed Jul 22 00:15:43 2015 UTC,that's about $100 too much for that jersey. these jerseys are also way too narrow and long for the size they should be. 2xl will likely be too narrow for you and probably down to your knees

hockeyjerseys,3e4z4v,another_plebeian,2,Wed Jul 22 00:46:50 2015 UTC,WOW. That looks long and slim- two things no one has ever accused me of being. Thank you for the info. I think I'll end up grabbing a Preds jersey from fullmoon and getting it customized.

hockeyjerseys,3dyp7n,tornfightstrap,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"VK&SM stands for Vladimir Konstantinov & Sergei Mnatsakanov (the team's masseur).  After their 1997 cup win during the celebrations Konstantinov, Mnatsakanov, and Viacheslav Fetisov all got drunk, so they hired a limousine to take them home.  Long story short, the driver they hired had previously had his license suspended for drunk driving and shouldn't have been driving at the time.  Tragically, the limo ended up wrapped around a tree.  Fetsiov was able to get away from the crash with minor injuries, but Konstantinov, whose career ended because of the crash, and Mnatsakanov both ended up in comas.  The following year the Red Wings wore this patch in honor of both of them.  They repeated as 1998 Stanley Cup Champions.  Yzerman gave the honor of the first lap to Konstantinov with the rest of the team following close behind."
hockeyjerseys,3dyp7n,sops-sierra-19,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:11 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Yet you didn't answer the question... Is it a rare patch? Why is this jersey so valuable?
hockeyjerseys,3dyp7n,RichardManuel,3,Mon Jul 20 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"The patch symbolized the amazing rally of the Red wings in 1998. After such a tragedy they won back to back to honor their teammate. It's not rare to buy the patch, but there isn't many jerseys left with the patch on, especially Yzermans, and it'd be a Red Wings' fan's prized possession. They did wear Nike's that year though...."
hockeyjerseys,3dyp7n,hiroshi51,4,Mon Jul 20 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah the jersey is a replica, right? I mean without the patch that's like a $60 jersey at most. I just checked... The patch is available on eBay for $13. So I'm confused why these huge numbers are being thrown out there"

hockeyjerseys,3dyp7n,Anberlin_XI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"If 350 is your budget you could probably almost buy two Nike authentic versions of this jersey. There is a Yzerman Nike authentic on eBay for 210 obo but it has a Cup patch.  If that is your budget, watch eBay for either a blank or Yzerman Nike authentic. It'll be MUCH nicer than the CCM replica. You can grab the patch for 15 bucks as said in this thread and most hockey shops can apply it. If the jersey is blank you could send both the jersey and patch to EPS to have done up.  If you're okay with the equivalent jersey your friend has, just keep an eye out on eBay. You can find the same Yzerman jersey for 40-80 and as said before, the patch is apparently available for purchase on eBay.  Best of luck."

hockeyjerseys,3dyp7n,ryan49321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:19 2015 UTC,You can get a gently used Yzerman replica jersey for 75 bucks and the patch is cheap to acquire.  You could have the same jersey for under 100 bucks including the cost of getting the patch put on it.

hockeyjerseys,3e0cla,vsxeworkingclass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"The main reason these (and the Lightning ""storm"", etc.) are so rare and valuable is because CCM/RBK haven't made a vintage line featuring them.    If they ever decide to, the non-gamer versions will plummet in value like rocks.  Jersey investors beware."
hockeyjerseys,3e0cla,knoper21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. Defunct teams, such as Quebec and Hartford's original replicas tend to be worth more than the CCM Vintage line re-makes."
hockeyjerseys,3e0cla,vsxeworkingclass,5,Tue Jul 21 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"Since everybody has named a lot of the obvious ones from around the league, I can say as a Senators fan, the only really rare jerseys the team has are the Peace Tower jerseys. The ones I've seen on eBay go for absurd amounts (200ish). Considering the jersey is just a mesh jersey with a screen printed logo, that makes it all the more crazy. People in the Ottawa area occasionally find them in thrift shops for nothing because of how crappy they look.   The other Senators jersey that is REALLY hard to track down is the authentic 1995-1999 black away jerseys. There are a few on eBay right now actually, including a pretty good deal on a Damien Rhodes one. Generally, they go for prices that are all over the place (I've seen them go as low as $100 and as high as $300). It becomes all the more hard to find one when you consider that if one comes up on eBay, it might not be in your size, and also the fact that there were actually two different kinds. They changed the Senators crest slightly half way through the jerseys run by removing the Ottawa Senators wording. So if you want to have a jersey done up of a player from a specific year, that makes it all the more harder.  CCM/Reebok/NHL clearly don't have their fingers on the pulse, as they could make a nice profit reproducing some popular jerseys from the past like the Wild Wing, Burger King, Fisherman, or even the Pooh Bear."

hockeyjerseys,3dvdin,tgentil,2,Mon Jul 20 04:35:32 2015 UTC,Kono! Bates didn't do much with the Caps either as I recall. Kono was one of my favorite Caps players back in the day. I was quite pissed about him leaving at the time though so my perception of Bates might be a bit biased.  My first non-Caps NHL jersey was a game worn Avs 3rd of Kono's that a fellow Caps fanatic gave me for my birthday years ago.

hockeyjerseys,3dsr01,canuck_11,8,Sun Jul 19 02:33:53 2015 UTC,I'd keep it as is man. Cumiskey IS the one who wore it. Every Hawks fan does need to get a Teravainen jersey though. He is a huge part of your future.

hockeyjerseys,3dspba,knoper21,0,Sun Jul 19 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not shocked.  If PKP and his company are dumb enough to pay US$500mil for a team they could probably get to relocate for half as much, and they are, nobody's going to match that and the new rink.  Kinda wish they'd move the old logo to the shoulder or something, though."
hockeyjerseys,3dspba,Kitten_Hammer,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"As much as I would love to see the Nordiques return, that logo needs to stay in the past where it originated. It was extremely dated before the time they relocated.  If they can come up with something stellar like Winnipeg 2.0, with a subtle nod to the past like Washington's three stars above their crest, I'll be happy.  It definitely needs a fleur-de-lis somewhere on it."

hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,Nas160,5,Sat Jul 18 07:56:44 2015 UTC,"As an Avalanche collector, I was very disappointed that Mitchell and Ness missed on a lot of details. This is what an actual game worn 2000-01 Roy jersey looked like.   http://www.milehighcardco.com/ItemImages/000016/14_16833a_med.jpeg  The M&A is essentially a glorified replica jersey for $300. You could find a blank Avs authentic jersey ($100), buy a Stanley Cup patch ($20) have Denver Athentic customize it exactly the same as it was in 2001 ($80) and save $100."
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,butchvig,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:53:40 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but...firstly, isn't the jersey supposed to look like the one that was worn when they lifted the Cup?  And also, I thought All-Star Game patches are worn until the actual game happens, then is absent for the whole second half of the season."
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,butchvig,2,Sat Jul 18 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"In 2001, the Avalanche wore the All Star Game patch throughout the playoffs until the cup finals against NJ.   From the 2001 WCF: http://imgur.com/lwAOk7t  The point wasn't the patch, it was rest of the jersey. The numbers on the M&A are too small, spaced too far apart, and are made of tackle twill instead of glacier twill. The yeti shoulder patches do not have a thick enough border, etc.   Admittingly, I'm a little crazy about the small details on Avalanche jerseys.  But I would hate to have someone drop $300 on one of these jerseys, because it is pretty far off from the real thing."
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,butchvig,2,Sat Jul 18 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see now.  Eh, I'm really indifferent to M&N; if a replica sweater from when it was actually worn is available, I'll get it. And like the Sakic I actually own, a lot of them are rather inexpensive."
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,butchvig,2,Sat Jul 18 19:57:11 2015 UTC,Haha. My hobby would be far less expensive / far more expansive if I wasnt so crazy and I could deal with replica Avalanche jerseys. ;)
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,knoper21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, and I do notice what you mean about not using the glacier twill, that's the silver sparkly stuff used on the grey outline of the Avs numbers (as well as the silver Kings' sweaters from the early 2000's, and the Leafs' number and shoulder patch outlines from the early 2000's) right?  Really sad that reproductions can't be 100% to the original, but that's the nature of it I guess."
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,NowIRockATellerSuit,2,Sat Jul 18 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"Glacier twill is the ""zig zag"" pattern on the black portion of the numbers seen here:  http://akamai.edeal.com/images/catalog2381/folder12235/img11200341.jpg  The Avalanche have used it on all of their non-alternate jerseys since their first season through present.  (I believe the Penguins are the only other NHL team currently using glacier twill.)  The M&N jersey uses ""tackle twill"", which is far more common.    The shiny silver material I've always called ""silver dazzle twill"", but that term is one I may have just made up."
hockeyjerseys,3dpvq1,another_plebeian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"Oh right, I really need to learn those terms.  And yeah, I've noticed the zigzag pattern, I actually have both an Avs and Pens jersey with that on it (the Pens one is a 2000-01 Jagr alternate). Oddly, I found the pattern to be similar to that on the back of Pop Tarts.  But yeah, kinda sucks these reproductions lack the details the original did, but eh, it's something I guess."

hockeyjerseys,3dmupf,TheKevinShow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"There's some links on the sidebar that will show you where to buy the Edge 2.0's.  For CoolHockey, look for the authentic jerseys that say (Made In Canada). These are the 2.0's that you're looking for. Here's a link. You can also customize the jersey through the site as well.  For Ice Jerseys, it looks like they only have an IndoEdge authentic so that's not what you want.  I would also suggest the Jersey Baron on eBay. Here's a link to a 2.0 that you can customize and here's another link to just a blank one."

hockeyjerseys,3dlloz,drew_carnegie,9,Fri Jul 17 06:59:10 2015 UTC,"It's a ccm replica jersey either from 1998-99 or 1999-2000.   During this era, branding of replica jerseys never matched the authentics or on ice jerseys exactly and it was common for multiple companies to make replica jerseys for the same teams. You'll also notice ccm branding on the left sleeve of the jersey, which is always an easy giveaway that the jersey is a replica. (even today)  It is not from 2001-01 or 2001-02 because that is when ccm / KOHO became the official manufacturer for the entire nhl. During those seasons, they began to brand their replicas the same as authentics and on ice jerseys, except for the left sleeve branding and the puck nhl logo on the lower back hem instead of the nhl shield logo."
hockeyjerseys,3dlloz,butchvig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:53:14 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! So probably not worth customizing then?"
hockeyjerseys,3dlloz,butchvig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"It's probably not a good investment for you are thinking you will resell it down the road. $50-$70 is about what the second hand market would fetch for a customized replica. But really, it's up to you. If you really want a Kings Blake jersey from this era right now, then maybe it's worth overpaying a little for. Even if you could find another Blake jersey, it may have a poor customization job."

hockeyjerseys,3ddvav,54321Blast0ff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the norm but it was common in the 80's/early 90's for some people to customize their jerseys with screen printed numbers. There were probably more blank jerseys at the time than jerseys that were even customized at all.  If you look at any old photos or game videos there'll only be a few jerseys sprinkled through the crowd, and alot less places available to customize with legitimate twill in the correct font/numbers.  Removing the numbers will leave marks, but if they were placed correctly, and the right font, there shouldn't be any issues covering up those marks with the twill numbers.  Or you could leave it as it is and consider it a product of the times."
hockeyjerseys,3ddvav,Det40oz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"Is this an authentic (fight strap+numbered size) or replica?  If it is a replica, you're better off just buying another off eBay. Bourque was a popular player and if you set an eBay alert you can probably find a Bourque for the same price or less than it would cost to get a jersey customized. Generally with shipping you could probably find one for 40-80.  If it is an authentic, it might be worth salvaging since those are more expensive and harder to find. One thing you could do is compare the placement of your numbers to photos of Bourque jerseys and if the size of the numbers are proper (11 or 12 inches?) It could be covered up.  You could try acetone and/or goof off to get the numbers off but be careful as the colours from the plastic numbers could run.   Ultimately, I just don't think it is worth the hassle since you can probably find a Bourque jersey on eBay at a price in line with what you'd pay for customization."

hockeyjerseys,3d9ek7,heavykevy1983,12,Tue Jul 14 15:08:18 2015 UTC,"I started out in high school:  Back in the early 2000s I was endlessly hunting for a Nords jersey before the CCM vintage set picked up, now THERE was a hunt.  Found the process fun.  Picked up a retro Canucks Bure 96 for my first real purchase.  Bought up a bunch of $30US replicas on ebay (Jagr Captials, Vanbiesbrouck Flyers).  After that it became the default birthday gift.  Took a break in university, went kinda nuts afterward with Premiers once I got my first real paycheques, and then transferred into game worns, mainly because the hunt for a cheap jerseys transferred into the hunt for rare styles/players.  I liquidated most of my replicas (to my surprise)for about what I paid for them over the years, and am even thinning out the game worns.  It's been quite the process.  I'm guessing I peaked at about 45-50 jerseys, am at about 25 now.  I like the hobby, I like the fans it attracts to talk about the sport (more serious instead of ""Embrace Debate"" idiocy), and I like seeing what everyone collects."

hockeyjerseys,3d9ek7,bobbyp6565,10,Tue Jul 14 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"For me, it was more about the players than the jerseys themselves - always liked the fighters and when I met some of them (Bob Probert, Craig Berube, Gord Donnelly, Alan May, Tim Hunter), they were just great guys and were highly entertaining, so I started collecting their jerseys. Started with authentically-lettered replicas, moved to true authentics and then to gamers - love all of the customizations these guys have done to their game jerseys to help give them an edge. With close to 600 hockey jerseys in the closet (over 250 gamers, representing all 30 NHL teams and many minor league ones as well), its moved well into the obsession-realm now. Collecting only gamers at this point and since my collecting focus is being pushed out of today's game, only collecting 80's/90's/early 2000's jerseys at this point, but after 20+ years in this awesome hobby, the thrill of the hunt still keeps me interested and motivated."

hockeyjerseys,3d9ek7,chickenz666,5,Wed Jul 15 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"Neat! Well of course I'm subscribed to this sub because I love hockey jerseys. I think why I love them so much is because I've been playing hockey most my life and I love the game. I love that it's a team sport, the physicality, the skill, and the passion it delivers. A hockey jersey represents the team as a whole and is a symbol of not just the team, but the entire city or even state.  I also believe that hockey jerseys are the best designed jerseys in all of sports. The logos, the stripes everything makes it feel so unique. Other sports have limited realty to work with and usually are very timid when designing their jerseys. Hockey jersey designs can get crazy and it's wonderful.  My favorite team, the Chicago Blackhawks, have the best jersey in sports. The design is timeless and the American Indian crest is phenomenal."

hockeyjerseys,3d9ek7,yacadelic,2,Tue Jul 14 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"With guys like Toews, Kane, Hossa, and Keith we will be a force to reckon for a long time. I was sad to see Saad go but I really like what we got in return. The Sharp trade I didn't like so much. Again I was sad to see Sharp go but that was an inevitability. Seeing Johns go though was a major bummer especially for the return of Daley and Garbutt. I feel like trading a top 6 offense-men and a stellar young defense-man would get more worthy of a return. All-in-all this team is still really good."

hockeyjerseys,3d872v,coolhockey,2,Tue Jul 14 22:32:20 2015 UTC,The line in the center of the collar rights through the middle of the name and just to the left of the 0. So it's centered but the 1 makes it look slightly off. Honestly I'm fine with it. I don't know how to improve it really.

I've had issues with cool hockey but no one here seems to believe it because of mob mentality around here, and the novelty that they use reddit.  Tried to get ""A""s done twice, and the second time trying to get a Buffalo one done was so botched when they tried the second time to fix it (after I had even showed them what it should look like), I just got it removed and lost money because they didn't refund me.  Hopefully you can get things resolved with ice jerseys. Email would be the most official way, and I hope you can resolve that soon.  I guess that leaves you with EPS to try...  Stuff like this makes so weary to get my blanks customized."
hockeyjerseys,3d6u5x,Brgraham78,5,Mon Jul 13 23:52:15 2015 UTC,Well that's a nice collection you've got there!
hockeyjerseys,3d6u5x,DustinPenncakes,3,Tue Jul 14 00:03:21 2015 UTC,Question: the Richards jersey you got from Fullmoonjerseys...did you have your local customizer stitch over the glued-on numbers (NHL customization job)?
hockeyjerseys,3d6u5x,canuck_11,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:36 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I did!  I got the alternate captain's ""A"" separately and then brought the jersey to my local rink to send it out.  They did a great job!"
hockeyjerseys,3d6u5x,coltrane2989,2,Tue Jul 14 09:02:01 2015 UTC,Jealous of your collection. Where did you get your Rangers edge 2.0? Everywhere I've looked recently has been out of stock in my size (52)
hockeyjerseys,3d6u5x,JonnyBox,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:28 2015 UTC,Over the July 4th weekend IceJerseys had a 30% off sale and I noticed they had Edges in stock in size 54 and 52.

hockeyjerseys,3d773y,MrWhiskersMEOW,4,Tue Jul 14 01:35:31 2015 UTC,"That's an ""Ultrafil"" CCM replica, the Ultrafils being stretchier and softer than their ""Airknit"" CCM counterparts. You generally don't have to worry about the legitimacy of the CCM replicas from this era, just keep an eye out for the condition of them before purchase. Nice pickup, and even better team. ;)"
hockeyjerseys,3d773y,vsxeworkingclass,2,Tue Jul 14 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you! So basically the ""Ultrafil"" is a tier lower than air knits?"
hockeyjerseys,3d773y,vsxeworkingclass,3,Tue Jul 14 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the CCM Ultrafils are better than the CCM Airknits. The KOHO and CCM Airknits from 2000-07, however, are better than either 90s CCMs."
hockeyjerseys,3d773y,vsxeworkingclass,2,Tue Jul 14 02:08:47 2015 UTC,I have this same jersey (black) and it's airknit.
hockeyjerseys,3d773y,tornfightstrap,2,Tue Jul 14 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"For certain jerseys in the late 80's/early 90's (not sure exactly on the time frame). CCM made both air knit and ultrafil replicas. This is pre-blue hockey rink tag when the jerseys just had the white tag on the neck.  As an example, I've seen both air knit and ultrafil versions of the black 1992-1995 Senators away jersey. I'm not sure why exactly this is.   But what I think is that some time before 1995, CCM must have switched over to air knit for all replicas regardless of what the team uses on the ice, but I am not sure. When they started putting in the squared neck tags (like the blue hockey rink tag, or the blue/black CCM tag) and on from there, I'm pretty sure every replica was air knit only."
hockeyjerseys,3d773y,tornfightstrap,2,Tue Jul 14 02:17:55 2015 UTC,This looks like an early 90's CCM replica.   The early 90's ultrafil replicas aren't very sturdy IMO. They're still fine jerseys for the right price. But they aren't as good as the to late 90's/early 2000's air knit replicas when CCM were on top of their game.
hockeyjerseys,3d773y,ultrafil,-1,Tue Jul 14 02:15:35 2015 UTC,"That's an ""Ultrafil""   No, this is ultrafil."

hockeyjerseys,3d398q,dwoo95,4,Mon Jul 13 04:17:09 2015 UTC,Just curious. I would expect prototype jerseys manufactured for testing to have no neck tag like game-issue or worn jerseys.
hockeyjerseys,3d398q,tornfightstrap,3,Mon Jul 13 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"That was the tag used on the authentic jerseys for the short period of time when they had Reebok branding but were still the CCM pre-edge builds.   As far as whether it is legit. The jersey itself is clearly a legit Edge jersey with a few small differences (what looks like a different type of NHL shield on the neck). I've seen a few of these Vancouver prototypes out there on eBay (maybe it was the same seller, or maybe this guy bought it form that seller).  Pretty sure this would be impossible to fake because at the very least someone would need an uncrested Edge 1.0 of that design (which never existed). I'll say that if a similar Senators (the main team I follow/collect) prototype popped up somewhere at that price, I'd probably take a chance on it."
hockeyjerseys,3d398q,knoper21,2,Mon Jul 13 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I was trying to figure out if it was worth the $160, as the jersey would be way too big for me. Still, it would be a cool thing to have, and maybe I'll get it framed. What do you think?"
hockeyjerseys,3d398q,tornfightstrap,2,Mon Jul 13 04:44:19 2015 UTC,"If you love it and want it to be the centre of your living room, go for it.  It may get a ""that's kinda neat"" from your friends.  If you want to resell it, no.  Jersey minutia is a pretty small segment of the population, and this style isn't that popular.  In fact, you can probably find a pretty decent gamer for that price from that era."
hockeyjerseys,3d398q,butchvig,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"Worth it in what way?  There's no real way to gauge value for something like a prototype, so if you are hoping that it'll be worth a lot of money one day, it is probably not worth buying.  I doubt there are a lot of them out there. So to me, it seems like a cool jersey to have if you're a Canucks fan or collector. If you're not sold on the price, maybe try to make the guy an non-lowball offer and see if the seller is receptive.   Again, there's no way for me to be 100 percent certain it is legit, but the fact that it is an Edge jersey with a colour pattern that was never released is probably a very good sign. The jersey is certainly a legit Reebok Edge 1.0 jersey, just the origins would be in question. Here's the one I saw on eBay a while back. Because the writing on the tag inside is different, I would guess this isn't the same one being sold on your local CL. Maybe the seller would have some more info about where they came from http://www.ebay.ca/itm/191558951961"

This was the only year that the ""boxed"" Starter logo was used on the back lower hem.  In what is probably the largest gap between an Avalanche retail authentic and a gamer, the retail authentic jerseys made in 1995-96 are significantly different from what was actually worn on the ice.  This can probably be chalked up to the rush job that comes with a relocation and a complete uniform redesign.    Larger Avalanche crest titled counter-clockwise (similar 1996-97 Avs gamers) A different Yetti foot logo shoulder patch - interestingly, its the same patch that was used on CCM replicas 1995-2007.

hockeyjerseys,3cy7nq,K0RnD4Wg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"One of the sites linked on the sidebar offers stitching for like $50 I believe. The Islanders pro shop wouldn't stitch a patch I bought from the NYC NHL store so I would look elsewhere. I don't know if this is a thing but I have a local ""Sports Shack"" where all the local peewees/travels/school teams purchase their jerseys and I can have them stitch whatever on my jerseys too."
hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,Xenoo,15,Sat Jul 11 03:47:29 2015 UTC,"My bet would definitely be an honest mistake.  They probably ironed everything on and then just forgot to sew on the ""C"".  The reason its ironed on weakly may be that they iron it lightly to keep in place for sewing and then fully iron it in after sewing.  That way nothing is 100% set for good until it for sure looks correct."
hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,Det40oz,3,Sat Jul 11 05:55:26 2015 UTC,They need to fix that. It is terrible to see that 'C' falling off like that. You shouldn't have to pay another cent for the correction. Other than that the jersey is gorgeous.
hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,canuck_11,3,Sat Jul 11 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"I sent them an email as soon as I got back from work but I probably won't hear back until Monday. I don't understand why they would stitch everything and then iron on the ""C"" so badly. I stated in my order to have everything made to team specifications and even asked if everything would be stitched, which they assured would be. They charged $100 and shipping getting it there was $20. Has anyone dealt with their customer support or issues such as these and if so how did they go? Hopefully I don't have to pay for shipping there again but we'll see what they say. I was also thinking about sending them another jersey to letter after I received this one back but I'm not so sure anymore."
hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,DustinPenncakes,3,Sat Jul 11 03:52:36 2015 UTC,I think it was an honest mistake. They seem to take a lot of pride in their work over there and will more than likely do whatever it takes to get it fixed.
hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,Galvanick_Lucipher,-2,Sat Jul 11 05:47:03 2015 UTC,"I have had several done by them and plan to send them more soon, and have had nothing but positive experiences with them.   As mentioned elsewhere,  I bet it was ironed on a little bit to hold it in place & verify the placement and then for some reason the stitching was skipped.  Edit: Jeeze, some folks have no sense of humor."
hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,igotthepooonme,2,Sat Jul 11 10:53:15 2015 UTC,"If you crank up your iron, and place a towel over the C, a good 10 second count should get it all set."

hockeyjerseys,3cvmpt,imnotonacid87,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Usually when jerseys are customized, the kits are heat pressed to the jersey prior to being stitched.  As others have said, it looks like they pressed everything to the jersey and forgot to stitch the C.   Hopefully they'll help you out, or do something for you to make up for the hassle. But as far as getting it fixed goes, it might be more efficient to find somewhere locally who does hockey jerseys and see what they'd charge to have them press sew around the C, which is 5 minutes of work."

Sure - they're a lot cheaper, but they fit like crap look like crap too.  To each his own, if you're happy with the fake - more power to you, but I was not happy with mine.   Here is my album comparing my Reebok Edge 1.0 jersey and a bunch of fakes I bought from Aliexpress: http://imgur.com/a/F3dRu  The sellers on aliexpress are really shady too - One of the ""best"" aliexpress sellers, Aimee Smith promised to send me a replacement jersey since the ones I bought were not to my liking if I would change my rating from 1 star to 5 stars.  I changed the feedback and they never sent me anything.  Aliexpress customer service were supposed to do something but never did.  I'd rather buy authentics (and for some teams you can readily find used Reebok Edge authentics for $100-200).  Just look here or on eBay or some of the hockey jersey forums and you can often find great deals on used or even brand new authentics.  And for those of you who are slobs - fullmoonjerseys offers a lot of great deals on Reebok Premier jerseys for cheap on eBay (see the sidebar here) - you can find blanks for $60-70 and jerseys with former players for $40 or less there.  I've also found brand new Indo-Edges on eBay cheap.  For example - Sandy's Fan-Tastic Stuff sells Indo-Edges for the same price as Reebok Premiers - http://stores.ebay.com/Sandys-Fan-tastic-Stuff?_rdc=1"

hockeyjerseys,3cv819,liquid1ce,18,Sat Jul 11 12:34:48 2015 UTC,Well that's disappointing that they feel that way. It all boils down to you get what you pay for.
hockeyjerseys,3cv819,lionsgoalie,29,Sat Jul 11 01:37:44 2015 UTC,To be honest the Reebok jerseys are pretty terrible quality.  Those ironed on patches are pretty terrible and fray like woah.

hockeyjerseys,3cv819,lionsgoalie,8,Sat Jul 11 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"I always want to comment on posts like that but really there isn't much of a point, guys who think like that are so set in their ways.   I'd say people in this sub are mostly collectors. Collectors of  ANYTHING (stamps, coins, rolexes, whatever) will always want to avoid counterfeits/fakes. That's just part of collecting."
hockeyjerseys,3cv819,RichardManuel,9,Sat Jul 11 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie that Penguins fake is actually one of the nicest looking ones that I've seen, and sure, at a glance it looks not much different to a Reebok made jersey, especially to an untrained eye. But like most things, the devil is in the details. Its the sketchy stitching, the materials used to make the jersey itself and the lettering, the cheaply thrown on fight strap that I can't get past. No one else might know that my jersey is a fake, but I will, and maybe I'm too particular and care about minor details but I just can't jive with buying a product that I know is fake and has imperfections.  But if you're happy with a fake, then all the power to you. My dad just got a fake as a gift like two weeks ago and he can't see how it differs from a legit jersey, so whatever, he is happy to wear it, and thats fine. If you don't care about the minor details then I guess fake jerseys are for you. But to say that people in this sub are ""elitist"" and consider those who buy fakes to be ""peasants"" is laughable. You can't blame us for wanting to buy the ACTUAL jersey and not a re-creation. We are mostly collectors after all."

hockeyjerseys,3cjs0a,giraffestafarian,3,Thu Jul 9 00:43:04 2015 UTC,CoolHockey is very good at what they do and they have a good reputation here.  I have a few from them (replica and authentic) and the fronts/sizing are accurate.  You should be good to go.

hockeyjerseys,3chiu8,another_plebeian,2,Wed Jul 8 15:48:49 2015 UTC,This is one of those things that it's worth the ~$15-30 bucks a tailor will charge.
hockeyjerseys,3chiu8,knoper21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure it is worth it as you don't save that much by buying a kit and sewing it yourself. Stahl's charges about 30-40 for NHLPA kits, where as you can send your jersey to Game Day Sports Archives and he usually charges about 50 bucks (not sure if that includes shipping back).  You also should have a heat press, which a cheap one might cost about 300-500.  If you wanted to cut your own kits, you'd have to buy an adequate vinyl plotter (not sure if that is the technical name) or a laser cutter. A brand new entry level laser cutter is about 10k give or take a few thousand. You might find a cheap used plotter from a local print shop. You can also do it longhand, and make stencils for numbers, but then you're getting into spending hours on creating numbers/letters.  If you want to learn to sew, I'd buy a roll of twill, and use it to practice sewing.  Here is a tutorial: http://www.stahls.com/stahls/09/pdf/techsheets/How-To-Sew-POLY-Twill.pdf  Youtube is also loaded with videos on everything. So I'm sure you can find some more sewing zig zag pattern tutorials there, but I doubt you'd find anything directly related to hockey jerseys."

hockeyjerseys,3ci5d9,knoper21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:53:29 2015 UTC,"Adding to this question, how much of a difference is there between men's and women's styles?

hockeyjerseys,3ci5d9,GlitterLamp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:05:29 2015 UTC,"What I noticed from personal experience: if you fit into a men's small, you shouldn't have a problem with a women's XXL and if the men's small is still a little too big, then even a women's XL is fine. I usually get one of the three - they all look more or less oversized on me anyway (also, I'm not a guy, so I don't care what the label says :)). The biggest difference is the length (men's small is longer), quality is the same.  If you look at the smaller sizes (small, medium) the style is a little different, but I haven't noticed that with XL/XXL. In this video you can see the difference, unfortunately they don't show all the sizes I've talked about."
hockeyjerseys,3ci5d9,c3ndre,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"Oh boy well, seeing as I'm a 6' dude that typically wears men's L, I think I'll be hard pressed to find any women's sizes that would fit.   Ah well, my money-saving idea was worth a shot I suppose. At least now I know the difference if I ever need to buy a present or something - thanks for your help :)"
hockeyjerseys,3ci5d9,GlitterLamp,0,Wed Jul 8 14:41:21 2015 UTC,"I've got jerseys in both women and men's sizes (I'm a lady), and the women's sizes are much more form fitting (they come in at the waist instead of being straight up and down on the sides) and shorter (the ones I have sit at the top of the hips). So, if you have a long torso, it'll be short on you."

hockeyjerseys,3chv8u,superfish5,5,Wed Jul 8 02:54:01 2015 UTC,Fake as well. The 2010 Winter Classic jerseys were not apart of the Vintage line. Between the CCM patch at the bottom and the vintage tag its a dead giveaway.

hockeyjerseys,3chv8u,54321Blast0ff,2,Wed Jul 8 22:08:12 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking but I don't think that Bruins style jersey was made at all for the vintage line. Not entirely sure though.
hockeyjerseys,3chrxq,TexMex08,3,Wed Jul 8 00:32:26 2015 UTC,It's probably a legit replica. Pre-Reebok replicas didn't get faked all that much. The problem with this one is that the branding isn't accurate. The Islanders wore CCM both of the years they wore the Fisherman jerseys.
hockeyjerseys,3chrxq,TheKevinShow,2,Wed Jul 8 00:52:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! So from what I've read the Koho and Starters aren't faked that much? Any truth to that?
hockeyjerseys,3chrxq,TheKevinShow,3,Wed Jul 8 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"No, pre-Reebok replicas are almost always legitimate, and they're of a much better quality. I refuse to buy Reebok Premiers because they're crap. That's why the modern Jets won't be represented in my collection until I start buying authentics. That being said, I do have a Thrashers jersey so the franchise is there, just not the team."
hockeyjerseys,3chrxq,knoper21,2,Wed Jul 8 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"Koho aren't faked at all, Starters only a few really minor ones from the early 2000s that are really obvious."
hockeyjerseys,3chrxq,markmalks,-3,Wed Jul 8 13:43:00 2015 UTC,eBay is not the most reliable source. My bet just looking at the price this is fake... However by just looking at the price you might as well get it becuase it is fucking awesome.

hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,Box_of_Shit,16,Wed Jul 8 13:43:04 2015 UTC,To answer your question I would consider it jersey foul. But there is no real reason for you to care what I think.
hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,canuck_11,6,Tue Jul 7 12:59:50 2015 UTC,"People get Orr, Neely, Bourque, ect. on brand new Bruins sweaters all the time. No reason you can't go the other way.  That said, you're REALLY going to regret that 'C' patch when he marries Selena Gomez and demands a trade to LA."
hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,JonnyBox,11,Tue Jul 7 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion: there is no such thing as a jersey foul. If that's the jersey you want, then buy it. The only thing that matters is if you will enjoy it."
hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,marksk88,6,Tue Jul 7 05:02:32 2015 UTC,"Things that seem inevitable sometimes turn out very differently. Personally, I wouldn't do it and would roll my eyes if I saw a guy wearing a McDavid jersey with a C. I doubt McDavid will be the captain withing the next five-seven years, especially if Hall is still around.   All that being said, do what makes you happy."
hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,LazerMcBlazer,3,Tue Jul 7 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, but do what you want. Maybe wait on the C though."
hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,beardyman22,5,Tue Jul 7 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"According to the bylaws, you will be violating Article VI, Section II, which reads: ""A jersey from a particular time period must only be customized using players from said time period /s  Real advice: Do whatever will make you the most happy. This hobby is all about having fun first. I personally wouldn't do it but we buy/collect/wear jerseys for different reasons.  Note- It might be a while until McDavid wears the C...this point actually gets me curious in thinking how long it will take. I think Crosby started wearing an A immediately, and became the captain rather quickly. Gretzky didn't become the captain of the Oilers for 4 or 5 years IIRC."
hockeyjerseys,3ce2nc,NowIRockATellerSuit,2,Tue Jul 7 13:20:16 2015 UTC,"I would recommend to send it to EPS or Game Day Sports Archives (if you're in Canada), they do better work on older jerseys than Cool Hockey for a similar price. (Turn around might be longer at EPS).   As far as it being a foul. Will other people think it is a foul? The truth is that within the bubble of collecting, most people tend to hate the idea of a player on a jersey they never wore.   If that's enough to make you feel self conscious about owning it, that's your call. Most casual or non-collector hockey fans probably won't care, but it might raise an eyebrow or two amongst older fans.  Ultimately, it is your jersey, your money. If it is what you want, and it doesn't bother you that some people might scoff at it, I'd say go for it."

Brian Burke, GM at the time, was adamant that players had to earn their ""low"" numbers, and until then, you had to wear ""race car"" numbers (i.e. high).  The next year, which happened to be the Stanley Cup year, they had earned those numbers in Burkie's mind."

CCM/Starter-era Bruins jerseys crop up on there fairly frequently, and people usually aren't asking much for them.  Craigslist is a good place to look too if you're local to Boston. I got an autographed Byron Dafoe jersey on craigslist for $40. Sometimes, people just want to get rid of the older styles, and you can get a pretty good deal.

hockeyjerseys,3c9sea,RedRando,3,Mon Jul 6 14:50:02 2015 UTC,"That jersey is definitely fake. Shoddy construction aside, that jersey never existed in size 48. For the record on current Reebok jerseys:     Reebok Premiers (replicas) come in letter sizing - XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL, XXXXL. Men's XS and XXL+ sizing exists, but is rare. Replicas never have fight straps.     Reebok Edges (authentics) come in numerical sizing - 46, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 58+, 60. 58 and 58+ are not retail sold, they're only on gameworns or team issues. Authentics always have fight straps.     A dead giveaway on a fake is if the jersey is size 48, the size was never made for current Reebok Edge jerseys. Sz. 48 was last used for pre-Edge jerseys, before 2007. Sizing aside, things to watch out for are poor embroidery/construction, off coloring, bubbly looking crests and letters (real jerseys have stiff cresting and almost never bubble), wrong font on nameplates, and if the seller is from China, where NHL hockey is a niche sport at best."

hockeyjerseys,3c8fd6,BCEagle2011,3,Mon Jul 6 04:53:54 2015 UTC,My best bet would be exclusiveprosports.com. Send them an email to see if they could do that kit. They usually respond pretty quick too.

I would suggest having eBay email you daily when new search results are listed. Just log in & run the search for what you are looking for. Next to where they tell you the number of results, you can save it and setup an email option. Works well when you are stalking a specific jersey."

hockeyjerseys,3c4sbf,jon_izafish,2,Sat Jul 4 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"Going on the order of the pictures after the stock picture   You can see a ""Made in Indonesia"" tag under the Reebok tag, all counterfeits try to pass off as ""Made in Canada"" The Winter Classic patch is properly sized and ironed on, all counterfeits will have an oversized patch that is stitched directly on Crest has minor bubbling, I have a legit Winter Classic Fleury premier jersey that has that same issue. The counterfeits will have way more severe bubbling. Nameplate is too long as per the standard with premiers, and Malkin isn't oversized as seen with counterfeits like here Crumpled/bubbling looking numbers standard with premiers. Last picture shows the standard plastic single layer used on all store-bought premier jerseys.   Other ways to differentiate with this particular jersey but not shown are ""Winter Classic January 1, 2011"" will be printed neatly in the collar whereas fakes have it stitched directly in. Also shoddy fightstraps are usually an easy giveaway."

hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,Mosetter27,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:40:17 2015 UTC,why did you get downvoted?
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,another_plebeian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:12:25 2015 UTC,Apparently the appropriate answer is downvotable
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,Mosetter27,0,Sun Jul 5 01:20:58 2015 UTC,Because it's not correct. I have jerseys crested by the company that does the Oilers jerseys that have this tag. The numbers were not put on at a factory.
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,b0r0n,2,Sun Jul 5 04:07:50 2015 UTC,I am curious as to this as well. here is a pic of one on my Staios 'Oil Drop' jersey.
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,canuck_11,0,Sat Jul 4 13:18:32 2015 UTC,"If you live in Edmonton, then you probably had this crested at RMC sports. (Both Game On and United Cycle subcontract to them). Every jersey I've had done by them has this tag."
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,b0r0n,0,Sun Jul 5 04:16:13 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the tag is supposed to be put on if the cresting is done using official licensed name kits. For example, at my local jersey store, they could put my name and number for about half the price. When they put an NHL player, then licensing fees are part of the kit. The Player tag comes with that kit."
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,b0r0n,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:55:27 2015 UTC,Not quite... See my answer above
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,Mosetter27,0,Sun Jul 5 01:21:40 2015 UTC,..and my reply. I have jerseys in my hand that show your answer is incorrect.
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,b0r0n,0,Sun Jul 5 04:08:44 2015 UTC,Those tags are only given to the nhl factory's.. In the present case it's reebok in the last it was ccm/koho ..  Your local customizer doesn't get those tags... Trust me I've been collecting a long time and have accumulated more jerseys than you can think.
hockeyjerseys,3c3e6g,Mosetter27,0,Sun Jul 5 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"So explain why I have jerseys with these tags?  Jerseys that I bought from one retailer without numbering, then brought to a customizer for numbering. Your claim doesn't support the facts."

hockeyjerseys,3c1eoy,Mosetter27,3,Fri Jul 3 21:44:23 2015 UTC,"Counterfeit.   I guess there are times when fake jerseys are falsified as legit, but it blows my mind that a fake Wild Wing can go for that much on ebay when in a quick google search you can find the exact same thing for 70 bucks.  It isn't a good idea to buy a Wild Wing jersey on eBay any more unless you're really certain, there are some very convincing blank fakes. That one you posted is pretty easy to spot, but because it is sublimated, and a lot of the counterfeiters don't put fight straps on the Wild Wing knockoffs, they are a lot harder to tell for casual collectors.  It is sort of getting out there that there are a lot of fakes now, but I'm sure a few people got duped early on with some of the better blank fakes."
hockeyjerseys,3c1eoy,imnotonacid87,2,Sat Jul 4 00:58:28 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity would This one be authentic then?

hockeyjerseys,3bx70p,State0fChaos,3,Fri Jul 3 02:06:50 2015 UTC,That Bouillon jersey is beautiful. If I didn't already have a weber I'd be interested.   Real talk: You gotta get Hasek up on one of those bitches
hockeyjerseys,3bx70p,hammertime4525,2,Fri Jul 3 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"Idk what it is about the Preds jerseys. They're just so nice!  Yeah, Hasek is right at the top of my list....I might have to settle on customizing one of my blanks"
hockeyjerseys,3bx70p,hammertime4525,2,Fri Jul 3 02:07:56 2015 UTC,Awesome collection man! You got some steals on those jerseys.
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,leafsfan97,34,Thu Jul 2 19:22:26 2015 UTC,This made me laugh
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,afux,6,Thu Jul 2 19:22:47 2015 UTC,I removed the stitching for the side numbers but I am wondering if there is anyway to get the number of the jersey without ripping it. Thanks !
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,Kitten_Hammer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"If the customization is tackle twill, a seam ripper should do the trick. I have no advice for iron-on faux tackle twill."
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,dudedisguisedasadude,6,Fri Jul 3 04:49:14 2015 UTC,Dude why don't you wait and see if someone else they pick up takes that number right away. I would still sport the shit out of a Leafs Kessel though. Should've offered to sell it first.
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,MetropolisPt31,5,Fri Jul 3 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"I have 2 Kessel jerseys, so I wanted to change one of them."
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,chickenz666,3,Fri Jul 3 13:24:15 2015 UTC,I've noticed some of the newer replica jerseys have numbers that feel a bit like plastic.  I bet those are ironed on.  The stitching is there simply for visual effect.
hockeyjerseys,3bwlzy,cverl996,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend removing the numbers as there is a great chance of ripping the jersey and even if you do get the numbers to come off there will be a glue outline on the jersey.  If you still want to proceed you will need a way to warm up the glue, with an iron or other heat source, and carefully peel away the numbers. Again I would not recommend doing this as it could discolor your jersey and it will steal leave an outline."
hockeyjerseys,3bwjwx,kdunks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for one too. Jersey baron on eBay (link on the sidebar) has some authentics at $425 USD and a blank premier with the patch at $125. I've seen some premiers floating around eBay, too, but they're still pretty spendy. Personally, I'm keeping my eyes open for a good deal on a blank and then getting it customized. I don't know how familiar you are with spotting fakes, so if you aren't and you want to buy online from somewhere not listed on the sidebar you might want to post it here for an authenticity check first."

hockeyjerseys,3bq671,Imoffensiveontheweb,3,Wed Jul 1 06:45:31 2015 UTC,"I'd be 80% that they're not changing colours.   The red is very susceptible to lighting, in my closet my Emelin gamer can appear almost burgundy and in the sun almost as red as a knockoff.  I can guarantee you, however, that there never will be a shortage of Montreal Canadiens red jerseys as long as professional hockey exists.  I'd wait on it just to be sure."
hockeyjerseys,3bq671,knoper21,2,Thu Jul 2 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure if the colors have been altered or not but I don't recall seeing anything in the articles about any color changes and with the Habs I'd think that would get mentioned.   My guess is that the new stock photos don't quite match the old photos due to lighting, etc. I expect we'll see early next season once a few of the wonks have wonked it up. Or something."

hockeyjerseys,3bnlah,schennbros,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:31 2015 UTC,Any of the shops in the sidebar will be able to help you out with customization.
hockeyjerseys,3bnlah,TheKevinShow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:25:14 2015 UTC,EPS' website doesn't list all the jerseys they can do.
hockeyjerseys,3bnlah,schennbros,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"Not going to be able to tell unless there's an image of the actual jersey listed.  Their feedback looks fine and the prices aren't super low, so they're probably fine."
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,PrisonedMuffin,11,Tue Jun 30 19:55:27 2015 UTC,Not at all. Looks like a accurately customized jersey with a proper edge plate as well
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,K0RnD4Wg,-3,Tue Jun 30 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, only reason I'm a bit concerned because there's a bit of space between the beginning K as well as some space between the end H"
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,Graemelee,6,Tue Jun 30 20:01:19 2015 UTC,This is normal.
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,Flavourdynamics,5,Tue Jun 30 21:12:18 2015 UTC,"I've returned two jerseys across the Atlantic due to the customization job, and let me tell you, if you return this you are orders of magnitude more picky than I! It looks absolutely fine to me, even though you might be right."
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,knoper21,2,Wed Jul 1 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"^ This would be my general opinion.  The gamers I have/have seen vary from hugging the name tight to leaving a bit of a gap.  This would be on the higher end of the scale, but it's not bad, and it certainly wouldn't be noticeable to a passerby.  Then again, if it bugs you, it's a problem.  If OP bought it off the rack at a big store and the error will drive you nuts, I'd recommend returning it.  If OP bought it from an online retailer, I'd expect some major flack and, at best, to cover shipping fees and maybe extra for the return."
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,Det40oz,3,Wed Jul 1 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"The nameplate looks good, although just a tiny bit longer than normal (as pictured in the gamer that someone else posted), but what would bother me about the nameplate is that its a tiny bit off-center.  The ""EIT"" should line up with the reebok logo and the midsection of the top of the 2, and it looks a centimeter or so off.   Alot of people wouldn't even mind that, but that's the only thing I could see that would actually bother me."
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,remz07twos,2,Tue Jun 30 21:20:01 2015 UTC,differing opinion here. yes it is too long. the gamer looks to have about 1.5 letter spacings between the first/last letter and the edge. but worth returning? idk
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,remz07twos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:31:07 2015 UTC,Should I get it removed and redone?
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,schennbros,5,Tue Jun 30 20:38:23 2015 UTC,not worth the $30 to get it done.
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,knoper21,2,Tue Jun 30 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"Here's a Keith gamer on eBay.  Yeah, the namebar looks a little longer, but not by much.    If it really bothers you, send it back.  I'm super picky about stuff like that, so it would probably bother me too."
hockeyjerseys,3bo55p,knoper21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll probably take it to the Hawks official letterer to see what they can do. Otherwise I'll return it and purchase a blank."

hockeyjerseys,3bnuvn,ihennebe,3,Tue Jun 30 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"With the newer style jersey your only choices are really Glen Murray, Mike Mottau or Steve Begin. Murray is obviously the most successful of the three. Mottau's a local guy from Quincy though, so even though he only ever played 6 games, it's still kind of a cool story.   *Edit: That's if you wanted to keep the number. /u/coolhockey has done great for me getting jerseys done, I'm sure they can do whatever you need."
hockeyjerseys,3bnuvn,BCEagle2011,3,Tue Jun 30 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"Glen Murray jersey would be so damn slick. I started following the B's in 2002 and he was my first favorite player (later became Marc Savard, who is still my favorite). I now feel like I should get one of my old style CCMs customized to a Murray..."
hockeyjerseys,3bnuvn,54321Blast0ff,4,Tue Jun 30 21:28:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. We have no problem replacing namebar (rectangle over rectangle) but don't suggest removing numbers... Sorry for your loss.

hockeyjerseys,3bnuvn,Fitzwell,2,Tue Jun 30 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"Well you could always try selling it on here or eBay if you really want it gone. Most people will tell you that removing the numbers is a bad idea, but if you wanted to go that route here is what the coverage over the old numbers could look like: http://imgur.com/mOl2461 Obviously the numbers won't be there, but from my understanding there is sometimes a faint outline of them left over after a jersey has been stripped."

hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,DustinPenncakes,6,Tue Jun 30 03:58:53 2015 UTC,Of the jerseys I've had customized so far:   Mighty Ducks - Teemu Selanne - Dude. It's Teemu. Thrashers - Andrew Brunette - It's a 99-00 jersey and he was one of the few bright spots on the team that year Stars - Mike Modano - Same reason as Teemu. Rangers - Brian Leetch - He was the captain the one year they wore the white Liberty alternate. Penguins - Mario Lemieux - See Selanne and Modano.   Future ones:   Avs - Ray Bourque - Bourque getting the Cup after the 2001 Final is one of my favorite sports moments ever. Kings - Luc Robitaille - The best player ever to wear the jersey save for Gretzky. It's an easy choice. 2014 US Olympic team - Josh Sweeney - Because I said I'd get the jersey of the player who scored the gold medal-winning goal for the US and that included sled hockey.
hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,TheKevinShow,4,Tue Jun 30 05:01:12 2015 UTC,"Heh, I probably think about this way too much, but it is one of my favorite parts of jersey collecting.  If I'm getting a jersey of my favorite team, I try to go not for the ""franchise player"" but players who provided valuable roles on the team. I also have a knack for collecting unique jerseys in some way, whether the player is a HOFer but was only here briefly, or the jersey-style was worn briefly, etc.  Right now my 2 go-tos are my 2007 Sergei Brylin (great role player who was on all 3 Devils Cup teams) and my Stadium Series Jagr (such a random Devils jersey I love it). As much as I love Brodeur, Stevens, and Elias...those are the 3 that everyone has and I didn't want to do the same thing.  The most interesting observation I've noticed is that I rather wait until AFTER a player is done with the Devils, or at least has spent considerable time on the team, so I can evaluate whether he will have ""lifetime appreciation"" from the Devils fanbase. It's too risky for me to go in on a Schneider or a Larsson now as we don't know if these guys will be long-term Devils yet.  But when it comes to other teams, I like to get a franchise player."
hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,NowIRockATellerSuit,3,Tue Jun 30 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"I really hope Schneider becomes a longterm Devil and all-star for you guys. My next jersey purchase is going to be a home Schneids, although I still wish that Miro Satan had played at least one game as a Devil. Nothing could be better."

hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,ryan49321,9,Tue Jun 30 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"Why do you think it makes them look like an ass? Maybe they had always been a huge Hossa fan on and off the ice and were super pumped when he became a Wing. Or maybe they just liked the way he played there? I never understand people who get pissed when a player gets traded. You always have the memory of rooting for one of your favorite players while they were on your team. I mean, I get it if they went to a rival or were a prick about it but who cares?"
hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,LazerMcBlazer,2,Tue Jun 30 04:52:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ass, however if you buy a jersey and the player gets traded/signs with another team weeks/months later, you may feel duped.  But if that player happened will be forever revered with his work done with a particular team, then it will still be a good jersey to have. {Although I don't think Hossa fits into that category with Detroit, but he's likely a future HOF'er so that complicates things :)  }"
hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,NowIRockATellerSuit,-2,Tue Jun 30 13:09:23 2015 UTC,Because theyre proudly wearing a name thats trying to beat their team. It has nothing to do with being pissed that a player was traded.

hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,JGreenberg11,2,Tue Jun 30 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"If I buy a game worn or previously owned jersey with a player I usually don't usually care who it is, as I'm mostly interested in the jersey itself and look for good deals. For jerseys I customize it'll be a player I like. For the Caps, I'd rather have an assortment of players than a lot of jerseys of the same player."
hockeyjerseys,3bld2x,Galvanick_Lucipher,2,Tue Jun 30 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"I've only gotten one jersey blank and then had it customized, everything else has been customized or made before it reaches me. Generally I follow these rules... 1. Is the jersey on sale? 2. Does the player have a semi-decent track record? 3. Has the player played on his World Championship, World Junior Championship or Olympic team? 4. Is said player on my list of jerseys to buy? 5. Can I make an exception and add him to my list? If I said yes to all of these, then I buy the jersey with the player's name"

hockeyjerseys,3bisgc,remz07twos,2,Mon Jun 29 16:37:27 2015 UTC,I know it's going to happen but I really hope it doesn't. I don't want the NHL to have 3 stripes on every teams shoulders like in soccer. Adidas makes some of the ugliest sports equipment in my opinion.
hockeyjerseys,3bisgc,JGreenberg11,3,Mon Jun 29 18:25:54 2015 UTC,why would you think adidas would put 3 stripes on a hockey jersey? is that really something you think would happen?
hockeyjerseys,3bisgc,another_plebeian,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:57:52 2015 UTC,Because Adidas has the tendency to make every team wear the same thing and the 3 stripes is their trademark for jerseys.
hockeyjerseys,3bisgc,JGreenberg11,3,Tue Jun 30 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"they make NBA jerseys without shoulder stripes, very few of which share the same pattern template"
hockeyjerseys,3bisgc,another_plebeian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:51:30 2015 UTC,I think that's the one sport wear they did that right and even so a lot of NBA fans aren't fans of Adidas jerseys.

hockeyjerseys,3bisgc,Galgenfrist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Everyone gives Nike bad reps for their jerseys but it's honestly 10x better than Adidas can do. The old Nike hockey jerseys were great. So are the current football ones and I can't wait to see what they do for basketball. My favorite jersey company is Majestic but I honestly hope they stick with baseball because they're so good at it, I do t want them to try other sports and have baseball quality drop."

hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,bajubiejunior,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:08:55 2015 UTC,"eBay and you'll be looking for the KOHO versions, not the starter or pro player. Ovi ones come up occasionally and you tend to have to pay a lot for them. You're better off getting a blank and sending it to EPS, official customizer of the Capitals, to get it customized for $85.  Edit: Here is a blank. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Washington-Capitals-NHL-Replica-Jersey-Quality-Made-by-Koho-Mens-Large-/221789940417?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_2&hash=item33a3b5eac1  Edit #2: As I've been reminded/corrected KOHO would be wrong. You'll want a Reebok one and those ones don't come up very often. Jerseybaron on eBay sells some blank authentic ones for about $300. Sometimes you'll be able to find one with CCM branding and those ones sell in the $75-$150 range."
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:05:09 2015 UTC,That large would fit relatively similar to today's premier jerseys correct?
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:25:38 2015 UTC,I believe so. I don't actually own a jersey in that style so I can't compare.
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,Mosetter27,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:57:04 2015 UTC,They fit a little bigger than today's premier L especially the sleeves
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,TheKevinShow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:07:10 2015 UTC,"No, actually, Koho wouldn't be accurate. Ovechkin started with the Caps in 2005-06 so he's only worn Reebok. Unfortunately, you won't find that jersey in Reebok in a replica since post-lockout pre-Edge replicas were all made with CCM branding."
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,DustinPenncakes,2,Mon Jun 29 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"You're right, my bad. I always forget that when I double check on nhluniforms since they don't have the rebrand marked on the Caps page."
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,TheKevinShow,2,Mon Jun 29 04:10:05 2015 UTC,"Well, if OP wants to be as accurate as possible, he'd want a Reebok authentic, but those aren't easy to track down, since the black Reeboks were only worn for two years."
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,DustinPenncakes,2,Mon Jun 29 04:45:09 2015 UTC,Jerseybaron sells a few blanks in different sizes for $300. Not too sure OP would be willing to pay close to $400 for a 100% accurate Ovi jersey though.
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,TheKevinShow,2,Mon Jun 29 04:57:51 2015 UTC,Finding cheap authentics is near impossible unless the team is crap.  It's really too bad that the Baron doesn't have the late 90s Caps blue in authentic. It's a much better jersey than the black jersey.
hockeyjerseys,3bg7ds,DustinPenncakes,2,Mon Jun 29 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"That is very true.  It's a good thing they don't have it because I would be a poor man. My goal is to have that jersey with Bondra on the back, but I can only find Starter versions of it."

I was sort of expecting an orange jersey but I never expected it to be an actual replica of what they wore way back in the WHA, when they were the Alberta Oilers. Hell, they even got it down to the collar, which is in a style that's unique to the current Edge uniforms.  Nevertheless, it's beautiful either way, and it's great to see them wear orange again. I'll think about preordering this."

The jersey smelt strongly of smoke and had some yellow stains where the smoke got through the bag (the bag itself was now yellow). Paid $50 and luckily the dry cleaner got rid of the yellow stains and smell. Sadly though the dry cleaner ripped off the tags. It took some work but am happy to add this piece to the collection.

hockeyjerseys,3b0w83,canuck_11,2,Thu Jun 25 02:57:10 2015 UTC,me too! instead the cup just gave the rebranding that much more of a reason to stay but oh well
hockeyjerseys,3b0w83,Nas160,6,Thu Jun 25 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"One of the best sweater designs and color schemes of all time imo. Yeah, it was a product of the times, but now is the era where we look back all that time ago and realize how awesome they were. The color scheme really looks amazing."
hockeyjerseys,3b0w83,BuddyCheque,3,Thu Jun 25 05:56:55 2015 UTC,The captain's C doesn't look quite correct to me. It's more of a rectangle font than what you have.

hockeyjerseys,3b2qvr,irishguy42,3,Thu Jun 25 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"Well this is interesting. It is a legitimate premier replica but I wonder why they would remove the SS patch. The jock tag I can understand but why the patch? Anyway, I don't know to much about the other site you posted but on the sidebar here there is CoolHockey and IceJerseys which both do great jersey customizing and I'm sure would sew on the patch too. I'm guessing you'd have to buy the patch beforehand as well. You can PM them on here too to ask."
hockeyjerseys,3b2qvr,chickenz666,2,Thu Jun 25 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know they both do send-in customization. I'm not sure if they have the number/nameplate kit for the SS though, since they don't have them in their online store. I'll message them and find out. If either can do both, that would be an A+ (bought a jersey from CH and loved it, so I may be biased :P)  The jersey not having the SS patch did seem a bit odd. Not sure why it's not there. But otherwise, it looks like it isn't a fake?"
hockeyjerseys,3b2qvr,chickenz666,2,Thu Jun 25 15:04:09 2015 UTC,"Woops totally forgot, the Rangers did wear these jerseys outside of the SS for a game against the Islanders. That's why there's no patch. Also it is not a fake. The stitching, material, and tags all look good."
hockeyjerseys,3b2qvr,RichardManuel,2,Thu Jun 25 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Well, they did play the Devils and Islanders in the SS, and wore this for both. What other game did they play wearing these? Must have been at some other point in the 13-14 season, since I don't think they wore them this year.  I guess it's minor details, since it's the same jersey, and I can just buy the patch and send it in to get sewn on.  Thanks!"

hockeyjerseys,3b2pig,ZachB10,3,Thu Jun 25 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"No.  With Nords jerseys, the Fleurs are a dead giveaway of the awful stitching."
hockeyjerseys,3b2pig,knoper21,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:55:24 2015 UTC,Wow. A $350 price point for a fake jersey. Are these style jerseys faked often? Not the Nordiques in general but players with their statistics on them.
hockeyjerseys,3b2pig,knoper21,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ones with all the stats are usually fake."

hockeyjerseys,3b0scf,kahnives,3,Thu Jun 25 01:27:10 2015 UTC,Anyone know why the CCM logo on the back is so high up? I thought those were normally on the bottom for that era of jersey.

hockeyjerseys,3b0scf,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:47:13 2015 UTC,That's the only concern I have about it.
hockeyjerseys,3b0scf,ZachB10,2,Thu Jun 25 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"Looks good. These are very rarely faked. I would just confirm with the seller because the title says ""Hossa"" and ""Stanley Cup"", make sure what you're paying for is what you're getting."

hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,canuck_11,2,Wed Jun 24 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"For sure. I have one of the blue ones, but it's not in great condition. I mostly use it for ice hockey. A guy I play with has the Capitol building one, it's gorgeous"
hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,LazerMcBlazer,2,Wed Jun 24 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but their two Blue and White ones"
hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,canuck_11,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:08 2015 UTC,I love my white WC and love this one as well. I want one. My big concern is how much the design will suffer in the Reebok premiers and that horrible jock tag. This one may be authentic or bust.
hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,LazerMcBlazer,5,Wed Jun 24 13:57:12 2015 UTC,What if I told you you could use a seam ripper and take it off in about three minutes?
hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,canuck_11,2,Wed Jun 24 16:17:26 2015 UTC,I did see the post on that before. And I would do that for sure. I guess it is just the quality that frustrates me. I have been drawn to pre-lockout replicas because of what Reebok has done.
hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,LazerMcBlazer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"I have three Premiers and have taken all the tags off, immediately gives the jersey a better look and ""feel"". However, I would never buy a Premier of a jersey that had shoulder patches. Just can't handle the screen printed heat press things they put on. I'm not sure how the stars are put on the Caps white retros but I'm guessing the same way."
hockeyjerseys,3ay98o,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:46:27 2015 UTC,Surprisingly on the white WC jersey the stars are stitched. It is a CCM cut.

hockeyjerseys,3ayiu1,knoper21,2,Wed Jun 24 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"I'm bad with explaining these things... one thing is the quality, but the 1.0 is still a lot better than a premier (replica) and for that price (ebay) you can't complain. The 2.0 are usually more expensive. And then there's also those Indo-Edge jerseys made in Indonesia.  I'm sure you can use the search function here (or just google) to find a better explanation. Or someone else can help?"
hockeyjerseys,3ayiu1,c3ndre,2,Wed Jun 24 15:29:26 2015 UTC,google helped me out a little bit too after a quick sift around. but thank you for your answer as well!
hockeyjerseys,3ayiu1,c3ndre,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"1.0 and 2.0 are both authentics.  1.0 featured a different, softer material that is at points water resistant (you can put it under the sink and the water just leaves), and has a bit of a tighter/stretchier fit.  In any event, this is a good one, though I'd go up a size from what you'd normally get."

hockeyjerseys,3avohe,SwugLip,0,Tue Jun 23 22:54:45 2015 UTC,as stated above I'm Sorry but most of the prices are firm and low enough to begin with... I'm taking HUGE loses on most of these..
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,Archly_Jittery,2,Tue Jun 23 23:02:08 2015 UTC,I understand. Though I'm on a tight budget. Would you do $100 shipped? I live in Pittsburgh so shipping shouldn't be very expensive.
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,Ask_Me_If_Im_Stamkos,2,Tue Jun 23 23:39:08 2015 UTC,shipping is $15 I use USPS Flat Rate Boxes... it covers me in all aspects...if you wanted the Orange Adirondack Phantoms 52 it would be $115 shipped.
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,Ask_Me_If_Im_Stamkos,2,Tue Jun 23 23:55:40 2015 UTC,If you ship anywhere in the U.S. using USPS it'll only cost around $5. Anything west won't be more than $10. USPS is cheaper to ship jerseys I've discovered
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,TheLoneCenturian,4,Wed Jun 24 02:08:40 2015 UTC,I use Flat Rate boxes.

hockeyjerseys,3avohe,87ofHarts,2,Tue Jun 23 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"Why take a ""huge"" loss on your jerseys?"
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,87ofHarts,5,Tue Jun 23 23:59:17 2015 UTC,"Well,   Idk if you've seen any of my previous posts or my post showing my collection. I'll assume you haven't and explain in a little more detail. I've been collecting jerseys for about 10 years. My collection prior to me selling off some amassed 350 jerseys, give or take a few. I now have 170 or so that I'm keeping and 110 up for sale at the moment remaining. What made me decide to start selling them was that I just had too many. When I started going through and deciding what I was keeping and selling I was finding jerseys and scratching my head as to when I bought them. While I'll never get exactly what I paid for most of my jerseys. I'd rather get something. Most jerseys are priced well below they're value and what I paid BUT, I'd rather see them go to good collectors who will appreciate them.   TL:DR I'd rather sell the jerseys at a loss to collectors who will appreciate them, then have them sit in my closet"
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,87ofHarts,2,Wed Jun 24 00:07:53 2015 UTC,Looking at the thread I think it's still good but just want to check do you still have that pooh bear jersey?

hockeyjerseys,3avohe,tigercaviar,0,Wed Jun 24 03:21:25 2015 UTC,as said prices are low enough... and shipping in a box would be $60 or in a bag (with no responsibility on my end) would be $25. so your total would be either $195 in a box for both or $160 in a bag with no responsibility on my end.

hockeyjerseys,3avohe,justthetip751,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:00:03 2015 UTC,Unfortunately yes. Shipping to Canada is a nightmare. It would be $45 for 1 Jersey $60 for 2 in a Box or I can ship cheaper ($25) in a bag but I assume no responsibility once I put it in the post office hands.

hockeyjerseys,3avohe,DeadpoolShotFirst,2,Wed Jun 24 20:05:29 2015 UTC,Which Columbus the chimera or the white blank... Yes shipping can be pretty expensive $60 in a box or $25 in a bag but if I send it in a bag (large padded envelope) I assume no responsibility once the jerseys leave my hands.
hockeyjerseys,3avohe,DeadpoolShotFirst,2,Wed Jun 24 20:28:48 2015 UTC,The white blank. In a bag because I can't afford the box. What would the overall price be?

hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,rdmdcne,2,Sun Jun 21 21:32:47 2015 UTC,Sounds like a great idea! I might want to get mine customized as a Fedorov 13 with an 'A'

hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,marksk88,6,Sun Jun 21 21:58:50 2015 UTC,"Nice score. They didn't wear these alternates for more then a season or two did they? Man, for a team that's been around for less than 25 years, they have had a LOT of different jerseys. Which is kind of cool if you're an Anaheim fan, because it gives you a lot to collect. I'm a Leafs fan, and their jerseys have remained virtually unchanged for almost 50 years, save for differences in striping and shoulder patches."
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,canuck_11,5,Sun Jun 21 23:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think they only wore them from 03-06. And if you're a fan of an original 6 team, there's not many crazy or different jerseys to look out for."
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,marksk88,2,Sun Jun 21 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Ya, I just pulled it up and you are right, they wore them for 3 years and then changed uniforms when they dropped the ""mighty"". Although in my opinion, their jerseys have all looked pretty awful since the name/logo/colour change. They just don't compare to the jade and eggplant.   And yes, it's true that the original 6 clubs are very reluctant to do anything to radical (except maybe for the pooh bear jerseys). On one hand I like that they stick with the classic designs, they all hold a lot of history and prestige. On the other hand, as a collector, I wish my favorite team had more variety. Oh well."
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,canuck_11,4,Mon Jun 22 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"Imagine the uproar if the Leafs did a word mark jersey. But you are right, they could move a bit on the traditional uniforms."
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,marksk88,2,Mon Jun 22 00:52:40 2015 UTC,What do you mean by word mark jersey?
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,canuck_11,3,Mon Jun 22 00:54:33 2015 UTC,Like the ducks one we are discussing here. Where the jerseys is essentially the team name written across it instead of a logo.
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,marksk88,2,Mon Jun 22 01:36:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, gotcha. Some of the stylized ones like this ducks jersey or the Wild's alternate green jersey look nice. But the basic diagonal block letters (like NYR and the old penguins jersey) are a little to boring for my taste."
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,MrHockeytown,3,Mon Jun 22 01:46:38 2015 UTC,Haha hilarious that you mention that: I just got the Pens diagonal jersey on Friday. Not my favourite choice of style but the jersey is a beaut. I'll post it tomorrow.
hockeyjerseys,3an1ny,imaketoast,2,Mon Jun 22 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"They're certainly not horrible jerseys by any means, just kind of bland in my opinion. Almost generic looking. But there are lots other factors that could make a jersey great outside of pure aesthetic appeal."

Obviously, that one has the CCM Vintage tag in the neck which is a clear give away, but I've even seen a knock off with the correct CCM neck tag. So you've gotta be pretty careful.   It'd be nice if Reebok/CCM would just re-issue popular jerseys like these and the Burger King as there is clearly a market for them."

hockeyjerseys,3aitpk,drrtydan,2,Sat Jun 20 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"WD 40 can take out marker. It'll take a few (maybe dozen if need be) passes, but it works.   It'll slowly fade the stain, and the WD 40 just washes out with laundry detergent.   You'll need to spray (you can spray a few times of you like ), let it sit, scrub/wash it out, and repeat til you're happy with the result."
hockeyjerseys,3aitpk,thatsong,2,Sat Jun 20 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, I've never heard of this one. Have you done it yourself? I would have thought that, being a petroleum product,  the WD40 would leave a yellowish stain itself."
hockeyjerseys,3aitpk,marksk88,2,Mon Jun 22 00:29:28 2015 UTC,"I've done it before with markers on white and cream coloured fabric and it washes out fine. You may need to soak in detergent if you use a lot of WD 40 as you can have residuals left over.   You may also have to wash it one more time, or febreeze it if the smell lingers, but that will also disappear."

hockeyjerseys,3aitpk,dudedisguisedasadude,2,Sat Jun 20 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"If I were in this situation, I would try a clear solvent first that will be less likely to stain the white. Try in a inconspicuous area first to test its effect on the material. I would try lacquer thinner or naptha first. Maybe 90% ethanol would work. I have heard that hairspray does well getting out ink stains so that one might be worth a shot too. A magic eraser/melamine pad will do wonders when combined with a solvent, but it is a fine abrasive that could cause pulls in the fabric. It has worked well for me so far though. I would be wary of WD-40 permanently staining your garments especially in white areas. It is petroleum based and nearly impossible to completely wash out of clothing. I have thrown away many rags and shirts that have become permanently stained by it at work. Even if there is no visible stain good luck getting the smell out."

hockeyjerseys,3aj7cb,OakenTable,4,Sat Jun 20 18:43:42 2015 UTC,NCAA is not allowed to sell jerseys with a player's names on the back. So your best bet with that one is to buy a nice blank one and custom put Toews' name and number.

You will have a hell of a time.  You may even have to buy a gamer of that era and strip it (""88"" covers just about everything, thankfully).  For customization, Pete's in London will probably be your best bet.  If you're fine with any Knights jersey, call the team, they may help."

hockeyjerseys,3aiiy1,DMGRT,4,Sat Jun 20 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Game-issued - jersey issued to a player for a specific game or set of games that the player ends up not wearing due to trade, call up, demotion, injury etc.  Team issued - jerseys given to the team in case of call up or trade.   Game prept - jersey prepared for a player but never made it to the ice...   Game prept is pretty much the same as game issued"
hockeyjerseys,3aiiy1,Mosetter27,0,Sat Jun 20 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"Game-Issued jerseys can also be back-up jerseys, especially for fighters, as most typically have at least one back-up made for them in case of severe damage during a fight. The back-up would typically then have the same customizations as the original if the fighter had his jerseys customized (2nd fight strap, reinforced collar, shortened sleeves), just would have little to no wear to it.  GI jerseys may also have been worn in the preseason for instance, but the player was sent down thus the jersey was GI for the regular season, so it is possible to have a jersey categorized as a GI that has some minor wear or damage to it."

Or do you want exactly the same as used in the jerseys? Then I have no idea.  Regular shoelaces are probably not as soft, but if it's just the look you're after it might work.  I would probably take your jersey to a store that sells a variety of shoelaces and ask there. It'd be easier if they were white, but with the wild jersey you'll need to match the color."

hockeyjerseys,3ab3cz,CyberPope,2,Thu Jun 18 17:38:34 2015 UTC,Probably better off getting a blank. If you get a blank you're looking at $100 at most for your total investment after you get it and have it customized.

hockeyjerseys,3a8akm,Nas160,3,Thu Jun 18 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"If you want 100% authenticity, since the jersey is manufactured by Starter, I would recommend someone who played from the 97-98 season to 98-99. Starter jerseys were branded as Pro Player in the 1999-00 season, for the jerseys that were actually worn in-game. I'm not sure about replicas, though.  The first player that comes to my mind is Peter Bondra (#12) and Adam Oates (77). The Capitals' typography from back then is one of my favorites, not only from the colors but the unique Times-like font. If you're going for style, I'd suggest checking out the font and find out which numbers stand out to you. If you want a notable player though, go with one of the two I suggested."
hockeyjerseys,3a8akm,Galvanick_Lucipher,2,Thu Jun 18 02:59:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying the years I should go with. I wasn't too sure if they continued making starter jerseys into the 2000's which is why I initially was thinking of going with Witt. I already have plans for a Bondra jersey or I would totally put him on the back of this jersey. I'm thinking either Kolzig, Hunter, or Tinordi now that I know what years I should be looking at players for. I appreciate the help!"
hockeyjerseys,3a8akm,Nas160,2,Thu Jun 18 04:21:21 2015 UTC,Nice collection. Either the 25th or 30th anniversary patches would work for the older jersey.
hockeyjerseys,3a8akm,DrStudMuffin,2,Thu Jun 18 02:23:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! 25th season would have been 99-00, right? Just trying to think of a player from that roster. I had been thinking of putting Witt with a 9-11 patch and Captain ""C""."

At one point I had thought about trying to get a whole collection together so that I could match any team that I play with.  But that's a tough and expensive proposition.  So I guess there was always some intent to wear them in the back of my head.    And once I felt the difference in quality between an authentic and a  regular practice jersey, I was hooked.

The original Checkers team played in the city from 1956 to 1977, originally in the Eastern Hockey League and then in the Southern Hockey League. The franchise is one of five teams to directly replace and share a name with a predecessor from a lower-tier league; the others are the Bakersfield Condors, Ontario Reign, Rockford IceHogs, and San Diego Gulls.

The listing was active again, so I threw down a bid at the starting price and got it.  I messaged the seller beforehand to see if they were ironed/sewn on, or just sewn on without being ironed. They were pretty crooked, so I figured they weren't ironed first, and sure enough they were just sewn on by hand.  He also said it was only worn for work occasions, and the jersey itself seemed pretty decent so I bid on it hoping that there werent any surprises and I could reuse the patches. I figured the worst case scenario would be the jersey ends up snagged and thrashed up but if the patches werent ironed, they would be fine.  it took about 90 mins carefully cutting threads out of it, but in the end the patches came out nicely and the jersey is fine too. Just some creasing that hopefully comes out with an ironing.  It'll be a jersey I wear a bit carelessly anyways so I don't mind.

hockeyjerseys,39w4n6,jedimasterchief,2,Mon Jun 15 15:47:37 2015 UTC,What is the general consensus of having jerseys with multiple SCF patches? Jerseys are much more expensive than patches. Don't do it? It looks ugly? Do it only if the player was on both teams? Buy a New Jersey?
hockeyjerseys,39w4n6,jedimasterchief,5,Mon Jun 15 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"I'd consider it foul. This thing looked worse in hand than it does in the photo's. I almost feel like the post might come off humblebrag dickish in the first place (oh woah is me, multiple cup patches) but really I'm just pumped to secure the patches and save the jersey too. This thing looked bad. I kinda wish I took pics right outta the box but the first instinct was to strip the patches. I stripped the 1997 and 98' first and almost kept the 2002 on there but thought about how my home CCM Hasek jersey would benefit from its addition."

I was always a Modano fan as a kid since he's from here, and over the years I've collected a bunch of stuff. Mostly cards, but I've gotten some more legit stuff too. I've got some old shirts and sweaters (not jerseys but actual hoodless 90's sweaters). My most wanted jersey as a kid was the 1999 style away Modano jersey. A local sports shop had one in my size in stock but I never saved enough for it before it was gone. I was 14, so it took a bit to make coin. Now thats on my want list.  Modano and Jon Casey signed autographs at a sports shop here around 1992. They signed 11x14 Lithographs during their last Minnesota season. wearing the ""transition"" jerseys.  http://i.imgur.com/y1zxAp6.jpg  Also a few years ago I met Marty Turco signing autographs at a Best Buy promoting NHL2K11 with Ryan Kesler (Kesler was on the cover that year and Turco on a previous season cover).  http://i.imgur.com/6MXYiIT.jpg"

I live in a town where hockey is probably 14th on the sporting popularity chart, right in between AWA wrestling re-runs on ESPN Classic and 4th grade dodge ball, so I haven't had an opportunity to meet any players or attend any signings. That, and we don't really have any comic book/sports memorabilia stores around here, so I guess that's kinda hurt my interest in starting any kinda collection outside of jerseys.

If you found that at a thrift store it is a great find. A lot of people don't realize those jerseys are rare because they are very crappy mesh/screen printed jerseys. Quality wise, they look like something an office would have made up for some recreational floor hockey tournament.   They aren't very nice jerseys, but they are pretty rare and go for quite a bit when they turn up on eBay. The first one I ever saw at auction on eBay a few years back went for about $200, which I thought was a fluke.....but every time I see them they seem to go from a low starting bid to around that price.

Thanks in advance!"
hockeyjerseys,39rhbe,TheKevinShow,3,Sun Jun 14 01:18:56 2015 UTC,"It is legit. You'll almost never see counterfeit CCM/Koho jerseys from that era.  It is a basic jersey that you could have bought at retail back in the day. It is called a ""replica"" level jersey (which doesn't mean fake) the equivalent to what Reebok now brands as ""Premier"" level jerseys and sell for $130 brand new.  As far as what it is worth, those black jerseys are desirable. You'd probably looking at around 50USD+Shipping to pick one up on eBay.  If you're in Chicago, I don't know the best place to send jerseys locally, maybe someone else can chime in, but if you want to get name put on the jersey, EPS would be the best place to send it (link is in the side bar). If you're in Canada, either Game Day Sports Archives, or Keener's would be a good place to get the jersey done up at.  As far as what player to get, the Blackhawks wore the equivalent of that design from 1996-2007.   At times, different companies made the on ice versions of the jersey. Meaning, for different seasons from 1996-2006 there might have been different branding logos such as Nike, Pro Player, or RBK on the jersey.   Meaning, if you're trying to be extremely accurate, they wore that jersey with Koho branding from 2000-2004.  Although, for a replica jersey, most people wouldn't go through that much trouble as to try and match the branding to a specific year since the cut is the same."

hockeyjerseys,39rhbe,tornfightstrap,2,Sun Jun 14 01:57:43 2015 UTC,Take it to Exclusive Pro Sports. They're right there in Rockford. They do customization for several NHL teams so you'll get top-quality customization. It'll be somewhere around $60 for it.

hockeyjerseys,39pnvq,knoper21,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would get them to fix it. You did not get the product you paid for. They shouldn't have even shipped it like that.  If they give you any push back, post a picture of it to their Twitter and/or Facebook page and ask when they plan to get some quality control."
hockeyjerseys,39pnvq,Galvanick_Lucipher,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:16:23 2015 UTC,Like everyone else has said just send them an email explaining your situation. Send them a picture of the jersey and include a screen shot of your confirmation email showing exactly what you ordered.

hockeyjerseys,39o5bc,natefaraci,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"The intention wasn't to build a mostly 90s collection, it just happened that way. Most of them are early-2000s CCM/Koho jerseys using designs dating to the 90s. It's just that the Premiers are crap and the pre-Edge replicas aren't properly branded so I'm concentrating on pre-lockout jerseys."

hockeyjerseys,39nbn4,LazerMcBlazer,2,Sun Jun 14 01:24:02 2015 UTC,"On average anywhere from $150-$350 per for the Pens Team/Game-Issued. Blank Team-Issued Penguins Jerseys pop up on eBay frequently, though they're almost always 58, 58+ or 58G and you certainly pay a premium I don't feel is fair.   For my Letang/Malkin Jerseys I bought a couple Game-Issued jerseys of no name players (which can be found for $100-150 each), stripped them then sent them to Cutting Edge Sports (Team customizer for the RBK Vector logo era EDGE Jerseys) for On-Ice accurate customization. The Dupuis and Bortuzzo Jerseys are bought from a guy who has a contract with the Penguins to sell the teams Gamers."
hockeyjerseys,39nbn4,LazerMcBlazer,2,Mon Jun 15 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"Very cool, thanks for the info. I sent a baby blue winter classic authentic to Cutting Edge to get Crosby put on and was frankly very disappointed at the job they did. Very sloppy. Actually had to send it back to have it cleaned up, have the captain's C moved, have a sleeve number re-done. It was a major hassle and bummer."

hockeyjerseys,39b3rp,Brgraham78,3,Wed Jun 10 15:54:14 2015 UTC,They are legit.  I have a few from them (new and custom work).  They do great work.  Paging /u/coolhockey !!
hockeyjerseys,39b3rp,DustinPenncakes,3,Wed Jun 10 15:46:31 2015 UTC,They are a legit and well respected company. Have you tried calling them? Also where are you from and when did you order? It's possible they got tied up in customs if you ordered from the US and it could take even longer if you ordered out of North America. Either way your best bet is to call and ask what is going on.
hockeyjerseys,39b3rp,Puckfiend,3,Wed Jun 10 15:47:03 2015 UTC,Sent them a Thrashers jersey to be customized earlier this year. They had very fast service and did a great job. From sending my jersey from California and getting it back in the mail was just under a month. They are legit.

A fair bit of complaints of poor communications and customizations sent out that were wrong. I personally have used them and experienced poor communication and customization issues.  If you are ordering online, I think the only site that hasn't had complaints around here is icejerseys."
hockeyjerseys,39ceeb,c3ndre,8,Wed Jun 10 20:39:58 2015 UTC,"It's a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater that was probably purchased from the Eaton's catalogue for a good little boy for Christmas in the mid to late 1970s.  It may or may not have come with the number 27 originally (I'm inclined to say a local shop probably did it), which was Daryl Sittler's number.

It is in between a Premier and a Canadian-made authentic as it is made in Indonesia out of different material. However, it has a legit fight strap, the bigger, roomier cut that the players wear to accommodate pads, and is numbered in size. However, it is not what the players wear and should not be confused with a true Authentic. As mentioned in this post, the bright green neck stripe is the giveaway that this is a ""Indo-Edge"" as opposed to an Canadian Authentic Edge."

hockeyjerseys,398dr8,KanersMullet,2,Wed Jun 10 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for cheap authentic jerseys you can always check out eBay and learn the ins and outs of spotting fake jerseys. You also have the ability to pick up game worn or team issued jerseys sometimes for pretty cheap through sites like MeiGray, or through this sub.  As for the Hossa jersey, the signature is more than likely legit. However, when people sell jerseys like that online they tend to be on fake jerseys with the intent to sell them to autograph collectors who only care about the signatures and not if the jersey is real or not.   Lutch sells two levels of jerseys. Replica's which are 100% sublimated jerseys, and their Pro jerseys which are either sewn or sublimated in accordance with what the teams actual jerseys are like. The Pro jerseys will be made of a heavier material and have fight straps like the actual KHL player jerseys."

The fastest way for you to ddo this would be to get at least four pictures of each jersey: front, back, close up of neck tags, and the inside of the back to see the number stitching, fight strap, and any team equipment tags on the inside of the bottom edge. Also get a shot of any decent sized wear marks (usually black scuffs or fabric tears) and obviously a close up of any autographs.

The reason I ask is that there's two approaches I'd recommend, depending on what you want to do:   If you want to get rid of them with some haste, contact Meigray, Classic Auctions, or Gameworn.net.  They'd pick out the gamers, take care of the pricing and sales, given that you're too tired to sell them, 20% is reasonable. As another reader suggested, if you want to do it yourself, cut the pile to about 10 at a time and sell like that.  Just listing the whole lot of them will overwhelm you and lead to bad deals."

Pretty simple process.  Went out and bought a small seam ripper for a few bucks and went to work.  I first started cutting the thread from under the tag, but then I cut the thread on top of the tag.  Didn't seem to damage the jersey any.  Right now you can see the outline of where the tag was, but it's not too noticeable.  It's a lot better than the ugly tag, that's for sure."

hockeyjerseys,38zwl4,DustinPenncakes,4,Mon Jun 8 06:00:31 2015 UTC,All the tags look exactly the same as the legit CCM's I have. So I don't think it's a fake. If this jersey is from Ovi's rookie season (05-06) it could be legit CCM. I have a legit Sabres slug jersey from 06-07 that is CCM. This is the last year they used CCM before they switched to Reebok. This is definitely legit and a good find.

hockeyjerseys,38zwl4,liquid1ce,3,Mon Jun 8 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"It is a replica jersey (equivalent to the ""premier"" Reebok jersey) - so there isn't necessarily any authenticity to it compared to on ice jerseys.  CCM and Koho were the same company at the time this jersey was made.  According to http://www.nhluniforms.com/ they wore CCM blacks, from 1997-2000 - but not like the one you posted (CCM is on the bottom hem).  From 2000-2007 they wore this Black jersey as a Koho and their white jersey as a CCM."

hockeyjerseys,38z5xe,SexyOmlet,3,Mon Jun 8 01:59:38 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to find brand new ones cheap, as not many places carry them.  Otherwise, eBay is your best bet. If your definition for cheap is under $40, you might find one very once and a while, but prices seem to vary. There's not as much demand for OHL jerseys, but there's almost no supply. I'm still kicking myself for passing on a mid 2000's Olympiques replica at $50 because I think it'll be a long time before another one gets listed. Like with any jersey, you just have to look everyday, and eventually something in your price range will pop up.  One thing I've noticed about Major Junior jerseys, is there are a lot of gamers that go for reasonable prices. If you look at eBay sold listings, you can see gamers selling anywhere from 100-150. Not cheap for a jersey, but for an authentic that is fully customized, it isn't a bad price."

And how much would shipping cost on 1 jersey versus 2 to Newmarket, Ontario. Thanks."

Most (or all) patches are ironed/glued on and not stitched. More likely than not, the name plate on the back is made of twill, a cheap screen printed fabric.   Anything listed in the side bar is going to get you a nice customized jersey with proper stitching and quality numbers and name plates.   I've bought from the NHL store before. The jersey looks nice when you get it, but little things will start to go wrong if you wear it a lot like I do."

hockeyjerseys,38onye,tipthomper,4,Fri Jun 5 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/W0ouA  Here's what I see, and as others have mentioned. 1: NHL patch is clean and appears to be authentic. 2: Stitches on each side of the V are present. 3: Reebok vector logo on the back is a patch. 4: No bubbling on the number. 5: Hard to see any detail with the strap, but there isn't any ugly stitching trying to draw attention to the fact that it has one. The thread matches the jersey (white) and from what you can see it looks correct."

I'd kinda lean ""no"", and sometimes people get the alternate ""A"" tacked on when customizing because it's often free with the process.  A Getty Images search would probably be your best bet.  Thankfully he's the most photographed player ever, so you should find your answer.   The jersey is ""legit"", btw."

There are a half dozen thrift/vintage clothing stores, and most carry hockey stuff.   There are a lot of random jersey shops along Yonge (it's been a while for me, but there was one near Yonge/Dundas, north on Yonge), and you can swing moderate deals here.  Then you have Real Sports by the ACC, but that's full MSRP.  If you can travel a bit, there's a store with cheap stuff in Richmond Hill in Hillcrest Mall called Fresh Fit Sports, they have a 75% off rack. When I last checked a few days ago, they had blank Pittsburgh jerseys for $50, and OV and a bunch of Leafs jerseys (various players) for $100.   Vaughn Mills has Pro Hockey Life, which basically has everything, but it's all MSRP, unless you want Clarkson stuff, those were on sale for $50 a jersey."

hockeyjerseys,38dj92,mason_3_d,2,Wed Jun 3 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"The neck is way too big, the NHL shield is too low (it should never be hidden behind the laces), the laces are too thick, the Rangers font is wrong, The numbers are bubbly, and in the 4th picture of the tag, you can see the letters have a paper/cardboard backing. All fakes are stitched that way for some reason. This guy is labeling this as an ""authentic"" when really, you can buy it off of one of those Chinese sites for $30. I really hope no one buys that thinking it's real."
hockeyjerseys,38dj92,CaptainJoeShmo,2,Wed Jun 3 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"The size is a number, not a Letter size (S, M, L, etc.), from my understanding only authentic jerseys have number sizes. And second is the numbers on the back. If there are many air bubbles in the numbers, there is a very good chance that it is fake."
hockeyjerseys,38dj92,hawks198810,5,Wed Jun 3 15:17:19 2015 UTC,"Also, I believe real authentic jerseys were never made in size 48."
hockeyjerseys,38dj92,RichardManuel,3,Wed Jun 3 15:44:16 2015 UTC,"There are older authentics with size 48 (this one for example), but you'd never see a current player jersey with size 48."
hockeyjerseys,38dj92,otter_pop_n_lock,2,Wed Jun 3 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"To add to what others have said, the ""Rangers"" lettering is too spread out. It's actually a bit more closer together. And you can see the stitching from the inside of the jersey is tightly stitched together which is not how it's done. The hemline also almost looks straight although that's hard to tell from the picture. Last but not least, the maple leaf from the tag looks more like the Albanian eagle."
hockeyjerseys,38dj92,liquid1ce,2,Wed Jun 3 18:08:53 2015 UTC,"Easy way to tell if it is fake for a Rangers jersey (or other NHL teams that have a tie down in the front) - the shoelace rings are silver metal on the fakes.  On a real jersey, those rings are white on a NYR Home jersey.  For other teams, it is colored - never metal color.  All the other things folks have already said are true too - but looking out for those metal shoelace rings on the jersey is easy."

Reebok was introduced league-wide for the '07-'08 season. Prior to that you'll see CCM, Starter, Pro Player, Nike, among others.   Rumor is it will be changed again for next year, either back to CCM, the new reebok logo, or even to adidas (reebok & ccm's parent company)"

I just started this, and am trying to catch up starting when Reebok jerseys were introduced. I didn't know this detail until after I bought a current Reebok Detroit jersey with Datsyuk on it, complete with SCF '08 patch. Of course, they wore the vector jerseys, not the word mark. Minor detail to most, but I would like the 09-11 (Pens, Hawks, Bruins) jerseys to reflect the jerseys they wore down to the minute details."

hockeyjerseys,38aokl,Librewian,2,Wed Jun 3 00:31:03 2015 UTC,"The authentic crest and patches are larger than replicas, and the embroidery is also tighter and more detailed. Biggest thing is the metallic gold detail inside the letters on the crest, and the extra green detailing inside of the star. The Stars used the exact same details in their crests for the entire run they stayed on the chest of their uniforms. The only difference between my 1993 authentic and my green koho is the addition of ""Dallas"" above the STARS wordmark, and the darker shade of green."

hockeyjerseys,38aveb,wiccanly,3,Wed Jun 3 00:46:38 2015 UTC,You can get the same jersey with a better customization and cup final patch (for free it seems) over at coolhockey for $158. They also have a $10 off coupon right now as well. So for $10 more than the NHL store one you're getting a better quality customization and a cup final patch.
hockeyjerseys,38aveb,DustinPenncakes,2,Wed Jun 3 02:32:55 2015 UTC,"I would avoid NHL.com because they also heat press on the customization on the back -- it might be the cheapest but you get what you pay for.  I'm 5'5"" and ~150 lbs, I don't have a Reebok Premier, but I own an older CCM replica and I wear a medium.  That said, Reebok Premiers, even from good customizers have the front logo and any shoulder patches heat pressed - they are not stitched.  Only the ""authentic"" Reebok Edge jerseys would have everything stitched.  On authentic jerseys, I can usually wear a 46 or 50.  There are three different Reebok Edge jerseys, you can read more about it here: http://prostocknation.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/the-prostocknation-com-guide-to-avoiding-counterfeit-nhl-jerseys/"

hockeyjerseys,38aveb,c3ndre,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I pretty much have the same size too and the one medium jersey I have is a bit tight (I can wear it, but...). Overall, I just prefer a jersey to look/fit more like a hockey jersey and not like a normal shirt. I found out that a women's XXL is almost identical to a men's small (a little bit shorter), so maybe a women's L or XL would work? I don't like the youth versions that much personally."

hockeyjerseys,3859ki,liquid1ce,5,Mon Jun 1 23:16:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it is a twill nameplate. Twill is the material used for the numbers and bad/lazy customizers use twill for the name plate. It never looks good because it is shiny and clashes with the material.  What you would have to do is send the jersey to somewhere like EPS and ask them to strip the name plate and apply a new one using the proper material. In this case, that would be ""edge"" material.   It is a bit riskier, but you can strip the name plate yourself, and order a name plate from EPS in the mail. That way you don't have to ship your jersey. You'd then just have to find a local hockey shop who'd be willing to stitch it on for you."
hockeyjerseys,3859ki,tornfightstrap,2,Tue Jun 2 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"If it is wrong couldn't you just have the nameplate replaced? I know you shouldn't have to but that has to be option, right?"
hockeyjerseys,3859ki,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely an option - but I don't like the idea of having to pay EPS $35 to remove the nameplate and $60 to put a new one on...  Was sort of expecting it to just be the right color in general - need to see if it will look weird once it is hung up in a case."
hockeyjerseys,3859ki,DustinPenncakes,2,Mon Jun 1 23:30:59 2015 UTC,Oh I don't blame you there I wouldn't be too thrilled if that happened to me.
hockeyjerseys,3859ki,tornfightstrap,2,Mon Jun 1 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind there is always a risk, but stripping should not be hard.  Pull the material inside the jersey behind the name plate. If it is able to be pulled back, you can most likely conclude that the twill isn't glued. You can also go over the inside part with an iron with a lot of steam (covered with a pillow case) and see if that detaches the material as it might just have a light adhesive that can easily unstick.  The point is, if the material is not stuck to the name plate and there is no glue then it should be an easy strip.   Judging by the photos, the plate is only zig zag stitched so you just need to very carefully destroy each individual stitching with a small pair of grooming scissors or an exacto knife.  Again, every strip is at your own risk, so there's no guarantee your jersey won't explode, but judging by the photos it looks like a simple strip."
hockeyjerseys,3859ki,remz07twos,2,Tue Jun 2 02:02:53 2015 UTC,"I would just do it honestly. If its a 2.0 it is $300 plus $60 for customization. so if you got it for $400, you basically got a King sig for $40. also I don't think EPS will charge the full $60 for just the nameplate."

Their size is a bit smaller than a modern day equivilent, and they're made out of a thin form of ultrafil that you may or may not like (I tend to prefer air-knit in replicas).  Really, I'd recommend getting a replica from Coolhockey or a CCM/KOHO 550 or a Nike replica or something instead of this.  The one you post is not worth $180."

It has some slight discoloration on the shoulder patches that I didn’t know about when I bought it, but I’ve been told by you all that it’s just from the jersey being washed. I don’t really have the need for it anymore since I’ve switched my focus over to collection older Caps jerseys and edge jerseys. I would love to get $30 for it, but that price is very negotiable.

hockeyjerseys,37w8j2,TrollocsBollocks,3,Sun May 31 00:00:01 2015 UTC,Try steam. Easiest way being to hang it up in your bathroom when you go to take a hot shower. It might help and it won't damage the jersey so its worth a shot.

hockeyjerseys,37w8j2,TrollocsBollocks,2,Sun May 31 09:33:57 2015 UTC,You can always put a shirt or light towel over the jersey and iron it that way.  I would go steam first and then maybe the iron/towel technique.

hockeyjerseys,37hupp,Featherbeard,10,Wed May 27 19:17:53 2015 UTC,"Finally a question I can answer. I have accumulated over 20 jerseys this year in my new obsession but I always buy them with the thought of wearing them in mind. If someone bugs you just brush it off and say ""I support ____ but I like the jersey/style/look."" I am a Jets fan who has 3 Jets jerseys but I still wear Wild or Predators jerseys, they are in the same division and I would never wear their jerseys on game day but it's still hockey! I'm glad so many teams exist to root against and if they have a jersey I like I can still wear it....plus I can root for them in the playoffs after my team is out (Re: My Selanne Ducks Jersey). So before I rant too long. Do what you feel. If you want to wear it, wear it, don't worry what others will think."
hockeyjerseys,37hupp,empathyx,6,Wed May 27 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"I'm suuuuper shy, especially when it comes to this kind of thing, and being an artist/designer/huge fan of mascots/design & colors of uniforms I often like the idea of wearing it because it looks so damn good/cool rather than support a particular team, so it gets a little awkward. :)"
hockeyjerseys,37hupp,empathyx,5,Wed May 27 19:51:36 2015 UTC,I'm the same way. I mostly buy jerseys I like. As I said. I have jerseys I like of teams I don't necessarily support (Nashville's old third for example). I guess it's easier for me as the Jets don't have a real hardcore rivalry with anyone...but people will still bug you for 'not supporting them' by wearing another teams jersey. I would always say do as you feel and don't worry what other people think too much. Be comfortable and happy.
hockeyjerseys,37hupp,empathyx,1 point,Wed May 27 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"I was thinking I'd be wearing a lot more minor league team jerseys; they tend to have more interesting/bold designs versus being more marketable, which is really nice.

They were just ugly, and no one feels like experimenting with new jerseys for Buffalo given their last few failed attempts to ""update"" the jersey."
hockeyjerseys,37gxjn,McArctic,2,Wed May 27 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"My issue is that Buffalo has one of the best, most timeless, and recognized logos in sports as well as a beautiful color pallet (especially the more royal blue used on the older jerseys and the 40th anniversary jersey, which is one of my favorites). They have so many great things they could do as proved by the jersey I just mentioned and so much to work with. And instead, they created that monstrosity that looks like it's a practice jersey for some team from the future. No, that wouldn't be as bad. It looks like a team from the 90's trying to guess what a team from the future would use as a practice jersey. Just so much going on, so crowded, so many unnecessary and loud details.  So I guess the main thing I hate is the fact that they just could have done so much better and decided to try to trailblaze. I won't hate on them for that, but leave that to a newer team with less history in a nontraditional market like the Coyotes or Ducks or Predators."
hockeyjerseys,37gxjn,LazerMcBlazer,2,Wed May 27 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"The jersey is ugly due to the large amounts of ""conflicts"", to be frank.  Too many colours in use (blue, yellow, yellow, grey, and silver).  Two shades of yellow (front and side panels are different shades) didn't work. Generally speaking, colours too close together clash.  Grey and yellow don't really match.  Grey and silver don't match (silver is the piping along the arms and cuff, lower on the back).  The front and back being different colours could've been fine (though unconventional), but they added the silver things in the small of the back, giving it the impression that it slims down to a V (it doesn't, but it looks like it), which doesn't look good.  The font they used for the numbers were a bizarre choice. They look cartoony but not cartoony enough to pull it off.  The text ""BUFFALO"" on the front above the logo is unnecessary, and it looks like someone forgot to take it off, and just left it there.  They use 2 contrasting fonts, the ""BUFFALO"" on the front, and the name/numbers. One is serious, the other is a bit cartoony.  Shoulder colours can work going halfway down the sleeve (think Pittsburgh, but since the colour changes on the back, it ends up looking a bit weird.  I think it's ugly, but I didn't hate it. To me they were looking to make an ugly jersey, and did it right.  TL/DR - People hated it because it was too busy with too many things clashing."

hockeyjerseys,37gxjn,knoper21,2,Thu May 28 05:32:54 2015 UTC,"No, they're too mass produced now.  Fisherman and Wild Wing were made in the sweet spot where modern style jerseys were being produced and they weren't that common.  The only ones I can see this happening with are some of the vintage one-shots (Rangers 77-79 style worn in 03/04, for example)."

hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,another_plebeian,2,Wed May 27 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"The perceived higher value of game issued jerseys vs retail authentics  is that they were done by the team's customizer. The same one that does the player's on ice jerseys, so you know you are buying the highest quality customization. They made these for the team and not necessarily to be sold retail. You can buy a retail authentic blank and get it customized by the team's customizer for pretty much the same jersey. Game WORN however, does have some sort of further value to me that is substantiated by some sort of authenticity verification. If there is no authenticity certification then it is as good as any other used authentic to me."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,dudedisguisedasadude,1 point,Wed May 27 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"I don't.  The only time I would is if it's got a neat story behind it; a misspelling/different number for a big player for example, or like the Sweden situation where they didn't wear their blues in the Olympics, so all the blues became team issues.  Otherwise, it's just an authentic to me."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,knoper21,1 point,Wed May 27 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"I do, but obviously not as much as a game worn. GI jerseys are still one-of-a-kind, because they were part of an issued set by the team, and still have the team equipment staff's tagging."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,sciencedenton,1 point,Wed May 27 13:05:56 2015 UTC,"It really depends - some GI's have been worn. Could have been a jersey worn in the preseason that was then recycled for the regular season and then game-issued for that regular season as the player was sent down to the minors. I have a few of these.  Some fighters have back-up jerseys, that even if never worn, were customized for the player in case they needed to be pressed into action at some point. If a fighter required customizations (reinforced collar, shortened sleeves, 2nd fight strap added, etc.), any GI'd back-up jerseys would have those same mods, just no game wear, but could have slight puck/stick marks from being worn in warm-ups (if original was damaged from a fight and then player was a healthy scratch after wearing that back-up jersey in warm-ups). Have a few like this as well."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,bobbyp6565,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"if they've been worn in the slightest, they're no longer GI and now GW"
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,bobbyp6565,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in the purest sense, but its really how the team or vendor categorized and then sold the jersey. I have a handful of jerseys listed and sold as GI's that had stickmarks, inside pilling, or slight fight damage when they arrived. Jerseys are recycled, so one could have been worn last year or in a previous year for a few games and then recycled and GI'd for a new player - still sold as a GI jersey, but had been previously worn. Same applies for preseason GW jerseys that may then be marketed and sold as GI jerseys for the regular season if the player is demoted and never recalled. You can also have a player that is a constant scratch that takes warm-ups most games - jersey will have some sweat staining, maybe even some pucks marks - it will still be sold as a GI as it was never used in a game."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,yacadelic,-4,Wed Jun 24 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"If by game issued you mean a 2.0 or 1.0 and by regular authentic you mean an indo-edge - then yes, i highly prefer a game issue over a regular authentic.   The quality is night and day, and i take pride in craftsmanship.   Oh and for gameworn, i stay away as they are probably only worn for one period, and they are WAY over priced for what it is."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,sciencedenton,5,Wed May 27 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"No offense, but you don't know what you're talking about.  Game Issued is a jersey that was prepared by the team's equipment staff for a player to use, but for whatever reason, wasn't worn in a game. It usually has all the team tagging of a game worn, just no wear or tear. It usually comes with certification and is generally considered at least a little more valuable than a jersey, 1/2/Indo or whatever, that a person can just buy from a store.   Game Worns are not worn for just one game unless it was for a special event, like a Winter Classic or promotion game (Military night, for example). There are usually around three sets of game worn jerseys for each player for each season, one home one away. So for example, a game worn Set 1 Home would have been worn for all home games by that player in roughly the first two-and-a-half months of the season."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,yacadelic,1 point,Wed May 27 13:02:53 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. It was super late and i was somewhat confused of what OP was asking. You're totally right. Sorry for my stupidity lol.  Edit: can you tell me what OP was asking? I'm still confused. By authentic jerseys does he mean the indo-edge?
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,sciencedenton,1 point,Wed May 27 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"ANY Edge is an Authentic. 1/2/Indo, there are minor variations between them, but they are all considered to be authentics. The only thing that isn't an authentic is a premiere (or knock off, obviously). But an authentic is still a store-bought item. It was never seen or touched by any player or member of the equipment staff.   A game issued is a jersey that was prepared by the team's equipment staff, and was JUST short of beocming a game worn. He's asking if Game Issued jerseys are considered more valuable than store-bought authentics. It's a common quesiton and a lot of people disagree about it."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,yacadelic,1 point,Wed May 27 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, i know all edges are authentic, i was asking what OP was saying they are. Because he was asking what the difference between ""authentics"" and ""game issued""   I know the retail authentic is the indo-edge, and i know any edge is authentic. And i have known what game issued jerseys are but I've always called them team issued.   I really don't know what i was saying last night or even earlier this morning, but i was super tired and now I've woken up and came a bit more to my senses.   Also, what i was insinuating before was that all 2.0 are team issued because they are not sold in retail correct?"
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,sciencedenton,1 point,Wed May 27 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"That's incorrect. 2.0's can be, and usually are, store bought. I bought my Tampa 2.0 from coolhockey.   For something to be team issued, it HAS to come from the team's equipment staff in some manner."
hockeyjerseys,37f6sr,yacadelic,-1,Wed May 27 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"Ok thats not what i met. I meant all team issued jerseys are 2.0's or if their old, 1.0's. And what i meant by retail is like going into a sporting goods store.  2.0's are not sold to retail shops. They are always team issued."

hockeyjerseys,379w1e,DreamcastWriter,2,Tue May 26 17:34:26 2015 UTC,I just measure one of my jerseys and it matches with the sizing on nhl.com. The sizing will be the same no matter who you buy it off of though.
hockeyjerseys,379w1e,DustinPenncakes,2,Tue May 26 02:21:44 2015 UTC,Yeah thats what I thought. I would measure a jersey if I owned one haha. I just really want to make sure I get the right size because it would be an expensive/time consuming process to return it and I'm gonna get it with a player/number so I don't think you can return it. I'm probably gonna get a medium though
hockeyjerseys,379w1e,DustinPenncakes,3,Tue May 26 02:29:37 2015 UTC,If that's the case I recommend not ordering it from nhl.com since their customization is pretty bad ironically. Worse comes to worse you can always go a size up and have it be a little big on you.
hockeyjerseys,379w1e,DustinPenncakes,2,Tue May 26 03:03:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I was planning on buying from coolhockey. Do they do customization with the proper stitching?

At EPS we are able to photograph about 1% of the jerseys going through production at any point. The rule of thumb at EPS is we can customize any jersey, from any team, from any year (depending on licensing agreements). So, if you don't find a price or picture you are looking for, contact us for a quote. We hope to eventually show a picture for all products produced.

hockeyjerseys,371bz6,FlyingWhales,1 point,Sun May 24 04:34:44 2015 UTC,"ahh shit. i definitely am a stickler for details. although, i really wouldnt have noticed, but since you brought it up there is no way im buying that patch.   any idea when they introduced the 2.0?"
hockeyjerseys,371bz6,remz07twos,1 point,Sun May 24 05:14:53 2015 UTC,"2.0s were introduced after pretty much every player complained about the 1.0s so I'd say late 2007 to 2008 was when the majority of the players started wearing them. What I'm talking about though is the Reebok wordmark on the back of the jersey, which was introduced at the start of the 2011-12 season."
hockeyjerseys,371bz6,remz07twos,1 point,Sun May 24 05:29:29 2015 UTC,yeah i just realized the 2.0 and logo have no correlation.   so i guess ill just have to wait till the wings get into the final again...whenever that happens they will probably come out with new jersey designs that year with my luck lol

Prices include shipping to Canada, if to the US it will raise the price a little.   2003 Western Conference All Star - $185  http://i.imgur.com/qnQjec5.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/FpKkWdj.jpg  2006 Turino Olympics Team Canada - $100  http://i.imgur.com/kPFy2Ue.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/zbH5KL8.jpg  I'd also trade, I'd be willing to pay a difference if your jersey is ""better"" lol.   The jerseys I'm looking for in trade are:  Canucks jerseys, specifically early 2000's era orca, looking for Naslund, Jovanovski, willing to listen to other players from that era, or any vintage jerseys  Crosby Pens white (reebok) Blackhawks white, Sharp or Seabrook (reebok) Boston Bergeron white (reebok) Kings Black, Kopitar or Mitchell (reebok)  As much as it pains me for a few of those jerseys, part of my collection is Stanley Cup winners of which I will add patches later.   I will also listen to other offers for any jersey, never know what might interest me."

Sometimes I emailed the team reps if they didn't have any shop readily available or if they didn't ship to Denmark to see if something could be worked out (like the czech league), but the slovakian teams all had a good site that I had no issues ordering from."

hockeyjerseys,36m5vw,Tigrafr,2,Thu May 21 11:50:08 2015 UTC,Nice collection so far. So you basically don't care much about the team as long as the jerseys look nice and are cheap-ish? I wouldn't know where to start with suggestions :) I don't like the fact that there's so much advertising on the jerseys... in some cases you can't even see the team's own logo.
