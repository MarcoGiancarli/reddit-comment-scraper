homestuck,3e3lr9,HiddenKrypt,3,Tue Jul 21 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"So the squared sprites are projections of what Dave and Rose wanted to be, really.  Ultraconfident sexually aggressive tentacle cat princess and empathetic androgynous never-alone mindmeld hyperfurry?  Are you kidding me?  Sign my terrified middle-school self up.  If this were really a video game and these kids genuinely gained all the levels, these are what the results would be: the highest selves of 13-year-old trauma victims.

Tavrisprite- AT and AG. A doesn't bind to A, T doesn't bind to G, and we all saw how stable that sprite was. Checks out so far!  Fefetasprite- AC and CC. A doesn't bind to C, and C doesn't bind to C. Fefetasprite Fefetasploded, but seemed to be doing pretty well up till that point. Looking slightly less likely.  Erisolsprite- CA and TA. No bonds, but Erisolsprite was/is(?) alive and well, but permanently miserable.   ARquius (just gonna take Dirk's TT for AR)- TT and CT. No bonds, unless you count AR as the code, in which case A would bind to T but R would not bind to anything because it's not a base. ARquiusprite seems to be loving life.   Maybe it's different for sprite2 then, but doesn't seem to have anything to do with the normal sprites. Sorry for the long comment, I honestly just wanted to work this out for myself."

Feferi.  HIC. Is also expendable- if she dies, Lord English can just take the Game Over HIC and replace her. Meenah. Has glasses. Has motivation to fight English. Bec Noir. Electricity flowing around? Check. Purple color scheme? Agent of Derse. The blood on his arm. Cetus. The only Denizen who hasn't been relevant. Probably pretty derp-ish, and since she's a Light denizen, she might want to be important. Be important how? Well, by defeating the terror of Paradox Space.   Alternatively, instead of Alt Callie, maybe Karkat? The more I think of this, the more possibilities there are.  If it is Bec Noir, then that means Nannasprite MAY not be involved, which would need a blue to complete color scheme, so I'd say retJohn. Looks enough like Jake to not be noticeable.

homestuck,3e08cw,Immahuman,4,Tue Jul 21 07:52:31 2015 UTC,"Well, among the living we've got three options: Jade, Kanaya and Calliope. Kanaya's matriorb deal has her space thing covered. Honestly I think it may be a toss up between Jade and Calliope. On one hand Jade just got this foreshadowing, but on the other hand Calliope is living on borrowed time. Even with the ring of life, according to paradox fate she really should be dead. Also there was a big deal about how she wanted to be important, and basically she was built up as a ""fix character,"" and frankly seems much more likely to do it than Jade  Maybe. I'm just throwing this out there. During the final battle Jade sacrifices herself, but it's not impactful enough. However, this does prompt Dave to finally use his time powers again. So Dave stable time loops Jade out of dying. After that, Calliope sacrifices herself at a critical moment in the battle."

homestuck,3e08cw,edrudathec,13,Tue Jul 21 02:59:00 2015 UTC,CLOSE  ENOUGH!
homestuck,3e08cw,GuyWithPasta,5,Tue Jul 21 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I thought Jasprosesprite was irritating when we first saw her... the orange/green is pretty difficult to look at for long. If the delay between switches was twice as long or so, it'd be a lot easier."
homestuck,3e08cw,ZoomBoingDing,26,Tue Jul 21 01:08:15 2015 UTC,Davepeta kind of talks like Roxy. Sort of like how Arquius talks like Doc Scratch.  Davepeta confirmed for Roxy?
homestuck,3e08cw,Dragoryu3000,20,Tue Jul 21 00:09:28 2015 UTC,Well Roxy is basically a more cheery dave who liked cats... So basically a Dave and Nepeta fusion.
homestuck,3e08cw,fiveforchaos,10,Tue Jul 21 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"Equius relutance will do no shit. Millions of nepetas will died already, and Nepeta isn't even visible in this sprite."
homestuck,3e08cw,jpae20,11,Mon Jul 20 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a fair point, though I guess you could say he wasn't targeting them, they just happened to be in the dream bubbles, so he may not have known they were there.   I'm just trying to think why Davepeta is an inherently good combination to fight him. We've gotten quite a bit in that direction about Dave, but not as much for Nepeta. She's a good fighter, but that's true of a lot of characters. All that sprang immediately to mind was her aspect or her ties to Equius."
homestuck,3e08cw,-ACunningLinguist-,28,Tue Jul 21 00:01:21 2015 UTC,"I think the implication is that Davepeta's just now making that vulnerability by introducing their self to Arquius. Establishing an emotional connection now that Lord English will recall later.  It would also kind of explain why he had no issues killing individual Daves or Nepetas previously, since Lord English is part Arquius. If Davepeta can hook both sides of Arquius into an emotional attachment, he might not feel as conflicted about their separated forms.  Edit: Oh man, I just had a mental image of Davepeta shoosh-papping LE, à la Karkat's solution to Gamzee's murdertroll rampage in Game Over."
homestuck,3e08cw,TabethaRasa,22,Tue Jul 21 00:12:11 2015 UTC,"Dave has LONG been foreshadowed to fight and vanquish Lord English.  Davesprite has long been foreshadowed to eventually play an important or pivotal heroic role, proving he's still a legit enough Dave.  Nepeta is Equius' moirail which COULD play SOME part.  Nepeta is also the Rogue of Heart. Heart is one of the defining aspects of what's keeping LE... You know. ""Together"". And Davepeta likely has both of their roles supercharged."
homestuck,3e08cw,Homeschool-Winner,5,Tue Jul 21 00:14:52 2015 UTC,oh my god all those dead nepetas who were doomsploded now technically exist in this sprite  nepetaquest is complete

homestuck,3e08cw,LittleUggie,14,Mon Jul 20 23:56:16 2015 UTC,maybe sprites squared automatically become god tier? or at least get some of the powers a god tier of their classpects does since birddave was never godtier but davepeta sprite has a gear as part of their shirt symbol o:
homestuck,3e08cw,rudyilluminati,16,Tue Jul 21 00:04:11 2015 UTC,But remember that they have the memories (and perhaps powers?) of literally ALL other Daves and Nepetas from here to the Furthest Ring. Maybe that's why they're godtier.

Rose is at her best when she's being her most intellectual, and throwing that away from any version of her is getting rid of the most interesting part of her personality."

Ohhhh and Callie and the mayor meeting, that was short but cute, somehow, I hope they do something together to pass the time, like plan Cantown's rebuilding.  I had very mixed feelings about Davepeta yesterday but today I'm very fucking ok with this development, even fucking excited to see where this will lead! Davepeta is such a riot!

homestuck,3e0mc7,ThatPersonGu,4,Tue Jul 21 10:31:09 2015 UTC,"My friends got me into hamsteak a couple years ago and it's been a joyride to say the least, but the only thing keeping my ""one-arm-in, one-arm-out"" with homosuck is the weird obsession with the comic the typical fan has.   What's keeping me from SU, on the otherhand, is the over-obsession with gender, gay relationships, and no open-mindedness from any of its viewers to other peoples' ideas or opinions of the show (from what I've seen so far of it at least). The subreddit for SU, which has been linked to me a few times by a friend and by /r/gravityfalls, doesn't seem as bad, much like this subreddit for himstruck.   I feel like I would genuinely be interested in a show like SU, had the show not taken its turns to cater to fans (which I don't blame the writers) and if the fans didn't aggressively shove their obsessions in your face (more aggressively so than horsestable)."

homestuck,3e0mc7,qezler,2,Tue Jul 21 10:40:28 2015 UTC,It isn't catering if the writers are flat out writing it. It has a SJW centric fanbase because of a lot of the episodes that deal with common SJW topics (pretty well imo).

homestuck,3e0mc7,fennric,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, Homestuck was linked to XKCD only very recently. Or maybe I'm just getting old as a HS fan. But yeah, when I checked the stats XKCD is in fact the most popular webcomic on the internet (we've heard of it, this is reddit for after all). But I disagree that HS attracts a wider audience... you have to a specific type of person, that is, the type of person who can put up with a WHOLE lot, to really get the most out of HS."
homestuck,3e0mc7,sometipsygnostalgic,0,Tue Jul 21 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"That's arguably more the writers of SU. There are some episodes (you'll know them when you see them) that really delve deep into a lot of themes of parenting, gender identity, etc. etc.  And Pearl is the thirstiest cartoon character since Johnny Bravo."
homestuck,3e0mc7,qezler,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:08 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the SU fandom's got even more potential for being rather outspoken. It's bigger than the Homestuck fandom, for a start, and tends to invite more young fans what with being broadcast on Cartoon Network instead of tucked away on some corner of the internet.  That can make for some rather mixed actions. On one hand, the whole Keystone Motel debacle recently was mostly just a product of people trying to be funny but not quite thinking things through, then people meaning well in leaving good reviews but again not quite thinking things through. No active malice there. In fact, I reckon the worst part about that was the hostile reaction.   On the other hand, there have definitely been cases of fan vitriol getting out of hand. To which I say, people should probably just try to be more chill in general. And /r/stevenuniverse is pretty chill most of the time. I like that."
homestuck,3e0mc7,sometipsygnostalgic,5,Tue Jul 21 15:50:54 2015 UTC,no not quite because homestuck fandom wasnt obnoxious about social justice  homestuck fandom was actually... rather right-wing if i recall  that wasnt a good thing they were assholes

homestuck,3e0mc7,Turtanic,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"Naruto was a target of this before HS   Naruto never mind-fucked me, I think we watched two totally different shows. In fact, with every revelation thrown at me in that series, my reaction was quite appropriately ""... huh... okay."" I mean, if you like the series, good for you! Keep liking it and delve deeper! It's good to have passions, but I wouldn't use Naruto as a good example of a good series a younger fan base would obsess over. I might instead throw out there Madoka Magica or some other series with more apparent homosexual shipping possibilities, as Naruto doesn't really seem to fit any comparison to HS, imo."
homestuck,3e0mc7,fiveforchaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:39:06 2015 UTC,"No no no, I didn't compare Naruto with HS in that sense at all. I agree with you it has neither ambitious plot complexity, nor a progressive portrait of personal relationships (or say ""tumblr-SJW-friendly"" if you want to buy in the joke).  My point is that along the years there have always been some entry-level franchises that appeal to younger audiences but you are supposed to grow out of them with time. These usually received disrespect from senior fans of well stablished franchises. For example, Naruto or Pokemon fans would, according to some accounts, be looked down in conferences and generalistic forums.   This is a different aspect of conflict than the level of obsession. Madoka is from 20111 so technically it belongs approximately in the same generation than Homestuck, the earliest Naruto I can find is 19972, which is why I pointed it as an example of generational repetition of the ""seniors hating on franchise X because it fills their favourite lounge with uninitiated juniors than refuse to discuss, enjoy or interact about anything except X""."

I don't think Jasprose is acting like a depraved bisexual, more like someone who is extremely lonely, kind of confused about their existence, and has no inhibitions.  Hussie might be jokingly playing around with the trope like he did with Kanaya being a lesbian vampire, but I feel like jasprose's fucked up personality is quite a bit more multidimensional(lol) than that."

It's just a specialized homophobia and it's harmful to gays of all kinds, not just bi people. For thirds, and most relevantly, Rose is not one of these malicious fuck-arounds. She just happens to like women. We actually haven't seen evidence of her liking men, so she might not even be bi and therefore completely unrelated to this trope that was shitty to begin with. edit: link to your heart's content, not everybody knows about it.

(That's actually an issue I've dealt with on embedded systems. There's PLENTY of memory, but it's so fragmented that you cannot allocate anything.)  But please remember, to lock your data nicely, but do so wisely, as deadlock is a beautiful disaster with the Ostrich algorithm.  Of course, Dijkstra may frown. However, use the Ostrich anyways. Threads and humans don't mix.  Or, rather, they do mix, but interleaving is BAD, usually!  More realistically, I expect they're dealing with bugs and the needs to refactor code. It starts with minor changes in the expectations of a program. This leads to less intelligent design decisions in the code. Then, the 'code smell' aroma stinks the building. The refactoring delay causes a crisis in terms of time spent. Considering how hacky game code could be (health potions in a game I made once were enemies that did NEGATIVE DAMAGE. Hehehe), the need for refactoring presses strongly. Probably takes them a lot of time! Should be fun for them."

Average salary for a programmer in NYC is $60k. Average overheads (computers, software, insurance, utilities, payroll taxes) are in my experience 1.5x salary, so let's say $90k.  One of the interviews said a full time staff of 12. So that's $1080k per year.  Wall Street office rent is $40/sq ft/month. Let's say a cramped space of 50sqft per person (that's 7ft by 7ft). That's $288k per year.  So a burn rate of $1.38m per year just on Hiveswap, and they want to expand."

homestuck,3dys6a,archonsolarsaila,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"okay yeah those are pretty reasonable numbers. Since they are releasing the game in episodes, they're probably planning on running a bit into the red and then making the money to develop subsequent episodes with the previous release. It's not a great system but they're certainly not the first to do it. If the rumors were true they started working on the game at WP in october with about 1.5 million left, plus I'm assuming they are using additional funds from merchandise sales and ad revenue on top of that. I mean they're not gonna have much to spare when they're done, but it's definitely doable.  I just don't like all the negativity and entitlement the fandom has had to be honest. I mean it's unfortunate it's taking so long, but developing a game with a dev team built from the ground up is really hard. It will be done when it is done, you have to have just a little bit of faith."
homestuck,3dys6a,ShokTherapy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"Using money over and above the Kickstarter implies they intend to somehow make it back on release. It's a huge gamble that that many people will want to buy this on release who didn't back the Kickstarter.  Especially since they are expanding and planning future games. There's a lot of risk there - Homestuck isn't Mario, it appeals to a highly engaged niche audience who could well dissipate after the comic ends, or after the first game is ""just OK"" quality. The risk of this (and cost of doing business) goes up the more delays happen.  Video games are just so much riskier than comics. We know Hussie could probably work until his retirement from comics and WP merchandising. We don't know that about his games."
homestuck,3dys6a,archonsolarsaila,2,Mon Jul 20 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"That's the point though, it is risky. Trying to turn a webcomic into a full time career was risky, but he did it successfully. Trying to transition that career into one of video game development is even riskier. But I mean, that's why he's doing it. He's not making a game because he already knows its going to be a success. Hussie is an artist, not a corporation. He is making this game because he wants to see if he can translate his success from webcomics into video games. I don't know why you're arguing with me to be honest? I never said it wasn't risky, I'm just saying it's very possible for him to succeed, and it isn't entirely unprecedented since he already made the leap of faith involved in writing homestuck full time in the first place.

I think a connection between the Void aspect and the Furthest Ring can be assumed. IIRC The comparison between the aspect of Light and the precognition in the clouds of Skaia has been stablished in canon. Also, there is an opposition between Prospit dreamers learning stuff by staring at Skaia and Derse dreamers learning stuff by staring at the Furthest Ring; which is mirrored by the Light/Void opposition. My headcanon is that Homestuck is set under a dual pantheon with Skaia on one side, the entity that enables creation, and presents itself as source(s) of light in a single point(s); and the Horrorterrors on the other side, the entities that enable extinction, and present themselves among the absence of light in all regions of space far from Skaia. This aligns with Aradia's view of all the events, that despite the multiverse-reaching size of the problems, everything that is happening is just a cycle of cleanup or housekeeping, put in the context of this eternal cycle of creation and consumption."

homestuck,3dz8ov,jpae20,4,Mon Jul 20 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"My sense is that anyone who's ever going to play the game was orginally ectobiologically created IN and BY the game, and so their 'spirits', if you will, are bound up in different metaphysical rules than others. So while the average troll might die and persist in some ghostly afterlife permanently, one who was created within the game ultimately has a different fate in store for them than the rest of their race upon what the game considers 'death'."
homestuck,3dz8ov,shoe_owner,6,Tue Jul 21 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"personal headcanon is that horroterrors 'eat' souls, by taking them into themselves. horrorterrors are just ancient amalgamations of souls, the result of immortal entities staying overlong in the void of paradox space (they eventually get smushed together, physically and spiritually). their deal with Feferi was to hold off the consumption of the player souls from the kid/troll session. ""let's become tangle buddies"". of course the horrorterrors are SO ancient and made up of so many souls that new individuals are essentially totally lost in the collective (it is a kind of death). I also suspect Lord English is doing the same thing. He's possibly a infant, possibly severely mutated Horrorterror (maybe so far afield they don't consider him kin, rather a threat needing to be annihilated).  This would explain their relationship to Skaia and The Game. They're possibly opposed to new creation running amok for reasons of preserving a stable paradox space (assuming new universes draw their essence from Pspace and are some small 'harm' to it), but also they want players to fail so they have more souls to 'eat'. which i would guess to be a hunger driven by desire for a continuing influx of novel experiences."

homestuck,3e0p6r,TabethaRasa,12,Tue Jul 21 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure which part you're confused about, so I'll bullet-point the conversation highlights. These are subject to my own potential misunderstandings of Hussie's intent, but hope they help.   Calliope and Jade are going to ""the source"" of everything. This is something Jade already knows about, so possibly The Green Sun, or possibly something else the readers are familiar with. Time is not passing at the same rate for Jade's dreamself and her playerself. This is because her dreamself is located in the furthest ring, in which time and space are notoriously wonky. Time and space are revealed as paired aspects, inseparable. This is a reference to the idea of spacetime as a single entity in physics. All other aspects are explained to be similarly linked in this cosmology. Players, or at least space players are, according to Calliope, created to have an intrinsic aptitude for learning about their aspect, as well as a curiosity about its pair. Space and time, or spacetime, in the furthest ring are measurable by change. These measurements are implied to be subjective, or specific to each person, the same way your location in the real world is measured by coordinates. But if you as the observer stop moving, changes are more difficult to measure. Imagine you have a start point A, and an endpoint B. Everything between those two points are set to random, so you can't navigate by landmarks. But because B is where you're going, you'll end up when and where you need to be upon arrival, because that's your destination. It's your destination because that's where you wanted to go. So it's important to have an understanding of your goal when navigating. The furthest ring has become easier to navigate as it becomes cracked because the cracks provide landmarks that can be used to measure change, which stabilize spacetime to some extent. Calliope knows where and when they're going, so it won't be time for Jade to wake up until they've reached their destination. Space is a ninja or something. Then it destroys everything."

On the one hand their character was years in the making, pulled together by lots of little plot reveals and foreshadowing to make none of their existence feel like an asspull.   But at the same time they're weird and a random, and just have this crazy awesome design with a color scheme that a lot of people hate, but I sort of really dig.  And their personality is just the right amount of cute, and sweet, and introspective.

That's canonically not a thing for trolls. Andrew has compared her preference to a fetish. She's not incapable of being attracted to males, she just vastly prefers females.  Number two, people like Rose because her sarcasm and personality work so perfectly with characters like Dave, John, and recently, Roxy."

What do you get?  C -> G  T -> X  that may not seem like it makes sense, but let's go back to the time of Shakespeare. In his time, the letters J and U did not exist, so therefore if we shift the letters C and T four over, this time we get:  C -> G  T -> Y  Therefore, cat singularity = gay singularity    Edit: Sauce"

homestuck,3dvupm,Shardwing,16,Mon Jul 20 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"One way I can see this going is Davepeta deciding the be catty (haha its a pun) and trying to steal Karkat away from Dave, because hey, they're Dave plus extra.  That's a very unlikely direction. The most likely direction is DavePeta feeling relieved that they're no longer fake!Dave but instead their own unique thing. This realization allows them to finally move on from their inner turmoil and become kickass brorails with GO!Arquius.   Or at least that's the direction I'm hoping for."

homestuck,3dvupm,FlameDizasterX,22,Mon Jul 20 01:42:07 2015 UTC,"*They.  Interestingly enough, Davepeta is the first sprite i've actually referred to with ungendered pronouns in by head, despite the fact that Jasprose, Jadesprite (assuming Bec can, in any way, be considered male) and the original Davesprite (Rambunctious Crow is assumed to be male, due to Crowsprite trying to hatch the Cruxite Egg) are all partially male and female. It's probably because both Dave and Nepeta are sapient."
homestuck,3dvupm,EverythingIsNormal,40,Mon Jul 20 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"I very much dislike Jasprose, but this... this is purrfection!!! Both of the Meowrails are prototyped with the more ""fake"", less ""real"" Striders!

That's the first reasoning I've seen for this fusion that makes it seem logical. I wonder what a meeting between Arquius and Davepeta would be like? Probably the best thing to happen to this comic, that's what."
homestuck,3dvupm,NitroGlyde,29,Mon Jul 20 00:47:17 2015 UTC,If this results in Arquius and Davepeta becoming brorails and fighting side by side in the epic conclusion I'd be 100% okay with this fusion.  I'd also be 100% okay if Davepeta somehow fuses with Gamzee's good half and badass!Calliope to become some sort of reverse lord english.

homestuck,3dvupm,icekilled,13,Sun Jul 19 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"Dave has said that Davesprite probably lays eggs and takes a dump out of the same hole, so that suggests a cloaca. The Seppucrow was probably female, because of how protective it was of its egg. Now, Nepeta is probably the more dominant part of the sprite, because DPS2 is a combination of Nepeta and a combination of Dave and a crow.  sprite( Nepeta, sprite( Dave, Seppucrow ) );   So DPS2 would be 75% female. However, Dave is obviously more prominent in the sprite. Davesprite is a more major character than Nepeta, although they're both kind of animals. We'll have to wait and see what kind of pronouns are used, but I think they should be female ones.  Also they're both probably bi."

I think we need to separate and draw a distinction between the aspects of life (being alive and able to develop) and light (fortune, agency and relevance) here. BKEW likes to draw life into relevance as well because of what Aranea said about the rings of life and void having opposite effects. But the thing is there's loads of reasons why what Aranea said may not be entirely accurate."

homestuck,3dw7n2,Jonatc87,2,Mon Jul 20 03:44:54 2015 UTC,"Look at the chest. A Time symbol. Let me now remind you that Davepsrite is one half alternate timeline'd Dave. In which timeline, Dave did not ascend to the God tiers.   It may be because they are both derse dreamers and it was a 50%/50% chance of being either Heart or Time symbols. Davesprite wasn't godtier. However, since Jasprosesprite2 can see EVERY instance of their other selves; it stands to reason that sprite2 magnifies their powers greatly.  Davepetasprite2 is now a god-tier-level time player, who is said to kill the bad guy. While Dave doesn't want to fight.  Now where does this leave nepeta? Sadly with little other than influencing Davesprites personality. It seems Dave is simply the dominant part."
homestuck,3dw7n2,mehgamer,2,Mon Jul 20 08:02:19 2015 UTC,Nepeta is the rogue of heart and might help Davesprite figure his shit out so he can prepare for the battle.
homestuck,3dw7n2,Jonatc87,3,Mon Jul 20 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"That's some pretty big speculation, since we have no prior sprite2 made of two players to base that on. So I feel like that is a major shot in the dark.  A majority of the worn features are Nepeta's, minus the wings and shades and Davesprite was prototyped into Nepeta, so based on what we think we know, he should be the dominant aspect/class/character in the personality. This may also be proven by the ""Clawclaw meowtherfucker"", following Rose doing similar prior and they both have a similar sense of humor.  Just like how it's pretty clear Jasper is the dominant personality of Jasprosesprite2.  And AResponder is the Dominant personality over ARquiussprite, so on and so forth.  Anyhow, my point is, I believe her personality, not her aspect/class will have a greater impact. Not to mention the lack of a heart/time combo symbol."
homestuck,3dw7n2,mehgamer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:46 2015 UTC,"Well that's more what I meant, the personality following the heart aspect specifically.  I know it's a shot in the dark but to be fair we have a long history of striders losing motivation and then gaining it again through someone else's intervention.  It's definitely possible."

Realistically, nepeta has never been a main character. Davesprite is literally a copy of a character that has already been getting loads of A+ character development.   Hussie hasn't 'betrayed' the fandom he's just continued to write the story he's always been writing."
homestuck,3dwe9u,edrudathec,10,Mon Jul 20 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"I agree Nepeta was pretty nicely wrapped up. She died trying to avenge someone she loved, she had her conversation with Jaspersprite, it was all good.  I disagree with Davesprite. He had his own arc going on (see this conversation). People (as well as the characters) keep trying to convince me that Davesprite is just another Dave but I feel like he was far enough along in his development to not be a Dave-clone."
homestuck,3dwe9u,shootdawhoop99,3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know I think davesprite and Dave's character arc is one - the same as his quest.   When alpha Dave was talking with dirk he also said that he felt like a runty after-thought rather than a person.   They are different instances of the same guy. The linked conversation just gives us another perspective on the same guys thought processes and issues.   To support this interpretation - Dave's planet quest was actually completed by both of the Dave's independently. Davesprite was the one who visited the denizen and got the sword if I'm remembering it correctly. Then he gave it to alpha Dave. Considering that planet quests are suppose to be quests of personal development I think this is telling us something about hussies intentions.   (Edit) also, when Dave was talking about struggling to not be a douche during the striunion, the first thing that came to my mind was davesprite and john's tiff about john's dad."

homestuck,3dwe9u,shootdawhoop99,2,Mon Jul 20 02:35:12 2015 UTC,It's good that Davesprite fused with the character that Hussie hate the most.  umhum.
homestuck,3dwe9u,kurikurimix49,6,Mon Jul 20 02:42:10 2015 UTC,This is important. For the END GAME. Both Dave and Nepeta are needed. Why would he bring her back if he hates her? Just makes sense.
homestuck,3dwe9u,SuicidalSushi,3,Mon Jul 20 02:43:50 2015 UTC,So he can double kill her once and for all.  Or make davesprite armed since he lost his sword.  Or to turn davesprite into a human again if the sprite explode?

If Davepetasprite2 splits, wouldn't it split into Davesprite and Nepetasprite? But maybe the sprite would just split totally into its base components: future!Dave, the Crow, and Nepeta."
homestuck,3dw4g0,BobisOnlyBob,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:56 2015 UTC,Nepeta and Feferi split too after exploding.
homestuck,3dw4g0,sunil_b,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"They were still oddly quiet and synchronised through, which was cute in its own way."
homestuck,3dw4g0,Gudic,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:14 2015 UTC,maybe sprites^2 can defuse? maybe nepeta will be back? ;_;

homestuck,3dw4g0,antlertroll,11,Mon Jul 20 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"I can actually imagine a comedy of errors where the nepeta half of davepeta gets up the courage to confess to Karkat, and Karkat, thinking this is his Dave, decides he'll try to make it work. Then of course Karkat's Dave shows up and hilarity ensues."
homestuck,3dw4g0,hyperhedgehog7,13,Mon Jul 20 03:04:25 2015 UTC,"The way I prefer to look at it: the sprites are meant for solving the problems (whether personal problems, information problems, strategic problems, whatever) of the alive people. Now that Davesprite is merged with somebody else he might have more insight for helping real-Dave, which was kind of always his purpose. Maybe if we're lucky and Hussie decides to not ruin ALL our hopes and dreams, davenepetasprite will be able to solve their (his? her? its?) own problems too."

homestuck,3dw4g0,Igigigif,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:09:10 2015 UTC,that's just hussie's excuse for doing random shit
homestuck,3dw4g0,Swaggy-G,2,Mon Jul 20 06:25:47 2015 UTC,How could you think that?
homestuck,3dw4g0,CamlinDomino88,13,Mon Jul 20 10:56:29 2015 UTC,"I think they are both more relevant now. Sprites 2 have memories from every single instance of that character - a pretty cool power if you ask me.   Also, Davesprite was always going to have to change drastically if he wanted any relevance in the story line. We already have alpha Dave working through his childhood issues. Davesprite's emotional development would have just been repeating stuff we've already seen. They are literally the same guy."
homestuck,3dw4g0,gumptiousguillotine,3,Mon Jul 20 01:43:51 2015 UTC,Relevant
homestuck,3dw4g0,Yaridovich23,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:16 2015 UTC,Post retcon Davesprite might still be relevant in the dream bubbles.
homestuck,3dw4g0,MindOfOrangutan,2,Mon Jul 20 02:31:57 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I feel like Davesprite was kinda... used for this sick sprite2 joke.
homestuck,3dw4g0,jpae20,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a joke so much as it was just... Shenanigans. I feel like the general consensus on what happened is that it wasn't funny. I do, however, think it will be relevant in the future."
homestuck,3dw4g0,MindOfOrangutan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"Davesprite was never going to be relevant anyway, just like Nepetasprite.  Might as well make them one character to take up less space."

homestuck,3dve96,OnlyLoveNow,7,Sun Jul 19 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"Lord English is implied to be the best wrestler in paradox space. He's at least better than any of the alpha kids, and possibly better than Gamzee.  oh yeah, and magic sunglasses that alter your vision of reality (dave ignored the horror terrors, was possibly shielded from lil cal's malevolent influence)"
homestuck,3dve96,cranialAnalyst,4,Sun Jul 19 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Its totally a cult classic. Why not reference it? Its mythos is poignant, fun, and pretty much already over the internet before mspaintadventures was a thing."

homestuck,3dve96,iHipster,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:11 2015 UTC,It's a really good movie.

homestuck,3dve96,maxxramman,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:34 2015 UTC,doubt he played it
homestuck,3dve96,ZapActions-dower,2,Mon Jul 20 03:17:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, maybe.  But if he were to play it, he'd probably really enjoy the Keith David stuff, considering."
