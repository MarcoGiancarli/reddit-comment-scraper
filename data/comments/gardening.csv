gardening,3e2brk,ThePaisleyChair,10,Tue Jul 21 12:26:43 2015 UTC,My dog likes to pick squash and tomatoes and bring then to me. I think she thinks they are balls.
gardening,3e2brk,Mthecrouton,7,Tue Jul 21 14:27:21 2015 UTC,Once I left 3 squash on the counter when I left for work. I came home no squash on the counter mutilated squash all over the living room. I'm guessing she liked the texture of it because it's crunchy. She's a lab mix so anything that can be reached is fair game to go into the mouth to be chewed on. Labs are just all around nutty goofy dogs I decided.

The above method I replied to is called an open kettle pack, and was the preferred method even 30 years ago.   ""Why is open kettle canning not recommended? In open kettle canning, food is cooked in an ordinary kettle, then packed into hot jars and sealed without processing. The temperatures obtained in open kettle canning are not high enough to destroy all spoilage and food poisoning organisms that may be in the food. Also, microorganisms can enter the food when it is transferred from the kettle to jar and cause spoilage.""  From http://nchfp.uga.edu/"
gardening,3dz0t2,Akthrawn17,0,Tue Jul 21 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"Botulism is caused by the spores of the clostridium botulium bacteria.  This bacteria cannot survive in high-acid environments, it also cannot survive above 212 degrees F.  So, once you bring the hot solution up to boiling and place over the vegetable, you are killing any bacteria that may be there and removing any environment that it could survive in.    The processing 10-15 min is simply added as an ""extra"" precaution.  If you are providing a low-acid environment, with no air then this is perfect for the bacteria's spores to survive in.  They can only be destroyed at a temp of 240 degrees F or higher, which is why we steam-pressure process certain things.    Source: www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09305.pdf"

I didn't even get enough to eat out of them. I didn't think to grill them. That sounds good 😊 I have been steaming these and they are just the slightest bit sweet (or at least sweeter then normal beans) but SO good. I plan on canning them if I can stop eating them long enough to get enough together to make canning them worthwhile.
gardening,3e3top,stealing1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:09 2015 UTC,Canna plants are very popular in my area so I collected some seeds recently. I was finally able to germinate some canna seeds on my covered back porch! Has anyone grown these from seed before and have any advice? Should I put them out in full sun now and just make sure to keep them watered or keep them on the covered back porch till bigger?
gardening,3e3fbh,epiphanette,3,Tue Jul 21 17:35:27 2015 UTC,What is a winter cover crop?
gardening,3e3fbh,Casswigirl11,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"Something that you plant in fall in order to overwinter, and then in the spring, you till it under. It adds organic matter to the soil, and utilizes the soil during a blank period when not much else is going on (if you're not doing fall/winter crops).    What you plant depends on where you are, and how long you want to dedicate your garden to cover crops. You can do a quickie autumn grow of non-winter-hardy fast-maturing buckwheat or annual rye, or else something like winter rye that you leave in place all spring.  http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/ecogardening/impsoilcov.html  http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/green-manure-crops-zmaz86sozgoe.aspx  Cover crops and green manures are a fantastic way to add organic matter to your soil."

gardening,3e3cp3,thenistoppedlurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"See after reading more the oil seems to be in other fungicide/insecticide mixtures just as a sticking agent, so it doesn't seem to affect it that way by itself anyway.  i'm guessing something about the combination, or maybe the infection was further gone than I realised and it just, died."
gardening,3e3cp3,thenistoppedlurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:19 2015 UTC,I think the soap being added is a sticking agent as well.  In everything I read it said that this kind of spray wouldn't really help eradicate existing infection but could help in preventing it spreading to other leaves.  I removed all the infected leaves and sprayed the healthy looking leaves in an attempt to keep it at bay.  I also didn't do it for a week and it appears to be back.  What kind of squash is this specifically?
gardening,3e3cp3,thenistoppedlurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent question, I'm 99% sure it's a Butternut squash.  I say 99% because I got it as a seedling on clearance and their labelling was sketchy at best (it was doing fantastic until now.)"
gardening,3e3cp3,DebbieU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"When you say melted do you mean that all the leaves kinda wilted down and it looked dead? I know if I don't water mine a bit it looks like it's giving up on life but perks back up with some time/water.  In future, if you see powdery mildew coming on you need to get ahead of it ASAP.  Sometimes people make the spray and stay on it as a preventative measure from the get go. I'm going to try that next year as it hit every single one of my squash plants and was a total pain."

gardening,3e2nji,surbryl,5,Tue Jul 21 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"Experience is the best, and sometimes the only, teacher. You learn by doing. You learn how to do cuttings because you have a favorite plant that you want to either propagate or salvage.  You learn about diseases and insects and nutritional deficiencies when one of your plants comes down with weird symptoms.  You don't usually breed, as in hybridize, your own plants in order to have plants next year, but you do save seeds, and there are numerous resources on the Internet telling you exactly how to do that for whatever plants you have a mind to save.  Sometimes an ailing plant really IS a lost cause. Triage is an essential component of all gardening. However, sometimes people give up too soon, and in that case, you keep looking, and as you're looking, you're also learning.  I didn't learn how to grow tomatoes and African violets by reading a book about it. I learned to grow them by reading books AND by growing them for 40 years. Eventually you too will get there. Just keep on keeping on.  You are blessed by having the formidable resources of the Internet at your fingertips. I had to get in the car and drive to the library if I wanted more gardening books.  Where are you located? If you're in the U.S., your extension office is a fount of information.  Also:    U.S.-centric but very good on basics. http://www.garden.org/  UK-centric but very good on basics. https://www.rhs.org.uk/"
gardening,3e2nji,GrandmaGos,2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:23 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks, didn't realise the RHS did ""general"" guides, I have only ever used them when researching specific plants!  I already seed save some of my plants (usually do it with a few of my veggie plants) but I'm just curious about hybridisation. I don't really plan on using it that much.  I understand the point about experience, I just have an extremely long, extremely boring commute on public transport (meaning a lot of reading time), so being able to pick up some gardening ideas on the way would be nice!"
gardening,3e2nji,wwjbrickd,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"For hybridization you bag the flower buds to prevent uncontrolled pollenization, remove the stamens from the one you plan to pollinate if it can self pollinate, them pollinate by hand and there are lots of methods for that depending on the type of flower and your preferences so I'll let you research that."
gardening,3e2nji,GrandmaGos,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:29 2015 UTC,"Ok. A good second-hand bookstore can be a useful destination, as the information from earlier eras isn't that much out of date.  Some of the approaches to insects and diseases may rely more on chemical pesticides than on newfangled Integrated Pest Management and on organic and cultural remedies, but plants still need the same things to grow, and there's a lot of good info on basic techniques in those old books.  My personal preference would be to avoid the ""Gardening for Dummies"" kind of modern books, the ones that are set up to give you a Buzzfeed infographic ""The least you need to know"" 100-words-or-less experience. I'd go for the books that have, like, a lot of text, with occasional pictures for illustrations.  Those are the ones that IME are going to have the widest range of actual information. The ""Dummies"" type of books tend to skim the surface, and moreover can tend to be heavily biased towards certain geographic areas such as North Temperate Eastern Woodland, which is what I think of as the Burpee Bias.  Burpee and many of the other U.S. mass market seed merchants came to power by catering to gardeners in the Midwest, New England, and Mid-Atlantic, so their slant, especially on their packet instructions, is frequently heavily biased towards that.  So a lot of the Buzzfeed infographic types tend to be similarly biased.  So go find some old books."

There is no shortage of literature; it seems everyone writes a book these days. But if you are learning by yourself, this should cover about everything, except for maybe more specific specialized techniques, in which case you would probably be better off taking a class e.g orchid cloning or something like that. I taught Cub Scouts how to graft fruit trees one year (with varying degrees of success), but that was all- root stock selection etc. would have way too much information for the exercise in that level of interest. I hope someone from the UK can give you better sources, but these may be available to you."

Soil prep is the most important part of gardening, it's just also the least romantic and fun. You need to add compost stat. Get a hoe and start digging around the shoulders of the plants, working compost into the top 4 inches or so of soil. The nutrients might burn it up, but at this point you don't have a lot to loose.   Before you put new plants in next year, dig the whole bed out at least a foot deep. Add compost, manure, a sprinkle of epsom salts, egg shells, dried leaves, grass clippings etc. Also find some earthworms and plop them in there. The more worms there are, the healthier your soil is."

gardening,3e2ys2,Iamnotyour_mother,0,Tue Jul 21 16:29:22 2015 UTC,"You are a captain of mercenaries who has been hired to root out some bandits in a mountainous area in a Third World country. No politics involved, just a gang of doofus robbers with a banditti hangout, from which they jump out and rob people--tourists, merchants, missionaries, everybody. The local Powers That Be would like them gone, but don't have the manpower who's willing to go mano a mano with them.   So, they hire you.  You arrive in the capital city, a Third World backwater of direst conditions.  A nervous government flunky meets you at the airport and gives you one of the following sets of equipment to enable you to do your job:  EITHER:  For transport around town: a rusty bicycle with a leaky rear tire.  For housing: a single bed in a ramshackle flophouse filled with boozy sailors and brawling hookers.  For meals: a pre-adolescent houseboy will be on call to go out to the local street food vendors for you and bring back deep-fried Mystery Meat in greasy newspaper. For weapons: a WW2 Army carbine and a box of cartridges of varying and unfamiliar caliber. To pay the men you're going to recruit: A shoebox of cubic zirconia offcuts and some IOUs drawn up on the  First International Bank of Nigeria.  OR:    For transport around town: A serviceable Land Rover. For housing: A nice room in a nice hotel.  For meals: An expense account at a decent restaurant. For weapons: A shipping crate full of new automatic weapons, and enough ammo to win a small war. To pay the men you're going to recruit: Boxes and briefcases of brand-new American Franklins, and for those who don't like paper, a whole lot of krugerrands.  So, which setup would you prefer?  When you plant something in the ground, it is immediately at war, in a fight for survival, against heat, drought, cold, flood, insects, diseases, herbivores, and other plants.  You give it every possible advantage in order to stack the odds in its favor.  So yes, you dig up the dirt before you plant anything in it. This expedites the plant striking its roots down deep and fast, before anything can catch up to it. And it increase the oxygen supply to the roots by breaking up the soil and aerating it, adding air spaces between the soil particles.   You have the soil tested for nutrients and pH, and you add whatever's necessary to make conditions optimum. That's how you get tomatoes and roses. If you just plunk your plants down in the dirt as it came, you're much less likely to get tomatoes or roses. Way it works."

gardening,3e0vr4,stopthebefts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:29 2015 UTC,"It looks like a bacterial infection, most likely Downey mildew. Trim off the severely affected leaves, (your plant is still young, trimming off all affected leaves would be detrimental) and make sure you water from below, as Downey mildew spreads through water.  How hot does it get in your area? Downey mildew can't survive in hot Temps and will usually go away mid-summer. Another user suggested  copper fungicide, and while this is still a good idea if you live in a cooler, moist region, it will not treat the Downey Mildew, because despite the name, it is a bacterial infection and will not respond to fungicides.  There are no chemical controls for Downey mildew, and once you have it, you have it. Just ride it out, many plants survive the disease, if a little stunted."

Male bees never collect pollen, and only forage for nectar to sustain themselves. They may incidentally have pollen on them, but they font consume it and likely will groom it off.

gardening,3dv2r6,Amnesiablo,5,Mon Jul 20 01:23:54 2015 UTC,"They are!  In case anyone is wondering how to identify bees (or bee look-alikes):   Bumblebees are fat and fuzzy all over. They almost always have varying color bands of yellow and black all over. Like this! Honeybees are more lean, fuzzy on the thorax (the ""torso""), and semi-smooth on the abdomen. Their thoraxes are usually mostly dark brown, and their abdomens are banded yellow & black. Like this! Carpenter bees have yellow-ish thoraxes, often with a dark dot or stripe (sometimes it's all-black), and mostly-black, fairly smooth abdomens. Like this! Wasps and hornets are usually banded yellow and black, but are smooth all over (or have super-fine hairs that are hard to see), and are much more lean-looking than bees. Like this!   There are also flies, beetles, and moths that are considered bee-mimics, in the way they look or act. This offers a ton of info about that :)"

Mine was so root bound it was forcing the potting soil out of the container, I forget to water it for weeks on end, and my fiance even accidentally kicked over the pot for good measure - it's healthier than ever.

gardening,3e01gr,thenistoppedlurking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:34 2015 UTC,"Let's see... he's killed a lavender, rosemary, and moonflower for sure.   Lavender was most recent, it was very healthy when he got it, and he says he watered it every day. When I noticed it looked really dry, I suggested giving it more water, which he did, but it was dead a week later. There was some unusual build up on the outside of the pot (terra cotta). I think he was using fishtank water, which I've never had a problem with but something may have festered in the water or it might've been poisoned (with ammonia/toxins) to begin with.   I think the rosemary was watered irregularly or not often enough; it was pretty young when he got it. No idea what happened to the moonflower. There was one other a while back whose leaves turned white and fell off. There was also a cilantro that started turning purple, but I got it healthy again.   My place definitely gets more light, but his place still gets plenty. I kept them all on a balcony that got really hot during the day, and I thought they'd do better at his place because they'd be indoors."
gardening,3e01gr,HarryBridges,2,Tue Jul 21 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Is it possible he's watering often, but not fully?

gardening,3e0bch,aklolitalost,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:55 2015 UTC,Def some fertilizers. I use Epsom salts around by blueberries. For my lemon tree I use happy frog organic fertilizer. It's about 10 bucks a bag and one will do all your trees and more for months. They are a little young. Some fruit bearing trees can take up to 5 years to produce fruit. I have a couple kiwi plants and I have been waiting 3 years for my delicious kiwi to appear. There are some great YouTube videos on pruning fruit trees. With lemons you want to thin the fruit so the individual fruits grow bigger and have more room. Being in southern Cali I don't know what your water restrictions are. That could be playing a small part as well. More than likely next year you will have plenty of fruit :)

gardening,3dz0if,cantcountnoaccount,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:45 2015 UTC,Insects usually attack young forming leaves. Absent leave miner tracks the most likely causes are aphids and psyllids. You can try insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.   Citrus needs a 9-3-6 NPK proportion so your balanced fert formula is leaving a lot of unused potassium salts behind.

I seek them out and dig them up, since they're so invasive where I am. Yet I grew up in the high desert where my parents couldn't get a berry to grow at all. Just interesting to see a weed in one area become something to garden in another."
gardening,3e0wzo,MsYutai,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"Very nice. Good job. But yanno, if you have room, I'd totally put the compost bins elsewhere in the yard. Why should they be taking up precious square footage in the garden itself?     Water: Light watering every other day   It's always better to water deeply and more infrequently, than to water often and shallowly. When you water with many light sprinkles, this encourages the roots to stay up in the upper levels of soil, where the water is, and they don't forge deep connections down to the lower levels where there are reserves of moisture and also of nutrients. So when drought comes--as when you miss a few days with your light sprinkles--if the roots are all in the upper layers, they're hit really hard. But if they've grown down deep, they can withstand better. Water the equivalent of an inch of rain a week, and then dig down a couple times to make sure it's moist down there.  Worst case scenario, if you always apply the same amount of little sprinkles every day, the roots can actually end up going back and forth laterally along the ""water horizon"" that marks where the moist soil stops. It's almost like being potbound.  Light sprinkles can also accomplish nothing more than getting the mulch wet, so you need to really soak it once or twice a week, and then leave it.  Straw is not as effective as something like shredded bark or cardboard at excluding weeds. Germinating seedlings will still find a way upwards. But they do tend to be etiolated and easier to pull.  Usually a maximum of 4"" is best."

gardening,3dyuio,nnin,5,Mon Jul 20 17:23:09 2015 UTC,So I found a trick for short term watering that may work for you and is dirt cheap.    All you need is a bucket and some yarn made of wool.     Water your plants really well. Fill a bucket with water and place it slightly higher then where your plants live.  (See photo for reference)  Soak yarn in the water. Extend the string from the bucket to each plant that needs to be watered and place near or around the base of the plant.  Use more then one string for the plant if the plant is a little bigger.  You can also braid the string to make it bigger.     Make sure you weight the yarn or do something to ensure that it will not fall out of the bucked while you are away.   The yarn works like a capillary and will slowly water your plants while you are away.    http://i.imgur.com/lwPQGUt.png

They send up new canes right next to the old ones.  They'll quickly sprout new canes if the tips touch the ground but that is easy to prevent with a bit of trimming.  Here is a picture of my main plant after early spring trimming (cutting out the old canes.)  Note the shovel for scale.  There are two smaller plants behind it slightly to the left and right.  They aren't quite so big now because I had some serious die back a couple of winters ago but I expect by next year they'll be back at least as big.  My black raspberries are the same way...no traveling runners but start new plant at the tips easily.  I'm pretty sure I've heard people say purple raspberries are the same way but I've never grown them so I can't be positive.

I fear they may be snail eggs or a type of fungus and therefore wonder if I should scoop them out.  Edit: the more I research, it appears to be a type of fungus. Not sure if it's detrimental to the plants though."

gardening,3dz4ny,swampcreek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:15 2015 UTC,It's not blossom end rot. This is similar to normal splitting which is kinda 50/50 not enough or to much water OR growing to fast because of really high temps. It will be perfectly fine to eat it just might not last as long.
gardening,3dz4ny,fuzzzzywuzzzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:54 2015 UTC,"Sudden increase in water. The tomato can't expand enough to keep up with the pressure...the cracks relieve the pressure.   If it's raining a lot, you're kinda out of luck. You could move any mulch you have aside to help increase evaporation, that might be about it.   If not, you've got to look into your watering practices (less in this case)."
gardening,3dz4ny,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,-3,Tue Jul 21 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"its called end rot. have you had torrential downpours recently? it often occurs when tomatoes are overwatered. pick off all the yucky ones, reduce watering times, and proceed growing."
gardening,3dz4ny,spinninglizzie,4,Mon Jul 20 19:24:34 2015 UTC,Actually this is the top I think so that would be splitting but it's also caused by overwatering.
gardening,3dyevl,mercfh85,4,Mon Jul 20 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on how old the seeds are, what type they are, and the ferocity of last years pests."
gardening,3dyevl,SiberianShibe,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"Since most seed packs have way more seeds than I'm ever going to use, I just overseed and thin later.  Plus that means you can keep the best looking sprouts and thin the ones that don't look as strong."
gardening,3dyevl,caltomin,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:10 2015 UTC,It also depends on the size of the seed.  Plants with larger seeds like squash and beans have a much higher success rate.  Smaller seeds like carrots and lettuce will need more seeds per hole to ensure you get some good sprouts.

gardening,3dyevl,Casswigirl11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"I've noticed it depends on the type of seed and how I'm planting it. Directly into the ground I put no two right next to each other but each one closer together than they should be and thin them when they sprout (especially important for carrots, radishes, etc that grow in the ground). When sprouting inside I put 2 or 3 peppers because they seem to have low germination. Sometimes for those I sprout in a bag to see how many germinate and then plant."

You  can't grow them on the coffee table in the middle of the living room 20 feet away from the window.   If you're prepared to put the plants close enough to the window, a west window is ideal for many succulents and cacti.  If you can put up a gauze curtain to filter the direct sunlight, you can grow African violets and Phalaenopsis orchids."

gardening,3e03e9,PuffyCottonCandy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"It's more likely to be mold or algae than moss. Either way, it's not hurting your plants, it's not taking away any nutrients, it just means it's wet enough and the spores or whatever were there.  You determine how often to run a drip emitter by monitoring the soil's moisture with your fingers. Keep track of how long you ran it, and then go out there and stick your fingers in the dirt. How deep did it get it wet? You want to water deeply but infrequently, as opposed to shallowly and often, because deep infrequent watering encourages the plant to send its roots down deep into the soil where there are reserves of moisture. If you're always watering shallowly, then the roots tend to stay up shallow where the moisture is, and they can actually grow horizontally, back and forth, at the line in the soil where the  moisture habitually stops.  So run the emitters long enough to really soak things, and measure  how long that took. Then you want to keep it at ""evenly moist"", so you'll have to keep checking it.  Irrigation doesn't go by ""clock time"", it goes by ""how wet is the dirt now""."

Many more plants are killed by overwatering than underwatering.  If it stays too wet too long, the roots will rot.

gardening,3dzxdi,_Calochortus_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the specific plant you have but some plants are known for shedding their leaves when their environment changes so it probably looks worse than it is.  Since the leaves are gone, the plant won't be sucking up as much moisture from the soil anymore so letting it dry out some may take longer.  Definitely make sure it is not sitting in water as soon as possible.  If the pot has an attached tray, see if you can remove it so it can drain freely.  I even drill extra holes in the bottoms of pots to make sure water doesn't sit too long.   If you can't get the tray off,  leave the pot tipped at an angle steep enough to let the water out until it doesn't drip at all.  Possibly you could bunch up some paper towels and press them against the soil to try to wick out any excess.  I don't really know how wet your soil is so I may be making too much of this but soggy roots are really the biggest danger.  Someone more familiar with your plant may be able to tell you how to make a cutting so you have a backup in case things don't work out.  I've got a plant my Dad gave me 30 years ago which I've come close to killing a few times so I know how you feel.  If you're really freaked out and want some help, you might want to consider checking out your local nurseries.  You might be able to find someone with experience who would be willing to nurse it back to health for you or at least give you some pointers."

Currently,  Ive got a thriving balcony garden with flowers and some mystery vegetables growing. My first step was figuring out how much sun I got during the day and then researching plants that fit withing those parameters. At first I just picked up some plants I thought were pretty from the greenhouse and read the tags carefully,  then put them in pots and watered almost every day when the soil looked dry or the plants looked droopy. It was a definite trial and error time (but that's how you get better).   This year I tried starting seeds inside which worked well until I got a bit ambitious and left them outside and a surprise snow killed all but my peas. My strawberries are going wild though and I'm happy with my progress this year.   I think that wall along the side would look nice with flowers that grow up or something tall like tomatoes or peas. You can maybe try putting some other potted plants around the wood deck you've got there and that should look nice. See how that feels, then add more or different things next year."

Splitting oranges and leaf dropping are signs of overwatering.  Leaf curl is also another symptom of overwatering.  cut it back to once a week and see if they improve.  Mulch helps keep in the moisture so if you live in a humid part of Florida, you can probably go a week and a half if the trees have been in the ground for a while.

Another one will eventually grow back if the plant is healthy.  Yellow leaves tend to mean that the plant has too much water while brown tips tend to mean not enough. In your case, I would add more water to try and repair the brown tips.  Have you made sure that the water has drained through the pot at least once? Peace lilies don't need a lot of water, but they do like their soil being moist all the way through; just make sure that it's in a well draining pot. Also, do you use any slow release fertiliser in the pot at all?  As a guideline, the light for the plant should be filtered, natural light that you can comfortably read a book in for several hours per day.  It's also possible that the plant is suffering from transplant shock. If this is the case, just keep it fed and watered and in a nice level of light and it should eventually get better."

gardening,3dubqf,MinusNick,3,Sun Jul 19 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"AKA, the apical meristem. It is literally the point at which more plant grows. Most plants will just grow new ones below the injured site coming off at an angle if the meristem is damaged or lost. So then you have two or more shoots coming off the main shoot where you just plucked the meristem.  Look at what three years of undergrad research in plant molecular bio taught me mom!"

gardening,3dubqf,SonVoltMMA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:52 2015 UTC,"With beer, you bury cups in the ground with the rim about an inch above the soil, then the slugs fall in and drown. The trouble with this is that the beer attracts slugs from all over the place, more than would normally be in the immediate vicinity, and you need a pretty wide perimeter with a bunch of cups otherwise a fair number of the slugs will bypass the beer traps and go for the basil. At least that's what happened with me.  Edit - Also, the beer needs to be changed pretty frequently so that, even with cheap beer, it can get a bit expensive."

(still have 1/3rd of a 2½kg box left, so even if it's expensive it lasts for a while if you have a small'ish garden)  I haven't been using the beer trick, because eurgh gross, but I could imagine a combination would work well.   If you want to go all organic and isn't squeamish, some guy described making ""snail juice"" on here at some point (I think it was). Basically some slugs have a disease, if you collect enough slugs in a jar and have them live, you'll eventually have a jar full of infected slugs, then you mix them up into a slug-disease slurry, that you can then spray everywhere in some sort of organic version of chemical warfare lol.

Secondly I didn't cut back enough of the old growth and we had a very odd warm snap in the winter which caused some very weak initial growth. I should have cut it back again to the surface of the soil but I didn't so now the bottom of the stem is very dry and woody and doesn't stand up straight.

gardening,3dy5cv,gauchoman2002,3,Mon Jul 20 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  Are you positive this was not grafted?  Because the way it split looks like a graft fail (smooth break at a swelling instead of raggedy splitting) in the exact place a graft would be.    If you didn't take the cutting yourself, I'd not even consider letting it sucker into a tree.  If you did, either planting fresh or letting it sucker will work.  You should be considering your wind break situation before the apple problem though.  Got room for poplars?"
gardening,3dy5cv,roketgirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"I thought it wasn't grafted, but now I'm not sure, and I definitely didn't take the cutting myself.  Usually there's more of a graft bulge just above the soil line, but now you're making me second guess.  I'm thinking now I'll probably just get a new tree and stake it a heck of a lot better.    I wish I had room for poplar trees, but even one in this place would shade my garden pretty significantly.  Thanks for the help!"

Here is a Garden Kit container from Earth Box that is really working the best so far thanks to the dolomite and fertilizer you put in there.  Others are in Smart Pots that are at least 10 gallons (some are larger pots) around the patio and other places in the yard (I just don't move them once they are in their spot because the whole pot can absorb water from any angle) that are constantly hit by direct sun light from early morning to late in the afternoon.    Others are in the ground in raised beds that are doing alright, a little slower than the garden kit boxes and smart pots, but still going strong and all have peppers.  I also have been using Jobes Organics rather frequently when the peppers started showing up and I also mix in some Epsom salt into occasional waterings' for all my peppers and it has seemed to really help their growth and production so far.  They all seem to suck up water fast so keeping up on waterings' in-between rains can be tricky but I have been trying to get up early or make it a point to get out there after the sun is down to make sure the pots have enough water.  Hope this helps and I wish you the best!  edit: words"

gardening,3du622,ironnomi,3,Sun Jul 19 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"I start to look at if the green is either a deep green or just before that and starting to lighten up, I will pick them. I believe they are ready when they lighten up from the deep green to a lighter green but I also like them right before they lighten up too.  Something else I've noticed is if there are tiny cracks in the pepper, I pick those as soon as I see them. I've heard that indicates the pepper is done growing.   Also, if they are ready, they will pop off the plant very easily. Generally, if I can't get them with a gentle twist or flip them backwards, I leave them alone.   Jalapeño madness has been a big help for little bits of quick info for me although they have crap on their site about buying their book.  Hope this helps!"

gardening,3dwz0s,ihadaface,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:47 2015 UTC,"Do you want to plant the bromeliad permanently in the ground outdoors or keep it in a pot?   The parent plant has flowered and is producing pups. The parent will die off eventually leaving new plants/pups.   You can separate the pups now individually or even after the mother dies back as a brown mush.   I have all of my bromeliads planted outdoors in indirect sunlight here in Hawaii. My temps range from 47-97 give or take a few degrees, based on season. Last winter was one of the coldest remembered and this summer has been record breaking in high temps. We just had a snow storm on Mauna Kea to top off the strange factor in recent weather.   My bromeliads are established and doing well in the wide range of temps planted outdoors. But if you get direct snow where you are, they need to be kept in pots.   Where do you keep your cacti? Indoors in full sun or outdoors in full sun?   From what I can gather in your post, the cacti need more sun and less water. Stretching is a sign of a cacti searching and reaching for light.   Softening and darkening at the base is a general indicator of too much water and possible rotting."
gardening,3dwz0s,moonpurr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:24 2015 UTC,"Both cacti are outdoors (as are all of them). They get sun at least 8 hours a day minimum. As for the bromeliad, I intend to keep it in a pot. There's a spot outside in the shade, should I put it there? The last bromeliad I had began quickly browning and drying out, so I don't know. There's a place indoors near a window I could put it, but my cat will destroy it."
gardening,3dwz0s,moonpurr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:17:42 2015 UTC,Bromeliads will tolerate full sun in warmer climates but they begin to fade out in color. Indirect bright light is preferred. Or even an area that gets direct morning sun and then shaded for the heat of the day.   If the cacti are stretching an in direct outdoor sun then I'd suggest cutting back on watering. The only concern is darkening and softening of the base. That can sometimes indicate rot.   But they are producing pups so that's good.
gardening,3dxcg0,Spacedementia87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:53:22 2015 UTC,"Gently remove it from the pot and put it on some newspaper for mess.

Initial investment of a few hundred bucks for equipment (supers, smoker, beekeeping outfit).  30 bucks or so for each of your starter colonies.  $30-40 per year for treatments as needed for mites, fungal diseases, etc.  Additional cash required for supplemental feeding (sugar water, cheap), and occasional treatment of diseases or as preventatives.  And then you pay someone to come out and extract for you when you want to harvest (unless you buy your own extractor, but that's silly for a couple supers).  Look up your local apiary society. They tend to be very welcoming and supportive.  Where I am, they even collate orders for colonies and the Pres makes a trip down to Florida each spring to bring back a flatbed of them."

gardening,3dstlf,cantbelieveilostit,5,Sun Jul 19 04:02:41 2015 UTC,It's called Love-in-a-mist or Love-in-the-mist. It's pretty in bud and in bloom and when it's a dried seed pod. :)

gardening,3dvz5x,GrandmaGos,0,Mon Jul 20 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"You have space in your yard for three 75-foot tall trees?  They are not very desirable shade trees for the home, which is why you don't find them in nurseries. They drop their leaves early, and leaf out late, so they're bare for 6 months of the year.  If you have a spot where you want to maximize winter sun, that's a plus, but otherwise they can look strange in your yard. ""What's wrong with your tree?"" ask the neighbors.  Also, many parts of the tree--leaves, seeds, and pulp--are highly toxic to people and to animals, so nobody wants a tree growing in their yard that the dog, or toddler, is going to chew on and die.  http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_gydi.pdf  So this would be why they're found in the arboretum and not at Walmart's garden center.  If you want them, plant them where they're going to go. I'd put a fence around them so they don't get mowed by accident."

gardening,3dw3sq,fixsomething,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"Since the yellowing occurs on the lower leaves and they're shriveling, I'm willing to bet that your plant is under-watered, although the yellowing can occur if you over-water as well. (Lower leaves yellow + wilting == under water; leaves yellowing overall + drooping == over water)  Stick your finger into the soil about one or two inches. If it feels dry or damp, water thoroughly until some water leaks out of the holes of the bottom (that tells you the soil's been saturated and the used-up nutrients are getting washed out). If you're only watering a little bit here and there when the top of the soil gets dry, the soil deep down probably isn't getting very moist, is full of used up nutrients, and needs a good flushing.  From your other posts, I reckon you're watering too frequently at too low of a volume, instead of watering thoroughly only when it starts to dry out."

gardening,3dwfv7,Jaminp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"This question is very difficult. Soil can vary greatly even in the same yard much less an entire area. If your soil is more clay water less, sandy soil water more. The thought is to water, wait 5 min, water, wait 5 min, water, done. When the top 3 inches or so gets dry, it's time to do the watering procedure again. This could take 1 day or 3 days or 5 days, depending on environmental changes. You usually want to try and catch it right as the leaves aren't as turgid and start to droop, then soak with your watering procedure. It's probably good to water by hand for a bit until you get the feel for how often and how much to water."

gardening,3duwc4,_Calochortus_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"East Bay gardener checking in, don't make my mistake! High temps can superheat the oil when it's applied to the plant, and both the oil and the soap can clog the leaf pores (stomata) that the plant ""breathes"" through.  When you know the weather's going to be 90+, apply the oil/Bronn's concoction to a test patch first! If your plant looks burned a day or two after the test patch, or you just want to be extra careful, try applying the mixture at night and rinsing it off in the mornings.  Remember, with neem oil you have to directly hit the bug to kill it, so spray the stems and undersides of the leaves too. You'll probably have to re-apply in the first week to kill off the adults, and possibly every week until they're at a manageable level. Best of luck!"

If it was just a nursery that sells trees, the best place would either the be county cooperative extension volunteers or an actual arborist. There are certified arborists, and then there are people who know a heck of a lot about trees. You might get lucky and find a tree expert, one who knows these oaks specifically, at the CE office; I believe both these oaks are native to Texas, but Texas is a big place, so they might have a more regional distribution. I don't know about Texas, but where I live it is common for growers to replace dead trees up to one year after purchase. It is generally not wise  to plant a 35 gallon tree in July, in full leaf, just because of the lower odds of survival, but if you are in that area that got all that rain earlier this year, it is understandable. Fall is really the best time to plant. If they were late winter, early spring planted, then it is possible the one tree just isn't going to make it. The few shoots on that one tree may mean things will be okay, but oaks that are destined to grow large and have long life spans, you really want to shoot for balanced limb placement."

That guy's response to what is going on with your tree is what they all say, and most of the time that is true, but if there is major branch die back, as in the scaffold that will help predict the tree's future canopy, I would call that a failure and request a replacement. Get a second opinion on your tree, so you will feel better about asking for a new tree. A good nursery will make it right for you. If you do that, try to get someone to help you take a look at the root ball of the new tree so you don't come home with another problem. p.s.  any nursery business who replaces a plant twice would have my loyal business forever."

But that's all it will do--keep it alive. If you want it to flower and fruit indoors, you'll need the kind of high-output grow lights that the hydroponics people and weed-growers use.  You can either pot up the entire plant before frost, in which case it will need a 5 gallon bucket with holes punched in the bottom, or you can cut off and root a sucker."

gardening,3duxy3,chardee_McPOYLE,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"Spend the time and effort to prepare your garden soil well. Lots of organic material and good drainage are two good basics. You may want to check with local gardeners, nurseries and state agricultural extension services for specific conditions and tips for your area. Keep things simple.  Grow some easy and fast growing crops to keep your six-year old's interest. Depending where you are things like lettuces, peas and radishes can be planted early in the Spring even in many colder areas. Tomatoes are very popular, of course,  they are fairly simple to grow, yield a lot of fruit and taste so much better than store bought. Cucumbers, squash and melons are fun for kids and will usually give you tons of fruit.  There are many available in bush varieties to help take advantage of small garden space."
gardening,3duxy3,le127,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"Mulch- it keeps water in the soil, keeps dirt (and fungal spores) off the leaves, makes life tougher on weeds, can contribute nutrition to the soil, and makes the garden nicer to walk around in. Straw, hay, wood chips, grass clippings, there's a lot of options.  Spacing- Don't get too greedy and make sure you have good spacing. You don't want you plants competing for nutrients too much and if you do have some disease issues, it's much easier to contain if you space well. Also, it's easier to harvest and get around. Consider growing vertically (pole/runner varieties) to help with spacing.  Plan- Some stuff shouldn't grow by each other, other things make good companions. Make sure you remember or keep a list/drawing of what you do, you'll want to rotate your crops (change where you plant them) every year or at least every couple years.   Seeds- If you start your garden from seeds, you'll have a lot more variety (and uniqueness). But of course this requires patience and a safe and sunny place for the seedlings. I grow a lot of tomatoes and try to plant ones that mature at different times so I have tomatoes over a longer time, there's things like that to consider.  It's very easy to start a lot of plants...but some things take a lot of time to harvest. Weeding can take forever (especially if you till the soil) too. So I always suggest start smaller and expand later. Get an idea if you even like the hobby (or if your kid retains an interest in it).  Gardening can be pretty easy and hobbyish, or you really try to grow a lot of what you eat. Either way, good luck and read lots!"

gardening,3duxy3,Iamnotyour_mother,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"Best tip I can give you is to keep your weeds under control.  When it's really hot or really rainy, they will grow like crazy!  It's SO much easier to keep them under control if you don't let them get the upper hand.  Once they go crazy, it becomes a really unpleasant task to get rid of them, and it can make the joy of gardening quite a bit less so.  Plant beans, plant radishes, if you have a potato with ""eyes"" growing on it in your kitchen, chop it up so that each eye is on its own piece of potato, and plant those.  Plant zucchini.  Plant eggplants and plant tomatoes.  Those are all pretty easy, tried and true plants, that are hard to screw up.  Plant some flowers, too.  Marigolds seem to be considered beneficial in the garden."

The fruit swells with the additional water and eventually bursts. You can avoid this by never letting the plant dry out too much, or, if it dries out anyway (especially hard to avoid if your plant is potted), giving it a light watering to bring it back to a happy medium, and then a day later coming in with a more thorough soak so that the fruit has time to adjust."

How many hours  a day of direct, unshaded, unfiltered-by-tree-leaves sun does the flowerbed get? I see dense shade from trees. For ""full sun"" flowers to do well, it has to get a minimum of 6 hours a day of the sun shining directly on the spot, unfiltered through tree leaves, which would mean that ""morning sun"" would need to entail the sun shining directly on it from sunrise to noon, and since it's evidently under trees, I'm not seeing how that's possible, because once the sun gets up to about the 10 a.m. position, it looks like the rays are going to start coming through tree leaves."

As far as pollinating lemon cucumbers go, I haven't had to do any hand pollination with them at all since the bees are working hard on them. I have noticed, however, that my lemon cucumbers are very slow to grow compared to my pickling cucumbers. In fact, it takes 1 lemon cucumber to grow to maturity in the time it takes to grow and pick 2-3 pollinated pickling cucumbers (which I grow on the same trellis as my lemon cucumbers). So, it might just take a couple weeks for the pollinated lemon cucumber to grow. Sorry I can't be of more help!

gardening,3dsb6k,bobbybrooks,37,Sat Jul 18 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"What /u/melleb said; it's a boy flower, it's meant to bloom and then fall off. When you get a girl flower it will be very obvious because of the miniature fruit at the base of the flower. Something like this. Then, if you don't have many pollinators about you will need to pollinate by hand. The easiest way to do that is to pull off a boy flower, remove its petals, and stick it in the girl flower. I like to talk dirty to them while I do it, but that's optional."
gardening,3dsb6k,jelliknight,12,Sun Jul 19 03:06:31 2015 UTC,"That looks like a squash (Gold Rush?) and those flowers fall of all the time, it's supposed to do that :-) Keep the soil moist and in a few weeks you can make a nice dinner!  Edit: Even found an explanation!  ""Squash plants are monoecious, meaning that they have both male and female blossoms that grow on the same plant. The female blossoms are the only ones that will eventually produce fruit. Early in the growing season, squash plants tend to produce more male blossoms than female blossoms. Since there are no female blossoms for the male plant to pollinate, the male blossoms simply fall off the vine. Your squash vine will produce more blossoms very shortly and these blossoms will be a more even mix of female and male blossoms. The male blossoms will still fall off the vine but the female blossoms will grow into lovely squash."""
gardening,3dsb6k,NorGu5,10,Sun Jul 19 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"Also, each squash blossom only blooms for one day (male or female). They open early in the morning and close up by afternoon.  I love collecting the male blossoms after they have served their purpose and making fried stuffed squash blossoms."
gardening,3dsb6k,fondor1,9,Sun Jul 19 01:57:47 2015 UTC,That's definitely a male flower. I find squashes tend to produce those first before also producing female flowers. You can distinguish the females because they have a small bulb at the flower base

Parsley is a biennial (A plant that takes 2 years or a wintering period to flower and go to seed) If your winters are not too extreme you could leave a plant or two depending on how many you have to spare to a low it to go to seed but you wont get much herb from it during that 2nd year so you will need to start a fresh batch anywho."

It's a big lake, ha, but we're at least kinda in the same area.)  You're doing the exact right thing, looking around, getting educated....but it really comes down to this...what do you want to grow? After you figure out what you want to grow, then you can figure out the logistics (soil, water, trellises, etc.). Some stuff you may have to grow indoors, but you can still do it.  I always recommend people start off on the smaller/easier side. Not because you aren't smart enough to figure it out, but there's a lot to learn and it can be a time consuming hobby.   Usually once you start though, the bug bites you hard. It's really satisfying to grow your own food or watch a flower/bush/tree mature.  And don't get discouraged if things don't go perfectly. Nature is so finicky. Even if you do the right things, things can go badly. I've been super ignorant and had amazing years too. It's challenging, but that's what makes it rewarding too.   Do you want to start with veggies? Will they be in containers? You're limited to fall stuff right now, but there's a lot of great stuff you can grow in the fall:  http://www.bhg.com/gardening/vegetable/vegetables/fall-vegetable-gardening/  Want to grow flowers?   http://www.flower-gardening-made-easy.com/beginner-gardening.html  There's always more to learn, no matter how long you garden.

If it's completely dry a couple inches down, you probably want to water.   One dryish day may make the plants droop a bit, but if you keep them wet all the time you'll have a whole new set of worse problems."

Use a spade around the edge of the cup to help remove the dirt. Gently break apart the soil until the root is exposed. These are young enough that the root network shouldn't be too big and you won't need to worry about tangling. Wherever you're going to plant them, make sure the soil is nice and moist, then poke a hole just deep and wide enough to cover the root. Insert the root and delicately fill in the empty space and pack it delicately to give it firm  support and keep it vertical.  I generally wouldn't transplant this young of a plant, but others here will have good advice for you."
gardening,3drplw,PM_ME_YOUR_PM_PHOTOS,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"I'd wait a lot longer before planting those. Once they get around 4-6 inches tall, I'd slowly introduce them to the outdoors for a few weeks (not putting them in direct light right away, protecting them bad weather, etc.).  Then you bury the tomato right up to the bottom leaves at least (some people bury 2/3rds of the plant...this encourages root development and makes it harder for the plant to get snapped in the early going by wind) in a pot or in the ground.   If you go with a pot, bigger is better. I'd go with at least a 5 gallon bucket.   You give them a good deep soaking right after the transplant then wait for the soil to dry out before you water again...then it's the waiting game. Maybe you put some mulch down to keep water in the soil and prevent the leaves from getting dirty (disease prevention)."

gardening,3dqfjz,futurezach,6,Sat Jul 18 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"The plants do not look very big, mine are normally double the size before they start pushing fruit so something could be wrong. My guesses are 1) To much watering 2) Nutrient deficiencies and or PH levels are out. Remember water will drain nutrients and/or make them less available.  Also the san marzano bush looks like it has early blight, cut the affected leaves off and put them in the bin then wash your hands."
gardening,3dqfjz,fordplumber,6,Sat Jul 18 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"The yellowing is over watering, everyone in toronto is having this problem right now. If you have mulch on top of them take the mulch off so the plant can dry up a bit. Other then that, try digging a trench around the tomato so the water drains properly. Hope this helps!"
gardening,3dqfjz,melledali,4,Sat Jul 18 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"Pic number 2 definitely has first signs of Early Blight.  Cut off the affected leaves and dispose of them in a trash bag.  Do not compost or mulch with said leaves.  Also trim off the leaves closest to the bottom.  EB spores live and overwinter in the soil, so removing those leaves will help deter them from splashing up onto the plant when it rains.  EB can infect plants from both the soil and the air, so you're not really getting rid of it... just trying to slow it down enough to get some ripe fruit.  Pic number 4 looks to have Septoria leaf spot.  I've never had it, but from what I have heard from others, it is treated in mostly the same way as EB.  From my understanding, it is not as destructive as EB.  Just cut off the affected foliage and toss it in the trash bag.  It appears that same plant is also suffering from some kind of physiological stress, which sometimes causes the leaves to curl inwards.  Could be over or under watering, lack of nutrients, or too hot/too cold.  Hard to say for sure.  Pic number 3 looks like the plant has been over-watered.  Maybe cut back on the watering and see if it improves.  Finally, pic number 1 is a Brandywine tomato?  They are notorious for not producing much and being difficult to set fruit under anything but the most ideal conditions.  I think a small fruit set is just a genetic condition of this variety.  If you are after the flavor of Brandywine, but you want a highly productive plant, try out the Brandy Boy hybrid sold by Burpee next year.  Very productive plant with the same great Brandywine flavor.  I would also recommend spacing your plants further apart next year.  Tomatoes need a lot of air circulation to discourage foliage diseases.  Try to water at the base of the plant as well, if you aren't already.  It will minimize moisture on the leaves, which, again, will help discourage diseases taking hold.    Many people also spray fungicide regularly (daconil and generic copper fungicides are what I see recommended pretty often), but they are generally only effective BEFORE diseases set in.  Perhaps something to think about next year, if you want to go that route.  Personally, I don't spray with fungicides, as I feel that my food is my medicine, but fungicides are absolutely the most effective method to keeping your plants disease-free.  Those of us who don't spray just have to manage the diseases as well as we can to get ripe fruit before the plants inevitably succumb to them.  Hope that helps.  EDIT: Just noticed that you said it's been raining like crazy in your area.  Not much you can do about that.  Hopefully you'll get a few sunny days to dry the soil out."

Find your pipes and sewer lines, first. You don't want to have to be digging under a beautiful tree to fix a domestic water line, or tearing out an expensive patio (it is better to use bricks or pavers in those areas, rather than a concrete slab). It is also nice to know what kind of pipes they are, galvanized, pvc, poly. If you have a septic system, find out where it is and where the leach lines go, and learn about septic systems. Do what bothers you the most first, like working with a low area that always collects water. Maybe it is the patio and pathways. This will always be a work in progress. As time goes by you will notice seasons, where the sun moves across the sky etc. You are likely to make many changes; what works now might not work 10 years from now- trees grow, trees die etc. Maybe the rose garden wasn't such a great idea, for example, so you tear it out and put something else there.

That creeping charlie will just go on forever.  Gaia's Garden gets into plants that do well under trees too.  It's a symbiotic arrangement kind of thing.   If it were me, I'd clean the place up so I could enjoy it, but not put in much money since it's a rental.  There's a lot of flowers that will self-sow and I think that might work for you along the driveway.  A little goes a long way kind of thing.

My other fave shrub is the phantom hydrangea - does well in full sun and provides color summer through fall."

You never allow plants to sit in excess water, as it will wick back up into the soil and you just overwatered them.  Always give it a minute to finish draining, then dump.  With yours, just take them out of the saucers, set them on the grass or the concrete, water until it comes out the bottom, give it a minute or two, pick up the pot, tip it a little sideways, and when it stops dripping put it back on its saucer.

The soil dries out so completely that the water runs straight through and out to the saucer.  The plant gets no water that way.  I know I could soak the planter, but instead I return to the plant after an hour and dump the water then.  Usually there's no water left and the plant has wicked it up.  So, the saucer can work, once you know the plants water preference and the soil in the pot.  As a side note, I am now mixing my own potting mix and it does better at not losing all the water to the saucer."

I've learnt a few things already:    Don't plant under a tree, even if it has no leaves, they'll grow back  Transplanting vegetables mid-season won't work.  Raised beds work but you need to have sun just like everyone said  Aphids really can be removed with some homemade spray  Gardening is a ton of work that sometimes doesn't pay off.  Best thing for me to use in raised beds is a combo of grass and sawdust"

For some things that aren't annuals (strawberries, for example) the popular advice is to not let the plant produce fruit for the first year so the plant will concentrate on making itself as strong as possible - then you get bigger, better strawberries from it the following year(s).  Over the years I've grown strawberries I've never really noticed a difference in production pulling blossoms first year or just letting the plants ""do their thing"".    TL;DR: if the plants are doing so poorly that they can't sustain themselves and produce... produce then you need to fix whatever the plants require that you're not providing."

There's a fair amount of wiggle room in ""how big you want them to be when you set them out"" and ""when do you want to set them out"", it's not carved in stone. You start them ""[in July sometime]"" and you set them out ""[towards the end of August]"".

I thought it died over the winter actually, but it sprung back. The plant is probably 3 feet tall, several main stalks, up to about an inch thick at the soil.   I had this same problem with tomatoes now that I am thinking back. My beefsteaks came out the size of cherries... But the same beds overproduced basil, arugula, and lettuce. I am almost positive its nutrients but I have no clue which to supplement.   This bed has just peppers and shallots in it right now. The shallots are the biggest I have ever seen, so that is good.

Also being in that type of warm zone can cause heat stress on a plant even if they enjoy the full sun causing them to just try to get their fruit out and seeded as quickly as possible, Maybe try draping them with some cheap deer netting next year to test out some shading.  As for nutrients if you arn't seeing any deficiency signals in the leaves the only suggestion I can think of is some more nitrogen and doing a 1tbls epsom salt to gallon of water mix and spraying down your pepper/tomato plants when they are starting to set fruit then again a few weeks later."

The panel and battery were WAY bigger than it needs to be. Total cost was around $450 all said and done which doesn't include the lumber or the yard of top soil for the garden itself. Plan on adding a bed or two every year. Panel is a 50 watt Renogy panel I picked up from Amazon.

gardening,3doxce,EssenceOfOat,2,Sat Jul 18 01:34:06 2015 UTC,"Down behind my house in the trees is a small area where I've been dumping grass clippings, branches, leaves and so on without much thought for a couple of years. Recently I've been getting more serious about vegetable gardening so I decided to go and dig the pile up and see if it was up to anything interesting. As you can see it's breaking things down, and attracting a healthy population of worms, but has a way to go.  I'd like to start a serious go at compost so I'm after some advice on what to do. My plan is to find some netting to contain a more coherent ""pile"" I can manage instead of scattering things all about. My questions are:   The pile has a lot of roots growing though it from the surrounding trees etc which makes it hard to dig in. Is there anything I can do about this or will regular turning etc basically take care of it? The usual advice talks about an even mix of green and dry brown matter. It's rare for me to have anything dry or brown as I'm in a mild, wet climate where everything is green even in winter. Would simply taking some of the green waste and letting it dry out separately before mixing it in fill this need? I also have a huge stack of cardboard and paper waste here which I read is good. Is printed stuff OK to add to the pile and is there anything I should watch out for? I think at the moment the ""pile"" is to scattered and contains too many big branches etc to be very effective. I'm aiming to bring it together, keep it to the smaller stuff, and start turning it regularly. Am I on the right track?   Thanks for you help :)"
gardening,3doxce,MsManifesto,3,Sat Jul 18 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"1.) Tree roots might cause some difficulty (I haven't had experience with them in the compost), but as far as the other roots go, once your pile starts heating up well and breaking down the material faster, most of those roots ought to break down as well. It's important to keep your pile hot if you compost a lot of weeds like I do.   2.) Brown and green do not refer to the color or dryness of the material, but rather, the carbon or nitrogen ratio. Grass is ""green,"" because it is high in nitrogen, even if it has dried out. I would try adding shredded news paper and cardboard (pizza boxes that you can't recycle are great for this!) to supplement brown matter.    3.) As far as I know, the only thing to avoid is glossy paper. So long as the ink is nontoxic, I'd assume it should be fine.  4.) I try to break up the big stuff gradually, about once a month or so, usually with a shovel. It'll break down eventually. Remember to sift your compost when you do finally apply it to the soil, and put the larger pieces back into your pile."

gardening,3dn03k,kenabashi,7,Fri Jul 17 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"Tomatoes need lots of sun.  So a shade planting isn't the best spot to begin with.  Likely your potted-tomato plant was a bit root-bound (where the roots get tangled because it outgrows its container) and when you replanted it, you disturbed the roots.  Move it somewhere sunny, give it lots of water, and it should bounce back.    We here at /r/gardening love to answer questions.  If you need advice, don't hesitate to ask.  And it's helpful if you include your location, and pictures of whatever you're having issues with.  Good luck!"
gardening,3dn03k,Destra,4,Fri Jul 17 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"If you want guaranteed success, get a big pot full of fresh potting soil, plant ONE tomato in it and give it a tomato cage. It needs full sun but also plenty of water (anytime it looks wilty, give it a good soak of water). But also make sure that the pot drains so it doesnt drown if you get a heavy downpour)."

Step two: amend your soil with organic matter so that next year you'll stand a better chance.  Step three: Do specific research about the types of plants you want to grow, and how to grow them in your area. At then end of the day, it's all about having a good growing medium and localized knowledge.

gardening,3dnpon,PrincessRosella,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"There are so many different kinds of salvia. If you bought it at a big box store, I am gonna assume it is a perennial kind since you do not provide the Latin name. If it is a perennial, it really is more of an in ground plant and will not take kindly to wintering indoors.   Also, perennials bloom once and then only sporadically for the rest of the season. Salvia - some kinds, who knows what you have - can take being cut back and rebloom.   As noted already, plant care tags provide only the most general info, so general as to be basically useless.   If is drooping, soak the pot. Let it get to ALLLLLLLMOST dry, then soak it again and so on throughout the summer. Once it sets seed, it will be DONE for the summer, so don't let it - keep it cut back.   Again, since it is a big box plant , it is probably root bound. If there is a mass of roots at the bottom, whack that right off, repot in a mixture of half potting soil, half fine vermiculite in a pot about an inch or so bigger than the one it is in now.  For further care instructions, should this survive and you get into the whole plant thing, it is also helpful to supply a basic location. You should know your zone as well.  If it is inside, and not on a balcony, don't expect much in terms of longevity."

gardening,3dmmty,GrandmaGos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"No. They need to be at least 6"" tall or so, with many sets of true leaves.

What's your frost date in the fall? Because these are so behind that you may not be able to beat your frost clock. Birdhouse gourds have to be allowed to ripen the gourd fully on the vine, and you may not have enough time.

gardening,3dntbv,ClearlyDense,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"The inescapable facts are:   Each watermelon plant needs about 32 square feet for sprawl. That's an entire 4x8 bed.   Full-size watermelons (i.e. not Sugar Baby) are so big that to trellis them, you need an extremely sturdy and large trellis, attached to posts or something similarly stout, set into the ground. A watermelon plant in a container needs at least a 3 to 4 gallon size bucket, and for full-size watermelons, I'd go with a 5 gallon bucket, same as for tomatoes. They need six (6) hours a day of full sun shining directly on them, unshaded, unfiltered through trees.   Those are the things you have to work around. Dogs can be chased out of the bed, rats aren't usually a problem unless your block is totally infested, as they much prefer people-food such as garbage, and slugs are easily dealt with via beer.

I would wait until the usual lilac pruning time, though, even though lilacs are tough. If you can, don't do it all at once. There should be lots of info; search 'how to rejuvenate lilacs' or something like that. The usual way is to cut a third of the stems down to the ground, then the following year another third, etc. so that bushes will not have to grow a few years to start flowering again. Mother Nature usually decides when and my lilacs get lopped/sawn down. This year we had a late April snow, and again, the lilacs were a mess; they had just started to be nice and flowery after a storm 5 years earlier. I have a dozen or so, and all stems had to get cut down, I didn't cut all of them to the ground, but shortened some of them. But really, it is pretty hard to ruin a lilac permanently, they are one of the least fussy plants on my property. I hardly notice them except for bloom time, or clean-up.The new growth won't flower next year, and probably not the following.

You do know that European grapes won't live in the southeast of the U.S. for more than a few years at most right? There are a number of pests that destroy them and European grapes are more susceptible to them than native species. Pierice's disease being the worst, no European varieties are immune to it and its endemic. As a consequence there is no European grape industry in the Southeast. Unless you are doing something no one else has done or are particularly lucky the endevour is doomed to failure.   There have been many attempts to raise them in the southeast and in generally all have failed, some parts of western N.C. being an exception. Research and commercial plantings focused on Muscudines and hybrids because the European species won't work.

gardening,3dl2j0,vincethepince,2,Fri Jul 17 03:28:06 2015 UTC,Is this the teddy bear variety?  It looks amazing.
gardening,3dl2j0,cakeeater808,2,Fri Jul 17 07:28:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not sure. I grew mammoth grey stripe and teddy bear sunflowers last year and saved the mammoth seeds and planted them. This one flowered at about 6 feet tall which is short for a mammoth sunflower leading me to believe it might be a cross between the two since the flower head also resembles a teddy bear sunflower. The other seeds I planted are well over 8 feet at the moment and haven't yet began to flower."

gardening,3dnecw,Bartisgod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could try groundcover, it would look better than mulch if you don't mind complicating mowing a bit. Some of my favorites are periwinkle, spiderwort, and yellow archangel, none of which really care if they're in the sun or the shade. Yellow archangel has a reputation for being very invasive, but I have a cultivar that, after 15 years, never gets taller than 1' and with which irises and hostas can still compete without problems. I don't know what it's called, but you could probably find it on Google."

They do however, readily reseed themselves.  I have several different varieties now that reseed every year.  I have to thin them out, actually, and either give them away or toss them.  They are so great to have around because they need so little attention, bloom constantly, and I love their smell too."

I've got some great marigold volunteers that pop up every year, but they only ever started reappearing after I started planting higher quality plants.  Not sure if quality has to do with them coming back or not, or really what made them higher quality (they were just more expensive, from a local farm store, and seemed to grow better and larger than the previous cheaper plants I had put in) but it seemed interesting to me."

Pretty sure you can look up the stamping online.   Tons of different ways to do compost. I got a geobin for Christmas about 3 years ago. Basically hard black plastic netting that forms a circle. You stake it in the ground and use whatever you want to cover the top.

We have citrus quarantines in place because of it. I would not be surprised to hear it had spread to SW TX. However, you will normally see leaf damage with the flies. You may also notice small flies around the plant. If you do spot leaf damage later on, or see an abundance of flies near the plant, contact your county extension immediately. They can give you great advice on treatment, and may provide you with additional resources to stop the spread of the insect.  Wasps can also cause similar damage, but not normally as extensively. It is impossible to tell you how to get rid of the bugs within knowing  which type of insect you have. For now, cut off all of the damaged fruit so that the trees put their energy to better use. Examine your tree for insects as best as you can. Check the undersides of the leaves for webbing or droppings."

Of course I could plant them all separately... but just curious if it could work all together... sigh I really need a bigger house).

gardening,3dlrep,ColonelBleepRescue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:46:20 2015 UTC,"That 600x300x300 container will fit your single cherry tomato plant. Even though cherry tomatoes produce small fruit, they still have a normal-sized root system, and they need a big pot.  There is another principle besides ""room for roots"" here.  Putting plants in their own individual pots allows you to tailor the watering, fertilizing, and light needs to each plant. Two different species of plant aren't always going to have the same needs for water and fertilizer. So it's gardening ""best practice"" to give each plant its own pot.  One exception is the planter filled with herbs or annual flowers such as geraniums, petunias, or French marigolds, because those are all similar, and have similar requirements.  The mint is going to quickly take over any container its in, crowding out the others and outcompeting them for water and nutrients.  Carrots need deep soil for their taproots, and don't compete well with other plants that have fibrous roots."

Not sure where you're located but many grow it as a very early spring crop or fall crop. If you're in a warm area that may be what's causing the abnormality.   Yellowing can also be a sign on too much direct light.
gardening,3dl8zu,moonpurr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:41 2015 UTC,"I was also going to mention the heat. Cauliflower starts off like a tiny little crown of cauliflower and then grows wider. Heat will stunt it though. I would try again in the fall. Also, when the crown gets big enough that it is peeking out from under the leaves, tie them together over the crown to prevent the sun from yellowing the crown."

Any that do survive this gauntlet will be mowed down along with their weedy companions, sometime in August or September.  I can think of better ways to spend ten bucks than by ripping a ten-spot into shreds and sprinkling the bits on a vacant lot, but YMMV."
gardening,3dkud8,GrandmaGos,5,Fri Jul 17 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"Cultivated, domestic flower seeds, as opposed to weed seeds, don't usually do well if they're tossed on hard, unprepared, weed-filled ground and expected to fend for themselves. Weeds can outcompete any garden seeds, hands-down.  Any that do somehow manage to grow will eventually be mowed flat as weeds later on this summer, either by the property owner or by the City.

gardening,3dk8xg,TwoHardCore,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"I'd think you could. Last year I accidentally grew tomatoes simply by dropping overripe/rotten tomatoes in the pot with the parent plant (intending to be a kind of fertiliser), and about 6 months later all these little volunteers were popping up. I didn't even bury them, just dropped the fruit in the pot where it rotted, and watering must've stirred the soil up enough to give the seeds a decent cover.  Since strawberry seeds tend to want to be planted quite shallow that's what I'd try. Every time you get an old rotten one in your punnet throw it into a specific pot and water it regularly like you would with any other seed.  I grew strawberries from seed a few years ago. They do grow pretty slowly but seemed to be much hardier grown from seed than all the times I bought strawberry seedlings from a shop and they died only days later. I did some reading at the time, apparently from seed they will take two years before they fruit, all the ones you buy as seedlings are either from runners or are a year old already. My from-seed strawberry grew pretty happily for many months (over a year I think) until I forgot to water it a few times in a row and it died. I live in the tropics so it was a long shot to begin with and I haven't tried since. If you're in the right climate I think it's definitely worth a shot. It's not like it's going to cost you much to have a go. Be patient, I'd give it at least a year from the first time fruit meets dirt because you don't really know how long it will take to rot and then germinate and then sprout.  Good luck! Please let us know how it goes (win or lose), and take lots of pictures!"

They are my favorite flower, but they do not grow here in Florida.  It's always a treat to go home when they are in bloom.  I did find a very fragrant bush, sweet almond verbena, that grows well here.  It was the first plant I put in when I bought my house.  It satisfies my need for a lovely smelling flower.  :-)"
gardening,3dkx51,Buffalodolphin,3,Fri Jul 17 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"That type of rose is called a hybrid tea, and YSK that they can be temperamental prima donnas.  Paging /u/roketgirl  the Rose Grower for cultivar recommendations.   While we're waiting, where are you located?  Zone only tells how cold your winters get, it doesn't tell climate."
gardening,3dkx51,GrandmaGos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"I'm located in the north eastern United States, around the Pennsylvania-New York border area. As far as being temperamental prima donnas, do you think I would run into a lot of difficulties as a person who has little experience with rose bushes? I've generally been pretty alright with plants in the past, but have never done much with roses before. (also thank you for the reply!)"
gardening,3dkx51,roketgirl,2,Fri Jul 17 04:28:06 2015 UTC,"Well hello hello!  Someone wants a rose?    Your best bet for a white classic hybrid tea is 'Pope John Paul'..  This one gets a lot of love for perfect form, great fragrance, very good disease resistance.  'Full Sail' is another good white, it can have some opening issues and spotting and the petals are a little leathery for my taste, but when it's good it's great.  Strongly fragrant but a bit cloying I think, very disease resistant.    Now here's the rub, both are on the shoulder of your zone, meaning a bad winter will kill them.  You can either protect them in fall, or pick a hardier rose.  Frau Karl Drushki is tougher and a very good rose in the garden, but not long stemmed.  Not really a cutting rose, no fragrance :(  If you wanted tougher still, 'Chorale' simply can't be killed.  The flowers are not very big though.  Let me know if there's anything else you want!"
gardening,3dkx51,GrandmaGos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:19:43 2015 UTC,"Hybrid tea roses have been selected for generations specifically for long stems suitable for cut flowers, and for those big, distinctive blooms--the pointed rosebud, followed by the classic ""rose"" shape. If you want roses for cutting, you want a hybrid tea.   Heirloom and oher types of roses may not have the long stem, is the thing. I have a pink climber that I love, but the flower stems are only 2"" long. There's no way you're getting that into a vase, you have to float the blossom in a bowl.  So because you're specifically wanting long stems for cut flowers, a hybrid tea is what you need, and you'll need to put up with its quirks.  The kinds of static that you'll get from a hybrid tea that you won't get from other kinds of roses are:  A. Winter tenderness, even in zones that aren't particularly cold in winter, as pointed out by Roketgirl.   Of the roses in your garden after a bad winter for your zone, the hybrid tea will be the worst winter-killed, and the most likely to be completely dead by June.   You can partially get around this by choosing a hybrid tea that is hardy to one (or even two) zones colder than you---if you're in zone 5, look for a hybrid tea rated for zone 3 or 4.    You can also plant your hybrid tea in a sheltered location, a micro-climate around your house. If I was going to do hybrid teas again, this time around I'd put them against the south or west wall of the garage, instead of out in the flowerbed.  And of course there are the various forms of winter protection: mulching, rose cones, burying in soil. However, with global warming, packing a rose into a rose cone in November is no longer the simple task it used to be, since if the weather warms, there can be too much humidity in the cone, so it's tricky. Dormant roses need the weather to get cold and then to stay cold, in order to be in a rose cone.  So anyway, this is something you'll need to work out if you're going to have them.  B. Hybrid teas tend to be smaller plants than other kinds of roses, especially if they're stuck in a flowerbed and then ignored, and to make only a few flowers at a time, sometimes only one at a time on a rose that is stuck in a flowerbed and then ignored, which is in contrast to the way that other kinds of roses will be covered in flowers all summer. So if you're going to want a lot of cut flowers every week to put in vases, you're going to need a lot of plants.   C.  Diseases and insects, especially Japanese beetles.  Some cultivars have been selected for disease resistance, so you definitely want to look for one of those.  A battery-powered DustBuster works well for the beetles, but with a small rose plant, the trick is to catch them before they've completely defoliated it, so vigilance is key.  D.  You won't get a lot of fragrance from many cultivars of hybrid tea, as that was one of the things that fell by the wayside when hybridizers started selecting for long stems and flower shape.  And actually, the classic 'American Beauty' rose, the ubiquitous florist's red rose for the big bouquet of a dozen roses, has no scent at all, so it's always amusing when you see someone being given a big bouquet of red roses and the first thing she does is plunge her nose into them and sniff gratefully, because you know she's smelling absolutely nothing at all.  There are hybrid teas out there that have been selected for fragrance, and many of them have won prizes for that, but you'll have to seek them out, you most likely won't find them at Home Depot or even at the local nursery.   E. Pruning.  A hybrid tea rose is not something that you set and forget. It's going to need maintenance. Pruning a hybrid tea is not as tricky as, say, pruning a grapevine, but it's definitely something that needs to be done. If you never prune it, you end up with a scraggly mess full of dead canes.  http://treesandshrubs.about.com/od/pruning/a/how-to-prune-hybrid-tea-roses.htm  F. Fertilizing. They do need this. If you never fertilize your rose, you won't get many flowers."
gardening,3dkx51,roketgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:07:15 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add, roses seem complicated, and they do need special care, but don't let that scare you.  Even a rote beginner can have amazing roses.  *fertilize *prune *disease and pest control * keep deer and rabbits off  That's it.  Don't be afraid of killing a hybrid tea.  They are meant to pump out the luscious flowers, not be in your garden forever. Dirty secret: public gardens and 'green thumb' rose growers replace their hybrid teas every few years."

gardening,3di8v4,SincererAlmond,5,Thu Jul 16 15:07:19 2015 UTC,Question: WTF do you do with all that basil? I have 2 plants and I'm of Italian descent and I still can't use it all.
gardening,3di8v4,mcampo84,10,Thu Jul 16 15:55:53 2015 UTC,I sold all of them except for three. I have 3 of them that I prune each month and I get a large amount off of each. I then dry it out and save it. That's what I fucking do with all of my basil

gardening,3di8v4,Tofinochris,3,Thu Jul 16 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"Cut them off, basil doesn't really bolt. They may start putting on flowers due to temperature, amount of water given, pot size etc... when mine start to put on flowers I prune them all back about half. My basil gets to be about the size of a large shrub. I have them in 12"" raised beds, so they don't feel stressed from lack of room for the roots."
gardening,3di8v4,SincererAlmond,3,Thu Jul 16 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"To add to this, clipping basil just makes it shrub out more. Clip it above a leaf pairing and new branches will come out. You don't need to let the plant grow then cut the whole thing down, it will keep producing pretty much until the cold comes if you keep pruning it."

gardening,3di8v4,SincererAlmond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"So having grown 40 basil plants, I'm going to consider you a basil expert.  I have two basil plants in medium sized pots. They look good & I just did a pruning & they're getting bushy. However, something is eating them and I can't figure out what it is. I've ruled out slugs (used Sluggo, still got eaten, no slime trails) and aphids (Dr. Bronner's solution, have not found any since). I've been wondering if it's caterpillars, but I haven't found any caterpillars on them. What else is a basil predator? I've come to the conclusion it must be something flying in, having dinner (happens at night), then flying away. Whatever it is will munch down the smaller leaves to the stem, then eat half of the bigger leaves from the outside in.   Last night whatever it was attacked only one pot, leaving the other unscathed. It's driving me bonkers."
gardening,3di8v4,AGhostLP,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"That is very interesting... I would suggest using Neem oil extract. You can pick this up at lowes or even order it online.

It lives up to its name.   As others have said, I would suspect its the excess rain, there could be some nutrient issues as well. I see the yellowish brown on the bottom leaves as the plants mature fairly often. On a side note, you should weed that pot! Lots of things in there that aren't basil."

Only thing to do is pull the plant the moment you see it, and maybe even the ones on both sides of it and get it out of there (unless you want to go the fungicide route, which I don't). Then make sure to wash your hands/tools before touching any other plants, I've accidentally contaminated others from removing plants with DM, then not going through and weeding/touching other plants.

Im in SoCal, so we have a year round growing season. My moms grove had an infestation of bamboo, yucca, and some type of 'indian tobacco' weed which year after year refused to die even though we would cut it down to the soil and remove the rhizomes as best we could. Someone mentioned we should put a tarp over the affected areas for a few months. Went to harbor freight and bough 20 or so of their cheapo tarps, placed them over the area once I hacked it back to the ground then left. Three months later, no signs of breaking the topsoil, removed tarps. Two years in, all areas where the tarps were have no signs of either bamboo or yucca but I still see patches of indian tobacco which I suspect propagate by seeds rather than rhizomes (which makes sense given how quickly they spread over large distances). I can live with that."

gardening,3diqjj,nurdburg,3,Thu Jul 16 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"I think its Verticillium Wilt  Verticillium Wilt What it looks like: Yellow blotches appear on the lower leaves. As the blotches spread, the veins in the leaves turn brown. After the leaves turn brown, they fall off. The disease progresses up the stem until the plant is stunted. What causes it: A fungus that lives in the soil, Verticilliurn albo-atrum, attacks the roots and travels up the xylem tubes with water. It then prevents the normal flow of water and nutrients to the leaves. What to do about it: Once plants are infected, there isn’t much you can do to treat Verticillium wilt. Rotate your crops, because the fungus can live for long periods in the soil and even live among weeds such as ragweed. Choosing wilt-resistant varieties to plant is the best way to prevent Verticillium wilt."

They just recently started flowering this past week, and I haven't seen any fruit yet - so you're not alone! :> I'm gonna give it just a bit and let it do its squashy thing.  Something odd that I have noticed on my yellow and acorn squash - some of the flowers have wilted and collapsed on themselves. I did some hand-pollination of my yellow squash last week and peeled open the flowers that had mushed in on itself and about three of them had bees trapped in them. :O I'm going to be keeping an eye on my acorn squash flowers in the same way - I don't want them to kill off my bee bros before the female flowers have a chance to set properly."

gardening,3dj4uk,Farm2Table,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"My winter squash haven't set any fruit yet.  No worries.  If no fruit by Aug 15, then I'd be concerned.  You may want to plant a few more seeds now near your existing plants; the plants new plants will start flowering quickly, and you'll have plenty of male flowers once your existing plants are producing predominantly female flowers.  Also, if you're concerned about setting fruit, get out in mid-morning if possible and hand-pollinate.  A stick or q-tip rubbed around inside the male flower and then inside a female flower works well.  Note that squash pollen loses potency pretty quickly during hot days, so it's best to do this in the AM.  FWIW, last year my butternuts and delicatas set fruit in early September that, while they didn't get large, ripened on the vine just fine.  I did protect the plants from early frosts, though.  Ones that set in August reached normal size at maturity."
gardening,3di0xq,Whammajamma2112,4,Thu Jul 16 13:01:37 2015 UTC,"Generally flowerbeds and garden beds tend to be 2 to 3 feet wide, not 8 feet wide, because that is the distance the average human being can reach into a bed from a kneeling position at the side. So I'd split up your area into two 4-foot beds if possible, as a 4-foot wide bed allows you to reach the center from either side.  if you're using an 8x8 square, you need to throw down some stepping stones in the center to stand on while you work with the center, to avoid standing directly on the soil, which compacts it and drives out the oxygen which the roots need."

Different tomato and pepper plants are a great place to start. Depending where you live, it may be a bit too late for those, even if you get full plants from the nursery. But what you can do is start a fall garden! Lettuces, spinach, radishes, carrots, garlic, onions, etc. Those are great for now!   But before getting those in the ground, I would definitely research companion gardening as well as check the farmer's almanac for your own area's planting season. Good luck to you!"

Those conditions certainly need to be taken into consideration.   I'm in a completely different climate, but have discovered the benefits of natives.  They really do perform better than the fancy/schmancy ornamentals.  Before this town started pushing the benefits of natives, I couldn't find them anywhere in stores either.   I also wanted to see them live before purchase.  Are you near an environmentally conscious area?  Often they'll have places with resources for natives.  Due to the drought, I'd be surprise if someone isn't advocating the use of natives.   Stores have a tendancy to stock what sells.  It doesn't necessarily mean that if you can't find it nearby, it won't do well.  But, if all else fails, plant that easier to find Japanese Maple.  I just did!

Go behind your local home improvement store a few times and you'll see carts/racks of the crappy looking, damaged plants. If its not a dried husk, you can save it. Bring them to customer service and ask about a significant discount. I've been given free plants many times.    Your winter will be starting soonish. I'm not too experienced with Fall planting, so you're kind of on your own with specifics.   If I were you, I'd take this half season and winter to plan and gather materials, especially if you want to keep it inexpensive. Decide what you want, where, and what it might take to make it thrive. Time is what you need to scour for materials if you're not willing to pay retail. And you'll only know what you need after you've got a general idea of what you want.   Rain Barrels can be constructed for less than $25 with some craigslist hunting. This will reduce your water bill significantly over time. You can find all kinds of stone, wood, or other materials for nearly free there, too. Look up to see if your city has compost/mulch for free, too. If you know where you want your beds, you might need to amend the soil and bagged stuff can add up really, really fast. Starting a compost pile is literally just piling things together. A few seasons and you'll have some great stuff.   Good luck."

I use it as a summer crop when preparing a bed for the next season. 1-2 crops of buckwheat then in late August I plant cowpeas. As they grow they fix Nitrogen from the air into the soil improving it. Winter temps will kill it, so early spring, as soon as daytime temps are in the 50's I till and plant rye.

gardening,3dhytn,Teh_MadHatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:40:21 2015 UTC,"You can adjust any soil to have any ph and any nutrient level.  When gardening, usually the invariants of your soil will be things like drainage, porosity, water retention, and consistency."
gardening,3dhytn,WhyThinkThat__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:36 2015 UTC,"so how would you go about getting/making soil with these characteristics:    Parameter Value    PH range 5.2 to 7.00   Organic matter 1.5 to 4.0%   Magnesium 35 lbs. per acre, minimum   Phosphorus (P2O5) 75 lbs. per acre, minimum   Potassium (K2O) 85 lbs. per acre, minimum   Soluble salts 500 ppm   Clay 10 to 25%   Silt 30 to 55%   Sand 35 to 60%"
gardening,3dhytn,GrandmaGos,2,Thu Jul 16 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"The information for the pH is a relatively cheap over-the-counter soil test.  The information for proportion of clay, silt, sand, and organic matter is a relatively simple ""mason jar"" test for soil composition; google it.  However, the information for Mg, P, K, and salts comes only from a fairly expensive laboratory test that usually has to be sent away, and that can take several weeks to get back. For this reason, soils that are sold in bags at the nursery and garden centers aren't normally labeled with their precise chemical composition, because ain't nobody got time for that.  So I can't imagine that your advisor seriously wants you to obtain soils of this precise profile. It's not a chemistry exam, it's just a horticulture project. Reading between the lines, what he wants is decent soil for your garden. He doesn't want you to just go down to Walmart and buy a couple bags of stuff labeled ""garden soil"", he wants you to make sure you get The Right Stuff.  There are numerous brown or black crumbly substances bagged and sold as ""soil"", but not all of them are actual ""soil"", as in dirt, as in the stuff in the ground that plants grow in.  Some of them are clay subsoil from construction. Some of them are composted tree bark. And some of them are mainly peat moss.  So we make up soil for our gardens and potted plants according to what we want to grow, and what the existing soil is like.  So before we can help you further to get the right soil, we need more information about your project.    What are you planting? What is your garden layout? What exactly constitutes a ""rain garden"" in this project?  Is this in the ground or in containers?  If you're planting in the ground, where are you located?  What kind of club is this?  What is the ultimate goal of the garden? Things to eat?  A tool to teach about horticulture and gardening? Or just a hands-on project to keep students busy?"
gardening,3dhytn,GrandmaGos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your help, I've sent a quick question off to my advisor regarding the chemical composition. He had been getting those figures from the New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual (specifically appedix H ), and I believe it's aimed at a bit more lofty projects than our own.   While I'm not entirely sure what we're planting, I assume it's a combination of small shrubs and flowers, along with some more ground cover-type plants. The layout as I vaguely remember it from the plans we were shown in meetings 2 months ago is roughly a square surrounding a storm drain to a river, with a bench thrown in there haphazardly. It's an area that floods often when rain comes, as it is between a road and a substantial hill. The project's purpose is to help reduce flooding in the area, serve as an area for local high school kids to come visit as an environmental themed field trip, and promote environmental awareness.  We're located in NY, in the 6a zone (thanks for that handy map in the sidebar). We're a college club with the purpose of environmental awareness and to be entirely honest this is the largest project we've done in living memory, we even got a state grant. Everything is being held up and confused by the fact we're about a dozen college kids, half of us helping the other half getting in the way, some of us at school over the summer and some not, and we recently transitioned into new positions into the club.  I think that's all the information you asked for."
gardening,3dhytn,leanik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"a square surrounding a storm drain to a river, with a bench thrown in there haphazardly. It's an area that floods often when rain comes, as it is between a road and a substantial hill.   The project's purpose is to help reduce flooding in the area,    Ok. If it's the low ground next to or surrounding a storm drain, there's no way that planting anything there is going to somehow reduce flooding. The storm drain is the low spot for its entire catchment area, and it's specifically designed to fill up with water as all the water in the catchment area flows downhill towards it, and thus into the stormwater system.  So planting anything there and expecting it to somehow reduce flooding is like expecting the landscaping in front of this McDs to somehow reduce the flood. Excess water is what it is. You can channel it, divert it, or dam it, but plants can't do any of these, only concrete and bricks.  So either I'm not understanding your project, or else you're not understanding it, or else someone else is not understanding it, or is explaining it poorly, or has a set of peculiar and unrealistic expectations.  If, for the sake of discussion, we abandon the ""must reduce flooding"" requirement, we're still apparently left with ""the low ground around a storm drain"". The only thing you can plant there that will survive repeated flooding is lawn grass.  Landscaping--shrubs, perennials, annuals--may survive a single historic inundation, but a storm drain is specifically sited and constructed to function every time there's a storm, hence the name.  When the rain comes down in a tropical monsoon even though you live in Illinois and not in Mumbai, when someone opens a tap up in the sky and water pours down in a toad-strangling gullywasher, the storm drains all over the city immediately begin to perform their function, which is to channel that water and send it elsewhere.  They're expected to be regularly filled with floods of water, and so is the ground around them.  I'm surprised that there's a bench there.  How long has it been there?   Post pictures."
gardening,3dhytn,thrips47,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:59 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly specific. Like ""having a BS is soil science"" specific. Seriously, what level of schooling is the club associated with?  However, if you're purchasing the soil you can often find soil profiles about the product you're buying on company websites, although I doubt you will find information this specific without calling someone. You can also test these things for yourself if you have access to the soil of interest. A a soil composition test would tell you the sand, clay, and silt ratios and you can purchase pH test kit relatively cheaply but they are really only so useful.  Depending on your age and level of expertise, this level of specificity regarding soil is a little ridiculous. You may want to ask the project lead how to get started on this."
gardening,3dhytn,WhyThinkThat__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information, the links were very helpful. We're a college club that received a grant from the state so we're taking it somewhat seriously, though this level of soil composition specificity might be a bit overboard."
gardening,3dhytn,thrips47,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:46:20 2015 UTC,"I am not quite sure what you mean by 'invariant', but the physical properties of soil drainage and percolation, porosity, water retention and consistency can all be changed by modification and amending, in any soil. It is hard to find a soil, or mix, for a specific pH or nutrient content, unless the lot is labeled with a specific content; 'peat moss' has a pH range due to several factors, but individual lots can be tested for an exact value. This 'rain garden' soil  would have to be tested first, and then adjusted, as you said. It is easier to shoot for a range of values, which for plants is usually good enough, and still would need testing. For example, the amount needed raise soil pH with limestone or to lower it with sulfur is greatly determined by soil texture, and takes time. Specialty mixes could have a range of values, not a specific value, for example, unless the lot is labeled with a specific value."

I have planted them on my porches in various apartments for years and always kept the seeds. The past couple years I've had great big vines on my front covered porch area- probably 30 of 40 individual plants, I don't thin them, it's survival of the fittest out there, and whenever a bunch of pods are ready, I fill up a coffee cup of seeds (probably about a 1/4 a cup or so a week, I don't keep track) and toss them in and around the compost pile and let the hardy ones fight to the death.   Last August I pulled all the glories in the front down and tossed them when they started getting heat damaged and scraggly looking. I didn't care how the ones in the back looked so I left them to their own devices. I can only think of two vines that I know of that are definitely two years old and still blooming. They're both purple. Come to think of it, I think all the compost blooms are purple, even though the seeds came from purple, pink, and blue flowers."

gardening,3ddcut,blooheeler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"They don't transplant well. Wait until the blooms fall off and the little green knot at the base of the flower (receptacle that holds the ovule) swells and turns brown and is very dry and brittle to the touch- you can crumble them open in your fingers and each pod holds a couple three or four seeds. If you leave them alone, they open themselves and the seeds drop to the ground. You've got about a three day window from when they are ready for harvesting before they open themselves up and drop. The seeds should be dark- if they are still light or greenish they aren't ready for planting.   Before you plant, soak them overnight in lukewarm water. They will swell and some might jumpstart germination. You don't have to bury them under the soil at all. They're ferocious."

Mine was the result of me being too lazy to throw out a pumpkin that sat on the edge of the flowerbed on my front porch. In March we cut down a big chinaberry tree in the yard (invasive and UGLY bastards) and rather than scoop up the deflated pumpkin, I brilliantly rolled a big piece of stump over it to use as a natural stand for a flower pot.

gardening,3dhr4t,crankypants15,4,Thu Jul 16 11:11:24 2015 UTC,"when I water it's via drip irrigation   How deeply are you soaking the soil? How are you determining how long to run the water? Purely by seat-of-the-pants clock time (""That feels like it's been long enough""), or are you digging down to see how far down the water is going?   Plants that are continually watered shallowly will develop all their roots up where the water is, at the top layer of soil, and will not send down deep roots.  Thus when hot, dry weather hits, they are peculiarly vulnerable to drought, since they don't have deep roots that could be tapping into moisture far below, but are completely dependent on rapidly evaporating water in the shallow top surface soil.  Sunflowers in particular have a growth habit that calls for a deep tap root, but if it's dry ""down there"", they may not develop the taproot sufficiently for July in zone 5a."

gardening,3ddd6t,cbsx01,3,Wed Jul 15 11:37:59 2015 UTC,"Good job. But, they do tend to prefer a tighter pot. In the wild, they grow in pockets of rich soil on a hillside of limestone outcroppings, so generally they go in a 4"" to 4.5"" pot. Next time you repot it in about 6 months, downsize it, it will lessen the chance of root rot due to too much wet soil.  Also, plastic pots keep their roots at the desireabl ""evenly moist"" stage."
gardening,3ddd6t,GrandmaGos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:48:51 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I was going to ask if I should re-pot in a larger one.
gardening,3ddd6t,GrandmaGos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:47 2015 UTC,"Heh.   In a pot of soil, the space between the soil particles is normally filled with air. Plants rely on this to live, as their roots require oxygen.  When you water the soil, the water moves downward and fills up the empty spaces between the soil particles with water, driving out the air. Gravity moves most of the water on downwards and out of the pot's drainage hole, but some of the water molecules remain behind. The plant roots use this water to live, gradually using it up and thus leaving the spaces filled with air again.  Plants are accustomed to this cycle of wet and dry.  When you have a large volume of soil that doesn't have any plant roots growing in it or utilizing the water molecules, the water just sits there in the empty spaces between the particles. Some of it is evaporated off the soil's surface into the air, thus gradually drawing water molecules up from the lower layers after it.   But overall, a pot full of soil without any plant roots in it is going to stay wet longer than soil with roots in it, because there aren't any roots using the water molecules for anything, so they just sit there.  There are anaerobic rot bacteria present at all times in the soil, and when the soil goes anaerobic due to being filled with water, the rot bacteria proliferate.  If there are plant roots in this soil, the plant comes down with root rot.  If there aren't any plant roots in this soil, the wet soil simply sits there, incubating anaerobic bacteria, and eventually starts to smell funny. It may even grow algae or moss on the surface. We say that it has ""gone sour"".  African violets are particularly susceptible to root rot and to the effects of ""sour soil"". An African violet that's overpotted in a pot too big for it will not be a happy camper in the long term.   So every 6 months to a year or so, as they begin to look like they are outgrowing their pot, instead of potting them up, you pot them down. You break it all down--remove the outer ring of leaves, remove 1/3 to 1/2 the root ball, and put it back into its original 4"" to 4.5"" pot with some fresh soil at the bottom of the pot.  They like tight pots, and being kept evenly moist but not overwatered. Stick your finger in the pot and check.  On a windowsill, fertilize them once a month with any ordinary Miracle-Gro type fertilizer, diluted to 1/4 strength, used in place of their regular watering."

gardening,3dftzc,naturehattrick,7,Wed Jul 15 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot or answers to this question.   For me personally I select and save seeds from healthy vigorous plants that show disease resistance and in some instances are slow to bolt.   An example is some heirloom cilantro I've been growing for 6 generations now. I've selected the plants that performed well in extreme temps and more sun.   I might choose to save seeds from plants that thrived during periods of drought. Or on the other end of the scale I may begin watching plants to save seeds from in our rainy season as this years rains are extreme.   If I have a amazingly tasty heirloom tomato plant that was above normal in production and lived long, I would save those seeds also.   Perhaps your Dads thinking is to save seed from a fast producer? If you're located in a short growing season climate zone, that'd be beneficial."

gardening,3dftzc,GrandmaGos,3,Wed Jul 15 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"""Earlier is best"" is a holdover from the days when your survival depended on your veg. If you didn't save seeds from your veg in a timely manner, and the season went all to hell later in the summer and fall, like it started raining non-stop, then you had no veg the following year, and worst case scenario, you starved. A lot of families even as recently as the 1930s depended a lot on what they could grow in the backyard.  So you tended to grab your seeds as soon as you could.  The first fruits that veg produces are frequently small, because the plant itself is a little immature, and it just doesn't have the carbs to spare yet for making big fruit.  Under the principle of ""save the best"", then, you'd want to pass on these, and wait for later fruits produced by a fully mature tomato or melon plant working at the top of its powers."

Well, your options are Roundup Brush Killer in the hose-end sprayer, or sheer grunt labor with loppers, machete, brush hook, possibly a brush hog, shovel, and pry bar.  Even after Roundup kills it, you'll still have to dig out the roots, there is unfortunately no way around that.  Spray drift will carry Roundup on the breeze to neighboring plantings and damage or kill it, so either warn your neighbors and have them cover their landscaping with bedsheets, or else use a paintbrush to paint the Roundup on everything.  If you're not doing herbicide, ""get the easy stuff out first"".  Use a brushhog to mow as much of it as you can, then fine-tune it with hand tools."

First average frost and last average frost are also handy.  Anything that has a growing season just a bit shorter than from now to your first average frost you could do now.  Last average date will give you an idea when you can start in the spring.  Your dad probably did a garden in the early spring and another that he started pretty close to now that went into the fall/winter.  Match what he did when he did and you'll be on your way.

gardening,3debun,blooheeler,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"It always amazes me that folks recommend sevin dust. Did I read that correctly? You are also advocating its use on dogs?  Perhaps you'd be interested in checking out this article that links to many studies done proving the dangers of sevin/carbaryl.   From the article-   The insecticide sevin/ carbaryl, however, is striking because its use has been associated with such a large number of health problems. From acute toxicity, suppression of immune system functions, and behavioral problems to cancer, genetic damage, and reproductive problems in both males and females, carbaryl's adverse effects span an enormous range.  Carbaryl is a neurotoxic carbamate insecticide. In humans, acute effects of carbaryl exposure include headaches, nausea, incoordination, and difficulty breathing. Carbaryl can cause a variety of behavioral effects, some of which are relatively long-term. It also suppresses several functions of the immune system. Men exposed to carbaryl have more abnormal sperm and lower sperm counts than unexposed men. In female laboratory animals, exposure to carbaryl has caused a variety of reproductive problems, including birth defects in beagle dogs and increased rate of miscarriages in monkeys. Exposure to carbaryl has been associated with a higher incidence of the cancer non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in farmers and brain cancer in children.  Carbaryl is toxic to a wide variety of living things not considered pests, including beneficial arthropods, birds, fish, earthworms, plants, and bacteria. In almost all cases, carbaryl is both acutely toxic and causes a variety of sublethal effects.  http://www.healthyworld.org/sevin.html  OP the methods I use to control treehoppers include spraying with a mixture of water, dish soap and neem oil. I also put on a pair of rubber gloves and hand squish the larvae and adult insects. If I find a branch with lots of larvae I typically prune that branch from the plant. I also use diatomaceous earth and sprinkle a bit of that on the insects.   Start inspecting other plants for signs of the terribly annoying insects, they can spread quickly especially if you're in an area with high humidity. Just stay diligent and continue squishing both the adults and the larvae. Keep spraying and pruning as needed. Best of luck!"
gardening,3debun,moonpurr,0,Wed Jul 15 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. I recommended Sevin dust. Yes, I dust my dogs. It works perfectly fine and it's one of the listed uses on the label of the container. Our dogs are quite healthy and our vet is aware of our use of it and has no negative opinion.   So yeah. I fucking love sevin dust. It keeps fleas off of my pets and punches aphids in the face.   Edit to say the animal testing of carbaryl is conducted by administering oral doses up to a cup a day to the animal over a thirty day period. I do not suggest anyone feed their dog a cup of Sevin dust. Additionally, hater than post a propoganda site, here is the EPA's evaluation of carbaryl.  Additionally, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has not classified carbaryl as to its carcinogenicity for humans due to inadequate animal studies. The EPA considers carbaryl “likely to be carcinogenic in humans” due to increased tumor production in mice. Your anecdote about farmers is, merely that, an anecdote.   Don't fear monger people with hyperbolic nonsense."

The article to which you referred very specifically referenced non-lymphoma cancer occurring more often in farmers, without a source, rendering it anecdotal.   Used as directed, Sevin dust is not harmful to plants, animals, or humans. Therefore, yes, your response of bold, italicized hysteria about it equating to cancerous poison is hyperbolic propoganda.   You need to slow your roll and take a deep, pesticide-free breath.   *edit: I stand corrected, the farmer mention did have a cite. I followed it to the parent source which concluded that there was no strong consistent evidence found for an association between exposure to DDT and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

They never quite stood strong on their own, but they produced beautiful, fat ears.   The thing you'll discover about ""real"" gardens is that generally, they are pretty damn ugly. I'm convinced Pinterest has never actually seen a real garden. Plants grow crooked, sometimes they get huge and attack the other plants, sometimes they have freaky, curled up leaves and wonky stems, sometimes your fruits and veggies are deformed and discolored and look like grocery store rejects.

gardening,3ddbc8,GrandmaGos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:56 2015 UTC,"Fish emulsion is the remains of food fish after the meat and guts have been stripped for fish meal, and the oil has been removed for fish oil. So it's basically the bones, and stray bits of flesh, skin, and guts. Some processors use whole trash fish.  It's steamed or cooked to kill bacteria so it doesn't continue to spoil in the bottle, and then evaporated to concentrate it. It's not fermented or aged AFAIK.  The homemade ""make your own fish emulsion"" recipes on the Web are adding sugars and microbes, apparently in an effort to produce some kind of composted product, which eliminates the characteristic odor of classic fish emulsion. It doesn't increase the nutrients AFAIK.  Where I am, fish is more expensive than beef.  I'd question why you'd even want to. Fish emulsion doesn't smell that bad once diluted correctly and applied to the soil.  It seems like a lot of trouble and expense for very little return, other than possibly the motive of preserving fish stocks in the wild, but the fish meal industry is so well-entrenched that I don't think that making your own fish emulsion at  home is going to have much of an impact."

I'm not interested in making a business or anything, it's just that I can't find fish emulsion in my area for some reason and don't want to pay the shipping costs for a bottle if I can make some myself. I enjoy DIY type stuff like this as well so it's not a huge deal on that front. In my area fresh fish is pretty cheap. I could get all the fish heads I wanted for free probably. I could also get a couple of whole fish for pretty cheap. I also have a pressure cooker if that could be used in any way. I also have a Kitchen Aid glass blender I use just for garden projects (grinding up egg shells mostly.)"

gardening,3d7de8,ShadowRancher,3,Tue Jul 14 19:13:57 2015 UTC,The waterfall/running water should prevent mosquitoes.  They thrive in stagnant water.
gardening,3d7de8,snowmantackler,18,Tue Jul 14 08:59:34 2015 UTC,"Unless water flow is like a fast-moving stream, it won't be strong enough to dislodge any larvae.  So yeah he won't get mosquitos in the waterfall, but he'll get it in the pond proper.  I have a koi pond with a big pump that circulates the entire volume in one hour, and still got a ton of mosquitos until I stocked it with fish.  That's because the water will be quite calm just a short distance away from the waterfall and pump.  Put a few goldfishes in it.  They'll eat all larvae in 2~3 days."

gardening,3d7de8,Albator_H,6,Tue Jul 14 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of details that I forgot to include with the photos. There is a 1200 gallon pump that sits on the bottom of the pond, with a 1"" hose that runs along the right side up to the rocks where the waterfall is. The pump gets 120v from an outlet on the outside of the house, and runs continuously.   There is a 12""x12"" filter attached to the pump that I clean out every couple of weeks (more during the spring and summer, less during fall and winter). All of the plants are completely self-sustaining in that we do not give them any supplements/food. We simply cut back all of the growth below the water line before the pond freezes in the winter. In the spring, everything comes back in full-force on its own; it's really quite amazing to see! We do not have any fish but are considering them down the road."
gardening,3d7de8,grumpy_xer,8,Tue Jul 14 10:41:01 2015 UTC,"This is a very nice set-up! just make sure you do your research again once you get fish...Ive seen people toss in a bunch of 10cent goldfish and destroy their pond with the added bioload (algae blooms and such) and you need to take winter quarters into account since you freeze over. Personally I think either 3 ranchu goldfish (or other fancies) or a school of mollies would look great in here, and give you some free plant fertilizer."
gardening,3d7de8,Scorpionwins23,7,Tue Jul 14 14:17:02 2015 UTC,Nice job. I build those for a living and one thing I found out that if you put fish in the pond it will attract the Blue Heron. They love feeding in stocked ponds. If that happens you can put a net over the top to keep them out.

gardening,3dchkn,ranoutofbacon,0,Wed Jul 15 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"It creates filtered light to your human eyes, but to a plant's photosynthesizing cells, it might as well be total darkness.  Your human eyes perceive light differently from a plant. What looks like a brightly lit living room, full of ambient light to read a book by, can be too dark to sustain even a low-light plant.   Just because you may be able to dimly perceive light through the mesh doesn't mean that plants under it will be able to photosynthesize. It's much better to go with a lighter weight and more porous fabric, and moreover one that is white, which allows reflected light to bounce around under the cloth, and so contribute to photosynthesis."
gardening,3dchkn,GrandmaGos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"You can use an ordinary white bedsheet, or a chunk of cheap muslin from Jo-Ann Fabrics, or what is known as ""summerweight"" polyester floating row cover material.  You want to be cautious when buying things labeled ""shade cloth"", because some of them are heavyweight fabrics designed for patio umbrellas, awnings, and suchlike, and produce total darkness, not filtered light.    Prop it up on a couple of broomsticks or tent poles so that it offers shade during the hottest part of the afternoon, usually from 1 pm to about 5 pm.  Your tomatoes, unless they're transplants, should be fine without any shade cloth. They should be mulched with about 4"" of some kind of mulch, but unless temps are approaching the low 100s daily, they'll be fine. And even then, they don't die---they just sulk and refuse to make any more tomatoes, as heat over 95F hinders pollination. They're tropical vines, heat in the 90s is no biggie.

Are you seeing effects of heat, like wilting during the day but perking up overnight? I'm not seeing any reason for shade cloth (or drastic pruning) unless you get a upper 90s/lower 100s heat wave and your plants are visibly suffering. But I wouldn't expect any of them to have a problem with normal heat. We grow them here in normal Midwestern heat with no shade cloth."

They are in the mint family and therefore easy peasy to root from cuttings. Experiment with wintering them over - even if you only end up with a crappy piece of one come spring, it will still give you a lovely plant once it gets outside. Forget even trying to winter over the varieties which bolt early."

gardening,3dbln7,shillyshally,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"I'm in PA as well, also worked at a nursery for a few years after I retired. The red one surprised the hell out of me! I am expecting it to be an early bolter, though, and no way it will keep over the winter.  If you are growing a coleus and a branch looks different, cut it off - that's how you start a new line, from cuttings anyway. That's the reason there are so many different kinds.   After I dropped out of grad school I came back to Philly in the early 70s. This was the very beginning of the gardening movement. We used to go to Otts in Schwenksville and buy coleus but they were nowhere near as nice as what is available now. For some reason, everyone was selling crotons back then and they are impossible - crotons and fittonias. We did hundreds of avacados (as did my Mom) and sweet potato vines.   Very gratifying to see so many people into it now.   I love this sub. I am sending columbine seeds to a redditor in Czechoslovakia. Will probably send some other stuff as well. I have so many seeds and am cutting back (figuratively and literally) on annuals. I will keep growing them on the side of the house and near the patio. I like bright colors. A wise gardener said you can grow almost any color combo but always have blue - it ties the room together, so to speak. I favor Victoria salvia for that.

gardening,3db8b9,euripidez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:08:00 2015 UTC,Actually it is. I work in the commercial greenhouse industry & its pretty common to remove the first fruit. But it depends on the current light levels & how good a price you can get for them since they are early versus pruning them off and getting a slightly (very slightly) higher yield later. pruning to 3 heads or stems is also the norm to improve yield & managability of the plants. but its cultivar dependend (chili's are treated much differently for example)

gardening,3dcsga,xerithakyn,2,Wed Jul 15 06:53:03 2015 UTC,"It is not a fertilizer, it is merely water that contains some starch. The starch, like any other starch (bread, pasta, flour) does not give up its utilizable nutrients until after it has been composted. And you don't add carbohydrate food items to a compost pile, unless you're doing bokashi composting.  So no. If you're in a drought, you can pour it on the ground as water, but it won't add any nutrients until it's broken down."
gardening,3dcsga,GrandmaGos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:11:04 2015 UTC,"I see.  I wonder how long it takes for the starch to decompose though.

In the future, you probably want to grow determinates in a pot.  I've grown indeterminates in a 5 foot cage and they grew over the top, folded down, and were nearly touching the ground by the end of the season.

I seriously cried (of course, I'm pregnant, so it doesn't take much).  What seems to be working so far is one of the plug-in sonic rodent repellents.  They don't get great reviews online, and I've read that the rodents can get used to them and so the noise won't scare them anymore, but I went from seeing one run out of the garden four nights in a row to not seeing it since.  I have it on an extension cord right in the middle of my tomatoes.  I'm still pretty skeptical that it will keep them away in the long term, but so far, so good.  The other thing you could try is pick the tomatoes before they are completely ripe on the vine.  They will ripen up inside on the counter and still taste great."

gardening,3dchij,barakami,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"No. It only works with plants in the nightshade family (i.e. potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, etc).  Even professional grafters oftentimes fail when grafting a tomato to another tomato; the failure rate increases 100-fold when it's cross-species grafting. You would need many many many many plants to experiment with and to see which ones survive.  Basil is in the mint family. Even if basil were in the nightshade family, you would not be able to graft a tomato on it or vice versa. Why? Because all plants in the mint family have a square stem. Go up to a basil plant and feel its stem with your index finger and your thumb and you will find that the stem has 4 edges. A tomato plant stem is round. Even if you got stems that were equal in diameter, their shape would NEVER allow a successful graft."
gardening,3dchij,GrandmaGos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:42:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can graft a tomato onto a potato because they're both nightshades. I assumed you were wanting to graft a tomato onto another tomato because you didn't specify what your ultimate goal was, other than to ""graft tomatoes"".  There's a fair amount of information out there on grafting vegetables, if this is something you wanted to get into."

gardening,3dac3s,pobox209rsf,2,Tue Jul 14 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"Make sure they are staked or caged.  Pruning the suckers is a good idea.  You want to balance the amount of fruit vs leaves so that there are enough leaves to produce food for the plant that makes the fruit grow but not to be constantly putting energy into producing new vegetation.  If you have not been pinching the suckers off, you can pinch the ends of the suckers to stop them from growing and let them keep producing food for the rest of the plant.  http://www.tomatodirt.com/pruning-tomato.html  You can google for other sources on pruning.  edit:  I also assume these are indeterminate plants - determinate tomatoes need very little pruning - just removal of the lower stems to keep them from getting splashed is usually enough."

gardening,3daaji,emteereddit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"I posted a week or so ago looking for help as to what was causing my tomatoes to get all these brown spots on the leaves (   https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/3cmcz8/whats_happening_to_my_tomatoes/).  The most likely answer I got was that it was thrips.  If you look closely at this video, you can see a small bug crawling around on the leaves...does it look like thrips to you?  I've also added a couple more pictures of the leaves, as it has progressed some.  http://imgur.com/a/ikwMW"
gardening,3daaji,Destra,2,Tue Jul 14 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"I hope you find out!  I'm unfamiliar with thrips as they're not native to my area.  You can also go over to /r/whatsthisbug, and ask if the damage/footage looks like thrips.  Good luck!"

gardening,3dc1ce,julesandthebigun,2,Wed Jul 15 02:30:53 2015 UTC,Plus make sure you cut off the end that had the blossom on it. That end has enzymes in it that will make the pickles lose their crunch.

gardening,3dc1ce,jjaassmmiinnee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:24:21 2015 UTC,"Pickling a slicing cucumber may result in soft pickles. As long as you won't miss the crunch too much, go ahead.   Try a recipe where you soak the pickles in brine overnight, then pack into jars and cover with pickle juice, then waterbath. You don't want to use a recipe that cooks the pickles before canning."
