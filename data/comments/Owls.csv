Owls,3dr2ck,nxpnsv,3,Sat Jul 18 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"I would suggest acrylic paint. Prime it first with a white or grey, then you can choose the colours you prefer and make the pupils not so.... Goofy?"

Owls,3dr2ck,invisiblette,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe replace them with glass or acrylic eyes made for stuffed animals/taxidermy?  Here's the results I got on glasseyes.com when searching for 'owl eyes' http://www.glasseyes.com/cgi-bin/search.pl?terms=owl+eyes  There are tons of other places online to choose from however. Take your pick. When you apply them I would recommend offsetting them so the pupils point in the same direction. They could be strategically angled on top of a blob of hot glue. It wouldn't be perfect but it would prevent him from being wall- eyed. Having same size pupils will also help.   Good luck! It's got a nice paint job."
Owls,3dr2ck,Originalluff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple, just paint the pupils bigger. Enamel paint would probably work best, you can buy small pots of it at model stores. Alternatively there's acrylic."

Owls,3b6tlv,KingOfSomeThings,7,Fri Jun 26 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"I have no experience in handling owls, but I do have some interesting facts!  Owls have tube-shaped eyes which can't actually turn in their sockets. This is why they've evolved heads that can turn so far! They are also extremely farsighted!  Their strongest sense is hearing. Their earholes are actually in slightly different spots on each side of their head, which allows them to pinpoint sounds by noticing the minute difference in time between when they hear it in either ear! Some owls facial discs have evolved to kind of ""guide"" sound towards their ears.  Finally, they are ridiculously silent when flying. Check out this video where super sensitive microphones compares the sounds of different birds and a barn owl flying! They have special feathers at the end of their wings which reduce sound!"
Owls,3b6tlv,Kanthes,8,Fri Jun 26 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"Owls aren't clever or wise, but that's because they don't need to be. They get their food from hunting (which they're incredible at), not by being clever.   Contrary to what /u/Just_Tayb said, the owls I work with at a wildlife sanctuary do not like being pet, including the one that we've had since it was an owlet. At best, the owls we have tolerate people, but pretty much all of our owls clack angrily at us when we approach, and some have even attacked. So from my experience, they do not like socializing and they are not loyal. They like their food more than they like you. I saw one PBS documentary where a family raised a couple barn owls from hatching, and one wound up not coming back after a flight. This is pretty common with domesticated birds of prey, but whether it was killed in flight or just did not want to return, I can't say.   See /u/Just_Tayb's comment for the largest owl question.  Their beaks are pretty strong, a large enough owl could easily break your finger. I had one Barred Owl bite me through a rather thick leather glove and it still left a decent mark (and hurt)."
Owls,3b6tlv,mongrale,3,Fri Jun 26 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't pet owls.  They are wild animals and it probably terrifies them to be touched in that way."
Owls,3b6tlv,tyrannustyrannus,2,Fri Jun 26 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Owls aren't clever or wise   It is of significance to point out that many ancient communities once thought owls were a symbol of knowledge. They were thought to be as wise as the gods!  However, I am jumping back very far in time. In ancient Greece, owls were often seen as a symbol of good fortune. The idea of the 'wise old owl' may have come into being from the association of the Little Owl with the Greek goddess of wisdom, Athene.  n contrast, the Romans saw owls as omens of impending disaster. Hearing the hoot of an owl indicated an imminent death, it is thought that the deaths of many famous Romans was predicted by the hoot of an owl, including Julius Caesar, Augustus & Agrippa. While the Greeks believed that sight of an owl predicted victory for their armies, the Romans saw it as a sign of defeat. They believed that a dream of an owl could be an omen of shipwreck for sailors & of being robbed. To ward off the evil caused by an owl, it was believed that the offending owl should be killed & nailed to the door of the affected house.  Beliefs on owls varied between ancient American Indian tribes. Some tribes viewed owls as harbingers of sickness & death. Other tribes saw them as protective spirits, others believed them to be the souls of living or recently departed people & should be treated with respect. Some tribes even saw the owls as earthly incarnations of their gods, the Hopis believed the Burrowing Owl to be their god of the dead. The Inuit explain the flat face & short beak of owls, in the story of a beautiful young girl who was magically changed into an owl with a long beak, as an owl, she became frightened & flew into the wall of her house & flattened her face & beak. Some tribes referred to death as ""crossing the owls bridge"".  Some people believed that owls were particular bad to children, in Malaya it was believed that owls ate new-born babies, the Swahili believed that owls brought sickness to children, in Arabia it was believed that owls were evil spirits that carried children off in the night.  Some people believed that owls had magic powers, in Arabia it was thought that each female Owl laid two eggs - one with the power to make hair fall out, the other with the power to restore it. In Algeria, it was believed that if the right eye of an Eagle Owl was placed in the hand of a sleeping woman, that she would tell everything you wanted to know (now that is stretching the imagination too far).  British beliefs about owls include the Welsh belief that if a owl is heard amongst houses then an unmarried girl has lost her virginity. Another Welsh belief is that if a pregnant woman hears an owl, her child will be blessed. In Yorkshire owl broth is believed to cure whooping cough, amongst other things (see entries for Barn Owl & Little Owl). Because of its ability to turns its head so far & its habit of watching things intently, it was believed that you could get an owl to effectively wring its own neck by walking in circles around it.  While there are many cultures that believe the owl to be bad (in Cameroon, it has no name, it is only referred to as ""the bird that makes you afraid""), there are others that believe owls to be good. In Babylon, owl amulets were used to protect pregnant women. In the Lorraine region of France, owls are believed to help spinsters find husbands. In Romania, it is said that the souls of repentant sinners fly to heaven as Snowy Owls."
Owls,3b6tlv,SuperBreakfast,2,Sat Jun 27 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"Owls are never a pet. So as far 'domestic' owls go, there really is no such thing. It may live a house, but don't mistake that for liking people.   Some owls preen each other, so the head scratches can sort of stimulate that, and owls that are used to people may let you do that and seem to enjoy it, but they will never seek that. They tolerate.  As the others have said, they are not really clever at all. They are so incredibly stealthy that they don't need to be smart. Just wait for food, grab food, survive."
Owls,3b6tlv,Sparred4Life,4,Sat Jun 27 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"Owls are incredibly dumb, considering they're a symbol of wisdom throughout the world. Tiny brains will do that to you, though.  I have yet to find an owl that doesn't like being pet, wild or otherwise. A biologist might want to chime in with a particular reason, but the owls I've banded have calmed down significantly after a few head rubs.  Owls are essentially flying wild/feral cats. They act about the same in a domestic setting that a cat born and raised in the wild would. Basically, owls aren't pets, as much as everyone here would like them to be.  The largest owl in terms of length is the Great Grey owl, but in weight I believe that honor goes to the Eurasian eagle-owl. The Great Gray will grow to be an average of 28 inches long (72 cm) for females and 26 inches (67 cm) for males. The Eurasian eagle-owl is only slightly shorter than that.  I don't have strength measurements, but they do have the capability of tearing off bits of meat from larger prey with their beak. Normally they just swallow their prey whole, though."
Owls,3b46kv,Trypanosoma,7,Thu Jun 25 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"If you're in the US, you should know that it is technically illegal under the North American Migratory Bird Act to possess that feather if it is from a native species. It's unlikely to be enforced but you should put it away if you're ever likely to encounter someone from the US Fish and Wildlife Service."

Owls,3b46kv,grottohopper,2,Fri Jun 26 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"It's a law that fulfills an interesting purpose right now, because it was so effective when it was passed. Native bird feathers fell massively out of style because the non-protected birds could easily fill the gap and now the law mostly only effects hunters by prohibiting harming these birds, and patrons of nature who find dead birds or naturally shed feathers."

I found a Great Horned owl in the middle of the road about ten years ago and wanted to make something awesome with the feathers, so I picked it up (thinking at five AM it couldn't have been there long). Well, turns out those feathers do NOT come out easily and there were beetles, so I had to ditch this thing quick but it still seemed like such a waste. I noticed I was two miles away from a wildlife sanctuary and drove straight over. At the reception desk I told the lady I had probably the worst present she was going to get all day, and she was like ""No wait, let me call Jim! He's going to be thrilled!"" Apparently Jim studies the birds for their weight, overall health, and taxidermy potential, and he was indeed exceptionally happy that I brought him a dead owl absurdly early in the morning. Totally made his day."

Owls,39sz8s,slowest_hour,13,Sun Jun 14 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"This Eagle Owl is in fact nursing those little chicks.  Quite funny, eh?  Because it is imprinted on humans, it doesn't accept an other owl as a mate and, as a result, cannot breed.  Unfortunately, she became psychologically unhappy with not being able to raise chicks.  In order to solve this problem, they came up with the idea of letting her incubate fertilized chicken eggs.  Initially, they were afraid that the owl would eat the newly hatched chicks, but things turned out well.  This all happened in Germany.  In Saarburg, to be precise.  Here is the corresponding video.  The narration is in German, unfortunately.  The dead chick she has in her beak later in the video is not her own, btw.  She wants to feed it to 'her' chicks, but doesn't understand that they are little chicken, and not owl chicks."

It is legal in some countries, and I'm sure there are people with pet owls who are able to care for them correctly, but they are still wild animals with wild instincts and they are not adapted to living with humans. I'm on mobile so I'll try to remember to add the link later, but if you google ""owls as pets"" you'll find the International Owl Center's list of reasons that owls don't make good pets.   If you have a chance to work with owls (in rehabilitation, or for education, etc) I do highly recommend it. I train education ambassador owls and it's so much fun, definitely a challenge and it involves a lot of gross things, but absolutely the coolest thing I've ever done. Rehabilitation is a great experience too! Owls are really awesome animals to interact with, just not as pets. :)"

I recently put in some time at the local Owl Conservatory. They are something special, that's for sure!  It is of importance you noted they scared other birds away-- they surely do hold true to their title of raptor/bird of prey! It may be of more significance to note that the owls themselves may be having fun listening to the other birds flee in terror!

The most interesting times are how the public reacts. One day, some parents brought their 9 year old daughter and her friends. I was about to feed one of our red tailed hawks some mice. We don't feed them live food, but the mice were whole. I warned the parents that it would be gory, but they were enthusiastic about wanting the kids to see it. When the hawk disemboweled the first mouse carcass, the kids started screaming, naturally. And didn't stop. You could probably hear them for miles. It was hilarious.   This is the same red tailed hawk, btw. http://i.imgur.com/yRWyKX9.jpg   I often take her for walks to the same waterfront as the barred owl in this submission.

Owls,3797am,Anastasia0519,75,Mon May 25 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"FYI to everyone talking about emergency vets: owls can actually dilate/contract their pupils independently. This happens normally and is not necessarily a sign of brain trauma.  However since this individual was caught in a cage and might be stressed, a visit to the vet is probably still a good idea!"

Owls,36d8es,TheSithMaster,13,Mon May 18 13:34:58 2015 UTC,"For those wondering, it's a Screech Owl.  A little back story: Found him on the side of the road on a biking trip at noon, which was odd. Wasn't moving and had his eyes closed. Brought him home and contacted our local Wildlife Center. They had us drive him over. They're suspecting he had a head injury because his eyes were closed and he wasn't moving much - but within the hour we dropped him off he was more active and started opening his eyes back up. Probably knocked his head against a passing car. The center we left him at seemed top notch so he is in good hands."
Owls,36d8es,Pongpianskul,4,Mon May 18 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"Well done, OP. I've brought to rehabilitation centers and usually I was given the option to learn of their fate or not via mail. I wanted to know."
Owls,36d8es,Metallica964,6,Mon May 18 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"I wanted to know too, so they gave us its ID number and said we could give them a call in July. They're also going to give us a call if/when it is released back into the wild.   We were actually asked where it was found so that they could release it back where it was found."
Owls,36d8es,krynnmeridia,1 point,Mon May 18 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Aw, poor thing. He's so lucky that you found him. Just a question out of curiosity tho, how did you bring him with you? I never encountered an injured bird before."
Owls,36d8es,Sindja,2,Tue May 19 10:34:46 2015 UTC,"My Dad actually picked him up (hands wrapped around either side of it's body). It didn't even try to do anything, barely reacted to getting picked up. Then we just laid him down in my Dads hat, until further down the road we were able to ask someone for a bag so there was a little more room.   It's important to make sure there's no way for them to hurt themselves, especially their wings."
Owls,36d8es,Sindja,4,Tue May 19 11:25:36 2015 UTC,"Aww, tiny floofball!"
Owls,36d8es,CykoMelody,4,Mon May 18 16:25:25 2015 UTC,omg he's adorable.  Thank you for being awesome and taking him there :)
Owls,36d8es,invisiblette,4,Mon May 18 16:30:37 2015 UTC,It was really out of the question to keep it - we had to take him somewhere where he could be looked at by professionals and it had to be quick.   Growing up with an absolute love for birds of prey it was quite fascinating seeing an owl in the wild. But loving an animal means doing what's best for it.
Owls,36d8es,tlacomixle,2,Tue May 19 02:36:34 2015 UTC,Totally!  I grew up behind a vet that would treat wildlife.  They'd give us kids tours sometimes and explain what they did.  It gave me a healthy respect for animals along with teaching me that wild animals aren't and shouldn't be pets.    It's sad how many people would just leave them there though :(
Owls,36d8es,invisiblette,2,Tue May 19 03:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really sad. There were at least 10 people who biked past this owl as well as a countless number of cars - but no one bothered to do anything to help."
Owls,36d8es,ewhetstone,3,Tue May 19 04:01:31 2015 UTC,Shoulda dropped him off at my house.

Owls,35jv4f,Kanthes,1 point,Mon May 11 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"I really want an owl, always look derpy, cute or evil. Would make a great addition to my menagerie of 5 dogs, 2-8 barn cats, and 23 horses. Oh, and the 3 legged opossum (Awesome Possum) I leave food out for.   But illegal in the US and would be a pain in the ass, but I have a ""special"" owl that lives in my tree near my window, he hoots in the morning around 05:30 every day."

Owls,35jv4f,Kanthes,5,Mon May 11 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"Own a smallish ranch, live on it too. I can't ride as much as I used to due to repeated back injuries so I have had tons of free time, space and while I don't actually have to work anymore if I didn't want to I am by no means throw money away wealthy, have to keep a budget but I make some exceptions for my animals care and wellbeing when it comes to budget and find ways to cope (Did you know you can sell horse shit? and pet health insuarnace is invaluable) And the barn cats I don't actually feed, they come and go and I give them names such as <color> Cat, or Floofy Cat or combinations of. Only one that has stuck around is Spooky Cat who gets a special name because he somehow gets into the house no matter what I do and tends to pop up just behind me (Like on the island behind me as I am getting in the fridge.) I think he is in league with one of my horses to kill me.   I've never even seen him after like 3 years of him living in the tree, I pinpointed by sound and walking around a few mornings. Sat out on my deck with a rifle scope (not attached to a gun) twice to try to see him but never could. Might have to try again one of these mornings."

Through a mix of inheritance, living the most Spartan lifestyle possible in the Army to save, business loan from the military and family land) And from 14 to... hell last year I dated only equestrians which built be up a hell of a contact list since I stay in contact with exes. It was my dream job since I was little (I was first on a horse at around 6 months old with my grandpa)   Problem with the dream job was getting hurt too much after just a few years to do the part I love most, riding. Now I mostly sign checks for my couple of employees, give some lessons, and talk to overly entitled asshole parents who want to board their kid's horses here.   Also gives me some opportunity for helping though, Have a girl here whose family can no longer afford to board here or really afford the horse at all so I let her work part time and take it out of her wages. That horse is her whole life and has been since she was 12 (I don't take it out)"

Owls,35jv4f,Kanthes,2,Mon May 11 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"Heh, I refuse to board for some parents. Might cost money but I am not being responsible or made feel bad because your little idiot can't listen and doesn't understand that a horse can easily kill them.   Had a couple bring in their kid once, he must of been about 13. He kept yelling behind the horses, they were putting ears back and stamping so I yelled something like ""Hey hey hey, stop that they're getting irritated"" so his parents lay into me to not raise my voice to their child and do I know who they are blah blah. Then a loud yell and a bunch of crying, sure enough the little obnoxious bastard got kicked. They yelled at me the entire time 'till the ambulance came because I didn't stop it from happening. Just a broken arm but no way in hell am I taking in kids or parents like that.  I will meet with the rider, horse and parent (if applicable) before I allow your horse to stay on my property. No stupid kids, no stupid parents, no horses that endanger my staff."
