If there are any additional questions not covered by the guide, feel free to leave a comment. As always, I hope the guide helps, even if just a little bit. :)"
archeage,3e30zw,Workaholico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"could i ask if the copper steamfish have any skills, and what they are?"
archeage,3e30zw,Workaholico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:50 2015 UTC,"Since submarine skills are dependent on the armor they equip (For example, you can't use a regular submarine's Radar skill until you equip a Sonar armor equipment), then I'm assuming the Copper Steamfish Submarine has no skills since it can't equip armor.  Going off the ArcheAgeDatabase entry of the Copper Steamfish Submarine, you can see the skills listed there are the same as other Steamfish Submarine, but they all require something to be equipped to use the skill. This means the no-armor Copper Steamfish Submarine cannot utilize any of those skills.  However, since there hasn't been enough time on PTS to get enough tokens for the Copper Steamfish Submarine, I cannot back up that answer with in-game proof or screenshots."
archeage,3e30zw,Workaholico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:57 2015 UTC,when you find out if there is skills or not could you please inform me /u/Elaeagnifolia ?
archeage,3e30zw,Workaholico,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I used the 12 tokens I had to get screenshots of the Toasty Reclined Sun Lounger on PTS since I wanted to confirm the visual differences between it and the Crest Reclined Sun Lounger. By the time I get enough tokens for the Copper Steamfish Submarine on PTS, it will be a day before people on the Live servers get them.  But just for you and for the sake of answers, I'll go on PTS when I get home tonight and run through the quests on all my characters to see if I'm lucky enough to open one straight from the box. I'll definitely get back to you if I find out. :)"
archeage,3e30zw,Workaholico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks buddy, because if it still have that breathing device is good enough for me, but if it do not have the breathing device, a cyanfin with the breathing device of my clipper can be better choice"
archeage,3e30zw,vannatten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"Slightly unrelated, but have you done the quests to get the UBD (Underwater Breathing Device)? It's an item you keep in your inventory that you can use to breathe underwater for 10 minutes with a 20 minute recharge time. It's much better than having to summon your clipper and waiting for your breathing device to charge every single time since it's right in your inventory.  If you look closely in the screenshots in the guide, you can see that I'm using one since I did the quests on PTS a couple months back. If you do a lot of underwater, naval stuff, I highly recommend you get one. :)  Here's a link to a guide (Note. In the guide, it tells you to make a sextant. I didn't make one and just got as close as possible on the map to where it looked like they were to find the ghost.): http://www.dpsvip.com/archeage/news/473--best-way-to-get-the-underwater-breathing-device-easy-with-archeage-sextan"
archeage,3e30zw,malabella,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:17 2015 UTC,so.... the only thing that makes the submarines useful is the torpedo .-.
archeage,3e30zw,Zarfaraway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"That's the only thing unique about regular submarines compared to Cyanfin. Oxygen Tank would be useful if you plan on carrying trade packs because you can't use a UBD at the same time as a trade pack, but I'd rather just use Dahuta's Breath instead of investing in a sub.  Tailfin/Tail/Boost I think makes the speed faster than Cyanfin, but still not worth 250 Gilda IMO. Sonar...not a fan. Stuff usually renders on my screen at 100m. Air Cannon knockback...eh...."
archeage,3e30zw,Zarfaraway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:55 2015 UTC,maybe i can use air canon knockback as a small dropback xD hahahahaha so the subs are not useful
archeage,3e30zw,vQsv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"That's actually really upsetting to hear that these won't have any skills. I would have loved to see if subs are worth getting since the super-nerf back when patch 1.0/1.2 hit Alpha.   But then again, if these free subs had missiles and sonar, I'm not sure anyone would actually invest in a Gilda star submarine."
archeage,3e30zw,Powerism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:53 2015 UTC,This guide is wonderful! Please continue to make great guides like this for all events :)
archeage,3e30zw,Workaholico,3,Tue Jul 21 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"Easy event, easy quests, easy life, terrible prizes. I personally wouldn't bother with this event, as the best prize is a submarine. Submarines are only good when equipped, their equipment is the potent part of them. Having an extremely slow underwater mount isn't really useful, especially with many of us already having a cyanfin. Its up to you, it may be you just want to collect the submarine since its easy enough, which I understand, or maybe you really like furniture. If that applies to you, then go ahead, I'm sure you'll be pleased. Otherwise, meh."
archeage,3e30zw,ATFanatic,2,Tue Jul 21 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree, but I'll still probably end up getting the submarine because collectible item and then probably spending the rest of the tokens on the 200 labor potions because free labor is free labor.  Otherwise, maybe the previous events spoiled us, but the prizes this time around feel underwhelming compared to previous events.  Anyway, thanks for the comment Zaron buddy. :)"

It's dumb to get upset over something you know will happen every few weeks.

Duration   This contest starts Thursday, May 28 and ends Saturday, June 27 at 11:59 PM PDT (GMT-7), at which point we will no longer accept contest entries. The contest results will be published about a week after the end of the contest."
archeage,3e25s2,voodoona,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:49:27 2015 UTC,Well.... I like the archeage reddit... don't get me wrong.    BUT......  The Screenshot Contest is exactly Trion having a hand in the Pocket.  They are literally giving them a prize worth a dollar amount.  This is known as a Sponsorship.  (Even though no one has called it that)    I'm not saying it's a really bad thing.  I'm not saying it's a good thing either.  But it is a sponsorship.  A prize give-away is certainly better than Trion paying the mods to push their product.
archeage,3e25s2,4_jacks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"How exactly is the contest a show of Trion having a hand in anyone's pocket? Trion is literally giving away $150 worth of crap to the AA player community.  I would call it more of a ""promotion"" rather than ""sponsorship,"" given the connotations.  (edit: not trying to be an asshole lol)"
archeage,3e25s2,donnerstreik,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough Question.   ""Having a hand in someone's Pocket"" is kinda vague, I don't know how others use the term, but to me it's visually like slipping someone a bribe, in their pocket.  (I tried to google it, but between Alanis Morrisette lyrics and holding someone's pocket in Jail, didn't turn up much.) I don't always mean it as a ""Bribe"", but also like ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"".    Sponsorship is a near perfect term. It is when party A financially backs an event by party B.  They are two different groups, and group A doesn't control the event at all.  That is exactly what's happening here. None of the reddit moderators work for Trion, no one from Trion is having any control in this contest, but Trion is sponsoring the prize financially.  (You could argue it doesn't cost them anything, cause it's all digital, but it's basically equivalent to a prize of $150)  Even when Chevy gives away a $20,000 car, it doesn't cost them $20,000, it only cost them $10,000 (or whatever) to manufacture the car.    Trion is literally giving away $150 worth of crap to the AA player community.   Are they? Or is Trion giving /r/archeage $150 of crap and /r/archeage is turning around and giving the same $150 of crap to the users of /r/archeage (not the whole AA player community)   Once again I'm not saying any of these are a bad thing.  I'm not saying that /r/archeage is in cahoots with Trion or whatever. But this is clearly a sponsorship, which IMO is Trion having a hand in /r/archeage's pocket.   Sorry for the long post."

archeage,3e3zvk,WyzeThawt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"get in a guild that does things you like if not alreadly  death wardens are interesting... as they go off in different directions. are you more heals an support - then stone cloth armor and shield/1hand club, focusing on melee dps - then leather armor and shield/1hand dps weapon, more surviveability - usually plate with shield/1hand, but only on servers with high melee or ranged populations. the armor type and optimal variation of it all depend on your play style of the class.   first focus on getting money. set a goal a reach for it i.e. 200g per day or 1.5k each week, etc. something you can actually achieve. start earning and saving.  if you dont already craft gear then dont start. gear crafting is a gamble and there are much better ways to spend your LP and make more money to just buy what you need.  auroria gear is probably your quickest and cheapest option for buyable gear but i believe you must be lvl 50 to equip it. its just a bit under Epherium level gear and most pieces should be between 50-400g each. at higher regrade levels they arent too bad for the price. remember there is 3 different sets for each of the 3 armor types and each gives a class specific buff to a single move. i would recommend this if you are low on money and the time to play to earn money.  obsidian is an option but becomes expensive at T4-5. I also dont know your goals for you play style so i cant really recommend your exact route.  for ""free"" gear, GHA sets are just above Magnificent quality (set bonuses are usually really good tho) and then move to serpentis which is roughly epherium level as well but better set bouns over auroria gear. only thig is these will take most likely a couple weeks to run the dungeons enought to get the drop and win the roll on each piece you need.  honor point dailies are great to do and stock up on for when you are ready to gem your gear. i doubt you have the money to for crafting higher tier armor as it gets expensive really quick and the RNG nature of it means you may end up with something worthless to you or anyone else exc."

The worry that you have, about servers not lasting long is justified, but it won't be caused by the population, but by ArcheAge mechanics (or rather the presence of Cash Shop). Those who have spare dollars spending on the new server will create same gap between beginners and old players as before, and despite hundreds of new players migrating from old servers and ""quitters"" rejoining to have the Fresh Start game will cool down after 1-2 months to the same state as before.  What you are not noticing, with creating new Character disconnected from other Auction Houses is the fact that Labor Points/Loyalty Tokens/Cash Shop Credits are Account Wide.  I currently have 1083 Loyalty Tokens, and nothing will stop me to create new char at Day 0, purchasing Celestial Pegasus at the first second and rushing in front of anyone or even flying through the air as I please (You thought anyone can reach Solis Headlands faster than me? As lvl 1 Harani I just fly through the Mahadevi straight to the place where I need my house to be placed).  I think that patch 1.7C will add this ""Daily Flask"" that turns Labor Potions into Bounded No-cooldown-potions exactly for the reason so that players can prepare for the Rat Race that will occur when new server will go live.  Anyone wishing of ""catching up to the top"" while starting on new server is a dreamer, because if you plan to join the game at the opening day, you will be already months too late.  To visualize how important Labor can be: someone who can drink insane amounts of Labor Potions without cooldown will be able to reach level 50 by just standing in Starting Area and processing Logs into Lumber obtained from [Majestic Trees] and Raw Stones into Stone Bricks obtained from [Mining Drills] (available to buy at the Cash Shop for 300 credits each), planted on [Lunar Scarecrow Farms] (available to buy at the Cash Shop for 2,000 credits each).  Once I listed all those points, it feels kinda sad how big advantage Cash Shop gives (it's not even big, it's enormous)."

Even with everything you mentioned however, I think the new server is going to be a lot of fun. The whales will still have an advantage of course, but in the early stages of the game it should still be a ton of fun.  Everyone will need stabilizers, so the oceans will be filled with people which for me is the funnest part of the game, ocean PVP.    There won't be any Mythics around dominating people either, at least for a while, so PVP is going to be alot more balanced.

On top of this, there is a new rift in diamond shores/golden shores that is adding gear equal to tier 4 obsidian in so everyone will have extremely strong weapons and armors from the start.

This is going to be in korean, but here is a link to the currency dropped from the rift: http://archeagedatabase.net/kr/item/38093/  If you go to the first tab, that's the quests that gives you the tokens, the second tab is the items craftable with those tokens.  The gear isn't very specialized in terms of stats, but it is practically free tier 4 obsidian stats so I expect questing players to get literally steamrolled. It seems like it was patched to be stuck at heroic, but on Kooncoon's stream, at the beginning of the new server this armor and weapons were regradeable.

""an alliance will dominate abyssal attack and become extremely powerful"" Eventually probably, but at the beginning there seemed to be alot more competition.  It seems that over time competing entities either die off or merge together to lessen the competition, but in the beginning I predict there will be tons of different groups trying to make a name for themselves.  ""On top of this, there is a new rift in diamond shores/golden shores that is adding gear equal to tier 4 obsidian""  Do you have a link for this?  If you don't know the specifics of this it's impossible to say what the effects will be.  1 tier 4 obsidian once  a day won't really make much of a difference, but 50 of them sure would."
archeage,3e2nrd,Elaeagnifolia,5,Tue Jul 21 15:10:13 2015 UTC,"Stupid prices in terms of cheap. What you have to remember is, inflation is going to hit quick if they make no changes to ArcheAge currently because of new events like Abyssal attack.  The beginning will see competition, but think about the future of this server. It's bound to go down the same path as any other server in terms of guild politics. An giant zerg alliance will be created and the members will reap rewards while the ones on the outside have trouble catching up in members and in gear because of the lost gold in Kraken, Abyssal Attack, Castles, etc. These castles will be unkillable because people know how to build castles now, unlike launch of Auroria where they were just throwing together what looked cool.  Lastly, the new rift's currency is here: http://archeagedatabase.net/kr/item/38093/  This new rift generates 100 of these tokens a day for a player. It takes 120 tokens for a piece of armor and 240 tokens for a weapon. Think about this. If players are given Tier 4 obsidian weapons after just three days of this rift, and can have 3 pieces of Tier 4 obsidian armor by the end of a 5 day period, that is INSANE progress. A month into launch, magnificent gear was considered extremely powerful. Now, we are being expediated to in between Epherium and Delphinad EVERYTHING. Not just Epherium weapons like Hasla did. On top of this, Diamond Shores is a PvP zone and when players get these weapons it will be like Hasla. Quest-geared players will get roflstomped into the ground and will be unable to complete these rift quests.  Not to mention, these armor and weapons are most likely going to be regradeable. There has been a patch since the launch of 2.0 in Korea that I believe locks these items to heroic but at the launch of it, you could regrade them. I saw this through Kooncoon's stream as well as heared it from korean players."
archeage,3e2nrd,Tansien,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Since this event came out in 1.8, and as you said it was patched to be Heroic-locked in 2.0, there's the chance of the gear being heroic-locked from the start for us since we get 1.8+2.0 together. However, either way I agree in that it still doesn't change how ridiculously overpowered people will be who get here first, get their Epherium/T4 equivalent gear, and then proceed to PVP gate quest-geared players from completing the rift.  These OP players will force other players to essentially either ""join or die"" to be able to compete and then zergfest 2.0 here we go."

It looks like there are 4 related quests that get you the ""token"" you need to craft the armor which is 100 tokens per day.   Depending on the piece of armor, you need 100-160 of these, but you also need Moonlight Archeum Essence, 2 Archeum Ingot, and 4 Beautifully Colored Fabric/Fine Leather/Sturdy Ingot. Moonlight Archeum Essence and Archeum Ingot are non-factors with the cash shop (Archeum Supply Crates and new Mining Drill) while a little bit more work needs to be put in for the T2 Fabric/Leather/Ingot because of charcoal. But even then, a few runs of Halcy->Solis takes care of that pretty easily.  The stats of the gear are in the ArcheAge Korean database and while I won't link them all, I can confirm their stats are close to Unique Epherium/Arcane T4. The only downside to this armor is that there is no Wrist/Belt armor, so you'll have to find filler for those slots, and that they're not regradeable. But for a week of doing rifts to get Unique Epherium/Arcane T4 is already really good."

I don't know the exact population numbers, but from playing my fair share of hours on both servers, (prime time on both, because yay, horrible sleep schedule) Inoch (at least before everyone started jumping ship post-merger announcement) seemed worlds more populated than Aier.

But all that aside could you imagine the wait times on the new server if they did that.  I'd honestly love for them to do it as a test bench and see how many players return/move to those servers.  Then do some math and fix what needs to be fixed.  I say to you Trino and celestrada no balls.  TL:DR Not going to happen because trion has no balls.

archeage,3e315j,DaPotatoo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"Library is located at Diamond Shores in Auroria. You can use the worldgate in Austera/Caernord on the East continent or Marianopole/Cinderstone on the West continent.  If you plan on solo grinding, it might be a bit rough at your gear score. You will probably want to look at finding a party to help you grind. Also, look into buying Library Indexes and Tyrenos's Library Index to help boost your damage and give you a bit more Defense/Magic Defense in the Library (You might even be able to solo grind with these buffs. It's worth a shot to try.).  Additionally, at 7 PM CDT everyday, people form Library raids to take down the Library bosses. Before 7 PM CDT, just yell in faction LF > Library Raid or something along those lines. Follow people around and pay attention to what Floor and Dimension they're going to. As a level 50, you only have access to Floor 1 though, so bear that in mind. For the raid, you want to go to the correct floor + dimension and tag the boss. By tagging the boss before the fight starts, you gain a quest to kill that boss. Once the boss is dead, then you can interact with an object the boss leaves behind to complete the quest, giving you a huge chunk of EXP. These quests are quite easy and give you a ton of EXP for the time investment.  Also at 7 PM CDT, the Library daily quests reset as well. Do these quests everyday for even more EXP. Sometimes, the raid will stick together to finish the quests together as well so everyone completes them faster.  Other alternatives to library, some people just farm other places in Auroria, but the EXP gain isn't as high I believe. If you don't like grinding and have the money to spare, you can also look into growing Experia plants if you own land, but let me reiterate that you need to have money to spare because these aren't cheap.   Taking into consideration your gear score, your best bet is probably to find a party to grind library with + do the daily library raids. Other places in Auroria will probably hurt more than using Indexes in Library + level 55 reds farming in Auroria will probably PvP camp you. Since your gear score is that low, I'm assuming you don't have the money to spend on Experias either, and any money you do make should go towards making your gear better rather than Experia."

If you complete the entire quest line you will get a few hundred gold and a tier 2 obsidian weapon/shield, as well as 3 potions that prevent xp loss for an hour which are great to use in those boss raids.

Not that they haven't been mistaken many times. My understanding, from threads like the one your referenced, is that Korea 2.0 got some of the better regrade chances that we already received in 1.7.  There was some mistranslation which was suppose to say that Celestial has a reduced chance to break, but instead told people it has no chance to break.  I thought that was confirmed through a video of Koon Koon destroying a Celestial in 2.0.   I haven't seen anything like the first commenters response about a cash shop item to restore a broken celestial.  So I dunno, a lot of confusion on that subject, I don't have high hopes.   Khrolan said that in May about a specific RNG box. I think he was literally talking about a soon to be released new RNG box, but was beating around the bush and didn't want to say ""RNG box""   I haven't seen anything else on Superior Reds coming to loyalty, cash shop, or merits.  I hope it does, but once again, I don't have high hopes for it.

archeage,3e0f93,breakingbunnies,6,Tue Jul 21 00:16:48 2015 UTC,"1 Gank Bus and Alliance are killing the server. 2 PRX are a bunch of pugs, they have the numbers no leader. 3 GRIT might be the only thing to save the server. 4 Fire Nation seems to be increasing in numbers and now that their feud with GA is over have proven to be a big help with Abyssal and getting the west together to fight reds. in all Gank Bus and Alliance are super gear so they do anything they want and run the server, East is trying to catch up i hope they do i hate GB."
archeage,3e0f93,AAkyrios,3,Tue Jul 21 03:44:47 2015 UTC,"East won't catch up because of the infighting.  PRX is the last of the large guilds that stuck it out and the majority of the hardcore players in that guild have left due to issues with both the East and Trion themselves.  GRIT is a small group and while they like to make a mouthy appearance, they are just too small to swing a large battle.  The biggest downfall lately for the East has been the Ollo rerolls that are TT6.  Marked and Bacon were the big pain in the past with all their peace time griefing, but TT6 takes it to a new level and just fights the East all day long.  Having these people hide in peace zones and still able to grief all the time just ruins the game for anyone.  Half the time I'm loading up larder from my farm to my cart, there's a TT6 person standing there waiting for my mark to fall of the cart so they can steal it, or see if I drop a pack as free loot.  It makes just about anyone want to leave the faction when it seems every other green is against you."

Patience is important. Remove cluster in chat: press on ""+"" icon at the end of your chat list (behind ""Trade"") and name your new channel with something meaningful like: ""Private"". Right click it and select Tab Settings. Activate [x] near: Whisper, Party, Raid, Guild, Family. Also add another tab as ""Public"", and from settings choose: Local (/say channel), Alliance (/faction channel), Nation and Trial. Options -> Functionality -> [x] Disable Chat Filter. Don't sell unused quest/dungeon items to a vendor. Use [Evenstones], on your old gear that is untradeable and obtain Archeum Motes/Dusts/Shards, they will be worth fortune after you finish questing. Evenstones are available at General Merchants or Blacksmits. Note: Some items cannot be salvaged. Map is your friend, Map Markers are friends with benefits. Use them early and often. Open World map by pressing default hotkey M, deactivate all unwanted markers by unchecking [x] next to it or [x] All. It was also helping me to notice the marker on the map by toggling it on an off. Options -> Key Bindings -> Misc. -> Replace [Accept Now] as F (default hotkey: G) with [Next] as G (default hotkey F) Options -> Key Bindings -> UI -> Change: Open Bag to something easily accessible (default hotkey I, uppercase i). I got mine at ""A"" Options -> Key Bindings -> Pet Controls -> Change: Mount/Dismount to something easily accessible (default: unbound). I got mine at ""D"". Options -> Key Bindings -> Character Controls -> Change: Autorun to easily accessible or add secondary keybind (I use middle mouse button, which makes controlling character fully with just Mouse possible - useful while drinking or eating a sandwich). Work in a team! Invite random strangers to party for questing together. Possible speed improvement outweighs slight decrease in monster kill XP. There are no penalties for killing monsters faster, and you can do ""Kill [x] monsters"" quests with a raid group of up to 50 people (unlike WoW for example, where private quests doesn't progress in raid group). Also fighting in a 2-man party creates multitude of combos and increases mana efficiency (basically doubling your mana regen rate). Save up all your initial gold for 2xAPEX and patron status, that time with some effort you can play this game completely for free. Try to ""touch"" every Memory Tome you will encounter. It makes it easier to teleport around the map at the later stage of the game. There is currently no option to sort entries in your Teleport Book. Set Recall Point by channeling at the Memory Tome. To either capital city or a transportation hub. Examples for East continent for good recall locations: City of Towers (all necessary crafting stations), Lutesong Harbor (all necessary crafting stations), Austera (all necessary crafting stations + Arena Managers) or Caernord (plenty of NPCs, crafting stations, PVP NPCs + Worldgates) or my favorite: Oxion Clan (5 minutes away from any important place on the continent, crossing the mountains on glider makes stuff easy. Gliders: After you follow main questline (Green Diamond-shaped marker on the minimap) you should get your Basic Glider. Go to Mirage Island and buy upgrade at character level 20. To understand what is needed to upgrade gliders go to Folio menu (default hotkey O) and navigate: -> Machining -> Gliders. All upgrade designs cost total of 1g75s. There should be skill ""Use Glider"" somewhere on your action bars. Remove it and replace it by dragging [Glider Item] from the inventory to your action bar. Always learn to double-tap this hotkey to fly. This might remove an odd bug where after carrying some trade packs your glider is not re-equipped. I've seen many players dying because ""Use Glider"" will display a death sentence ""Must have glider equipped to use this skill."" Armor type/weapon type: Quest reward choice is very limited. Whenever possible choose: Mages (take Cloth armor) should go with Staff, Healers should choose Greatclub and either Cloth or Plate, Archers should take Bow and Leather Armor, Tanks should go with Sword+Shield and Plate Armor, Warriors should take Nodachi and either Leather or Plate. Utilizing hybrid class or weapon swapping is beyond of this quick-tip list. Your mount is your friend, the more time you will spend riding his back the stronger he will become. You can learn crafting and other proficiencies when around level 10 you meet ""Blue Salt Brotherhood NPCs"" marked with green plant icon above their head instead of standard yellow ? ! If you complete all their quests and read the quest text they will introduce the Labor and Proficiency system. It's some sort of extended tutorial. Patience is very important.

Yesterday on his stream (http://www.twitch.tv/kloonike) he was killing only Ynystere mobs and he killed 100% of them by relogging every 20 minutes to his alt characters. I think you are overestimating the persistence and difficulty that requires.  Mobs respawn every 20 minutes, which gives potential 72 respawns per day. There are total of 21 rare monster spawns in 6 zones. Which makes impossible for one player to visit them fast enough.  Across the day group of 21 alt characters that are playing 24h/day would be able to kill up to 1,521 rare monsters. I would say that there is enough place to share with more than 2 players.

It's also cheapest of all Plate Armors and will most likely be salvaged by those who don't want to waste their gold on auction house listing fees. Try to ask on Forums or /Faction chat if someone has spare Sunset Armor. More expensive option (but also more powerful), if you have all the gold in the world would be [Quake Plate Armor].  Mainhand Weapon  Obsidian Katana is a perfect weapon, giving you full Magic Attack (like Scepters) and full Melee Attack (Like Axe or Sword), so you can't get anything better than that.  Offhand Weapon  Gearing up your second hand unfortunately will be the most expensive of the whole build. It is significant, because you are allowed to swap your Off-Hand gear while in combat, and it's crucial mechanic for any hybrid and non-hybrid build. I would start with an Obsidian v2 T4 Shield called [Mystic Ward] (click to open archeage database). Second purchase would be any level Physical Shield (Obsidian V1, or Hasla/Epherium/Delphinad/Serpentis/Kraken(lol) etc). Third purchase (required to complete your Crusader) would be another 1-H melee weapon and here you can go funky and pick one of those:   [Sleeper's Point] V2 Obsidian Dagger, unique weapon in the game that gives Magic Damage in the Off-hand slot boosting your offensive capability [Searing Oath] World Boss drop Katana from Morpheus, unique weapon that holds 3% Damage reduction in the off-hand slot, giving you benefits of dual wielding (increased attack speed to dish out your combos faster) and boosting your defence at the same time. [Cold Anguish] World Boss drop Katana from Rangora, fairly good and cheap Off-hand giving you Melee crit. Anything that will give you dual-wield buff. Serpentis Axe with its crit damage % is good too.   Other Gear  Accessories and Instrument should be left up to your taste. I suggest Life Rings (+% Skill Damage), Wave Earrings (+% Damage Reduction) and Halcyona Necklace.  Some honorable mentions for the Instrument slot should be:   [Fantasia of Sorcery] purchased for 300x[Warrior's Medals]. Increases amount of the Bonus Defense and Damage Absorbed by your Insulating Lens spell. [Anthem of Battlerage] purchased for 300x[Warrior's Medals]. Increases Cooldown reduction, Parry % Chance and Melee critical damage from [Battle Focus] (click for screenshot of effects).   Advice about Obsidian Gear (Bound on equip)  Important note about OBSIDIAN gear: Except Sunset and Quake armor there are Obsidian parts as well. But you need to remember that whenever you build an Obsidian piece, it will most likely stay Bounded to your Character (I know some people claim, that they can ""upgrade"" to T5/T6 and sell it, but the cost of such upgrade is insane (3x Epherium, 3x Delphinad + World Boss drops, some requiring killing Red Dragon or Leviathan). That's why I suggested Sunset/Quake, whatever happens in the future, if you will get tired of playing Crusader, you will have comfort of selling your gear, Quake set ofc has the highest resell value, because it's upgradeable to a higher tier. I believe that only obsidian item that any player should use is V2 Shield, that gives insane amount of Magic Defence. Any other Obsidian Items that you want to wear should be crafted at your own responsibility (and hopefully you will think it out very well before making your final decision).  Good luck and have fun.  Edit: Expanded on Obsidian Gear."

It's important with choosing your offhand, but if I were you I would go for the Sleeper's Point, because it's most significant one.  I also updated my answer expanding on Instrument suggestions and Obsidian gear."

I meant to mention that in my off hand right now I only have a t1 obsidian shield and you were saying something about using another weapon in my off hand how would I switch shield/weapon in my offhand during combat?"
archeage,3e1b1t,Faddler,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"So you are more into Battlerage, I would suggest you taking Cold Anguish as off-hand weapon.  Also, I don't think that Puncture is worth that skill point (maybe Dual-wield Proficiency or Attack Speed Training would be better?), because you are dealing hybrid damage, the 2000 armor reduction is not very reliable. Besides, if you see someone armored to teeth, you just throw a Meteor on him!  Good luck and have fun"
archeage,3e1b1t,Riliify,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"Crusader is just a tanky melee, so gearing up will be the same as abolishers. I would either get a full set of magnificent desert leather armor if you want to still have gear that is cheap and tradeable, or get 5 pieces of obsidian leather and put whatever sleeves/wrists on. I would avoid purchasing plate because an amazing set comes out of serpentis and leather is much better in the long run, not only because of the split defence but because of the set bonus as well."

archeage,3e14b6,kurtix07,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:23 2015 UTC,Boat is better but more dangerous. I wouldn't go into a conflict zone without some guildies backing you up.
archeage,3e14b6,awkwardvlog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:38 2015 UTC,"By Land;  *Carebear runs can give you a decent amount (~10 gold a pack) and has no danger whatsoever (unless you are prone to angering the gods, then you are at risk of being disconnected where any random guy can jump on your hauler and take it to mobs)  *Also conflict zones will go into peace where you cannot be attacked by anyone and you'll be safe running packs in and out for 3 hours. You should take advantage of zones such as Ynystere and Cinderstone being in peace as you get considerably more compared to carebear runs.  *Going through conflict zones without waiting for peace you run the risk of being attacked by PKers and Hostile Faction members. IF you do want to run packs without waiting just make sure you know all the safepoints ( i.e. Nui Statue and Neutral Alliance Guards) where you can make a quick dash to if you come under attack.  By Boat;  *When you are on the sea ALL players can attack you (Pirates, Nuian, Haranyan). You have to watch out for Pirates especially because they spend most of their time at sea as they aren't allowed on the continents and the sea is the only place they are safe.  *The benefits of taking packs across continent is you get valuable resources (not going to mention the 1 gilda star you could get instead) that you can sell for gold. Depending on you Auction House prices it may or may not be better then running normal packs. For example, on Ollo I can hand in a Solis Headlands Red spice for ~15 charcoal at Two Crowns. These Charcoal Stabilizers will sell for 1 gold each.   tl;dr Going by boat nets you more gold depending on your pack how much more it gives but you run the risk of being pirated by anyone at anytime. Compared to land where you can do runs completely safe for around 10 gold a pack."

archeage,3e0d2w,ThorBeerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"regrading - I personaly use charms on regrading in such manner:  arcane - green, heroic - blue, Unique - yellow and then just upcraft (doing obsidian stuff)  I can really see the improvement with the charms  ship regrading - you allways have 50% chance to success and 50% to break the item, also dont regrade your basic stuff, its allways way cheaper to buy/craft the green item  get better sail and propellant, for clipper, unique sails and heroic propellant should be OK, if you plan getting merch, mythic sails is the way  If you are using any healing abilities in your build, you should really go for obsidian shortspear, it gives you puncture passive + nice healing power, I dont see katana used by tanks very often, imo sword/shortspear is the way"
archeage,3e0d2w,Cosmic_Accident,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:32 2015 UTC,"I'll post how I used to make money because I pretty much hit the jackpot and won't have to be worried too much about making money (more on this later). I've been playing for 3 months so I'll detail how my progression went.  In my first week or two, I used to sit on AH and buy items people had listed for ridiculous bid prices and then resell them. I used to do this once every 30 minutes or so while I played the game, questing and so forth. I used to make 100g a day from that, and maybe 30-40g from questing so my daily income was no more than 150g. I saved up 300g and bought a farm cart. I started doing Rookborne-Falcorth runs in my farm cart as a lvl 38. I saved up enough to get a farm wagon. Then I was super lucky and found 3 black pearls on AH for 100g - I bought them and sold them for 1000g and bought myself a farm hauler and a clipper.  Now that I had a clipper and a hauler, I placed an 8x8 farm plot in Solis to use as a staging base. I would bring packs from Falcorth with a hauler to my staging base, two runs for 14 packs, and then take them one by one to two crowns with my clipper. Then something great happened, the festival enabled perma peace for 30 days in Windscour. I started buying Windscour aged packs for 20g and my seller would deliver them to my staging base (He would get 19.5g in solis if he sold there, so we were both happy). I would take these packs to two crowns and get my 31 charcoals. By this time I had hit lvl 45 or so, so I decided it was time I doubled my efficiency on the sea. I bought a crest trade pack storage for 280g and started doing 2 packs at a time to two crowns. It was risky at my level but I'd take extra steps to minimize my risk. I lost about 5 out of 100 packs delivered to two crowns in that time.  At around lvl 48 I realized that I could process my charcoals into other items to increase my gold gain. So instead of 1.1g per charcoal, I'd be making 1.6g per charcoal. Ofcourse this cost some labor, but I was never delivering at full capacity, and I bought my packs so that meant I was using half the labor anyway! So this meant that a single WS aged pack was worth 50g minus the 20g I used to pay for them and I was making 30g profit per pack, and 2 packs per run, and 3-4 runs per hour! So I was making about 200g per hour. I later reduced this even further by moving my staging base to the north shore of solis, this meant a single run to two crowns including packing and unpacking took me 9.5 minutes. I was making 360g an hour, and about 500-600g per day.  There remained 3 days to the end of WS perma peace. I've never liked managing farms so I refused to settle down in arcum iris and make my own larders. So I went to Perinoor and asked a few friends to help me stock up on peri packs. I think I had about 70 on my farm by that night which would allow me some time to rethink my money making system.  I decided to delve into Gilda star trading. It was less money per pack, but it was payment in a lump sum. That meant I wouldn't be able to waste money before I could afford an item (I was buying celestial obsidians upfront). So I found a guy that wanted 500 gilda stars. Normally the running rate was 2750 or so for that, I convinved him to pay me 3000g for them. I also convinced him to give me 750g upfront for any expenses. So I began working as a Gilda trader! A friend of mine was going on a vacation so I would plant Saffron bundles made by a guildie on his plots, and turn them into Solis fellowship packs and deliver them to Cinderstone for 5 gilda stars each. I bought celestial sails for my clipper, and that meant my entire run to cinderstone was about 8.5 minutes including everything. So I was making about 60 gilda stars per hour. I averaged about 100 gildas per day and delivered the 500 gildas in 5 days and got my 3000 gold.   Gildas were an iffy business and I couldn't find much motivation to do them, so much that I had to resort to my Shia motivational spreadsheet to track progress as you can see here! So I was looking around on reddit about 10 days ago and saw a post about the Trion livestream. It was not recorded on Twitch and the only recording was at 189 views on youtube by a french person. Nobody realized what this patch meant, they were blind to the opportunity. But watching the stream I realized two things:   Gliders were never normalized on KR and RU, so no veteran was expecting this patch. I could make a buttload of money off of it.   This patch (it hits tonight) was bringing 3 things: A new glider, a glider upgrading system and submarines. So I started stockpiling the materials. One of the main ones was Glowing Prisms. These were rare drops from purses (1% or so) and you needed 100 for the upgrade, 100 for the new glider, 20 for the rng second upgrade to the glider, and 30 for the submarine. I started buying them carefully without impacting the AH prices. I think the cheapest I bought 100 for was 7g, all the way up to 45g - my average for all the prisms I bought was about 30g per 100. I stockpiled 4600 of them, and they're already selling for 3.5g each right now on my AH cluster. Will be even higher after the patch. I also bought Prismatic Diamonds, stockpiled about 400 sturdy ingots, bought a bunch of royal jellies very cheap. Long story short I invested about 4000g in cheap ass shit, that are currently worth about 25-30k gold and after the patch might be worth even more.  So there you have my story. Do with it what you will."
archeage,3e0d2w,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:46:18 2015 UTC,"Money Making - /u/Cosmic_Accident went into great detail in his post on how he made gold. Good read.  Regrading - Charms increase the success chance of a regrade. It's been data mined that they do increase success chance, so they do influence success or no success. However, RNG will be RNG. You could be extremely unlucky and fail several times in a row with charm while at the same time be extremely lucky and succeed without charms.  Take a look at the bottom chart here. If you're regrading at Unique without a Red Regrade Charm, you have a 25% chance of success. With a Red Regrade charm, that jumps up to 50%. 50% is definitely much better than 25% chance, just people feel bitter afterwards when their 50/50 shot ends up being a bust. You win some, you lose some, but just based on numbers alone, you have a better shot at winning with a regrade charm. Personally, I use regrade charms at every stage from Arcane and up because I like my 50% chances vs. 25-30%.  Coin Purse Farming - Again, RNG plays in this with the drops you get. I've never personally coin purse farmed so I don't know the numbers, but I know that if you get lucky and open Scratched Safes + good drops (Ex. Archeum Tree), then I think it's definitely possible. Popping buffs might help compensate for gear, but at the same time that slightly cuts into profits. I think it's worth it if you decide to pursue coinpurse farming though. Personally not a fan of grinding mobs unless necessary though.  Clipper Help - The only thing I would focus on regrading for your clipper is your sail. The rest are things that you can decide to spend cash on if you so choose, but they're not as important in my opinion with the amount of gold you sit at now. If you want a dash, consider buying a Caernord Sea Serpent Propellant; however, they are heavy and will slow down your ship if not at a high grade. They're also pricier than other ship components, so regrading one is definitely a gold sink that I wouldn't throw money into for now.  For your sail, I recommend you buying an already regraded one if you don't feel lucky. Sea Serpent Propellant is optional unless you can nab one for cheap if you'd like for the dash, but it will slow down your base speed a tad bit in exchange for the dash.  As for the regrade chances, they are different than normal regrading. For one, you cannot use a charm at all and the regrade fee is always a flat 15g. The chances are as follows:   Grand -> Rare: 90% Rare -> Arcane: 75% Everything else: 50% If you fail, your ship component gets destroyed at every level.   Animation Cancelling - You must cast Fervent Healing first and then Triple Slash, Fervent Healing again, Triple Slash again, repeat. Remember, it doesn't have to be Triple Slash, any move that can be animation cancelled can be used in place of Triple Slash. For example, Mirror's Light has a really slow animation. Fervent Healing -> Mirror's Light -> Fervent Healing -> Triple Slash -> Fervent Healing...etc. I like this combo because it's good for setting up a trip without breaking Leech (Compared to Damaging Move + Triple Slash which allows enemy to use Bondbreaker). Because of Mirror's Light animation duration though, there are times Leech ends before I finish Mirror's Light animation hence animation cancel.  Here's the video I first watched detailing animation cancelling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3rGy86zDK4  Weapons - If you're a Paladin, specifically -Obsidian- Shortspear is definitely, definitely the way to go. If you're not looking to weapon swap, you want a weapon that can heal and output damage at the same time. Obsidian Shortspear is a healing weapon as well as a very strong melee weapon with the passive that has a chance to reduce your opponent's physical defense to 0 on an attack. The only other weapons with healing power are clubs, but an Obsidian Shortspear will outdps the damage on a club unless you have an Ayanad Club lying around...  Shield - I don't play aggressive healing classes outside Argent, so I like the Obsidian shield because it makes me bulkier and gives me more surviveability. Essentially it comes down to, do you want more damage or more HP to be tankier. 1 Stamina = 8 HP which can end up being a huge boost to HP depending on the stamina differential. Additionally, I'm in Stone Cloth and I'm aiming for more PDEF. In the end, it comes down to preference. I personally like to be tankier because if I'm still alive after a combo, I can still do stuff. If I'm dead, I can't really do anything whether it be attacking back or healing.  Obsidian Version 2 - These raid boss mats are quite often tradeable and on the Auction House for purchase. You could also just straight up buy the Obsidian piece, but they are quite pricy since Version 2 requires Salvaged Epherium to be upgraded to.  Bosses - I started my Dream Ring quest doing Serpentis runs with a medium-sized guild. Only one Dream Ring quest drops from the last boss, so only one person gets it. Usually in my guild, that was decided beforehand because some of the group had already done Dream Ring quest while others have not. The ones who didn't rolled for the quest.  Mount Gear - I think you're talking about Kroloal Cradle in Rookborne here. I know that dungeon drops mount gear which is pretty good. I've duo'd the dungeon before with a guildmate of mine. As long as you're familiar with the mechanics, the dungeon itself isn't that hard to do.   Serpentis also drops mount gear as well and since you want to get Dream Ring, you could also kill two birds with one stone and go for the Serpentis mount gear.   Hope that answered most of your questions!"
archeage,3e0d2w,ThorBeerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:54 2015 UTC,"to the propellant part, I have arcane propellant and if I use the dash on cooldown, it makes my clipper about 50% faster, so consider getting it  also it saved my clipper many times from red gallys during abyss, turning west/east and dashing makes it impossible for gally to chase you, so unless one of the crew decides that the clipper with 1 or 2 packs is worth the long chase ur safe (they are off to catch merchs usually, so won't waste ppl for clippers)  another thing, strip your clipper of everything but rudder and sail (+propellant if you have one) it only slows it down"
archeage,3e0d2w,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"You make a really good point. I didn't take into consideration that the burst of speed could make others second guess chasing you + throw a gally off your trail because of their slow turning.   I actually have a Heroic/Unique (I don't remember which...haven't used my Clipper in a while) Sea Serpent Propellant myself and the burst of speed, to be completely honest, feels really nice when using it. Even if a clipper might move faster without it, I still love that dash.  However, for the OP, compared to getting better sails and getting better gear though, the cost of regrading a Sea Serpent Propellant / buying a pre-regraded one might take a slightly lesser priority, but it's not an entirely terrible investment either. If he can get one for a decent price, great! If not, it shouldn't be something OP frets over.   In the long run, I'd definitely recommend getting one though."

I can see that he gets tripped but no ""Shadowsmite"" debuff. And same goes for my third friend that fled into the sea. After getting tagged to be allowed to strike back he still couldn't do anything. That's why i thought something was bugged!  Regarding myself in that clip, i had a feeling that i was missing something, since i couldn't use any abilites, and apparently i did! So thanks for pointing that out for me.

archeage,3e0baa,WyzeThawt,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"I believe the system allows you to retaliate against a player that has entered combat with you. However at 14 seconds into the video he shadowsmited you which locks out melee skills for 4 secs, that debuff wore off a second or two before you jumped off the edge at 19 seconds in the video. That skill is why you could still heal but not use any melee, it is in the shadowplay skill tree and can be combod with purge from the witchcraft tree to also apply silence which would also lock out your spells."

archeage,3e0yg3,lykewhoa,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"Get to level 55 in a good solo grinding spec, how? LIBRARY BOSSES AND DAILIES... event starts at 5pm PST but raids usually form 30-45 minutes early... because the experience gain is very good. RECOMMENDATION: Get Witchcraft -or- Auramancy to 55 along with 2 other skills of your choosing, both have the option of returning large quantities of mana and reducing your downtime/reliance on consumables. For gold/gearing from basically scratch... I'd highly recommend larceny or commerce, even if all you have is a few strategic 8x8 farms (which are very easy to find). If you never obtained a farm cart/wagon/hauler of any kind, then I'd say go ahead and stick to larceny. Many drops from Auroria and library sell for a very tidy profit, if you have time, make sure to participate in CR/GR/halcyona/mistmerrow and sell the honor you gained by buying enchants from the honor vendor and auctionhousing them.   You really don't need land to be wealthy in archeage, it just opens up options. join a large guild, see if anyone will let you use some of theirs, or sell it to you for a good price if you're not in a rush for gear.  Lastly, you didn't mention if you're Patron status. I'd HIGHLY recommend patroning, at least for your first month...you can use the loyalty and labor generated to buy APEX to sustain Patron if you're diligent.  Good luck to you!"

Very populated by people all around the world so there is action at any time of the day. This does come with side effects though, catching up will be very tough because the server is very progressed. There is quite a few smaller guilds on this server on both factions that are willing to help you out. Ask about or maybe run into someone in a guild and ask them if you could join.  As for there being a lot of end game elitists, ArcheAge is not too different from this. People that have reached the end game in ArcheAge are usually not too open to helping new players with getting geared and the game allows toxicity to be around. The game is one of the only on the market that is very hardcore, ran by PvP, but this does come with assholes inhabiting the game."

archeage,3e0ibc,Dool889,3,Tue Jul 21 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"If you've been away since Auroria, then quite a bit has changed. Off the top of my head + cheating with patch notes...  Secrets of Ayanad brought 180k proficiency, level 55, library grinding, Diamond Shores, Ayanad Gear and Obsidian Weapons.  Pre-1.7 brought Rankings (Arena, Fishing, etc.) and Crimson Lightning.  1.7A, one of the biggest of the patches, brought ship customizations, completely changing how sea travel works, new events such as Mistmerrow and Abyssal Attack, merit badges and achievements, Freedich Gold Trader and the removal of housing on Freedich, ports to Freedich, and the guards on the faction islands around Freedich, Ocean Traders for trade pack specialties from sunken treasure chests + ghost ships, Archeum Changes (More motes...yay...), Regrade Changes (Bumped up success chance of regrading), Golden Ruins, more patron benefits, Obsidian Armor, new quests, increased intracontinental trade pack prices...I think I covered most of what changed in 1.7A.  Pre-1.7B brought Timber Coupe and Longboards.  1.7B brought Leviathan, Miroir Tundra (Ice Fishing), new houses, and the Red Hauler.  As for something less structured, you could probably grind library and do library quests + raids to get to Level 55. In PvP, others higher level than you will definitely have the upper hand against you at level 50. There are new goals for you to work towards if you'd so like (Longboard, Timber Coupe). There are also new weapons and armor you can start working for that will probably eventually become better than what you had since Auroria (Unless you were running around in full Delph or something). You can also start working on regrading ship components on a ship to make your ship OP.  If you're more into events, you could always go to Halcyona, Mistmerrow and Abyssal Attack. If you like making gold, trade runs and Abyssal Attack are both good for that as well (After Abyssal, you can mine a crystal to craft a pack worth 70g if you turn it in). You could also head towards Freedich at the times the Gold Trader shows up and potentially mug someone for their pack.  In the end, what you do depends on what you want to do. Do you want to PVP?Get gear? Make gold so you can start affording gear and fighting others. Do you just want a piece of land to farm on? A mansion? Start working on the Gilda for the mansion and money to buy the land you want."
archeage,3e0ibc,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:40 2015 UTC,"n what you want to do. Do you want to PVP?Get gear?    I'd love to pvp but it seems virtually impossible to get gear as a solo player. I just made leather over and over again to make money, Tried to get weapons crafted for me and they never made it past the first seal. Spent about 20k gold on that so far... so many failures."
archeage,3e0ibc,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"As a mostly solo player, I know that feeling. I've done so many trade runs, single planted so many things, and crafted a ton to the point where I'm even surprised I've gone through all of that.  One good thing that has changed though is the introduction of Obsidian weapons and armor. This makes your failures worth something because it takes a Salvaged Illustrious to make an Obsidian weapon. Also, the stats on Obsidian weapons make them really good for hybrid builds.  For example, I like to play melee DPS+healer hybrids such as Argent, Soothsayer, and Inquisitor. The Obsidian Shortspear is perfect for these classes because not only is it a strong melee weapon, it has healing power as well so that my heals are just as potent as my DPS.  Although these weapons are Bind on Equip giving them 0 resale value, going through the tiers isn't as painful as trying to craft a Delphinad was before Obsidian existed. For Obsidian, there are 6 tiers and you need a Salvaged ____ <weapon/armor piece you want>.   So for an Obsidian Shortspear, T1 and T2 require a Salvaged Illustrious Shortspear to make + mats from Auroria mobs. T3 requires a Salvaged Magnificent Shortspear + more Auroria mob mats. T4, 1 Salvaged Epherium Shortspear + Library mob mats. T5, 3 Salvaged Epherium Shortspear + Library mob/raid boss mats. T6, 3 Salvaged Delphinad + Auroria/Library mob/raid boss mats.  For me, I crafted all the way up to T4 Obsidian Shortspear. It took me several days (1-2 weeks I think?), but selling the fails as Salvages definitely helped alleviate the cost as a solo player. In the mean time, while my labor was out, I would farm Library and Auroria for the mats I needed. Some days when I didn't feel like using my labor for crafting or didn't have the crafting mats available, I would open the coinpurses for gold.  Currently, I'm sitting at about 4000 gear score (This was added in 1.7A) with Epherium Stone Cloth, a T5 Obsidian Shortspear, and a T3 Obsidian Shield. I'm pretty happy with my gear and I can do alright in PvP (Except against the super geared, but that's ok for me. I don't mind too much.).   Almost took out a 5k gear score Blighter the other day but the damage was too much. I think if I played it a bit better (I made quite a few mistakes, using Shrug It Off too early, accidentally fat fingering Bondbreaker, minor stupid things like that), then I could've taken him down even more. Not sure if I could've won since his damage was really high, but it goes to show that even though I'm 1k gear score lower and a mostly solo player, that you can still have your shots at being competitive.   An added note...I actually got him 3 times in a row going into arena. I absolutely got roflstomp'd the first 2 times, but after paying attention to how he fought, what moves he started out with, what combo he would follow up with, things like that, I started to get the hang of how to fight against him which made the 3rd time I got him a little more interesting of a fight vs. getting stomped. So even though people do say gear > skill, skill does play a part as well to an extent (Although gear is good too, but at some point, you're gonna need skill to go along with your gear unless you're a super whale)."
archeage,3e0ibc,AMindBlown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"1) Spend my labor for the day. Use most of it for making money, and a tiny amount towards fun projects that aren't such a bore.  2) Daily events such as GR/CR/Abyssal/Mistmerrow/Halcy.  3) As much library/serp content I can handle for the day. Working towards the Ayanad Earring and dream ring is a strong personal goal for myself atm and keeps me going.  4) Arenas/random acts of pvp. Whether it's on the ocean or on enemy territory, this is always something fun to do.  5) Grab a good friend and go on an adventure. Doing something fun or silly is a good way to unwind. You don't need an objective or a goal, go climb a mountain or look for a hidden farm.  6) Help out whatever guildies I can with whatever it may be. Whether it's a boss they need/farming some mats/running packs. Just being helpful and lending a hand when I can.  This is what I do when I play. :)"
archeage,3e0ibc,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"1) Find secret farms, write down what time they mature, then show up to fight people for their stuff. CHALLENGE THEM FOR THEIR POTATOES.  2) Find crazy locations for your OWN secret farms, and gamble big on them not being discovered. Sure you can plant pines on a mountain and be bored to tears. But a rumbling archeum sapling behind a shed in Marianople? Hilarious. (It also helps if you just don't own land at all. Then you HAVE to secret farm to grow anything and it's way more exciting.)  3) Try to solo sneak in/out of the daily Abyssal Attack event without being robbed by the roving gangs of reds, pirates, and privateers. Realize too late that you're out of Dahuta's Bubbles. Die.  4) Now that gear score is visible, duel any greens you meet whenever it looks like it could be a good fight. Be shocked by the variance in power between two identical gear scores. Die more.  5) Find weird class combos and challenge yourself to make them viable somehow. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, STORMCASTER. I WILL FLOAT WHILE SHOOTING LIGHTNING AND IT WILL BE AWESOME.  6) Dive for sunken treasure in the Sea of Drowned love, and fight anyone else you meet down there. Get pissed whenever you get stuck with that one 5g treasure pack you can't drop. Get ganked on the way to Freedich trying to sell it. Curse the guild that ganked you, and swear to fight them whenever you catch one alone. Do so, and maintain a bitter feud that they probably don't even know is happening.  7) Use 4 stabilizing harpoons to hook a warship to an airship. Sail into the sky and rain cannon fire down on the unsuspecting populace. In fact, just bask in the glory that is a 4-harpoon ship. Harpoon yourself between two pillars and Van Damme your ship up into the air. Declare your hammock-ship the server's new ""Fort Kickass"" and see how many people you can fit on it. Viciously defend Fort Kickass from that stupid guild you hate.  8) Add a harpoon to a merchant schooner and do a landboat  trade run. It'll take a while... but it will be glorious.  Shoot, gotta get back to work. But yeah I'm still havin' fun! =D"

Right now I'm planting things needed to make my car, so I put those items into my car storage chest and update my spreadsheet to see what else I need. Make a mental note to buy those seeds etc when I run over to the store.  After that I do my 4 easy Gilda dailies (the crafting ones), then buy the seeds etc needed, go home and craft my bundles then plant them.   If it's a larders ready day, I head over to my larder plot and pick the ready ones up and put new ones in. Depending on my labor/mood/sell rate, I then run a hauler over to hand larders in.  After that I usually do a combo of the below:   Farm in Auroria for purses and the cloaks Farm the library for costume scraps etc. Craft - either levelling up various proficiencies or crafting gear Browse the AH looking for bargains, listing items, etc Go exploring - lately I've been questing in and exploring Karkasse Ridgelands. If I do this, I usually put my sound + music on for that RP atmosphere Farm dragon bones in Karkasse for the accessories. Chat to friends, help out if they need it Usually run into some bots so kill them Level up pets - have to finish levelling my Cottage Plushie Pet. I also like just getting out in the world and running around with no real purpose. Sometimes I'll ride to a destination rather than port, just to have a look around or explore the map a bit.   If anything I feel like there's too much to do and I sometimes log in and feel kind of overwhelmed with choices. I haven't even touched on PvP or fishing or any of the other things I do sometimes.

Obviously I am here and my PM inbox is always open for discussion. While I do not respond personally to every PM (and I never actually click your read notifications. I can bypass those, which people can attest to as I can respond back without triggering a read request) I do read my PMs each morning, Monday through Friday.  I have reached out to the affected player today to discuss the exploit so our team can properly test. If such an exploit does exist, steps will be taken together with XL in order to close it up.  In the future, if anyone here finds an exploit, privately send it to me or contact customer service. Do not post it to the forums and taunt others. Thank you!"

archeage,3dxige,awkwardvlog,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:01 2015 UTC,I don't even like to trash-talk Trion. I've just been a LOT more attentive to their actions ever since I was banned.     I just felt like pointing out that disparity in 'policy enforcement'.     Trion's previous modus operandi was to ignore problems until they became unignorable. This cultivated a particular way for the community to 'force' Trion into action: complaining en mass and or posting potentially hazardous information.     Perhaps things are changing. I honestly do not know.
archeage,3dxige,reznoc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"I think ignore things until outrage is not accurate. I used to work tech support so I know how a lot of this stuff runs. The people who do the fixing are never the people you talk to. They get paid to fix things not talk to you. The people paid to talk to you have not gone to school for programming or whatever. They get paid to talk to you. So when i was a tech I would run through the scripts and send the reports to the engineers. The engineers prioritized the reports based on the number of people effected, and the severity of the issue. But even when the issue was right there at the top of their list they still had to investigate it, isolate it, replicate it, and then come up with a fix for it. Then they had to test their fix out and if it tested well they would sneak it into an update and pray it didn't screw something else up. This was a long process if you can imagine.   So someone instead of sending a report to be investigated they post it on reddit or the forums. CM's look at that info and do what you should have done in the first place and they file a report. So players though a tissy fit the cms see that and instead of taking that to the programmers they take it to the producers. The producers then prioritize it based on something they know little about since they are producers and not programmers. And boom suddenly solving a major security threat gets the back burner to something players though was more important over what the programmers actually knew.   Now the issue here is that the programmers may not be here but in korea. And this build may not even be their priority over KR's issues.   So why drag the community through all the bullshit just so you can feel better that an issue that may or may not have already been on the programmers table? All people really want is a producer or a cm to come and pat them on the head or kowtow down to them for their excellence. Or they want programmers to stop programming and waste their time trying to explain what their last bug was and how they fixed it all while exposing security vulnerabilities to future exploiters."
archeage,3dxige,awkwardvlog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure if the 'you' is the general 'you.' I'm assuming it is.  As far as my comment on ignore until outrage paired with complaining: that's just my observation, not how I (personally) would suggest reporting exploits.  As far as responding to people who say 'hey I found X exploit,' actually respond. Maybe even make a sticky so the community can see that Trion is aware of it (just identify it briefly, not actually describe it in enough detail for replication). Just some way to avoid the whole fiasco route.  Then again who knows, that could backfire."
archeage,3dxige,awkwardvlog,2,Mon Jul 20 23:35:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think it would be a sound strategy to acknowledge exploits unless you needed to. Better to keep them quiet for security reasons. The server security and game community well being is far more important than some persons feeling that they are entitled to a pat on the back from trion. Just send the report to the people who actually do the work and let the community go about their day in ignorance. The people who do exploit will be dealt with privately in a way that they deem fitting. It may not be how we think they should be punished but it's not our game. WoW banned thousands of people not too long ago for exploiting and those bans were for 6 months only. Xbox live bans for hacking are for 2 weeks.

It's about 9.3g per pack turn-in, and depending on how much the materials run on your server it's about 6 silver per labor with a high commerce skill.

archeage,3dz95l,visawontwork,2,Mon Jul 20 19:18:53 2015 UTC,Abolisher is definitely a great class for this! Although I hate how you get accused of being a bot when you're farming mobs as an abolisher :(
archeage,3dz95l,turtlelord,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:49 2015 UTC,Plate Abolisher/Blighter/Hexblade is easy to gear up with Auroria armor and serpentis shield+axe combo.  Leather Abolisher/Blighter/Hexblade is harder to gear as you need something like an epherium desert set or T4 leather set but it will be stronger.

archeage,3dz95l,nyym1,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:52 2015 UTC,"Abolisher is the standard tank, he wont have any problems with quest/lvling  you only need battlerage to do good damage"
archeage,3dz95l,TheGuli,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"Compared to other MMOs I have played there does not seem to be that 'tank cost' penalty I seen in many games. If you do the quest line you will be given the quest gear until level 50. After that just buy a salvaged illustrious (not much difference in the cost between cloth, leather or plate) and grind turtles for topaz to make the obsidian."
archeage,3dz95l,itsamandatoryfield,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"PVE tank it's very easy to gear up if you are not looking for an endgame beast. Explaining attack: Dual wield or 2h weapon for level up, your plate set and defense passive skills will be enought to survive. Explaining defense: Even a dungeon plate set + hasla shield gives you a very high damage mitigation, around 50%, add 2 earrings, a lunagem, and an halcyona necklace and you can reach a 60%. The problem is we are talking about physical damage reduction, because the plate sets have no magical defense at all, and he could have problems with magic bosses (not so many to be honest), for the best physical/magical damage mitigation he should switch to a delphinad earth leather set (around 6k per piece) and pop defense potions + defense books, like 3g each... this is going to be expensive. Anyway a tank with auramancy can reduce magical damage with conversion shield and shrug it off skills, if he knows when the boss is going to do a magical attack, a battlerage will reduce your physical defense by 2000 with a critical hit, and a shortspear will ignore your defense because of its hidden effect. The obsidian V2 shield gives you magical damage reduction too, look into it. This is all about PVE, because in PVP any mage will kill him very very easily if you wear a plate set."
archeage,3dz95l,DarkManiak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:30:04 2015 UTC,general rule of thumb is tank classes tend to be cheaper/easier to gear and and such. plate is about 20% cheaper than cloth and leather for the same ratio of stats.
archeage,3dz95l,GGATHELMIL,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:07 2015 UTC,This must be AH cluster centric.  On my cluster cloth is about half the cost of plate.

On the Eu cluster i play on epheriums are are around 300g cheaper on average. The last time i looked at an epherium helm to upgrade my plate set i saw a unique epherium desert helm for 1700g. salvaged epherium hoods were going for 3k plus

archeage,3dx653,DarkManiak,5,Mon Jul 20 10:02:19 2015 UTC,Everyone is crying because archery went from one extreme to another. You barley kill anyone anymore with it.

archeage,3dx653,DarkManiak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is that neither the shield nor defense really helps much if not only those classes still keep you down long enough to shred through you. And even if they wouldn't, as an archer you'd still do not enough damage to kill him quick enough before his abilities are ready again. And since redoubt has a much longer cooldown you'd still be dead then."

What archery really needs is a good ping, and sadly not everyone can upgrade their connection.

archeage,3dx653,DarkManiak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:05:13 2015 UTC,are you insane? you have more mobility through gap closers and teleports than an archer will ever have. bonecage doesnt work have the time (people go right through it). there are points throughout a fight where i can kite them but i have to be super careful to maintain a far enough distance and make sure i dont wildly sling arrows for their cds to reset. but there is no way to kite a DR from start to end of a fight unless you get insanely lucky/you face the shittiest DR ever. i play prime on NA servers while living in germany (about 200 ping) and in 1v1s i do more than decent. i dont take float or boneyard in my 1v1 build.
archeage,3dx653,80WillPower08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:32:25 2015 UTC,"YOU are insane if you play archery with a ping of 200ms and keep talking about archery/anything/anything against Darkrunners, you should not even mention how weak archers are against that broken class. And if you think archer is a great 1vs1 class you are wrong, stop being angry about that and change class, it's not like YOUR class should be the strongest in the game, stick to open world PVP where darkrunner are killed in half second. And again, battlerage has 2 gap closers, auramancy has 2 gap closers, shadowplay has 2 gap closers, are you playing archery/nothing/nothing?"

Battlerage has 2, Auramancy has 2, Shadowplay has 2, archery has higher movement speed, can slow you down and block your skills from far away, can block you in the bone cage and snipe through it, can increase its range and move on a different elevation whit permanent buffs... There are classes an archer can't beat if not very well equipped, deal with it, Darkrunners have issues with same gear score tanks too, and they should be the ultimate broken class..."
archeage,3dx653,DarkManiak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:10 2015 UTC,"My point is that archer really isn't viable. Boneyard and snipe? Let's be serious here. Archer has some small utility in zerg pvp but us otherwise replaceable. Melee is better in every situation. Sure darkrunner can lose to tank. That is different than archer being guaranteed to lose to tank in all cases, because they can never do enough damage period."

I had no problems with 90% of the darkrunners etc. Nowadays i wouldn't even bother spec as archer even though i got divine bow. Also the irony of that witchcraft comment. Bitchcraft was one of the cheesiest and most used no-brain tree at that same time when archery was stil viable."
archeage,3dx653,nyym1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"Archery was also a braindead class too before people started to gear up better, 4 skill combo from very high distance, more than mages. Witchcraft is still a braindead class but will be nerfed for the 2nd time soon."
archeage,3dx653,DarkManiak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:53 2015 UTC,"Depends a lot what kind of archery you're playing. Primeval, especially without a shield is squishy af, so you can't really play it without thinking what you're doing. Also, many got delphinad weapons + epherium armors at that time already so it certainly wasn't effective only against starter gear."
archeage,3dx653,nyym1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"Witchcraft is actually really hard to use well.  Putting CA on and purging your self in the middle of a fight, or using purge for silence, switching targets to CC the other guy you are fighting...its harder than any melee class which is all mashing the trip button."
archeage,3dx653,luniz420,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"shadowplay isn't really getting nerfed per say.  Stalkers Mark: They are removing the 21% dmg received but they  are adding total dmg accumulation for both melee and mage, it is a direct nerf to archery however."
archeage,3dx653,Redelfen,4,Mon Jul 20 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"Damage accumulation is based on the flat value (50 per attack hit). This may buff the damage output at low gears, but a huge nerf to single target damage output for average and above players.   To add some math, precision strike has multiplier of 460% melee attack with base damage of 496. 21% increase in damage is same as addition of 96.6% multiplier and 104.16 base damage. Assuming you have 500 melee attack, which is pretty subpar, this results in additional ~587 damage from a single precision strike. If flat damage from stalker's mark stays same, that's about equal to 12 attacks hit during the duration.   For a crude generalization, if you have 500 attack (melee, magic, whatever), to kill a player at 15000 hp, you need at least 3000% multiplier done during the battle. And of course, all skills have base flat damage, so this may go down to maybe 2500% at most. All players have their armors so there is a bit of mitigation. Let's say 35%. That would require you to do 875% more multiplier totaling at 3375%. With 21% bonus from stalker's mark, you need to deal 2789% (3375%/1.21) to kill a target. This translates to 586% coming from stalker's mark and equals to 2930 flat damage. In order to do same amount of damage, you will have to land 50 attacks during stalker's mark duration. If you actually PvP often you will realize this is a ridiculous number of attacks for one duel. So yeah. Lower total burst potential in 2.0, more buff to defensive/tanky builds."
archeage,3dx653,tuieee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:51 2015 UTC,Enigmatist with 2.0 stalkers + skill que would be quite amazing
archeage,3dx653,wagwanimal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:31 2015 UTC,"Not really, enigmatist want to wombo combo you in a KD, the +21% damage from stalkers is a huge part of this. Even if we assume you will do enough hits to make up for the loss of 21% damage (you wont) the damage is still delayed until the stalkers mark falls off."
archeage,3dx653,nalt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"depends on your play style really.  So many ways to play enigmatist.  I personally do not rely on 1 shot combo build with SM.  Since most arena ppl in my server are over 4.5k GS.  I rely more on the constant slow CC/kiting style. I barely use stalkers mark.  But I can see this being a nerf to leech runners tho, your SM+SS+leech+nodachi wont be as effective."
archeage,3dx653,Redelfen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"the stalkers mark nerf is the largest nerf to non archery classes  the frequency of attacks influences the benefit you get from it, of which archers have the most"

And if it is anything that I understand at the moment they are simply removing damage amplifier and keeping total damage stack.  The main difference is all classes can make it stack HOWEVER the current version can only stack 20 times if I recall and thusly making it still shit.

archeage,3dv0wp,zackattackbrawl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:56:17 2015 UTC,easiest way is to buy/make music paper and use it. It costs 100 LP to start and goes to your artistry.   Cheapest would be to make and resell the music paper but that takes a long time.

Well, what about gear? Should i get the healing power weapon first? Then what's next? I'm trying to craft the Farm Wagon but since the thunderstruck trees are like 400g each it will take a while :P."
archeage,3dx852,chaeidras,2,Mon Jul 20 08:07:18 2015 UTC,"since heal equip is difficult to get (thanks to xl games changing healing from magic to heal power but forgetting to seed heal gear, then only seeding t4 osidian armor which needs epherium) you should focus on your weapon first.   if, in the long run, you want to play mainly pve then you should get a 2 handed weapon whereas if you will pvp more then you should get a 1 handed club and shield. there are good quest rewards to begin with and then you should craft t1 obsidian of each.  for the 2 handed weapon you could farm hasla token and grind the t1-3 hasla 2 handed club. it just takes time but is well worth the grind since t3 (600 token) is comparable to epherium.  you can continue doing your trade runs, burning your ap there and then farm hasla. when you got your farm hauler you can start saving your money for decent healer armor"
archeage,3dx852,DHTs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:44:09 2015 UTC,"For healing, you definitely want to get an obsidian shortspear or 1 handed club and shield. 2H gives you max possible healing, but the survivability trade off just isn't worth it. I've healed just about everything there is to heal with a tier 3 celestial obsidian weapon, you just don't need much more than that.  For armor, there is a dungeon called Greater Howling Abyss in Hellswamp, and the cloth armor set from there is actually fairly decent for healing. Ultimately you will want a set of Stone Cloth if you plan on healing as your primary activity, but GHA will tide you through until you can get that just fine."

archeage,3dx852,xmatt24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:20 2015 UTC,I suggest Golden Ruins for leveling. You'll have a chance for an Auroria cloak which you'll want and will pick up a bunch of good coin purses you can open if you ever don't have the time to do trade runs.
archeage,3dx852,KneelBeforeMyMinions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:31 2015 UTC,"i disagree, mostly because finding a library party/raid isnt hard (im on kyrios so maybe its different elsewhere?) and for leveling it is a lot better, the only real downside would be the fact you dont get the obsidian for the gear your going to try and get. although if your grinding for gear, you should work on your weapon first so exoloch/sungold fields is better. as for the cape drop, my guild does a raid grinding in auroria at least once every 3 or so days, we kill hundreds upon hundreds of mobs per trip and ive only ever seen one haunted chest... which happened while i was solo farming. doing trade runs is good for the gold (especially if you can get a guildy to lend a ship) but grinding in library is better for the coinpurses, leveling skills, and getting to 55 so you can honor gem your weapons effectively."

As Untouchable765 said , you need Patron at least if you wanna play the game and enjoy it.   Call viability has Increased alot, after they introduced Obsidian weapons, so basically a shortspear gives you Healing power and melee damage, a katana gives oyu Magic attack and Melee dps. Giving you more tools and being able to switch between multible classes without having to buy new weapons all the time :)  In a few months there will be a Totally new server, with its on AH and only new players.

archeage,3dwwfm,Redelfen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:02 2015 UTC,I agree. It has its place but others are better. I probably wouldn't put it in world pvp over the ones you have listed. I would however put it above your 1v1 list and remove arcanist. Ollo has some geared mages that run cabalist
archeage,3dwwfm,NgArclite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"It is hard to rank cabalist over arcanist, because arcanist provides the necessary chase/kite ability while providing magic defense (shrug it off and conv shield).  Same gear and same skillwise, cabalist stand no chance vs an arcanist.  But vs classes like hexblade/shadowblade cabalist would do better I am sure."

Revenants seem to be the only popular DPS class with sorc/occ/X by adding auramancy. you get in, do aoe combos and get out then use sorc ranged moves while aoe on cooldown."

archeage,3dvq5a,Riliify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:20 2015 UTC,"people like to mix it up, the Obsidian parts that gives you the most, are benefits is :  Boots, helmet and gloves. So you could do 3 part Obsidian, 4 part Delphinad / epherium Earth.   At least on my server (Eanna - EU) Plate is super viable again, since most people are playing Physical based classes now adays.   For shield, you could do Either delphinad or Obsidian. Tho atm a Delphinad shield should be alot cheaper then a T4 Obsidian shield. Why I have no idea :P   You could do Obsidian bow aswell for the extra stamina, and Maybe a Obsidian Lute for the M.def.   For Mainhand, as a paladin you could go a few ways. Delphinad Club / Obsidian Club / Obsidian Shortspear. Tho I would recommend a T4 Obsidian Shortspear, as it has good dps, and good healingpower. Shortspears also gives you a small chance to pierce the armor and that gives you alot of extra damage.   The shortspear is also super viable as a Darkrunner.   Im playing Inquisitor my self, Battlerage, Shadowplay, Vitalism.  Same dps as a DR almost, but with heales, instead of super mobility.   But if you get the gear I stated above, you will have the posebility to swap between, Paladin, Darkrunner, Inquisitor, abolisher, Blighter. Giving you a more freely setup.   Epherium Earth parts also works. ITs all about the Reciliiance gems, and Toughness gems :)   Estimated price on AH 3 Cluster would be around : Divine Obsidian shortspear T4 : 11.5k  Delphinad Shield Flame / Earth  : 8.5k-10k  Obsidian T1 bow any grade : 350-400g  Illustrious earth flute : 350-500g   Epherium Earth 4 parts (Waist, wrists, pants , chest) : around 12k.  Delphinad Earth 4 parts : 25-30k  Obsidian t4 Helmet, boots , gloves (celestial) = 12k   Summery : with Epherium Earth parts   44,9k gold. You could offcourse get it cheaper :)   Hope this helps. and Good luck!"
archeage,3dvq5a,sookie45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to play both classes on a consistent basis, id say earth leather and obsidian mix. Get your 4 piece earth and 3 obby pieces w/melee attack+crit dmg (helm, gloves and i think chest?). Paladin is an extremely versatile class that can work with almost any armor class, but goes well with tanky stats. DR is the  roflstomp one shot class and goes well with offensive stats, so an earth/obby mix would appear to be the best mix to go for. As for delph/eph, its really what you can afford. Just know that your earth pieces will always be resellable, so if you wanna iust go for eph to start you off its not the end of the world.   Also, if you go with the earth/obby mix, consider getting a cold anguish for your offhand (i always mix the 2 up) for the extra crit when duel wielding."

archeage,3dvxdu,WyzeThawt,2,Mon Jul 20 07:34:59 2015 UTC,"for a noob daggerspell i would recommend obsidian katana/shield. daggerspells usually have more prolonged combat since we use tons of CC and this setup, plus experience with when to use what CC's on who, will help you survive many ganks and the tons of mess ups you will make by breaking you CC's too early.  staff is awesome as well but id recommend it more once you get used your combos and CC since its more glass cannon. this is the ideal weapon for daggerspells as you can CC then go to town and move on to next opponent.  katana/t4 v2 dagger are good for getting many different skills off fast. i like this better for crit focused builds better than as a daggerspell since the more skills they put out in a short time, the higher the chance that mulitple moves will crit. i wouldnt personally run this as my main build but i can see how some may like the style."

Now both sides have quieted down, and your best bet is to advertise your mentee status at your server's peak times and hope for the best.

archeage,3dvpky,BroskiPlaysDaGAIMZ,2,Sun Jul 19 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you have two options really. You can join a very active, high population server but people are extremely geared in general on those servers. On top of everyone being geared, money is generated from world events that are dominated by many of these servers' main alliances so it is tough to get your foot in the door of them.  Another option would be to go to a lower population server that is behind in progression so you can catch up decently easy. I would recommend this because merges are coming up soon and you can get some gear going for when they actually happen.  For high population, I'm really enjoying Kyrios. Other options would be Aranzeb, Ollo and Naima.   For low population, Enla is a new-player friendly server. Calleil is kind of a drama central. I haven't played on Calleil, Lucius, Salphira, Inoch and Ezi though but I imagine they are pretty decent."

On Salphira there is a guild called Slayerz that dominates the server and locks all world boss content to themselves. Basically there was a large group of guilds that was against slayers however they were well known for duping items, DDOSing the server and people's teamspeak servers, and in general being toxic players. This group has left Salphira to join Forest Crow (that massive guild on your server Aranzeb). As a sort of welcoming gift, people seem to suspect that  one of the guild leaders decided to DDOS the hell out of Aranzeb.   When the server gets DDOSed it forces it to reset. This can cause world events such as the delphinad ghost ships to trigger at times they are not intended to start at, and aparently also allowing the duping of items or cheating with regrades.   To be clear i dont believe in most of this stuff, but this is what everyone is saying.   TLDR: toxic guild from another server joined your server and now Arenzeb has server connection problems."

You'll want to find a worldgate, such as those located in Solis Headlands on East, or Marianople on West, and use one of those to go to Halcyona or another PvP zone to continue progressing. I would suggest Halcyona --> Hellswamp --> Hasla, in that order.   You really just want to get to 50 and get the quest gear from Hasla, then get into a guild which can carry you through Serpentis to get you up to speed quickly. You can craft a tier 1 obsidian weapon on the cheap, which you'll later regrade and upgrade into a viable late-game weapon.  Hope this helps :-)"

Now I can add that no matter what class you are playing you will need at least 500 of your main stat to reach 100% Hit chance of magic, melee or ranged, unless you are use many skill points in Auramancy (Improved Targeting, and Magic Condenser passives).  If you are using Auroria items you should be focusing on their passive abilities, for example wearing [Auroria Soulbane Shirt] could be very useful if you are playing a Skullknight or any other type of Defensive/Supportive class with Occultism.  I would say that going with crafted items is never a mistake, because you can always trade them in, for something else.  If you decide to use Auroria or Obsidian you need basically a vast experience with the class you are playing because once you equip it, it becomes Untradeable.  I would say that you should first answer WHAT class you want to play, and when you gain enough experience gear choice will become obvious.  ArcheAge is very deep game, and when someone tells you that Darkrunner is the only Meta that has existence in the game, it means they reached good combination (a bit obvious combination) of Melee Skill trees and stopped researching further."

Personally i would highly recommend a secpter/shield combination for Demonologist and most mage classes in general. The extra magic damage from a staff just is not worth it when you look at how much survivability a shield gives you.   Im not going to tell you how to play your class too much as i have only ever used demonologist for library farming a few times, but i know that hell spear + crows + chain lightning and then into searing rain was what i was doing.   What i can say is try to get a full set of obsidian cloth to start with, and remember your weapons are always the most important thing in terms of gear progression. To some extent you can kinda ignore your accessories, and put more time into weapon/armor progression.   Dont gem or lunafrost your gear until it is at exactly where you want it to be for a long time, especially if it is obsidian. When you upgrade a piece of obsidian gear, it will lose all of its gems/frost and also lose any imaging you may have done.   If you can find a guild that will take you under their wing for Serpentis then do that, as that gear set will help you out a lot. Hope anything i said wasnt too wrong :P"

archeage,3du9qv,eliumdun,2,Sun Jul 19 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"Purge - banshee wail - lassitude - magic circle - meteor - chain lightning - bubble trap - arch lightning. That is the typical pvp mage combo.   I guess if he is only doing PVE then a staff might be nice, but personally i will always tell someone to use a shield + scepter/katana. This is a pvp mmo and i feel its important to keep the pvp side of things in mind when gearing. A katana is actually better for small scale pvp where the cast time reduction is more important. A scepter however is better for large scale pvp because of the added magic damage. Small scale pvp is all about cc abilities and out-skilling your opponent, large scale pvp is all about aoe damage and focusing targets."

archeage,3du01c,Spacemole,6,Sun Jul 19 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm primeval forever, but defence is so strong at the moment everyone's basically melee and will trip lock you.  There are many classes, but darkrunner is the dominant one. When your caught, and based on the fact it's the most mobile class they will catch you if your anything but good, they will combo after combo and keep you on your ass while they chunk your hp like butter. Precision strike will hit you for 1/2 hp if your not tanky, nodachi precision strike will likely 1 hit you.  Witchcraft is strong at the moment too, it's the cc skill tree.  Primeval is the best archer, but archery low at the moment after a period of strength. We're going to be hit further, at least in 1v1 when we loose our damage increase on stalkers mark.  Blighter and abolished are the tanks. Shadowblade and darkrunner are the assassins.   Primeval is the archer, trickster and stone arrow where good when archery was hot but you don't see so many anymore.    Just rush level 50 and get in the library. I could get you from 1-50 in a few hours so you can repick skills. Archeage is very political, heavily influenced by economy and a guild is essential.   Pirate life is hard. It's like an afterthought in the game by the devs. I am one myself but we get by as the most dominant guild on server. There is no advantage of being a pirate besides you can bloodlust your friends  and play with people from the other faction. Not trying to deter, just warning you.  Gear is a constant race. You can reach a point that you think your far enough ahead but eventually people will catch up. It's not like other games where you gain x set from y dungeon and your done.  Rng on regrades and crafts will take you through the ringer. It's a KR so expect and accept it.   As an archer, don't get hasla. The only viable bows are delphinad ( 1/112 chance to craft that) or obsidian which is guaranteed. Competitively, you need a divine grade one so your best bet is make an obsidian bow t1 and try over and over till it's divine. We do this as if it breaks you loose 300 gold in bow, now 5k+. When divin upgrade to a fugitive and then outlaw gold permitting.  For your hands, craft 2xt1 obsidian daggers and keep them till everything else is done. When they are upgrade them, or upgrade one and get a Falcons t4 shortspear. Puncture passive op.  Gear wise if you have nothing get yourself a serpentis set form the 10 man. You'll then want ephirium/ delphinad squal or gale if your brave. Squals better for sure but I'm a gale chooser.   Obsidian leather is the same a squal, but unreadable so not my preference but if you choose it you will be tanky as hell, and still shoot missiles."
archeage,3du01c,xerev,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:02 2015 UTC,"If you're dead set on an archer-type class, I would recommend stone arrow over primeval, big survivability increase for very little difference in damage.  Otherwise mages are pretty op right now, could choose one of the many variants of those."

archeage,3du01c,Swiffles33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"If you are serious about this game, which I'm sure you are, playing a class like primeval at the moment is countered very easily to the rise in shield wielders and general damage reduction. I fear that unless you invest heavily into this class and learn all the tricks of the primeval trade, you might not fully enjoy your pvp experience with AA. That being said, on to your questions.  1- lvl 1-50 is fast, should only take a week tops if you solo quest your way to 50 casually. There are xp pot consumables to help you out so keep that in mind. You could always ask someone for a power level, i dont find this method particularly profitable since you will be afking and learning nothing whilst someone grinds mob xp for you. Also certain dungeons or daily quests will help give you good xp bonuses. After 50, head to library (join a daily raid or a library boss raid for great xp gains) I'm a chill player so im still lvl 54, I dont find to much of a difference in pvp but that's just me.  2-through quests you will get some farm land plots you can place in farm zones (most good or easily accessible zones are fully plotted). You have a few options: join a guild which has designated guild land, also join a family with a shared house or estate of some sort. You can also buy housing or land from other players with in game gold later down the track. You can start doing housing at any time in the game but I think you should make getting lvl 50 and then finding a guild your top priorities.  3- the best kind of bows are crafted, you can try your luck at crafting but its pure RNG and might be easier for you to just make gold and buy a good bow down the track. For primeval a Gale, Lightning or Tidal bow will be decent. Once you are level 50 you may want to get a hasla bow to stark you off. Try and save up for an Obsidian Bow and then up grade it as a different choice from the original crafted bow sets.  General tips: Find a good guild, know what they are about wether its pvp intensive or pve. Avoid a troll or asshole guild if you are serious about the game (not even worth going into detail here). Know your polotics on your server, keep up to date with in game events. Make friends, dont be afraid to ask for help and have fun :) also 1 hour in game is 10 mins real time (this gets asked to often in faction chat)  My questions to you: what do you want out of this game? What server are you on? Whats your IGN?"

archeage,3du01c,darrkone999,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:01:49 2015 UTC,Leveling from 1-50 can be achieved by your average questing in game.  Any and all labor use will give you experience.  You unfortunately cannot direct line a bow in this game to the best because of RNG.  You can however craft good bows to aid you while leveling however once you hit Illustrious in craft you will likely stop there unless luck is on your side.  You cannot have a house until level 15 and honestly if you can find a spot for it put it down other then that you will likely have a hard time placing it.  Primeval is currently incredibly weak.  If you are going to be the least bit concerned with pvp (as you should because thats what the focus of this game is) then you will be incredibly sub par because the archery damage is not there.  Also you need enormous amounts of gold to get the gear you need to be somewhat relevant.  I wish you good luck dont invest to heavily though this game in september will have new servers opened I would recommend those.  So for now play and learn on the servers that exist then move to the fresh one.  That way you are starting out fresh.
archeage,3du01c,Faddler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not in any sense of the word good..but ive been playing since alpha so...That has to count for something right?....right  !)Err..everyone always say overacheive quests, that seems to work. That and burning labor helps too! If you are patron at least.  2)around..30? Then you can techncially just craft your way to 50, but it takes longer I guess?  3)Find? Well if you grind aurioa for the right leather piece then yes, the odds of that happening and getting the right one is kinda low, its better and cheap to just buy the item with the gold you farmed  4)The bow starts at level 24 , press O go to woodworking then go to bow, You start at apprentice? bow and you just go from there. then look into obsidian items when you are 50.  5) I'm bad at this game ;-; and I already feel bad for giving shit advice."
archeage,3du01c,anewitguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"Level 1-50 is going to be quite short if you log some hours. It takes about a week if you spend most of your time overachieving quests. Remember to keep your gear after about level 30 and break it down with evenstones to get crafting materials. Everything else get's pretty self-explanatory. Level 50-55 is a bit rougher, it's really just a grind that's not difficult. There's raid everyday at reset time to do the dailies so I would say do that and spend the other time working on gear I would wait until level 50+ to build your houses, gardens or boats. You won't take proper advantage of them until then and if you're on a fun/populated server you'll have to pay for land.  Yes, but best in slot in this game is extremely unreachable. To be honest, gearing a class isn't sort of a ""best in slot"" thing until the dead-end of crafting so you should look around at your options, crafted gear, obsidian gear, auroria gear, dungeon gear, see what you can afford at the time and make a judgement. You can craft a bow for sure. If you go to a carpentry workbench or hit O on your keyboard and go to carpentry, you'll see options for many bows to craft. They start at level 20, then 24 > 30 > 34 > 40 > 44 > 50 > 50 > 50 > 53. At the last 5 tiers, level 44 > 53 when you craft an item to those levels they turn into a sealed bag that you have to open to see what item is inside. This sealed bag drops 1 of 4 types of bows but only 1 type is upgradeable. So you have a 1 in 4 shot of getting the next tier of bow. This is why a lot of people cry about RNG in this game. You can keep your bow with you until level 44 where you might get a terrible one. Don't get super hardcore into the game. I was part of a guild that literally researched the game and came up with spreadsheets out of our ass since alpha. We would practice tactics for launch and when launch hit we didn't play, we worked. We were very successful but I truly did not enjoy the game until my guild disbanded. If you spend all of your time worrying about profit, etc. you will ruin the game for yourself since it will burn you out. Also, get a guild that suits your playstyle. Servers will remember you so try to find one that is decently respectful and successful but if you're le XD trel dank maymay you can do that too I guess.   PS: I'm not going to tell you to not play Primeval, but archers can be quite underwhelming at the moment because of how they aren't working well with an in-game stat causing them to hit 1s with endless arrows against players AND causing their other abilities to not hit hard at all."
archeage,3du01c,tuieee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:16:26 2015 UTC,Just a point about gear.  Once you hit 50 i'd suggest running Greater Howling Abyss  for leather pieces.  With a couple of 55s you can fly through and do boss clears in 30 to 45 minutes.   Also watch the auctioneer for cheap Auroria leather pieces.  I was able to gear up my primeval alt in a full suit by sniping (pun intended) pieces for less than 50g each.   The nice thing about Auroria pieces is the very high stam and mostly useful on equip bonuses.
archeage,3du01c,IIReignManII,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"1) Questing should get you to 50, but this get quite boring and repetitive. If you have patron status you can use labor to gain exp, which will speed up the process. There are potions called [Vocation Tonic] or [Professional Tonic] that increases exp reward from using labor. All exp gain from labor is based on amount used and level of the profession it's being used for. So exp gain from 10 labor x 6 is same as using 60 labor.  Past level 50, you will be leveling in auroria library. Most of exp will be coming from daily quests and library boss raids. This is a very long grind, so try not to burn yourself out. The exp gain from library is huge compare to pre-lvl 50, so lvling other skill trees to 50 becomes easy by this point.  2) Main usage for land is for placement of your crafting stations, bed (daily bonus labor), proxy for TP location, and farming (crops, trees, larders). Having a land really depends on what kind of profession you will be using to make money. It's not as necessary if you aren't seeking for farmer/pack running profession. Price of the land may vary on servers.  3) Unlike WoW, the whole journey to acquire ""best gear"" is extremely long and competitive process. Theoretically, mythic ayanad everything would be the best, but this is practically impossible. Nowadays, unique epherium level of armors (serpentis, t3 obsidian) and celestial delphinad equivalent weapons (divine t4 obsidian) are fairly standard to be relevant in PvP. I suggest you to look through archeage database and compare stats at each grade.  4) Crafting is highly dependent on RNG. After some low tier crafts (I am guessing this is what you were referring to), you will reach illustrious tier gears (lvl 44). From this stage and on you will received RNG box called ""Sealed [insert tier name] [insert gear type]."" Opening this will provide you a gear with a random prefix and only one prefix will be upgradeable:   illustrious (1/4 chance) -> magnificent (1/4) -> epherium (1/6) -> delphinad (1/6 + design)  -> ayanad. Delphinad -> ayanad upgrade requires very rare ayanad design for the same gear type.   On top of this, gears have grades that goes from grand -> rare -> arcane -> heroic -> unique -> celestial -> divine -> epic -> legendary -> mythic. This is also very rng dependent and biggest gold sink in the game. Gears have chance to break on failure past celestial. Celestial -> divine regrade has 10% success rate and it goes down by 2.5% for divine -> epic -> legendary. So best would be mythic ayanad gale bow assuming you nail all the rng.  5) Take  your time to learn the economy and the market. Otherwise you will feel overwhelmed by the gear differences without knowing a way to catch up. Find a progressive guild. Try out different classes to learn their skillsets, CC, anti CC, cd. Keep in mind archers do not function well in full potted pvp due to flat reduction from spellbook: brickwall - this blocks big portion of your endless arrow damage."

archeage,3dvbxf,thedeadoctopus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"The best labor/silver ratio you'll find out of prince coinpurses. They drop archeum trees and regrade braziers which are a majority of the profit you make from larceny nowadays. Dean's coinpurses drop more flat gold and have a chance for shards, crystals and essences of archeum but the chance is so low that it never adds up. Farming Prince coinpurses comes with the chance for auroria armor drops and the chance for haunted chest capes. Farming Dean's coinpurses comes with the chance of ayanad designs, library weapons/armor and library materials. You choose which you like better."

The problem is people think they are going to just find something worth money laying on the ground for free. It's a player driven economy that requires actually interacting with other players to get stuff. The other problem is people don't know that different areas have different strengths and weaknesses. They don't know that properties by the sea are used to stage packs and are therefor worth more. They either try to sell worthless land for too much or they QQ about land being too expensive when they are looking in the wrong place.

To answer your question correctly, the normal thing to get is shards and crystals are a proc just like dust. so i usualy plant 12 every time and about 2-3 go crystal and 2-3 go dust as well  its usualy sunlight or moonlight starlight is quite rare so yea its a gbit hard to loose money here archeum trees are a gold mine and rumbling trees are a waste of money go for radiant"

I can solo bosses a mage or melee character with equivalent gear shouldn't be able to as an archer. I usually have the advantage in large scale group fights and open world PvP. For 1v1 I go Bastion which is more tanky and plan on switching to Druid in the future. My advice would be to level as an archer to 50. Then go to the library with what ever skillsets you want to switch into. Try Archery, Shadowplay and Auramancy if you aren't that already. Or you can drop Auramancy for Defense of the mobs hit you too hard. I know that quite a few melee players in my guild switch to Archery for PvE content."

archeage,3ds96s,tuieee,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"Level up to 50 is not so long and Aa level is like: 3 tree with their own lvl and your main level.  Basicaly, lvl 1 to 10 is like a begin ""quest"", at lvl 10 you have to chose 3 tree (all begin lvl 10), you can change when you want (it's cost gold only), same for skill point, when you up lvl 11, 3 selectec tree up to lvl 11 too, same at level 20.  If you change one tree at level 20 for another, you keep your old tree lvl 20 and go with 2 tree lvl 20 and one lvl 10 (who need less xp to up when the tree is low level), but to up lvl 21 you have to keep one tree to the lvl 21 so you really can do a lot of mix/test.  One advice, keep one main tree depending of your play style and test/look the other tree who can make a good mix with. And later when your 3 main tree are lvl 55 you can swap all to xp from craft for example ;). XP gain is based on your main level."
archeage,3ds96s,tuieee,2,Sun Jul 19 00:57:52 2015 UTC,"melee class (battle rage + x + y) is usually good for overcoming gear differences because their burst rotation is done while enemy is CC'd. (plus they get 2k armor pen from battlerage)  mages (sorcery + x + y) need some decent gears to function but all around good for 1v1, raid vs. raid and pve.  archers (archery + x + y) need top notch gears to function properly due to their dps relying on endless arrows, which is punished harshly by armors and flat reductions."
archeage,3ds96s,allexd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:34:43 2015 UTC,"So as I rolled Archer first I may wish to drop and start Melee for the Battlerage?  What about Vitalist for heals, or is that relegated to support status and not PvP viable alone?"
archeage,3ds96s,Spacemole,2,Sun Jul 19 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Vitalism is mostly for healers, but class like paladin (battle rage, defense, vitalism) or argent (battlerage, auramancy, vitalism) can be pretty strong - very difficult to kill if enemy doesn't blow you up with one rotation.  This means you need enough gears to sustain through enemy's dps, so this rely on gears quite a bit as well.  If your lvl is high enough (50+) to enter library lvling other trees to 50 doesn't take too much time. Just play around with classes and find what you like the most. If you put efforts on progressing you will eventually acquire good enough gears to excel at what you do. (free armor set from serpentis dungeon is usually good enough for melee/mage)"

archeage,3dqtqj,LTKnuckles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"I am not a darkrunner. Darkrunner isn't bad in open world, it's just that normally a darkrunner can just tunnel vision with no concern for the environment around them. Your only goal is to be close all the time. All other classes have to analyse the surroundings, and prevent the melee being close. Darkrunner can be so much fun, you have to play like an assassin and choose your battles or you will die. Yes there are times you can't attack, but all you are missing out on is some endless arrow shots really. You still have a bow :P"
archeage,3dqtqj,Neoxide,-5,Sun Jul 19 09:46:33 2015 UTC,"That is 100% correct, Darkrunner is only decent in 1v1 arena. For anything else daggerspell is the way to go."
archeage,3dqtqj,nyym1,3,Sat Jul 18 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"This should be reversed. Daggerspell is good at 1v1 because of CC chains but witchcraft can't cheese very well outside of 1v1. Darkrunner CC doesn't break on damage and it takes 5 seconds or less to kill someone, which is why you see them in open world the most. Battlerage + Shadowplay is probably the best combo for stunlocking someone and killing them quickly.  For casters sorcery + songcraft is the highest damage output in the game but lacks the CC, utility, and mobility of melee glass cannons. Enigmatist can run but the damage isn't nearly as high as battlerage."
archeage,3dqtqj,LTKnuckles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"It also takes a lot less than 5 seconds to die as dr in open world. If you say open world darkrunner is easy to play, then i guess you haven't tried.   edit: point was that it's a lot easier to play ranged class in open world."

Poophand and bubble trap are great for catching people out and allowing your allies to consolidate on your RANGED cc. The benefit with daggerspell is that you can provide huge burst and cc utility from 25m out.  However with Darkrunner, you have cc and damage that is only effective from 4m or less meaning to kill the enemy dps(archers/mages) you need to be inside the enemy raid where anyone can hit you. Also Darkrunner is a glass cannon class aimed at pushing out as much damage as possible, this does not help them when 5 archers fire charged bolts at them and kill them instantly."

archeage,3drt8u,awkwardvlog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:44:36 2015 UTC,This may have something to do with how easy it is to get purses as opposed to something like making a bow. The labor to silver ratio for purses is still very high in comparison to other proficiencies. So while it may seem underwhelming it is still very much balanced.
archeage,3drt8u,awkwardvlog,2,Sun Jul 19 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"ye sure, however regardless of how much silver it give you, after you reach 180k in larceny you kinda do feel like you have to ""farm more"" simply because you want to spend you labor effectively.  the point i am pursuing is that maybe one can reward players who max out larceny (or any other profession) with time saving rather than time consuming mechanics.  regarding larceny specifically: many professions have ""mass production"" as a perk, while larceny ""only"" has labor reduction. maybe based on that one could arrange higher droprates of green purses, or even just a chance to drop 1-3 coinpurses instead of simply 1. so many options to explore, just need to pool ideas for this and make trion aware^"
archeage,3drt8u,Norikami,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:07 2015 UTC,I think that you would have to prove that there is an actual issue. Since there is no profit discrepancy and obtaining the items is fast and rewards xp there doesn't really seem to be an issue. A mass opening of purses wouldn't really work since there are so many different purse types. They would have to add he feature for every single bag type. Or at least from princes on up.

With it there is no way for them to avoid being Charmed unless they have something to purge the debuff, they can't just Shrug the stun to avoid the Charm. Its also a good way to bait out Shrug to open up for you to Overwhelm.  That said, the V1 staff offers slightly higher M.Attk and higher defense penetration, and the usefulness of the V2 staff effect is entirely reliant on how much you use Charmed for the fear."

Then i buy lots of labor pots to mine stone and craft hereafters with so i can get to atleast get to lvl 44 and then i use the rest of the credits on archeum boxes so i can craft some illust gear.

archeage,3dm4ih,dasweazel,6,Fri Jul 17 11:29:45 2015 UTC,"Note. Before reading my post, keep in mind that I just roughly went around translating whatever I could find regarding healing gear. Some stuff might be translated wrong or some details might be slightly off, but I think the general information is ok.  It looks like in 1.8, there's a new daily event quest in Diamond Shores translated to ""Flowers of the Blind"" that happens at 6:00 PM (18:00) Game Time. Completing these quests gives you this item which, along with Moonlight Archeum Essence, Sturdy Ingot, and Beautifully Colored Fabric, you can craft the mats into gear at that event craft bench. The gear consists of the Hood, Chest, Shoes, Gloves, and Pants. The stats on the healing gear you can craft are as follows:    Gear Piece Stats    Hood Defense 128, Magic Defense 643, Stamina 31, Spirit 63   Chest Defense 214, Magic Defense 1071, Stamina 147   Shoes Defense 85, Magic Defense 428, Intelligence 31, Spirit 31   Gloves Defense 85, Magic Defense 428, Intelligence 21, Spirit 42   Pants Defense 171, Magic Defense 857, Spirit 117       When you craft them, they are automatically Heroic level. Stat-wise, these are somewhere around Unique Epherium, but Epherium has the 4-set, 7-set bonuses. Additionally, I do not believe they are regradeable.     In 2.0, they are also adding (edit. the option to add healing gear, so it's not in yet) healing gear to Serpentis. According to this picture, it look like there'll be some sort of club (Can't tell if 1H or 2H). A hood and chestpiece are also shown, so highly likely a full set of healing gear will be added to Serpentis as well. I cannot find the stats for these though.  There's also a new ring quest that drops from the last Serpentis boss similar to the Dream Ring quest. However, this ring is specifically for healers and also cannot be worn at the same time as the Dream Ring.   There are only two phases of the ring listed right now on the ArcheAge KR Wiki. I think there are other phases in between similar to the Dream Ring, but I am not sure. The first phase listed gives Healing Increase +.5% and Skill Damage +.5%. The second phase listed has a passive where every attack reduces a target's Physical and Magic Defense -175, stacked up to 4 times. You also generate additional aggro. Healing and skill damage are increased by 2.5%.  That's all I could find regarding new healing gear. If there's something else anyone knows about, feel free to add on whatever you know."
archeage,3dm4ih,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:12:47 2015 UTC,its also worth noting this workbench can also craft plate and leather sets of armor. lets you easily fill that archeamaster role. i wasnt aware though the armor wasnt regradeable. Cant have everything i guess. at least having a unique epherium grade set of armor for every class isnt that bad also for more diversity for filling dungeon raids.
archeage,3dm4ih,GGATHELMIL,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all three types of armor are craftable at this workbench. One further thing to mention is that there's a second cloth set that's more magic-based as well along with plate, leather, and the healing cloth set.  And I'm fairly certain the pieces aren't regradeable since I saw a screenshot and didn't see the Korean equivalent of ""Regrade Available"", but the database says they are regradeable. I will try to find the screenshot again though since I know ArcheAgeDatabase's information isn't always 100% accurate.  Edit. Just kidding. Yes, this armor is NOT regradeable. Database also reflects that, I just mistranslated."

Despite the fact that it is boring as hell to watch people doing traderuns or sailing through empty oceans. When Terraria - a 4 year old game that is technically far behind AA - got its big content update 1.3 few weeks ago the game hit 30k+ viewers for the first days. While AA at the same time had less than 300 in total. AA = dead game.
archeage,3dmucj,Scellow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:30:23 2015 UTC,Terraria was a huge game with hundreds of thousands of players. Including myself. It's also kept alive by tons of youtube game channels. It's a lot like minecraft. Archeage is a niche game that half the players want to be one thing and the other half knowing that it is something else.
archeage,3dmucj,Scellow,0,Tue Jul 21 00:28:57 2015 UTC,It's been like this for at least a week now. It constantly displays over 1000 viewers and Archeage usually has around 100 viewers total.

archeage,3dmucj,Scellow,-5,Fri Jul 17 15:46:49 2015 UTC,Hey downvoters how do you explain this then?
archeage,3dmucj,Villentrenmerth,7,Fri Jul 17 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"By simply learning Computer Science.  Data Monitors are highly unreliable, and Twitch's API (https://github.com/justintv/twitch-api) does not provide real-time data. Only real-time access that they combined is Twitch Chat (which doesn't represent amount of total viewers, including anonymous).  Twitch nor Game Publishers doesn't benefit from misleading their viewers by boosting Game in popularity by ""imaginary premium service"", because what gives Twitch's benefit is Viewership of Ads. If you direct your users into ""undervalued/boosted game"" your advertisers will have less hits, and this is what you don't want.  Also, viewer numbers doesn't always relate to the ad's revenue. For example if you have 10,000 viewers on a single channel that runs 10 minutes a day, and 2,000 viewers that runs 10 hours a day, then this second channel will bring more ad revenue.  For most reliable info about API, Viewership and Ad Revenue I would suggest you visiting /r/twitch first, to ask more detailed questions and complete your research.  Also, ask yourself a question: do you really think that Trion has ""spare cash"" to boost their ranks on Twitch, while their recent game update: Skill Queue was total fail?  Also, I didn't cast any votes on your comments, but the second message from you seemed like a genuine question, so here is my answer for it."

The answer to that would be, to be a bruiser and brawl. You do decent dps and a ton of cc making fighting multiple people for extended periods of time possible if you have decent gear. Full tanks damage makes it pretty much useless outside of just engaging. At least with lake your not committed to only being the tank and it also makes you great for roaming pvp."

I wear lake plate for the simple fact that majority of players on my servers are melee dps with a mix of range dps. You can always gem magical defense.   Before you engage pop redoubt, liberation and possibly conversion shield. After you viscous implosion / hell spear and there's a mage in range you can boastful roar them and crippling mire to stun and dmg them. You always have invincibility for incoming God whips.

T4 OBS cloth or Serp should be good for a long time.  You then eventually want to get the 4 pieces Anthalon (Corrupted Kyrios).  Try to get a divine scepter.  I suggest scepter over katana because Revenant (or skullknight) have minimal use for cast speed."

With the 1.8/2.0 housing update we are getting, you can make a house that lets you craft to illustrious on weapons/armor now all it does is remove the first 5 crafts and condenses it down into 1 1400 labor craft. well how does this fix the archeum issue you ask? well it doesnt except from what ive seen of the recipes it reduces the amount of archeum needed by doing one big craft.   From what i saw and think it took crafting a leather cap and required only 6 moonlight crystals to craft a straight up illustrious cap. now doing some math it takes 5 crystals currently and 5 shards and 5 dust to craft a cap. so oit looks like they removed a whole shards worth of archeum. now thats a small amount but it adds up over time. also it seems they removed the requirement for gilda dust on aything illustrious and above."

archeage,3dinku,mmt66,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"While this is correct for SQL, that's not exactly how it's working in game as ""sun%eph"" will return Epherium Sunset Vambracers."
archeage,3dinku,-Howitzer-,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"The game automatically adds a hidden % before and after your search text. So if tou type ""sun%eph"" it actually searches for ""%sun%eph%"".  Now, this doesn't  explain why the search above would return Epherium Sunset Vambraces since the sun and eph strings are out of order. This leads me to believe that maybe the game uses % as more than just a regular wild card and instead its a delimiter. Meaning it will separate the text in strings starting and ending with each %. Then afterwards it does a search looking for items that include every new string in their name, no matter the order. I'm  not in-game right now to test it, though."

Unfortunately, there's no real way to prevent it since disconnects are often outside of a player's control, but if you feel your connection is shaky, don't try doing a trade run.  After it happens, to reconnect, you need to have your hauler despawn somehow. This can either be the 10 minute despawn timer when your cart is far away from you or destroy your hauler. This does mean that your packs will drop on the ground and become free loot though.  I don't believe Trion has addressed this issue yet, or if they have, I don't remember."

archeage,3dkyme,TheDuckExtremist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:47:00 2015 UTC,Depends T4 V1 (Blackleaf) gives you stam so you'll be a bit tankier and you also get the healing power from it so if you decide to roll Pali or Argent or even pick up healing the V1 is better. V2 is full glass cannon and I may be wrong but I believe t6v2 requires a leviathan mat. So you should take that into account

I'm not really into any guilds anymore so I don't know the drama but the faction events are exciting enough and there's not as much purpling as around launch. Probably a bit higher than medium population.  Calleil - Imagine a random deathmatch server in garry's mod RP. That's what Calleil is. The west get bored from so little reds they kill each other just to pass the time. If you're on the west it'll feel like a medium population server but there is very little PvP to be found against the other faction. You can join in the purpling though.  Aranzeb - Forestcrow mage trains everything which is pretty funny. High population for sure, very active and such but Forestcrow dominates most world events.  Ollo - I don't have a character on this server but I've heard it's died down a lot since many people have gotten banned and rerolled servers. Used to be pirate's heaven from what I heared.  Kyrios - The giant. I recently leveled here with a couple of old guild mates looking into what being free-to-play is actually like and it is insanely populated. So many people questing that aren't even bots, faction events with people at them, a community that is generally not too terrible. Reroll here for sure if you want a permanent home until september when the new servers arrive + big patch. Kyrios will simply continue to grow even when the new server comes out because low population people will probably transfer there."

Outplayed by far has the talent. Revive has a credit card and Obsidian Order... does stuff I guess.  Pirate- Last Resort. The one and only guild. Naval combat is always fun against them.

archeage,3dg41a,lexsird,4,Thu Jul 16 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"Good. I think a big problem with rotten green pirates and thieves everywhere is we have dumb people on juries. Innocent should be a rare thing, not handed out like candy. Too often you see the same problem people right back up in front of the jury, night after night, smooth talking or being vocal or popular in chat.   The pirating of people on your own side hurts your side. Sure you can do it, but that doesn't excuse it as right. It hurts that person's efforts, and contributes to the over all negatives that your own side faces.   We shouldn't hand out Innocent to assholes because they keep being such. We need to max them and let them keep racking up points until they are pirates. If they want to act like pirates, then let them be pirates. I think it's pretty weak to abuse the system to get the protections of your own side, the ability to slide up to your victims without problem and gank on them at the worse possible moment.   That's like waiting to fight someone that's fighting a mob and when the fights about over, ganking them. It's effective and it works, but it's also a rat bastard way of doing things. No honor.   Until juries act right, we're going to be plagued with low moral values players who know they can act badly with impunity.Come on juries, grow some guts. Ignore their morally bankrupt reasons for doing what they do, and stop being afraid of them.   I love the reason ""well, the game allows it..."" and ""we were just having fun."" It's a sociopath simulator apparently."

I understand you're probably a carebear and not familiar with the game outside of safezones, but the game is about guilds.   Guilds are their own factions which engage in war, negotiate peace, and occasionally consort with other guilds that might be red.

It only highlights Trion's failed ""justice system"" as the worse pirates are your own damn faction.   ""If you have packs and aren't on my guild's whitelist then I'm gonna kill you."" is the attitude that should land you in the pirate faction real fast.   It doesn't though and the problem compounds as bad behavior is rewarded via this easily exploitable system. What happens people are forced to join whichever collection of douchebags that is on top so that they have a chance of advancing once they reach the ""leave the carebear safezones"" level of play.

archeage,3dl2bk,Atruefatty,2,Fri Jul 17 04:11:16 2015 UTC,"The performance is more or less the same because it is on CryEngine and has seen little optimization. You can take a few steps to improve framerate by dropping shadows and shadow render distance to eliminate most of the CPU load through that. Otherwise, no it's still as bad as before.  The game runs a bit better than launch but not enough to change the system requirements. If you have patron, you earn the same labor being offline as online but F2P still gets shafted by 5 per 5 which makes earning patron through trying to make gold tough. I've recently releveled with a couple of friends to see how this is, as well as to record for a ""New to ArcheAge or Just Returning?"" video and it was horrible getting patron through that. As you play ArcheAge more and more though, the game's labor consumption gets easier. Leveling professions gets you 20% or more labor reduction so you can effectively do more stuff everyday.   Overall, if you didn't give the game too fair of a chance before, right now is a perfect time to pick it up!

I'm not sure what armor and weapons you're using, but you can run Desert (crafted armor with strength/stamina) which will toughen you up a bit. You can also look into getting the 3% damage reduction lunafrost for your chest piece and toughness gems for your legs. Toughness is a PvP-only stat that decreases the damage other players the same level or lower do to you. I know darkrunners with 13k HP that are extremely durable to average-geared players because they simply have so much toughness and damage reduction."

archeage,3dinjd,Faddler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"Oh wow! Yeah okay that explains it. You're undergeared so you're going to feel very squishy no matter what you play at the moment. Here is what I'd recommend if you'd like to be durable. Look into the obsidian armor and get 5 pieces of it. This armor provides very good durability and defence while not breaking the bank too bad. Alternatively, if you'd like slightly more damage and still want tradeable armor in case you switch classes later, you can get magnificent desert leather armor.  Once you get this armor, to further increase your durability I would get the 3% damage reduction for your chest first then get toughness lunafrost and lunagems for your legs. Stacking both of these will increase your defence greatly."

Works very well if there is a raidbreaking class to go in before you and distract/CC the enemy group so you can work your magic without getting killed.

It doesn't have to be used strictly for crowds, it can be single target, which is mostly what melees do except for Fotress and Imprison from the Defense tree.  As the commenter in the link I sent was saying, you basically either go in as an initiator (Behind Enemy Lines into the enemy's mid or back line) then everyone drops AoE magic on it or arrow rains.  If you are not going to be one of the initiators for the group, you can still be useful by finding priority targets to CC, and once the initiation is over stop their retreat.  You can also find priority targets like Clerics and CC them for a good while.  As an abolisher you can put a healer to sleep for 7 seconds and go CC another.  2 Healers down for 7 seconds is DEVASTATING."

archeage,3dhu2d,footmenhau,3,Thu Jul 16 11:48:32 2015 UTC,For most professions there is really little value in going from 90k -> 180k.. just a little less labor.  Hopefully there is a redesign for all professions so that there is actually a reason to level them up all the way.
archeage,3dhu2d,WithoutShameDF,2,Thu Jul 16 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly increased ""rare"" item drops would be ideal for me, even if it means just more green coinpurses it would save time as you put and allow for more overall drops... i think that would be a better experience over more silver per coin purse."
archeage,3dhu2d,80WillPower08,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:57:49 2015 UTC,"totally agree with you. i just proposed all the changes that came to mind when i wass writing. more money (flat silver increase) seemed like somthing that was doable, even though, like you, i would simply prefer more green purses and the sorts, or simply a chance to drop 1-3 coinpurses per mob"
archeage,3dhu2d,DHTs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"By your logic more mining means you have to spend more time mining to get rid of labor, even though you're getting more for it. All the trade skills work this way, and while larceny could certainly use a small boost, identifying haunted chests and library item drops for 150 labor instead of 200 is nice in and of itself."
archeage,3dhu2d,ThorBeerson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:58:30 2015 UTC,"yes of course you get more coinpurses, or at least the potential to open more at least. i understand that it is a benefit the way it is right now.  the idea i am trying to present its a time conserving one: if at max level i could spend less time for the same amount of gold that in itself would make the game experience better. this isnt a larceny exclusive either, im sure everyone would like a ""less time for same value at max proficiency"" mentality or am i wrong? xD  EDIT: less labor for haunted chests (like any other drop basically) is sweet, but you also dont find them regularly. think about it: if larceny simply increased the drop rate of those from 1/1000 to 1/800 i would also farm less since one chest  saves me 20 mobs which drop a regular coinpurse -> again more time to go pvp, dungeons and guild stuff"
archeage,3dhu2d,DHTs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:04:35 2015 UTC,"that is true, but as you get higher mining proff you get more fortuna veins and thus better rewards and faster labor sinking (still more amount of work tho)"
archeage,3dhu2d,robertrijkers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:04:02 2015 UTC,is it confirmed that you get more fortuna veins? as in has someone counted normal veins vs fortuna? mostly it could be down to rng because you would need tens of thousands of veins to get a good average and then compare that to someone with 180k mining  the same problem applies to larceny - hard to really see if you get less at sub 10k larceny vs 180k
archeage,3dhu2d,TankinJenkins,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"Scapes has said that it has no effect, and given how much they messed with coinpurses I think he's probably correct."

What I did is I made several passes until I found a place that I liked. I checked all the names and for possible demos. I knew that the land baron's and their alts would be worthless to try so I looked for people with unused farms or undecorated houses.  I sent them all tells if they were online or sent them in game mail offering to buy the place for a fair price. After about a week I ended up snagging a demo and found a 16 farm for sale that wasn't too far away. Villanelle is super popular for it's views and trade pack staging for overseas trade (don't look for seaside land$$$) I've found maha to be both pleasant to look at and relatively cheap. Doesn't hurt to ask in chat every 15 mins or so.

Right now Patron for a month costs about 950-1000 gold and it takes quite a bit of labor to get that.  Other than that, things do pretty well and the game is fun.  As a fan who played the Alpha, it's definitely bad news after bad news with everything that comes out for this game.  Trion is always putting the best versions of (non-gear) items on the marketplace and XL Games is constantly nerfing drop rates for stuff they buffed.  There is a ton of rampant botting so the price for everything goes way up.  A month ago Apex was 250g and now it's almost at 500g.  The economy is in constant flux.  However, if you just want to play and PVP and avoid all of this drama, a free account can still be a good time."

archeage,3di2ec,ThorBeerson,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:57 2015 UTC,I don't currently play but it doesn't cost you anything to install and try it out and see if its to your liking.

I'm asking if the game's features are good, not what these features are.  (Bad feature would be you need to get some material for an upgrade of clothing but that material can only be gathered by means available only to premium)"
archeage,3di2ec,awkwardvlog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:00:36 2015 UTC,"99.9999% of items available to patrons (premium players) are likewise available to F2P.   That being said, there are only a few exceptions to this: certain mounts, costumes, and luxury consumables from the cash shop in-game... But many things that can only be bought in the cash shop are tradeable among players; i.e. you can buy them for in-game currency from someone who spent real cash.  F2P is harder than P2P, but it's possible. A lot of people suggest paying for the first month of patron to get the ball rolling, and sustaining by purchasing APEX for gold. (APEX is the item that allows you to obtain credits, which you can buy patron with fyi)  Hope that helps a little."
archeage,3di2ec,InfractionRQ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:48 2015 UTC,There are no pay walls. You can achieve credits with in game gold and thus have the option to get all the things a patron can get including patron. There are people who play 10+ accounts and don't pay anything for it all. Most things you do other than killing monsters require labor to do and you don't regenerate labor offline as a f2p player.  So getting patron sucks at first but is sustainable after the first month.
archeage,3di2ec,Smerked,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"Theres no real feature other than higher labor pool and land ownership gated by premium.  Will it take you longer to acquire some items, yes.  Nothing is techinically locked out for a free player."
archeage,3di2ec,voodoona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:56 2015 UTC,"So, here's the thing you can buy patron with in game currency. If you don't mind leaving your computer on, at max level, it should take you about a week or two to be able to buy two apex in game and get patron.   Without a guild you're going to get bored quick. Some guilds will accept pretty much anyone, and are there to help newer players while others are more selective just like any other mmo.   There isn't really a paywall, however gear will take time to get. Most MMO's you can be top geared in like under a month, this game it takes more like 3-4 months if you're just starting out solo. However you can get mid level gear fairly easily, especially if you find a group to do PVE with. It also depends on how quickly you're able to figure out the market, and how much time you're willing to invest.   And yes, premium (Patron) is highly encouraged, namely because it pays for itself each month and makes life in game a lot more enjoyable."

archeage,3di2ec,Smerked,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"As the other two already said, yes.  However to get your first patron status is the hardest part. Labor is what you use to be able to craft, farm, pretty much anything related to making money. As a non-patron you only gain 5 every 10 min labor while logged in and 0 logged out(hence the leaving your computer on and logged in part) where as patron you gain 10 labor every 10min regardless of being logged in or out."
archeage,3di2ec,marcopico,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:07 2015 UTC,"Here's how you do it. You need in-game credit to buy patron status. In order to buy patron status without spending real money, you'll need to buy APEX. Each APEX is worth 1250 in-game credits. Patron status is 2400 credits, so you'll need 2 APEX. Other players sell APEX for gold on the auction house or will advertise on the trade chat channel. The cost of each varies on the time of day and on the server you're playing in. Expect to pay anywhere from 400 - 800 gold for each APEX.  There are plenty of ways to earn gold. You'll be able to find ways searching through this subreddit. Any APEX you buy can only be applied to the account you bought it on. To maximize your APEX purchasing ability, play two characters: one in the North American servers and another in the European servers. Questions?"

The game is heavily affected by the cash shop items being introduced and the radical changes patch to patch which causes massive changes in the auction house which eventually settle a few days after the patch. There is a tough paywall in this game, the subscription in this game can be bought for gold in game but it is very difficult to get the gold as a free-to-play player so I would say paying 15 dollars when you hit max level for the patron subscription is reasonable, then you can pay for it every month after that with in game gold. The community on a couple of the servers are terrible, but Kyrios has been generally accepting of newer players. I've experienced this while leveling there on an alt with friends. People were willing to answer my friend's questions while doing dungeons and even offered us a spot in quite a few guilds. The game promotes douchebaggery but there are still quite a few genuine people left!  Try it out or sure. Definitely the best PvP-ran game out there on the market at the moment."

You will take double if not more time to do stuff that patrons do. For example, you don't need patron to do trade runs, but you need a lot of labor. When you are free to play, you gain 5 labor every 5 minutes you stay online. A patron gets 10 labor online and offline every 5 minutes. One trade pack consumes 70 labor to craft and 70 to hand in.   So, a patron account can craft and hand in 70 minutes, whereas a free to play would need 140 mins of online time to craft one pack."

If you had been a coin purse farmer the whole time you would have noticed that ultimately you have less archeum over all than you did pre-patch.

If you spent 5 labor on one jester purse and you got one crystal you would get 25X the amount you would get from the prince purse and it costs 10 labor.  So 1 dust for twice the labor you would still need 24 more dust to make enough for a single crystal.  So after all is said and done yes coin purses got nerfed.

Rift had too many people at launch so they opened a few more servers and then when it normalized they had too many servers so they had to cut them down. It seems pretty standard mmorpg stuff. The problem with archeage doing it is that it has non-instanced player housing. So it's going to hurt a lot more. The reality is a dead server is the worst marketing an mmorpg can have.

archeage,3de5af,xmatt24,2,Thu Jul 16 08:56:47 2015 UTC,"Trion has a mostly automated and unfair forum banning system.   That said , you don't need to use the forums , it is a total salt mine and reddit is a very valid place to post actual useful content.   If something is broken or just information people want to see , post it here, not only will more people see your information, it is much more likely for trion to fix something that is broken.     Personally I still feel that archeage allowing players to play the ""meta"" has lead to an ultra toxic community on the forum's;   The meta is good , but trion does what it can to keep that off the forums , the archeage official forums is a place to talk about how nice your glider is or try and sell some gear, its not a place to talk about trion staff, how shit XL is or post data mined information.    I dont know in this case , and I do know people get bans for no reason, but people posting data mined information on blizz wow forums would be banned \ deleted too, if you want to do that or complain about developers reddit is a better placce.  Another totally separate issue is that reported serious bugs do not get fixed , if the gods whip bug didnt become high profile and people just reported it the normal ways it would be still in game (if no one complained about it on reddit).   Trion CM's like scapes (and hopefully the new chick) fixed a lot of issues by clicking refresh on reddit , when the same issues get reported in the ticketing system and ignored by the staff paid to look at that shit."

archeage,3dhtwi,ilovesmoking1,4,Thu Jul 16 11:46:37 2015 UTC,"what weapon combo for mage does more damage or does 2h staff do more damage?   It all depends on your build.  If you are playing mage builds that rely on combos or throwing spells in quick succession it will be always be Dual Wielding.  Why? Because if you want to throw Enervate -> Mudhand -> Freezing Arrow -> Flamebolt -> Bubble -> Chain Lightning -> Arc Lightning -> Freezing Arrow -> Flamebolt using Dual Wielding can reduce execution time of your combo from 9 seconds to 6.  But if your damage rotation relies on powerful and long cooldowns: Leech -> Meteor -> Chain Lighting -> Arc Lightning, then a 2H staff will basically melt your opponent with the first spell casted.  Now this is where the major gameplay difference comes when using 2H/Dual Wield: there are some unique builds that are scaling only by your TOTAL MAGIC attack. Remember last time someone told ""Occultism's Mana Stars is insane spell! I'm loving it!""? That's what proves that most mage players doesn't know shit about optimization.  Endless Arrows, Mana Stars, Triple Slash (all instant-cast abilities based on % of your Attack Value) will be always dealing higher damage per second with a 2H weapon and the reason isn't because you attack faster. It's because 2H gives you not only higher Maximum Total Attack value, but also applies 5% Damage increase which allows you to have higher overhead above ENEMY DEFENCE/TOUGHNESS values.  I've been playing with Vitalism since day 1, and this is unique example of how powerful 2H weapon is: every spell that is limited by it's cooldown and/or not limited by it's cast time will benefit from 2H weapons. If anyone will tell your healer: ""hey, equip Dual Wield for stronger healing"" will be a retard. That might be the reason why there are very few people theorycrafting Vitalism.  tl;dr:    Having complex combos involving lots of spells? Use Dual Wield  Can't penetrate enemy defence? Use 2H"
archeage,3dhtwi,Villentrenmerth,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:07:18 2015 UTC,Idk man a spear is pretty fuckin good at penetrating defences.
archeage,3dhtwi,spliffiam36,2,Thu Jul 16 13:02:50 2015 UTC,Are we still talking about mages?  If I would have BR or Shadowplay I would take DW over 2H any time.

archeage,3dhtwi,spliffiam36,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"The obsidian daggers have a variant which gives (very) small bonuses to magic damage. Combined with the scepter you get more total magic attack bonuses, but it's less overall damage because dual wield doesn't give any bonuses to magic damage like two-handed does. In exchange you get the utility of having multiple items to swap out for on your hotbar."
archeage,3dhtwi,DHTs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, at Divine my tier 4 obsidian dagger (version 2) gives about +45 Magic Attack, and also around 50 Int. Duel wield also gives faster Attack speed, meaning more magic damage faster (faster Gods Whip casts, etc).   The only issue I have with staff is the fact it leaves one with very little to no Physical Defense. When I used to rock a staff (back in Alpha) I was always torn apart in 1s and open world PvP by archers and melee. At least with a scepter/katana you can duel wield or switch to a shield (which is what I do) for that Physical Defense as a cloth wearing Mage."
archeage,3dhtwi,vannatten,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:08:39 2015 UTC,Why so much capslock from you?  No need to yell for every post you make.  Attack speed passive from dagger offhand = faster gcd = more insta flamebolts.  Good for enigmatist.
archeage,3dhtwi,bubbler_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"For me it was simple - I play more than one class and more than one role.    V1 Katana + V2 Dagger    I tank for my guild when needed in Serpentis and I play Defense classes involving melee and/or magic.    My issue isn't damage, it's getting enough spells to land in regards to CC. Dual Wield allows me to achieve that a little faster so I go with that versus more damage.    Both are very viable and if I played Spellsinger/Spellsong more I would have went with V2 Staff in a heartbeat."
archeage,3dhtwi,Artekka,2,Thu Jul 16 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the kicker for me.  Katana works for a lot of different classes, I'm currently using it for trickster, it also works great for shadowblade and several mage builds, and is not terrible even for like skull knight or abolisher.  If you pick staff, it'll be great for spellsinger, ok for other mage builds, and useless for anything else."
archeage,3dhtwi,olosbc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:41:01 2015 UTC,"People use scepter dagger because they can use a shield when needed, and have dagger when it's not. Dagger can have a 2% magic damage enchant on it, so you get 4% instead of 3% from honor enchant overall. Going staff would make you hit hard but also get hit hard. If you were using it like someone else posted for hard hits like meteor, you could always just nodachi before while dual wielding. Unless you can p2w the defences you'd lose, as a mage there is 0 reason to use a staff."
archeage,3dhtwi,wagwanimal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"Dual wielding causes you to be able to cast god's whip faster, cast more than three full fireballs with one backdrop as well as gives you quicker animations so you can win overwhelm duels, etc. Using a staff gives you the big dick damage for the most part, so it really depends on the class you're playing for what you're going to use.  For a spellsinger, the entire class is built around the hardest-hitting crits in the game so a staff makes sense. However, if you look at an enigmatist, they are like a rogue mage that relies on using melee abilities and instant cast abilities a lot so dual wield's attack speed would make sense.  Also, a staff is a much cheaper option for mages. When you compare the cost of a GOOD dual wield setup to a staff, it'll quickly make you steer for 1h + shield or staff. Getting a t4 v2 obsidian dagger is extremely strong but also quite expensive just for an offhand. If you're not running that dagger though, you're going to be losing a lot of damage compared to staff.  In the end, dual wield for enigmatist because they need it for duelling potential. Run a staff on spellsinger because that class is all about being a glass cannon. I'm not going to tell you how to play though, look at the benefit of each and see if you want to trade off some damage for global cooldown reduction. Being comfortable and independent is important."

That they will never truly get ahead in this game without either swiping (which most of them did but not enough) working hard (impossible for someone this deluded) or a combination of both.

Unless there is something fundamentally different about the new server (no cash shop etc) Is there any reason why the new server wouldn't become like the current servers (except demographics slightly different) within a few weeks/months?

Pretty much, everyone is going to be geared in full T4 Obsidian armor through that rift so gear levels are going to be on average higher than the main servers are now.

A large amount of progression on the current servers was able to occur at a faster than expected rate due to this (especially exploits which we've known about since Alpha).  Without a fix in place, land will be gone in 3-4 hours (ideal land in 30-40 minutes). Level 55 in 2 days with full heroic can be done without any exploiting, as I and many of my guild were able to do this in 2-4 days. We had celestial and delph in a week.   As long as they don't merge the AH and keep it server only, the timeline for progression can be expected to be double or triple the amount of time (so 2-3 weeks for celestial/delph). This is of course dependent on how many competitive guilds move onto the new server and are willing to give up their current progression (many won't I don't believe), as a rapid progression like this involves alot of credits/pot drinking. If labor was limited to just your character on the new server (i.e. no labor carry over from other characters on other servers), they could delay progression another week or so."

I've had a red jump me on a Pegasus and have also escaped from reds on a Pegasus out on the open seas.  If I'm just travelling on land though, I prefer the Snowlion for two dashes and the invincibility on the second of those two dashes as mentioned by /u/Redelfen.  Climbing mountains, Yata and Elk are good. Yata is more for the explorer-savvy while Elk I tend to use if my glider ascend boost is on cooldown.  For sneaking around, Leomorph/Bunny is good because you have Stealth + Teleport forward. For just plain stealth without movement, Soulmare is best since you can refresh stealth right when the cooldown is up to stay in Stealth indefinitely. It can be good for running away as well when you use the Dash + Stealth Dash, but two of its skills can't be used while moving (Backkick and the Stand Still Stealth move) which is kinda a bummer. I don't think Soulmare is worth if you do not have Pegasus yet though.  As for Sloth Glider, you have a 30m Backdrop that you can use to chase/disengage enemies with. 30m is a good chunk of distance which is why most people consider sloth glider to be one of the best gliders to get."

archeage,3dgi4p,Zannyth,5,Thu Jul 16 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"The real question is does it matter? i think auto attacking is stupid regardles of the class you playing. i cant htink of any good reason to AA anything in this game except in rare occurances for PVE where Auto attacking the mob might be quicker than charging a firebolt. shadowplay has an instant cast ""auto attack"" archers have endless arrows.and battlerage class has triple slash. what need is there in this game for auto attacking anyways? other than to troll the non-buffed fresh level 50 in arena with your weapon. i mean ive seen koon koon do that and yeah its mildly amusing but why is needed?"
archeage,3dgi4p,GGATHELMIL,2,Thu Jul 16 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"Auto attacks are important in the cases pertaining to conserving mana or when you have 0 mana (Hitting your enemy for that last bit of health with a basic attack vs. a mana-consuming skill) and in other cases for maintaining aggro in downtimes (Templar Tank comes to mind) as others have mentioned.   So in my opinion, the fact it's a no mana, no cooldown damaging (albeit low) basic attack can be quite useful and important at times; however, what I think people dislike is the auto part.   I think a better solution isn't to remove auto attack altogether, but remove the auto part and change melee auto attack to just a cast skill basic attack (Similar to how arrow basic attacks work now I believe). If I want to smack someone with a melee basic attack, let me decide when and where to use that skill on my own.  Essentially, don't auto attack when I accidentally double right-click a red/mob, don't auto attack in the middle of a skill rotation, make it so that the game only uses melee basic attack when I actively choose and press to use the Basic Attack skill like pretty much every other skill in the game."

archeage,3dgi4p,Draxus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:49 2015 UTC,i will have to agree with you. i would love to just have the option. Also not to nitpick but auto attacks do have a CD but thats neither here nor there XD
archeage,3dgi4p,GGATHELMIL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"That's my point, it doesn't matter.  This is a mechanic that is absolutely unnecessary to the game and the only impact it has is when mages break their own slept/feared targets by auto attacking them because they were within a few meters.  I can spam my key for the next spell but because of cast delays and cooldowns there's that ~1 second window where my character is forced to auto attack the person next to me that I have  targeted."
archeage,3dgi4p,ayumuuu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:49:21 2015 UTC,I AA mobs when farming purses if their health is low enough that using Triple Slash would be a waste of mana but that's basically it.

archeage,3dgi4p,PenguinPerson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:44:43 2015 UTC,I find auto attack useful for maintaining base aggro as a tank during team recovery periods when things go wrong.   Also I use it as a mechanic to counter some stun attacks from casters so it has its place in Pvp strategy.
archeage,3dgi4p,80WillPower08,0,Thu Jul 16 04:06:42 2015 UTC,The fact that mages break their own stun automatically by having their player auto attack players within a few meters is backwards.  Auto attacks only hinder mages.  You're not beating them with skill if you cause them to break their own fear/sleep.  You're beating them with a faulty mechanic that shouldn't even exist.
archeage,3dgi4p,Tyari,0,Thu Jul 16 05:47:46 2015 UTC,honestly hitting f1 after you have the person cced is not that hard then tab to get back on the enemy.

archeage,3dgi4p,Tyari,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:29:59 2015 UTC,That's extremely inconvenient and detrimental during fights (especially group pvp).  There's no reason for this mechanic and its only impact is breaking mage combos because of cast delay and cds.  The fact that this is in game and not toggleable doesn't make sense.

archeage,3dg7iz,Elaeagnifolia,5,Thu Jul 16 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"When you upgrade your house to a Tradepack-oriented facility, you can craft a special trade pack at your house called ____ Fertilizer. For example, if I made the pack at a Tradepack house in Sanddeep, it'd be called Sanddeep Fertilizer.  To make the pack, at 0 Commerce proficiency, you need 70 labor to craft the pack. For materials, you need 25 Chopped Produce, 25 Ground Grain, 20 Trimmed Meat, and 50 Dried Flowers. When you turn in the pack, the price you get will be higher than the normal trade packs you craft in that zone but lower than fellowship packs.  If you set your house permissions to something else besides Private, others will be able to craft the pack as well.

archeage,3dg7iz,Elaeagnifolia,2,Thu Jul 16 03:24:56 2015 UTC,"The other houses are different.   The consumeables house will have a workbench built into the house which lets you make any tier of consumeables without needing to be 50k alchemy or whatever proficiency is required. Crafting in the house, you also have a chance to ""double proc"", giving you more consumeables.  The equipment house will have a workbench built into the house which lets you make any tier of equipment without needing to proficiency in Tailoring, Weaponry, etc. Crafting in the house, you also have a chance to proc a ""Dazzling"" version of whatever you're crafting (Rough translation). This Dazzling version will ALWAYS proc the upgradeable version. For example, if you're crafting bows and you get a Dazzling bow, unsealing it will get you the Volcano bow proc. Additionally, the recipes to craft equipment are different in the house (No Gilda Dust, requires less Archeum and more Ingots iirc? Don't remember exact.) There's also a recipe where you can take all the materials from Apprentice-Illustrious to straight up craft an Illustrious piece of equipment. No need craft the Apprentice->Conqueror versions.  One similarity between all the houses is that they all have a bulk processor for lumber, fabric, iron ingots, etc. without needing 50k proficiency for the respective profession.  Edit. And yes, all the houses can be used by others if you set the permissions to be so."

archeage,3dg7iz,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"I looked in the ArcheageDatabase for KR and there are 23 different fertilizer packs. Nuia has 11 different zones excluding Miroir and Karkasse and Haranya has 12 different zones. Adding these together, you get 23, the exact number of different type of fertilizer packs. Taking this one step further, I double checked that all the Korean fertilizer pack names contained the names of zones in Nuia or Haranya.   This shows that <Auroria Zone> Fertilizer packs do not exist in the KR version database, which means that the new tradepack house cannot produce packs if located in Auroria.

Population wise, I play on what many feel is the most populated US server (Kyrios) and it is quite lively.  I can't comment on other servers.  Server mergers are good/bad.  Good in that they will concentrate people to get a more lively feel. Bad because of the pain it will take to get there. (Start on a populated server that won't be merged)  The game isn't very dungeon focused. It is very open world and ""do what you want"" - and there is a lot to do.  It is way WAY more fun with a group or good guild.  Get into a decent Naval battle with a group to see some of the different things AA does well compared to other MMO's.

But the problem i've had, is that when i go into options and tell it to record both my sound AND microphone, it ends up being neither in the recording. 0 sound whatsoever. So lately i've just been using Shadowplay with normal sound settings, and sadly skip my microphone being recorded. :/"

I am in the middle of unpacking all the files and I noticed there are a lot of object/animation files that I probably won't end up looking at.  Is it possible to set some sort of filter within the code to try and cut down on the processing time?  Also, I did not find the .sql files located within the AA folder.

I'm guessing the reason this is taking forever (for me) is because it needs to consistently copy and save data, as opposed to doing a read-only.  Regardless though, how is it extracting individual directories?  Do you enter the offset and it scans from there?  edit: looks like theres some c# code on https://forum.ragezone.com/f857/tools-archeage-db-converter-pack-1040661/ which I'm guessing is what can be used to retrieve the key to decrypt the sql file"

The real problem is the time, during the week days, at 6 am, most big guilds can only get around 10 members online and can only man one galleon, making them not really a threat against my guild when we show up with 25 from our guild + 20 from our allied guild, so we wipe them 5 min before the dgs spawn and then we kill it without any problems."

archeage,3db680,Tansien,5,Wed Jul 15 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this for a while and getting shot down in /faction, the conventional wisdom is that its gold sellers and bots responsible for inflation, which makes little sense to me.  Since 1.7, they've launched Abyssal and Delphinad Ships.  These two daily events combine for +/- 20,000 new gold in the economy every day.  Since 1.7a, the price of apex on the Ollo/Tahyang cluster has gone from 200-220 to 500-550 gold.  The price of apex has doubled on Kyprosa and Shatigon as well.  This new gold has not been accompanied by any counterbalance of any new gold sink.    I don't know how any reasonable person can see this and conclude anything other than XL is directly responsible for gold inflation due to introducing 20k new gold into the economy every day without a counterweight gold sink."

archeage,3db680,Powerism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yes bots and gold sellers cause deflation. They get their gold from other players so the money is already there in the economy.

But you can't deny that there is a higher number of Bots.  We may not know how much inflation is from one or the other.   BUT we do know last Dec-Jan when we had a massive amounts of bots Apex went up to 740 Gold! Highest I paid was 650.

archeage,3d9yj0,Ljungen,4,Tue Jul 14 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"This is something that I've recently discovered myself, but regrading is an end-game mechanic, so in many cases, it's best to leave it for the end-game players who know and don't care about the costs. Sure you might get lucky and save a bunch of money, but that's a gambler's mindset.  I used to regrade a lot, and then after spending 6k trying to regrade my boots to celest or divine I realized that I could nearly purchase a divine weapon for that much gold outright.  The cost of divine weapons and armor, while expensive, is usually disproportionately cheap compared to how difficult it realistically is to obtain them, because the overall demand for the pieces is rather low, so if you have the money to spend that much on regrading a weapon, you probably have enough to just buy the weapon that you want outright.  I know this probably isn't something you care about in a salt post, but when I stopped regrading it made the game significantly more enjoyable."

archeage,3d7fiz,Draxus,3,Tue Jul 14 16:11:56 2015 UTC,All they have to do with gems is make it so only the gem you're using has a break chance and the system won't remove any previous progress you have. And just make each gem slot it's own success rate. I'd be completely fine if my 7th gem broke 50 times before actually going in if I didn't lose the other 6 every single time.
archeage,3d7fiz,Neoxide,2,Tue Jul 14 18:30:12 2015 UTC,YES PLEASE. My server had non-stop 5's going during the event and it was great. The honor for 5's is really bad without the boost. I think people wanna play it but it's just not worth their time....

It's single target applications are few, like the poster said in arena occultism is mainly used by tanks like defiler, which is just a potato class imo.

Revenants are cool and have some cc and moblity to get out if closed in on. these have been a bit more popular since 1.7.  overall witchcraft is better with cc's, songcraft is better for crits and buff/debuffs, and everything is better for DPS lol. occultism doesnt get the love it deserves since its a jack of these trades and master of none.  You should try [Arche-Base.com] to play with other class variations, see how others build theirs, and build your own. You can also click a skill tree and search classes by that or combinations of them and that should help you find the occulism variation that fits you best."

archeage,3da4fb,Faddler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"I would try out Defense Penetration gems on Instrument slot. Until I got it fully gemmed, I was having issues putting damage out. Not so much that I couldnt hit them (2-3 focus gems on primary/secondary slots), its that i wasnt hitting for much). Then again the recent 5x5s I've been in are full of celestial buffed 4000+ gear scored players.  at least try it on, fully (edit: dont go broke - put 2-3 of the +60 DP gems) gem your instrument w/ defense penetration and return results here."
archeage,3da4fb,AANeubie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"I've used defense penetration before. Defense pen is a misleading stat. Against people with average physical defense you gain a lot of damage BUT if people have over 5k defense, which a lot of players on my server do, you won't notice a difference. Ranged Attack is a better all-around gem to use because it doesn't scale off of how badly geared someone is.  There's a breakpoint in defense around 4000 points of each. After that, scaling becomes pretty bad. If someone has 6k defense because they are fully gemmed and have a shield, taking 2000 defense off of them (max armor pen you can get in the game) would only really give you about a 3-4% difference in damage which is a lot lower than the percent difference you'd get from stacking +6 ranged attacks in your bow and instrument."

Do a fight w/o focus and see what its hitting for, then compare it to that same target w/ focus gear on. You should be hitting for more (and it will also be absorbing less damage) often, and for more damage.

I'm not trying to sound like an idiot, and was genuinely interested in coming back. Oh well.   My advice, don't be so sensitive - and don't judge a community's worth based on the number of down votes you get in the community's sub reddit for asking a tired question.  Several times daily, we see posts of returning players asking what's new - the Search function can assist better than another new post asking for a TL;DR of the last 6 months.  I'm not pointing this out to call out your post, I'm only trying to show you the way to find your answers.  If you don't like PvP, I would strongly suggest you find another MMO.  PvP is ingrained into the gameplay of ArcheAge.  Since, based on your comments, you're considering returning to wow because of a hypothetical in which wow's community is superior to AA's, I'll tell you this:  wow and AA are two vastly different games.  One (wow) is a theme park, in which all the rides are created for you (dungeons, dailies, raids, battlegrounds), and it's up to you to ride the ones you enjoy.  The other (aa) is a sandbox, in which you're given tools to explore and have fun in the world, but you have no set path and no set progression.  They're completely different types of MMOs.    Finally, your assertion that wow has really good crafting mechanics and AA's crafting is or was ""dead"" lends me to think you would probably enjoy WoW a ton more than AA.  The crafting in wow is linear and you can go from bottom to top proficiency in a day if you have the mats.  AA's crafting is much more dynamic and requires a much greater commitment.  In wow, crafted goods are bottom tier at end game.  In AA, crafted armor and weapons are the best in the game.  Good luck to you, man.  Sorry the community wasn't more welcoming initially, but I can assure you it's a good group of helpful people on the average."
archeage,3da84g,Powerism,0,Tue Jul 14 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply anyway. I'ts not that I don't like PvP, I just don't enjoy arena matches.   I found the freedom of AA to be a lot more exciting than WoW as you pointed out, and the crafting and skills system was well-done but it was quite linear and ultimately I found no market for anything that wasn't the end-game stuff, which is different on WoW.  I'll give it a shot once I've reinstalled it, because I do enjoy the skills, freedom and the boats."
archeage,3da84g,sparkle_dick,2,Tue Jul 14 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've never once joined an arena and I pvp all the time out in the waters. Open world is where it's at for me, 1v1 is just rock paper scissors and gear vs gear whereas open world there's so many different factors.  As for answers to some of your other questions (just perused comments so sorry if repetitive), crafting is very viable now and a great money maker, there's lots of world bosses and dungeons that are fun to do with people, bots are still around but not nearly as rampant. Housing is still difficult to find good plots depending on server, but a little searching can probably get you something or save up some gold. Trading is more profitable as aged packs can get you upwards of 20g each."
archeage,3da84g,Powerism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"Luckily, arena matches are a small part of AA pvp.  I don't really like the arena matches either, as if you're not rocking 4k+ equipment points, you're going to have a bad time.  But the sudden pvp in red zones and on the sea are what makes the game exciting.  The mini-wars that break out over the GR turtles and sunflowers, the purpling during Abyss, and the daily Halcyona/Mistmerrow battles are a much larger part of pvp than 1s and 5s, which I think see a smaller percent of players trying them.    I played wow pretty religiously from Wrath's launch through Warlord's launch, and I've had some experience at end-game in other MMOs as well, but nothing comes close to the dynamic, immersive gameplay of ArcheAge.  I'm glad you're giving it another try.  If you happen to be rolling on Tahyang, let me know - I'll help you get back on your feet."

You can play the game for free to try things out and see how things are going. I recommend taking the initiative and thinking for yourself.  glhf
archeage,3da84g,WyzeThawt,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"I looked at the main page of ArcheAge, but there's far too many blog posts for me to get any sense of what is new.  I'm not asking for what's new in general, I was actually quite specific with what I enjoyed about the game, and whether anything was new in that area of the game. Searching for whats new in those areas and what has been added recently wouldn't really yield any results.  Thanks for the lack of help though, really paints a picture of how much of a great community this is. Tempted to put a post in the WoW reddit just to see how much more friendly the replies would be."

archeage,3da84g,executive313,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Edit2: Appears I'm getting downvoted, If this is how the community treats a player asking genuine questions, I might actually keep away. I'm not trying to sound like an idiot, and was genuinely interested in coming back. Oh well.   lol dont take it personal. there are seriously atleast 3 or more posts per day saying they were old players and want to know if it is worth coming back since 1.7a was released. lol search the subreddit for ""old player"" and you will see what i mean and thats only the ones that use that specific term....  if you dont like the pvp then i would say its not worth coming back. Pve in this game is to farm for money, xp, items or mats. after you get what you need there is no reason to figth them anymore. that plus the open world style is why i say that you should atleast like to fight, or heal, or tank to keep that drive to log in and keep earning money at endgame. the skill queue system was nice and everyone said they liked it until they ran into someone who could gods whip you 10 or more times before it went on cool down. hopefully they fix it and reenable it soon and that might help make the PvP funner for you.  crafting never left... though higher tier jewelery, armor, and weapon crafters are few because of price and RNG. if you cant get to at least illustrious to salvage for some recoup or mag to salvage for usually a small profit, then its a money pit. if you are lucky enough to get epherium or higher you can bank big bucks tho.  land availabilty depends on server. still hard to find space in highly desired areas but prices to buy land have significantly lowered. plots that were 2k during 1.2 are going for 500-800g"

I've had issues trying to play with getting disconnected every 5 minutes, apparently the fix is to reinstall the game because my game is still in 'beta' state. I'll give it a go but I'm not expecting much. I'm a much more casual player that's why PvP and mashing buttons as fast as you can has never appealed to me, and that's why I loved WoW's skills/trading and crafting, but I just don't feel like paying WoW's monthly subscription."

He also doesn't realize that to have huge amount of labor you should utilize 5 other characters on your account, because labor is shared between all characters on your account.  Oh, and $500 doesn't buy you a weapon on new server, because there are also other components required, like Antler Corals (need to be grown), Archeum Ingots, and Mysterious Garden Powder.  Obtaining Delphinad Weapon is not a 1-man job, it will require a team, and even if your team/family/guild will feed you all their resources to build your weapon, whenever you will meet enemy team that balanced their power they will win, because all Crowd Control on your character will basically remove all power from your side."

You have to go around 10man dahuta entrance (south of freedich) and kill some mobs that drop a crystal(you need 3). Then you gotta kill Morpheus and loot him (you need to actually hit Morpheus unlike the dream ring quest) and then you get a small plushie that gives a 2k insulating lens buff once a day for 1hr or until broken.

Also you have to keep in mind that as a mage he would also gem physical defence in his plate set instead of magic def as you would normally do if its your only set. So he would have even more defence.

You choose where to run your packs, where you roam, what risks you take. Eliminating those risks makes for one empty, flat world.   Lastly, for your comments on ""sociopaths"".

archeage,3db6zf,Kloonike,6,Wed Jul 15 08:09:09 2015 UTC,"so many economic variables in this game. fun to predict and play with auction.  I am sorry to hear your experience isn't going well, but idk what to say about your attitude of obnoxiously generalizing and insulting on people who may be more successful in the game than you are.  I see mmo as a mix of a lot of different criteria, so ""skill"" isn't just about your pvp mechanics but also apply to economical or social aspects. Some may be good at one and not in others and some just good at all or none. And why even play mmo that depends on gear, levels, numbers if you are playing purely for pvp skillz? there are many different games that are designed for a fair pvp than mmo.  in the end, I am just reading ""I am bad at this game, but I am suppose to be good. So everyone else better than me are shitters and therefore this game sucks because shitters are better than me."" Logic. Maybe they are just better than you.   What do you even want to do in a game? You are not only shittalking people roleplaying in a fucking roleplay game but also people who are taking it seriously. wut.

archeage,3db6zf,LineageTang,2,Wed Jul 15 05:09:40 2015 UTC,"Amen bro. This game is about long term progression. Desired results will come by playing smart (or paying). If people don't like that, they can go play a game where they start and stay on an equal level or a game with much higher progession tempo (think moba style ""progession"" or even WoW - no child left behind). I absolutely love ArcheAge the way it is... There's always something to work on to keep myself going. Haters gonna hate."
archeage,3db6zf,Kaotikid,3,Wed Jul 15 09:51:28 2015 UTC,"A. So you reinforce a virtual system that echoes everything wrong with the global trade system, and enjoy the good feels that result from a non-skill based advantage. Don't fool yourself: there are better uses for your hard-earned, you blubbery fuel for someone else's 401k.   Welcome to crapitalism, where everything flows up, and we are all blubbery fuel for someone else's 401k. That's how the system works. If you have a job, you're making someone else above you money. In return you are compensated with the least amount of $$ possible. Then you're told that you aren't allowed to live without the $$, and that you're basically scum and not worthy of breathing if you're not making the even fatter whales above you money. Don't believe me? Try being jobless and homeless for a while in the good ol' USA. Land of the free, right? ha ha, yea, sure.  But are we really surprised that this system has infected video games? Time to start waking up to this soul destroying obsession with more, more, more, MORE profit.  Cha-Ching baby."

It is a command economy with trion picking winners and losers via the cash shop. The trade pack system also isnt a free market system, the prices are set and they only go down, and they go down when rule breaking bots abuse them.      Archeage would be an  amazing game if trade packs were dynamic, instead they are just a round about gold sink designed to waste people's time as they dump hard earned resources into an npc's backpack."

People criticize capitalism all the time but what they dont realize is everything about this world is about some form of capitalism. Whether it is emotional capitalism or monetary its always about it. I have been homeless and jobless in the US. The best thing about the system is it doesnt discriminate people might but the system doesnt. You can turn anything into an advantage. Homeless? No problem all you need is to gather cans long enough to afford a PO Box once obtained you can do anything because it counts as a physical address. Being homeless is called low overhead expenses. Just because you aren't smart enough to work through the system doesn't mean its broken its just means that you are can sit back and work for the big company enjoying the safety that it provides while silently raging about it and seeing through your glasses of corruption where maliciousness is everywhere.

There are plenty of mmo's out there where the only thing you can do to bother people is troll in faction chat, so they don't really count.   Ges like cod and madden can't count toward this. Your actions are too linear. You play to win, you have no choice in anything. Not like you can take that football halfway thru the game and go shove it down the other teams throat till they all die just because.   Gta.. Ehh. Similar principles apply. You can't really do shit to other players. Nothing that will matter too much anyhow.   Either way. Op is pretty on point. Archeage requires a lot of time or money or both. People care about it. Games designed to screw with people."

On the AH2 cluster 1 salvaged illustrious dagger will sell for about 250, (+1-3 crystals from salvage process) which is a slight loss to what it cost to craft. (Let's pretend about 75%, So cost to craft is 333)   1 Mag salvage is worth about 500 gold (+1-3 crystals from salvage process)  This just doesn't cover the cost of Three Illustrious at all!

archeage,3d4v8x,chaeidras,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well if your goal is to make money off the process then that's good reasoning.  But if your goal is to make epherium you're better off reforging them.  You said you made 25 illustrious that weren't upgradable, if you reforged those you'd have 8 more mags with a chance to go epherium.  And you'll be saving all the materials to make 8 more illustrious, something you didn't calculate in.  Edit: I should also point out that I did reforge and have a shortspear and shield both at T5.  I have 2 of the 3 delphs I'll need for the T6 shortspear also (not working on the T6 shield yet as one of the materials requires killing the red dragon).  Also, use loot drop potions if you have them.  I don't have hard evidence that they work but I do seem to get a lot of upgradable ones when I do use them."
archeage,3d4v8x,amphitryo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"Well I don't like to knock something before I try it.  So last night after crafting 3 illustrious, that stayed illustrious, I took them and forged them into a Mag.  It stayed a mag.    I think you are right mathematically/statistically.  If I salvage the three and sell them for 750 I have to invest about 250 to have 3 more shots at 1/16th each. Or I can take the 3 salvages, invest about 300 in archeum to make it a mag and have a 1/4 shot at Epherium.   But it just felt wrong.  After the mag didn't pop and I'm left with a salvage worth 500 instead of 750 I felt pretty dumb.  I think it's a risk/reward thing.  Selling the 3 salvage is lower reward, but also lower risk."

What people tend to forget are two major things when it comes to rng, assuming that XL games is using a standard probability system:   Law of large numbers Regression toward the mean   So assuming that there are 7 possible outcomes at illu and mag tier, you would have to craft 49 weapons in order to craft 1 epherium. If you have had luck with crafting at first, probability suggests that you will have no luck for quite some time.  RNG is just a bitch ..."

archeage,3d4v8x,boredmuse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:27:59 2015 UTC,"Not quite. What I meant is, that if you craft an infinite number of weapons, statistics suggests that every 49th is an epherium (if there are 7 in mag/illu tier). Gambler's Fallacy is just too short sighted in this manner. Complete randomization would only occour, if you would have a limitless system, e.g. no boundaries in outcomes in a numerical, decimal system. AA seems to base on probabilities somewhere between 0 and 1, which limits RNG to a certain corridor. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to deduct e.g. drop rates from coin purses."
archeage,3d4v8x,WithoutShameDF,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:34:33 2015 UTC,There are actually only 4 flavors of Mag and Illustrious.  Hence why I am upset about now having crafted 36 Illustrious and not receiving one Epherium.

archeage,3d7m7q,80WillPower08,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"I mentioned the maybes as such because it depends on what you queue into. They are anti-meta as you mentioned. Also, enigmatist and daggerspell already pretty much can't lose to abolisher/darkrunner as long as you have trip cloak. Don't really need to cabalist it up.  Hexwarden/shadowblade are very specific counter classes too IMO, you'll just get outnumbered by a fat Abolisher or Argent, which is ultra common on my server. But I should have listed them as maybes, despite them fully dying out after the stalkers mark/witchcraft changes soon tm.  This all comes from a caster PoV, where the redoubt on stonearrow/archon are what makes them difficult, so im sure its biased compared to other lists. I don't have experience playing all of the classes.   That being said, its not a horrible list.   Your main gripes are that I listed some classes as a maybe and didn't include an obscure worse shadowblade class. The amount of hexblades I've ran into is easily <1% of my games on my server, so I can't comment on their power."

Just wish the payout was more, like half or even double the payout.  The negotiation bonus on the delph registers is like 1000g or more, so not sure how the numbers work exactly."
archeage,3d7ac8,JawaBalloon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:52:37 2015 UTC,not quite 1000g but still definitely worth it when turning in big items like that  https://i.imgur.com/THc5jpi.jpg
archeage,3d7ac8,PopInACup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:22:56 2015 UTC,"I've been tracking my negotiation bonuses since roughly 90k prof.  I've turned in about 400 packs combined between 2 characters at each level from 90 to 180k.  The highest bonus I have gotten is 10.9% and the lowest I have gotten is .025%.  No matter what your proficiency you can get a bonus ranging between those values.  As far as I can tell, no matter what your proficiency is, you will get on average about 5% bonus when you trigger a negotiation bonus.  However, the odds of the bonus range depending on your proficiency.  At 180k I get negotiation bonuses roughly 10% of the time."
archeage,3d77ln,Hirazrador,2,Tue Jul 14 01:39:17 2015 UTC,They will be adding a server that is 'fresh' because its auction house isnt linked with any other clusters to emulate release. However I think it wont be long before cash flow piles up and it just catches up to all the other servers unless the comunity does something about it cause trion sure wont.   I think they said 2.0 was coming around september? Not to sure though.

The source for all this information is the livestreams Trion does pretty much every Friday. The last livestream on 7/10 was when Khrolan said they'd be releasing the brand new server along with 2.0 as a sort of way to commemorate the one year anniversary of ArcheAge (September).   I can't access Twitch right now to link you exact time, but it's definitely in the last livestream if you want to watch."

Things like Thunderstruck Trees will be expensive as hell hence the demand will be high and supply low. No thunderstruck fiasco box there so things like TT tree farm will be a thing again on that server.  I am really curious how market will play on that server just economic wise, seeing how things so far were very marketplace dependent. Prices going up/down on good/bad rng boxes.  Time will tell.

Larders go down in percent faster it seems also. Also you can mass turn in in unison and get the same rate. So at abyss your whole raid can open the window to turn in and click complete at the same time, and everyone will get the same percent."
archeage,3d73wg,Craigerade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:43:58 2015 UTC,"The market value updates somewhat slowly, two or three times a minute, depending on your proficiency and when you start turning your packs in you can get most of a hauler turned in before the value changes."

Takes nice positioning of the haulers, and your buddies rotating the packs into the closest hauler slots. So all you have to do is click the pack, hit F, rinse and repeat."
archeage,3d73wg,Squixel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:08:17 2015 UTC,"This is when I'm turning in packs via my glorious 200+ Aussie ping, but it doesn't really differentiate as it becomes a steady flow.

archeage,3d73wg,Squixel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:14:10 2015 UTC,"I have turned in several thousand packs over two characters and have 180k prof on one and almost 180k on the other, so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to optimize my turn ins.  The prices update once a minute.  If you spam refresh (the game prevents you from refreshing too often though) after you turn in and watch your clock you can get the second it updates.  The price will boost by 5% every 60 minutes.  Again, watch the prices and the clock to get the time.  Each pack will reduce the trade in value by .5%.  By knowing when the minute ticks over, you can time your trade ins to get as many packs in as possible before the price updates.  With the help of some friends I have managed to unload 3 haulers before the price updates."
archeage,3d73wg,PopInACup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"What I usually do, if I'm taking packs with several haulers (friends helping) or with a merch ship - I stack the haulers right next to the gold trader and turn them all in as fast as I can. Even after 21 packs the % might be 125+, when it suddenly drops to 118% or lower. So apparently there is a timer."
archeage,3d73wg,GrowlingMoose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:56:54 2015 UTC,"I find that when turning in larders, one hauler will drop the rate from 130% to 127%.

archeage,3d6xv0,formalyknownasDustAK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:13:27 2015 UTC,Inquisitor and Deathwarden seem pretty good  What would you recommend as the best 3 combo with a darkrunner because one of our friends has made his mind up but the other 2 of us are willing to play anything really

archeage,3d6xv0,veritascs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:07:29 2015 UTC,Deathwarden is awesome at 55 but leveling with it is hammered dog shit.

archeage,3d6xv0,formalyknownasDustAK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Soothsayer is my class (http://arche-base.com/builds/view/46227-Soothsayer#4.10.8/xHG18Cl1HP7A). I run it with a slight focus on DPS (leather, dual-wielding) because I like the versatility. And if you wanna go more in the healer realm with Soothsayer just go cloth/plate + shield. As for the inverse, if I'm playing more deeps I go Inquisitor but losing Auramancy's skills really limits the healing (http://arche-base.com/builds/view/45093-Inquisitor#1.10.8/Tz8Ztvl1HP7A).    Edit: idk about Assassin, wouldn't you need magic attack and healing power? Unless I'm missing something you can't get that with current weapons."

archeage,3d6drs,Singleeverysingleday,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:47:52 2015 UTC,Find out now if you want to be a farmer. If not liquidate before their planned gold sink event happens. Gold is kinda worthless right now because they allowed too much of it to enter the community via daily events. Prices are high. They will come crashing down once they release their event and soak all that gold out of the game. On some servers bots are combating the inflation by causing deflation. On these servers farmed goods are way low. So you may be better off selling the farms one at a time.   Now if you do want to go into farming you will have to watch the ah daily. As it fluxes you will have to adapt your farming to match it. Also look ahead toward the next event (submarines!) and see what mats they need to be made and stockpile those. This game is a lot like real life you have to buy low and sell high. That means keeping large stockpiles of goods so that you don't flood the market and end up competing against yourself. With that many farms don't worry about spending access labor. You may not have much.

archeage,3d7kod,RickDripps,3,Tue Jul 14 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! This is my video, and you can probably tell I don't do a lot of video editing. I didn't notice the voice of one of my fellow guild members until after uploading, so that's why I didn't cut that audio out. As for the timing of the actual content in the video, again I don't edit very often. The boat actually is spinning much faster than the turning speed because the game, I believe, is trying to pull the boat as close to the ground as possible, forcing the game to try and spin the boat to the optimal position. My main reason for sharing this was to demonstrate that aspect and show how to do it, not so much to make a good quality video. I'll practice editing more though, and hopefully I'll become better at doing so."

archeage,3d4q0y,Negative_Mojo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:34 2015 UTC,either the DR you are fighting is retarded or this is staged.  Like he/she only used tripple slash.  One stalkers mark+leech nodachi combo could have killed  you.
archeage,3d4q0y,nyym1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"The DR tried to SM combo. rguitar mirrior lighted the SM and shruged the overwhelm. Fight lasted long enough that he coulda done it again, but generally the DR had that idea initially.   It looks to me like the DR thought he was going to land a kill just by triplestriking since rguitars HP got so low. A miscalculation. After that he paniced and didn't think to try to reinitiate with a new SM leech combo."

archeage,3d4q0y,micdeath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"if you are playing vs a off heal/ off-heal spec.  Not initiating with SM+leech is a bad play.  Unless you have 1k melee attack, then it doesn't matter.  but not everyone has that.  A typical Dr 3~4k gear score.. won't be able to kill a geared cleric/paladin/templar/etc w/o SM and nodachi proc in 1 combo..  As much as people hate on leech, it is a crucial and essential skill needed by DRs in 1v1.  Same way witcraft use fear, same way defense use redoubt, same way shadowplay use stealth, auramancy has leech.  I don't get why people bitch about a skill that is in the game, if you are to win, use whatever it takes to win. why gimp yourself?"
archeage,3d4q0y,oliverjpg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:25:21 2015 UTC,Against cloth cleric you don't need leech to win unless super geared. Those other classes i agree tho. I play dr myself but still hate the leech. Every time i step leech part of me dies. Luckily that's only a thing in 1v1 arena.
archeage,3d4q0y,Saruna_Ezi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"yes you do depending on a cleric gear.  A cleric.. lets say 4k gear score can easily achieve 50% physical defense, and like 20k hp.  If you can burn through that with an un-geared DR, w/o using SM Leech nodachi combo.  Then i commend you."

There are tons of different options to make gold, and they all vary in amount of gold/time spent, gold/labor, gold/risk among other factors.  For a solo player, here are a few suggestions I have for you:   http://kloonike.com/archeage-gold-making-guide-sunlight-archeum-shards-labor-free/   It's a way to get sunlight archeum without having to use any labor. Highly recommend this, however you would need to make a new character to do it. Coin purse farming.  I would consider two locations best for coin purse farming:  golden ruins turtles to get prince coinpurses which have good drops, or L3 library for dean's coinpurses.  Per labor spent, the prince coinpurses will give you more gold, however farming the dean coinpurses will also give you a chance (albeit very small) of getting ayanad designs.  A lucky roll on one of those could easily give you ten's of thousands of gold. Clubhead fungus farming.  This is another gold method making that consumes little labor, but lots of time.  http://archeagealttab.blogspot.com/2014/12/clubhead-fungus-and-clubhead-spore.html   That has a map of some of the places where they spawn, and also the wild plants which have a 1/3 chance of dropping clubhead fungus.   Fishing currently is pretty terrible, I would not recommend it.  It should be getting better eventually, but for now I would not do it. Serpentis dungeon's could make you gold, but you would have to get into a good guild that does them regularly.  I'm not sure recently, but most of the time doing Serpentis with a public group is not a profitable endeavor.    Safe route trade pack running.  Going from Hellswamp to Gweonid forest on the west continent is about 15g per pack.  Factor in the cost of the pack, about 12g profit.  If you have a farm hauler, that's 7 packs a trip for 84g profit total every time you go.  Getting the hauler is a bit of an investment, and there is the risk you find it so boring you don't make your money back, but this is a decent way to make money. Cross continent trade routes:  These are decent, but much riskier then safe zone trade routes.  Often solo per pack you will make more gold per labor then safe zone, but you will only be able to take one or two with you, making it far less gold per time spent. Here is a spreadsheet that details the different values of gold per route: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2TAC30g9JfKjrUOnRsTkqeCyiMWkafuvqUwKB3PKjw/htmlview?sle=true"

archeage,3d4rlc,campoanywhere,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"Leather can be fine since it's celestial. You should be around 48% physical mitigation with a shield and defense passives.   For wrists and waist, anything is fine. I use celestial earth. Gemming is up to you, but the meta is generally heavy on physical for 1v1 and magic for world pvp.   I don't remember the stats of hasla weapons right now, but with that amount of gold you could pretty easily pickup a divine obsidian weapon. They're between 6.5 and 7k on my cluster.   A lot run plate for Abolisher, and it's good, but I think you would best spend your money by getting a good weapon instead of working towards a plate set."
archeage,3d4rlc,adorableSALPHIRA,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm at 50.44% phys mitigation and only 35% mag.  I was hoping to hold out for a divine delph flame sword so I can be end-game in that slot and not worry about it any more.   Funny enough a few mins after posting I got a haunted chest that contained the 5% block rate cloak, bringing my parry to 15.4 and shield block to 13.4.   That parry is key to abo DPS as it resets the cooldown, should I be focusing on that for my accessories or more str/sta?"

archeage,3d4rlc,Ev1LLe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:21:27 2015 UTC,Yeah and its really OP if you decide to play paladin/argent. Those classes are basically free wins vs everyone of you're really geared!
archeage,3d4rlc,Faddler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:15:03 2015 UTC,Sword is better for abolisher the shortspear proc is good but its not god mode and paladin is boring.
archeage,3d4rlc,Faddler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"sword, shortspear or axe.   Sword = faster attack speed, parry proc   spear = slower, higher DPS, armor puncture passive + heal  axe = slightly lower dps, bleed passive helps with precision strike dmg + def pen"
archeage,3d4rlc,Faddler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"Here's what I would do in your case:  Abolishers are a front-line fighter so being durable is going to be a large concern. In that case, I would get all 5 pieces of obsidian gear and get them to celestial and slowly work them up to tier 4 version 1 (The strength version). This is because of the high amount of base resistance that the legs and chest offer as well as the parry rate of the boots and the damage of the cap and fists. For the wrists and waist slot, you can fill those with whatever you can afford. I would probably stick magnificent desert in there because it is cheap. This set will offer durability for you in a class like abolisher, as well as a set to play darkrunner. While it may not be the most optimised for the class, it is still very effective. Just remember, always get the strength versions.  As for your weapons. Firstly, you can save up and purchase a celestial delphinad weapon which you can sell later when you'd like to upgrade or you can try your hand at getting a divine obsidian weapon and upgrading that. Personally, I would do the obsidian route because it is so cheap. Swords, shortspears and katanas are all good options for abolishers so pick whichever you like best! For your shield, definitely get an obsidian shield and regrade it to something safe, like heroic, and leave it there. For bows, you can either use the hasla one or get a t1 grand obsidian bow for the stamina (extra HP). Instruments, you can get some from the warrior medals so I would get that. It's a free epherium lute with very helpful skill rank-ups.  6000g will definitely help you make a dent in this shopping list. Remember that weapons are going to be the most notable damage increase in the game, so if you're looking for numbers go for a weapon first.  PS: You can get a free set of very good plate from the serpentis dungeon so there is absolutely no point in spending gold on crafted plate. Plate really does suck though, you put so much gold into gems to be safe against mages that you could've just bought a leather set."
archeage,3d4rlc,TankinJenkins,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks!  I do have a heroic Serp plate belt and Rare Serp plate vambraces going right now.  The only thing I don't have is the obs fists - I have serp leather (also have heroic promise fists leftover from my archery days).    I'm 1/2 way to the strength lute - that's the one I should get right?   Getting that t4 jerkin requires a slavaged eph jerkin.. .that's like 3k on the AH (already tried crafting it, didn't proc to typhoon).   That's 1/2 my bankroll right there, maybe I should just hold off and go weapon first?    There's a celest delphi flame sword on the AH right now for ~10k.  Maybe worth picking up for the time being?  Or hold off for divine..."

archeage,3d27cn,luniz420,2,Mon Jul 13 18:51:11 2015 UTC,I'm a merchant and want to get into fishing.   I like those two because i don't really need money to get it started or well that's at least true for trading still got to save up for a fishing boat tho. But getting that boat also completes my collection of having all ship-types (we don't count middle-sized warships ok!). This may not seem like a big achievement for others but its definitely one of my big goals (and its also a non pvp thing which this thread is about?).

archeage,3d1bm3,superchibisan2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:40:22 2015 UTC,Supply is down and that means prices go up. That's why archeum supply is concerning everyone whether they craft themselves or not.

archeage,3d1cfx,HKsekai,2,Mon Jul 13 04:20:49 2015 UTC,"My opinion on frost arrow: It's a very powerful spell with the major drawback being a cast time for a spell that doesn't scale high. It's decent if you are using frigid tracks to deep freeze and make use of the instant cast, but as a daggerspell you are given plenty of CCs that I would rather spend the points on other skills. Therefore I don't use frigid tracks or freezing arrow as a daggerspell, and after I cast insidious whisper I prefer to cast arc lightning rather."
archeage,3d1cfx,xYungbae,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"Well I see Witchcraft PvP like this: Use banshee wall and insidious whisper as soon as they're up, cram as much dps as u can during that time, keeping lassitude/bubble as your safety. I'm actually an Arcanist, my main opening combo (against non-cloths) is: shrug it off at 30 meters, get close(using earthen grip if archer), leech, meteor, focal as leech ends(having to shrug off focal will prevent from teleporting), God's Whips 4-5 times, but banshee wall b4 the trip is up, arc lightning, insidious(even if they overwhelm u, the insidious will usually go off) and at that point, a frostbolt/enervate/earthen grip/god's whip will pretty much kill anyone. Edit: Just realized I didn't actually answer your question. If I cc some1, the question is pretty much: cast-time spell +instants, just instants, or just cc again(I'll use arc lightning if it's up, but 20 sec cooldown so).http://arche-base.com/builds/generator#7.4.2/8y61pJzvJZyG Arcanist > Daggerspell.

A dolphin goes 8.4m/s with the same fins and a underwater breathing device and no eqps.  Now use the speed boost and you'll go 12.5m/s.  I didn't have songcraft so couldn't test the speeds with that.  Fusciafin would increase this speed by a few decimals making it better than carrot dash even if you used the carrot I imagine.  Now the submarine has the potential to go faster than either one if the swimfins boost works since we know the base speed and songcraft works."
archeage,3d0xy2,Jerry-Boyle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:59:52 2015 UTC,You can get somewhere around 12-13m/s with the UBA and the donkey. Only downside is the 10min cd

archeage,3d1z0r,redhat86,2,Sun Jul 12 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"First thing you're gonna have to accept about this game as a new player from WoW is that nothing in this game is guaranteed, and despite what everyone says this game is pay to win.  Secondly, you don't get good gear from dungeons, you can get decent gear from Serpentis but you will need a guild to run with. PvE in this game is almost non-existent unless you join a guild doing world bosses. If you do get into a guild capable of killing world bosses then you will get to enjoy doing the exact same thing every night for little rewards. The world boss loot is usually either a lot of gold, a weapon, or armor pieces which you are not likely to get unless you hold some sway within the guild.  Thirdly, if you don't have a lot of money to buy gear with you will have to grind for a few months before you can touch pvp. Crafted gear in this game is the best by a long shot and the crafted gear doesn't bind. If you do decide to maximize your grind for a few months, you will always be behind the wallet warriors.  Fourthly, everything in this game is luck. No luck = no gear, no wins in pvp, no money, etc. PvP is extensively based on luck as all of your stuns and cc can be evaded/blocked/parried. Gearing up through crafting is luck, and in order to make a single good piece you have about a 1/16 chance of getting a decent piece, a 1/112 chance to get a really good piece, and a 1/784 chance to get the best piece.  Fifthly, unlike WoW this game has very strong server communities and a shitload of interguild/faction/family/etc drama which reminds me of a more intensive vanilla wow drama fest. The fact that you can kill your own faction helps to make the drama endless.  Sixthly, the PvP is poorly balanced. They released all of the skills about 3 years ago on Korea and they have only balanced a few skills in one patch about a year ago.  In summary, luck wins the day, PvP is poorly balanced and pay to win, and the server communities make the game playable."

archeage,3d1z0r,Dopethulhu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:03:39 2015 UTC,I'd say play the game and see if you like it before spending money.  Or just pack a lunch and not eat out one day a month and repurpose that money to your Patron status.
archeage,3d1z0r,veritascs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:56:32 2015 UTC,"Play a day or two then see if it's what you want. It's not wow it won't hold your hand much and it will be a brutal rude awakening on several occasions. This game does a few things very well: crafting, player housing, and pvp. A patron account is pretty much a must have but paying real life money for it is not necessary. You will level to max very fast but your gear will be much slower. You will need to earn gear by making money in this game instead of raiding like in wow. Though you can raid other players to make money."
archeage,3d1z0r,awkwardvlog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:45:34 2015 UTC,Adding to this you can get decent gear by doing dungeons but at the end of the day crafting gives the best end game gear

Don't spend anymore money than what you would spend on a normal game. 60 bucks. Getting that head start to gaining more labor at the get go will give you an advantage. If you can think of it, you can probably do it in game. So there are limitless possibilities on what you can do in AA. Have fun and enjoy the game for what it is."

Wave is good for the int on spellsinger becasue you will go up to 40+% crit rate which is fucking amazing on spellsinger for dmg output, However, as you would imagine, you will be squishy as fuck.  Personally im going for obsid hood/shirt, serp sleeves when 2.0 comes out, and the rest will be anthalon. If you cant aford or get anthalon then wave will be good enough.

archeage,3d0snh,bliz5555,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:51:06 2015 UTC,Paladins are more useful as a Templar in group pvp. Archers are a lot more valuable then. Also in 1v1 a Daggerspell can easily beat a Paladin.

You're telling this guy to use 34% less crit damage on a crit and crit damage based character. The gloves are BIS. Period. The 2% crit is more important when you're at lower gear levels or 20-25% crit but not when you're at 35-40%.    No matter which one you go with, you're going to blow stuff up though. That's the reality."

archeage,3d06ok,Antrophis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:44:05 2015 UTC,"For darkrunner, usually people like dual wielding for the 1v1 strength, 2H is still very strong in world PvP. Picking your weapon is simply just picking whatever weapon type passive you like best. Every weapon type have a unique hidden passive that does an effect.  Shortspears do puncture, which causes one of your attacks to pierce 100% armor. Katanas cause your next attack to critical hiy, so it feels like having higher crit rate. Swords cause the next attack you get hit by to be parried, so it feels like you have higher parry rate. Another thing to note is obsidian swords are 100% only for melee players, while obsidian katanas are good for melees or mages and shortspears are good for melees or healers. Pick whichever you believe to be your favourite  PS: If you're wondering about 2H weapon effects:  Nodachi is same as katana  Longspear is same as shortspear  Greatsword is same as sword"

archeage,3czxgg,A_Bumpkin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:50:31 2015 UTC,Both the fishing boat and the warships can carry 4 packs if i'm not wrong so there really wouldn't be much of a difference from you farm wagon. But you could save up some money and buy the upgrade to a farm hauler which lets you transport 6+1 packs on land and it's easier getting packs on a land vehicle than on a boat.  But that's just my own opinion if you have more fun with boats than just get one and if you don't like fishing than the warships are probably your best choice but keep in mind you still need a lot of money to upgrade the parts. (That's also why people say fishing boats are weaker because you can't really upgrade their parts.)  Hope i could help at least a little :)
archeage,3czxgg,Masteraya,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:23:32 2015 UTC,I would Say a galleon or merchant ship. Galleons are super fast with the upgrades and most people dont attack them for trade packs.

For the longest time The western alliance had nearly all the power because of their massive numbers. However after the exodus from both east and west into the pirate faction, we are seeing some interesting power struggles develop.  First off, the east realized how much power they lost and are now actually setting up a faction wide TS server to allow for more cooperation and power coming from the east.   Secondly, the pirate faction is quite small in comparison to the large alliances on both the east and west, but to due good cooperation and skilled players they are able to do quite a lot with their size. Stopping kraken attempts from the west multiple days in a row now.  Finally the west seems to still be about the same power, although with the other factions gaining power it seems the gap has closed quite a bit.  We'll have to see in the coming months how this will all turn out, but one thing I can say for sure is Naima is no longer as boring as it once was, and I'm really excited to be a part of the server at the moment."

archeage,3cy6cf,lolgambler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"East - Ayahuasca  West - Poid (Void/Purge)  All of west hates Poid.   East likes Ayahuasca, we win abyssal and halcy for them. (Even when we're not there. If we're doing Delph/anthalon while abyssal is going on, Poid follows. Therefore giving the lower guilds a good fighting chance against the other lower guilds on west)   Even though we control the world bosses, it's not without competition. It's extremely fun to be honest.   Other notable guilds on east: - Lannister - full of high gear scored players, they like to PvP and play FarmVille and Sims ArcheAge edition.  They are mostly great and skilled players.  - Paramaters - They're KOS'd by us (Ayahuasca), but we're not hostile to them outside of PvP. They're pretty chill players, ranging from 2500-4500GS they like to PvP and faction pirate. (Which I enjoy, it gives people a challenge!) so basically, they're KOS, but still good people. It's just the way they like to play (same with a lot of ayahuasca) - Jade Dynasty - FarmVille only. Hello Kitty Nation and skilled players from JD joined together to make Ayahuasca. I don't know if they're even active anymore tbh. But if you like farming go to them.  - PkInc- Eh... They're like Paramaters, but they're douchebags. I despise most of them, not because they steal packs (I believe that's a key part of the game) but because of the scammers in the Guild. (Guild leader and Parze. Look in Inochs forums to learn more).   Those are the 'known' guilds.  Here's smaller guilds: -Knightmares- Fishing and more fishing! Nice people, don't do much content besides for farming/fishing.  -Silvermist- BR Guild, does Serpentis a lot. All I really know about them. (Sadly when I ran Serp with them they just... Didn't get it. Idk)   Some west guilds I know of: -Invictus- Declared war against Poid. They seem like great people.  -W T F- (sigh.. More wtf wannabes. Ohwell) Trade runs and PvP. They seemed nice at first, and we did trades with them. Then one got butt hurt because he died by one of our members and now they're extremely hostile.   Sorry I can't say much about west guilds... Anyways, Inoch is a great server. The fights between east and west are always interesting.  It's great for all types of players, and I recommend you join Inoch.  (For an example, Hello Kitty Nation our old guild came from Aranzeb. We have A LOT more fun on Inoch. We were the leading force on west Aranzeb: Banana)   Cheers :)  TL;DR Inoch is great and quite balanced."

Haranyan's are not even bothering to show up as they get reckted  when they do. Delphinad Ghost Ships are not controlled over any side, as there is a constant fight between East and West the last month. I could say on average it's a 2/3 for Haranyan's even though Nuian's have scored 3/3 a couple days. Kraken is again split and no side has a easy go on it.

Interestingly enough, this logo is actually from the flag and logo of Phoenix, Arizona adopted in 1990, long before the website and ArcheAge. It's entirely possible that Googling ""Phoenix Logo"" turned this up (Phoenix is no small city) and used the logo for their own logos.  Also, the developers of ArcheAge actually changed it a little bit to make it ""their own"" but pretty much still looks the same except more pixelly and jagged."

Another rumor, that a someone on reddit swore by, was that the spear passive will proc while using ranged skills.

It is to create a launch experience (hopefully up to date to avoid all the exploits) and sending existing characters to that server would defeat the purpose. I myself am considering starting on this new server, however they only stated that it will come with 2.0 and I do not know of a release date for it. I believe we are at 1.7b currently (1.7c coming soon according to the banner on the livestream) with more information coming in the producers letter being released about a week after this past livestream (Friday).  What I would suggest is if you want to be free to play, start now, get your patron by buying APEX. I assume that while the new server will be independent from other servers any account level attributes (patron and credits) should remain consistant on the new server. On another note, at launch APEX were VERY cheap, like around 30 gold compared to the current ~500g. Start now, get patron, maybe save up some credits and learn the game a bit and when the new servers are released, you will know what you are doing, be well within the competitive range for gear which I think will greatly improve your experience. Also get land ASAP. I imagine land will go very quickly and remain filled on that server until people decide to stay or go back to their usual server."

archeage,3cwf7v,Kaotikid,-1,Sun Jul 12 11:36:13 2015 UTC,Back when their games were sub based people stopped playing them. They will not make a purely sub-based server. It would have like three people on it. Plus they'd have to allocate devs to that instead of the main servers. It's a pipe-dream.

My recommendation would be to save that money, and slowly start buying Epherium/Delph pieces, then sell your Mag set and use that money to gem your new set. Ayanad armor is really nice and tempting, but it is ridiculously expensive, and just the gloves don't give enough stats to merit 7.5k. Especially if you only have a mag set AND its all your money.

archeage,3cy0rj,PvtWiggles,2,Sat Jul 11 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"A good starting point would be to grab the obsidian weapon quest line and craft your tier 1 obsidian weapon (its cheaper to regrade at t1). If you do go through the quest lines (which means crafting said obby weapon to t3), you eventually unlock your kill dailies for the aurorian zones (which are a good supplement for the library). Make sure you hit your servers library raids at the daily reset time! As for armor, serp gear is free and still very viable, as well as obsidian armor. Crafted gear imo, is still best mainly because its tradable (obsidian gear can be traded after equipped, but only if you craft it to the next tier).  In addition to enigmatist and spellsong mentioned by Drax, swiftstone is also a very nice class to play."
archeage,3cy0rj,sookie45,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info dude, so just so I dont misunderstand I should get the obsidian T1 weapon through a quest and regrade it to like Unique BEFORE going to T2? is that right? :P   Sorry what are the server library raids?"
archeage,3cy0rj,sookie45,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:13:08 2015 UTC,"If you can afford it, yes absolutely regrade before crafting it to t2. Ideally, you wanna regrade to unique and then use a resplendant regrade scroll (which gives a chance to skip a grade) with a red charm or yellow charm. The library raid happens at daily reset time (8pm est for NA servers). You should see people x'ing up for it in faction. The library can be confusing the first time or two, but its easy to catch on quick. Just be aware generally ive seen people do the 2nd/3rd floor bosses first before coming back to f1. Also take an immortal xp tonic in with you. I wish i could explain this further as it took me some asking and much searching to find info on when i came back 2 months ago, but im at work right now lol.

archeage,3cy0rj,TheDuckExtremist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"Hi there. First off, I'd like to say welcome back and i hope your'e enjoying your time so far!   Yes Primeval's and most archers are fairly weak at the moment unless you have a VERY good weapon, as a 4.2k Argent the only archer that beats me on a regular is Shylo and that's because he has 5.9k gear(around). I don't recommend archer as a main spec There are two caster classes that I see pretty often in 1's, Enigmatist[Sorc/Shadow/Aura](I hate these by the way they're more cheese than my spec) the basic strategy with this class is to global somebody with God's Whip and if the don't die the port away until it's off CD, and Swiftstone[Sorc/Shadow/Defense] this is my recommendation, I'm not real sure on the play style since I'm more of a melee type of guy but, the Defense tree is extremely nice for dealing with all of those Battlerage classes that are so popular right now  As for your gear, you can do one of three things to get onto the gear curve, The Free Way If you have a guild, ask them to run you through Serpentis and get the Cloth set from there, this is right on with Epherium tier, but Serpentis requires a decent amount of geared people to tackle. The Cheap Way Buy/farm Auroria gear, the gear randomly drops off of auroria mobs and is decently cheap in the AH each piece gives a bonus for a certain skill, there is no 4 or 7 set bonus, Just below Epherium.The ""holy shit I don't have that much money or time way"" Get a fully gemmed Epherium gear set. This is what I did, took me forever to get the gold, around 22k for my full 7 set of Clest Stone Cloth Yep as of now library is about the fastest way to level, and yes its boring, yes its time consuming, and yes i hate it too   GL I hope you enjoy your time<3"

So fuck hasla unless its you literally cant make an obsidian sword.   Im personally using the setup i suggested and it works just fine. im using a t2 celestial sword and a t1 unique dagger.
archeage,3cxqbh,RtuDtu,6,Sat Jul 11 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"High end crafting is all RNG.  So is all regrading.  There is no ""work hard and you will succeed"" in ArcheAge.  It's either ""grind for gold or spend real money on the marketplace"" to succeed if you are wanting to avoid the RNG.  There are three kinds of people with high-end gear.  Those who grind the gold in months, those who buy the gold in hours, and those who get lucky with RNG.  The people who work hard are the grinders and will always be far behind on time-spent than those with bigger wallets and luckier crafting."

I buy my gear off the AH and then regrade it do unique (No risk to the item breaking) I gem it and enchant it using the auction house.  It's entirely up to the player whether they want to risk their stuff for RNG, or just save up and buy it."
archeage,3cxqbh,turtlelord,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"yes you are right, one can make some decent cash through traderuns, however you also have to note that your income per day (doing traderuns at least) is very much fixed.  you get 2,8k labor a day (so thats the regen rate for 24h) so you can only make so many packs and/or hand packs in. im not sure but on average, including stuff like kraken and selling your gilda stars every now and then as well as those merit badges, should be around 300-400g. so as in many games the ""catch up"" mechanics are not that favourable, especially if you think of inflated prices. but then again it depends on the server (low pop servers tend to be expensive) and mostly on your luck. if you craft weapons all day and manage to get 4 delphinads and manage to sell them at decent prices you will get to your goal faster than through trading i guess"
archeage,3cxqbh,footmenhau,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Archeage has an interesting F2P exponential income growth system.  While yes you're right I'm limited to 2.8k labor per day. But can I make enough to cover my patron over a month? Obsolutely! Twice over in fact.   So I make a second account and buy him patron too, now he can pay for his own patron and another next month.  Now I have 4 patron accounts right? If that's not enough to catch up your gear and clipper a bit, you're screwed lol.  I currently have 10 patron accounts, I don't dual box because I'm not a richy rich with 10 computers lol. I log into the 9 other newbies every other day and I can burn their 5k labor in roughly 20 minutes each with a little prep and mailing from my main.  I stopped using the income gold to buy more patron accounts a while ago, Now I've got tons of gold and all my gear is fine where it is I feel like. So I just buy boats and stuff now lol.  I've been playing for a bit more than 2 months now.   Disclaimer: I did buy patron on my first 2 accounts using real cash and I do buy costumes from the marketplace, but I'm impatient."
archeage,3cxqbh,turtlelord,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"completely agree there the thing is that managing 10 accounts can be quite tiresome alone as well as trying to spend labor for all of them. its kinda like a second job (or thats how it feels sometimes) and i only tried this with my main and 2 alts. you could surely go full bananas have 10 alts and spend labor actively for all of them and then also make 10 alts on the EU/NA server and spend labor there and you would get rich very fast.  that would/could consume most of your day though with monotonous activities (even just going by what you said with 20mins) and on the other hand its a game and is supposed to be fun to play not endless grinding.  so if you have the time and you want to make the effort you can catch up to ""old"" players who dont have 10 accounts themselves i guess"
archeage,3cxqbh,footmenhau,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. You worked smart not hard. Thats what this game rewards. People who can out think the system. Either pirates who can catch merchants, merchants who can outsmart pirates, people who are clever on the market, people who know that there is no ""Best way to make gold"", people who buy low and sell high instead of panicking when prices drop and ditching their stores. And people who know how to regrade. The rng in this game does not reward brute force tactics. The actual amount of people dumping thousands of dollars into this game is not as high as people think it is."
archeage,3cxqbh,awkwardvlog,0,Sun Jul 12 07:53:30 2015 UTC,"But the point is if you wanted to get a high gear score the people who started before you will always have the advantage because it is pure RNG.

archeage,3cxqbh,Draxus,2,Sat Jul 11 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really make sense though. You have to choose between RNG or grind, or everyone will be power-capped in no time and the game will die. If the game had less RNG and more grind it would be difficult or impossible to catch up to someone who has been grinding the whole time, there is no shortcut.

Don't even bother trying to kite unless you're fighting someone with no gap closers and low mobility. Just burst and run away/stealth and wait on your cooldowns.

Yes you're going to need ATLEAST a divine bow to play am Archer so I would recommend saving up for that, celestial or below and you will lost most fights due to the current gear curve.   The most important thing with playing an Archer is to maintain your distance between you and your target.

And before we get the mandatory ""animation canceling is broken"", it's NOT animation canceling that is the problem. Animation canceling has been in the game since the very start."

archeage,3ctiky,LavendrGooms,6,Fri Jul 10 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"From my testing it seems the skill queue is allowing you to cast God's Whip multiple times before the server even registers that it has been cast once.  Animation canceling isn't the problem, it's definitely the skill queue that needs tweaking. On top of that, skills like Fireball are bugged. The same goes for shooting a cannon.

I absolutely agree now it was broken and needed to be fixed, please for the love of god fix god's whip and let me use the skill queue , i just want to play at 80% of what korean players with very low single digit lag get to play.   Please don't gimp the spell queue because of this bug, fix what was broken and let me enjoy playing a less clunky game; heck i play an archer because we have instant spells and stealth to help with a 250ms ping please please bring the skill queue back soon.  This bug is fixed so there is nothing against the forum about taking about it.  A very skilled player could perform this bug but i think most players used mouse macro's.   The spell queue for some reason was shit if i cast god's whip then any other instant spell i could cast god's whip again ignoring the 5 cast rule, THE SPELL QUEUE WAS FINE just make it handle spells correctly especially cooldowns.   Essentially spamming buttons ignored the cooldown and max casts on god's whip, thats bad code , fix the code but leave the skill queue how it was because i want to play a game that feels good with bad ping."

archeage,3ctiky,pixels123,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"As an Aussie player with typical higher ping, I found the skill queue really good as before I had a noticeable delay between my skills but with the queue I was able to cancel out that delay and feel like I could cast skills smoothly and in succession. In saying that, I'm glad it is being disabled to prevent it from being abused like I've seen in the videos of a billion God's Whips being cast in a second, I just hope that the mechanic can come back sometime soon to give us higher ping users a bit more of a level playing field because from my limited experience with it, it worked really well."

Anyways some skills are needed to be quick reaction and spammable due tot he nature of the skill.  But according to trion you have to have your GCD so what do they do.  They dive it a short one such as fervent healing.  And in effect you can make abilities like Triple slash and well any auto attack in this game that launches multiple hits in a single cool down, reset and keep hitting.

archeage,3cvb5t,nyym1,2,Sat Jul 11 18:49:58 2015 UTC,the thing that makes DR op is set of utilities from auramancy and I am pretty sure enigmatist has that as well.  Just get more pvp experience and learn how different classes work.
archeage,3cvb5t,veritascs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:04:43 2015 UTC,"It's that they have pretty excellent utility, mobility, cc, and damage that makes them extremely powerful in single target encounters.   Their weakness is their squishiness, and witchcraft which is probably the only single target tree that's stronger than glass cannon melee. Many people opt for tank classes that use defense and/or self heals to outlive their burst and kill them with medium damage output.   Overall I do think they're pretty op because they're so easy to get gank kills with and it shows by how popular they are. But enigmatist is a mage class that has all the utility and mobility of a darkrunner so I think your problem is your level, your gear, and your approach."

Maybe you should learn to play your own class, learn the strengths and weaknesses of it, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of other classes instead of just coming to forums to cry and complain.  The most geared caster on our server is playing the same class as you right now, yet I can still 2 shot him if I catch him, and a single god's whip combo of his will wipe me off the face of the earth just as quick.  That is how a PvP game works with checks and balances.  Join a guild that will teach you the basics of PvP, because you obviously don't understand them.  TL;DR: Toughen up and don't be so lazy."

archeage,3cvb5t,buttreynolds,2,Sat Jul 11 04:07:50 2015 UTC,"Darkrunners are just flat out OP... I played one with mag squall gear 5 pieces, and 2 pieces GHA. With 2 hasla t3 swords. This cheap gear was 2 piecing archers in epherium gear, and blighters with 20k+ HP. (Wasn't 2 piecing the tanks, But pretty much killed them before they could do anything to me.   The only thing I hated about the class was sometimes my abilities would parry, And there goes me. I die lmao (But to mention i had no gems on my gear, So thats a reason I got parried a lot)  If it's dr v dr, It's whoever leeches first.. Simple as that. Now that I'm a primeval, I can do the same leech tactic and pre-pop shrug it off to counter their leech, BUT if i don't use shrug it off then I'm most likely fucked. Since DR's are very mobile and melee. Archers do -20% damage when 8m close to target..  All in all, Darkrunner is a very good class. If you can pre-pop shrug it off, Do it. Have toughness on your pants, and res on your chest. (Seen you ask something about that)  EDIT: Also most of the time it doesn't matter about a DR's GS. My buddy played one for the longest time in quest gear, then upgraded to gha gear with t3 hasla and a GHA spear that dropped. He was beating a full epherium set DR. This was before we had the GS stat. I'm sure he was only about 2500 GS or even lower. (Full GHA, T3 hasla, and GHA spear, No gems) I still don't see why they nerf archers, And not DR's."

archeage,3cvb5t,nyym1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:29:08 2015 UTC,darkrunners are melee so they sacrifice the ability to get free damage in large scale pvp and pve for extremely high damage that's near suicidal in most circumstances.  There are classes that put out much more damage than dr even...like hellweaver.  These classes sacrifice even more like mobility and sustain.  In the end if you want to counter a melee class you need to use plate and a shield and a defense potion.  if you get your defense up to the 8k range they cannot kill you in any realistic sense.  then your worries would be a caster.

However the skills that you would commonly use are absurd in bigger fights, crows is an aoe impale (basically stun), crows do a substantial DOT if your gear is right. Summon wraith can be annoying as hell if channelled in a group of people uninterrupted (which isn't as hard as it may seem) And on top of that you get things like stillness, great at breaking fear and it's an AOE silence. If you can get on a boat and cast that you can literally disable them for 5 seconds.   However Occultism has another great utility which has been kind of forgotten with recent songcraft hype. The passives, you can pump out so much damage if you have almost all the passives in there. We're talking extra crit chance and crit damage. And % to damage when you are immobile. Very situational indeed, especially in pvp, but in PVE it's superb.   All depends what type of occultism class you want to be, tank? mage? or some bizzarre abomination with battle rage vitalism and occultism? :P The skilltree itself is amazing, but you shouldn't build your class around it, use it as a utility tree like auramancy or shadowplay."

My mate used this build alongside his normal darkrunner, literally all he had from Occu was urgency and hellspears I think. Urgency so that you have no stun after the frenzy. Ye, that's all the synergy you're getting lol. Retribution is very situational. It's like an awful redoubt that doesn't do anything. If you have ever fought a mob with that buff (Hasla golem) that returns damage onto you, you'd know it's pretty insignificant.   And Mana stars can do damage, but if you compare it to things like Flamebolt or endless arrows, it loses on both damage and range."

archeage,3ctsg9,pixels123,6,Fri Jul 10 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"Animation canceling isn't the issue - the skill queue broke something and allows skills to exceed their max use limits - ie: 20+ gods whips on one cooldown, when the max is 5."
archeage,3cuk8w,TheUncleVic,3,Fri Jul 10 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"This game can either be the most fun you've ever had or the worst experience ever. It all really depends on two things: Your guild and your server. I'm in a guild called Puga ab Laganum on the Kyrios server, and it's the most fun I've had in a while. Why? Because the guild I'm in is not only very active and supportive of their members, they're in the game to have fun. Some nights, indeed, we do farming in the various dungeons, but other nights we're doing trade pack runs across the sea, killing all the reds we come across. Sometimes we're exploring the new lands added to archeage, and some nights we take it easy and fish on the open blue. But like I said, it isn't just the guild that makes the game. The server is a big factor too. Our server, Kyrios, has seen some hard times with the departure of a few Big Guilds on either alliance. There's now a upward trend of people killing their own faction, and some guilds even pride themselves on it. It certainly adds a new challenge to the game when your riding along with your guild and see a ship coming up on your behind, and suddenly your being attacked by your own faction. You have to develop a strategy to get past people camping out at popular trade spots so you don't get jumped. You have to develop a specific sequence of healing then attacking with your guildies to take down a boss. One big thing I'll let you figure out yourself is all of the several game events you'll encounter. It's insanely awesome. This is truly a great game, and if you play it right, you'll love it."
archeage,3cuk8w,imgladimnothim,3,Sat Jul 11 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"Great response! Like all sandbox mmos the game is what you make it, and it sounds like you're having as much fun as I am."
archeage,3cuk8w,alt00174,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"Its a fun game till you get to end game gearing, then its a chore. You'll spend more time running packs than you do anything else. This is HOURS of gameplay. Also, picking the right server is essential, as you can be fucked by your faction being underpowered because they chose to prey on themselves vs fight the other faction."
archeage,3cuk8w,superchibisan2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:22:47 2015 UTC,Don't enter the game thinking it's anything. The game will change a lot depending on what server you play on and what you decide to do. It's not going to hold your hand and guide you. You will have to find your own fun. I farm and craft and occasionally will go out with my guild on trade runs. Sometimes I end up in pvp which can be fun when it's goal oriented. Sometimes my fellow factionmates will purple on us just for fun. Which is annoying as hell but also fun at the same time. If you are the kind of person who needs to be told what to do you may not enjoy the game much. In this game if you are having fun you are doing it right. If it feels like work you are doing it wrong.
archeage,3cuk8w,awkwardvlog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:23:53 2015 UTC,"It's a fun game, I will tell you that. Just don't come into this game with the mindset that you want to be the best. Youll get beat here and there by well geared players, but don't let that discourage you to keep playing. Get back up and work, and most of all have fun. Find what you like to do in game, and make the best out of it. One rule, stay away from the forums, and don't take faction chat to heart."
archeage,3cuk8w,reloys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:10:44 2015 UTC,"Joining this game after it's been out for so long will lead to feeling the disparity between gear, level, gold, server experience, and pvp experience. Don't get me wrong Archeage is an amazing game and I love it, but it isn't the nicest to newer players unless you get absurdly lucky or put a lot of money into it. Now don't think I'm trying to deter you, but if I may make a suggestion, grab a few friends with a balanced setup and join a moderately sized server (perhaps Naima or Inoch) and play through the game normally to experience the game and see if it's something you'd like. Progress like everyone else did before 1.7 hit with GHA and Hasla gear to start (unless crafting is your thing then obsidian is great). Whenever 2.0 patch hits and the fresh server is released start again on that one with the knowledge you gained prior. There won't be any immediate huge disparities and you and your friends could experience the game to its fullest without being the brand new newbies which may taint your Archeage experience."
archeage,3cuk8w,GunnerMC95,-2,Sat Jul 11 14:21:06 2015 UTC,whatever anyone tells you about this game it is a piece of crap and not worth playing it is heavily pvp oriented no matter what server you play and you will get stomped out by players who have dumped more than 2000+ irl currency in this game or have been playing very actively (8-12hrs) a day since alpha

archeage,3ct7eq,Villentrenmerth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:49:11 2015 UTC,skill queuing caused animation cancelling to be done easier so it in turn was the problem if animation canceling could be easily addressed they would do so but the best course of action is to remove the skill queuing until they get animation canceling in order
archeage,3ct7eq,Villentrenmerth,0,Fri Jul 10 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"How is that a buff? With the second combo performance your Whirlwind hit the target before Sunder Earth was applied.  Casting 2 consecutive Battlerage spells definitely can be called as a buff, in comparison to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbNjCPoAww (17k mana drained in fraction of a second)."
archeage,3ct7eq,Hasbotted,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:10:16 2015 UTC,i said it buffs mages but messes up Melee hence how the combo doesn't go off. The first time i hit the whirlwind after i saw the sunder go off then the next two times i did it with skill queuing granted one skill was evaded but you can see how it doesnt do the combo no where did i say it was a buff to melee
archeage,3cuoda,ihronn,3,Fri Jul 10 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Totally! just level up to 55 first off.  save all your gold and archeum from quests and use it to buy apex for patron.  once you get patron you can re-buy it montly with apex you get from auction house.  gold is easier to get every month you play as you learn better ways to earn it.  As far as content yes you can do everything f2p.  you may die a lot more but you can still do it :)
archeage,3cuoda,a4moondoggy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"can a F2P player like myself survive here?   I played ArcheAge for the past 13 months, and I would like to say that it would be close to impossible (If you like challenges: go for it).  A group of F2P players however can ""creep"" their power up, by purchasing first Patron account with combined effort, and then sustain their Patron Subscription and expand to additional Patron Subscriptions easily.  This game has lots to offer, but is definitely aimed at groups (even 2-5 man party or undergeared players will be exponentially more powerful than a PUG of solo players).  If you are interested in RP or very Casual style, then it's very comfortable: F2P account has access to most of the important content. If you are looking for obtaining significant Gear, then your progress will be severely limited by Labor/Gold Acquisition."

I tell you from experience, AA is a grind, it has it's features, it has it's perks, but honestly, if I wouldn't accept invitation to play ArcheAge, I would fail trying to figure the game alone."

ArcheAge's PVPers are either sponsored (by their group, guild), or grinded.  Answering your initial question: I believe that your friends will be at Mythic level, before you will get entry PVP gear as F2P. That's how brutal ArcheAge is.  Today at the recent Livestream Trion announced NEW servers that will be opened at the end of this year.  I would honestly advice you to wait. Get F2P ArcheAge, test the game, and get ready for the Rat Race that will be released at the end of this year.  Don't go with 3-5h per day as Solo ArcheAge player, because there might be a danger that it will burn you out."

archeage,3cuoda,NSA-SURVEILLANCE,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:28:52 2015 UTC,TBH I think the easiest way would be to just pay your first month of subscription then maintain it by logging in onto your NA account once per day to keep the Loyalty points (30 days 5 loyalty per day = enough for atleast 1 Lucky sunpoint which sells for 400-500g on my AH cluster which itself is just enough for 1 APEX. then burn the labor by mining and selling the Raw stone to afford a second APEX) doing this and you will no longer having to care about to renew your patron with $.  edit* by NA server I refer to incase your main is on EU. and the opposite if your from NA

archeage,3cuoda,Wolfing731,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"F2P should be easy if you get patron with apex, 3-5 hours a day is plenty of time to efficiently burn labor for the most gold output."

To many reds killing my alts and just harassing me. so i moved to sungold fields. found a corner and do a rotation on the cunning/sunbathing field roots. i was pulling griffons for a while. but they have a lot more hp then field roots. since all im after is purses and since they changed the drop rate on purses to always drop from mobs or at least it feels this way. i remember when starred mobs were the only guarantee on purse drops. now it seems anything and everything drops purses. i just do the roots. they have a slow and hit kind of hard but as long as you have like 3400gs in cloth with a shield you should be fine. thurmaturge is my desired AOE farming class. sorc/def/aura. gives you damage and survivabilty and sustainability

archeage,3cscgj,WyzeThawt,2,Fri Jul 10 13:55:50 2015 UTC,That was normal animation cancellation with a bit of lagg. It seems that when your spamming 3-4 abilties at once with godswhip it causes the godswhip to show multiple hits however I can say at least in my experience that I only see the 5 animations from godswhip. Macro'ing you can get 30 or so abilties off within a 1 second window which is crazy. However even with people using macros the problem lies in the ability queue stacking abilities.
archeage,3cscgj,GraySwagBuster,2,Fri Jul 10 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"no this is not normal animation canceling. normal animation canceling would have been  GW > freezeing earth > GW > chain lightning > GW > etc and still took about 2 seconds.   he was able to hit each of the 10 gods whips for different damage so none were duplicate messages.  5 should have been the max in the first place and triggered CD 13 moves in total (that we can see) in the log all were cast within the same exact second timestamp   the issue is a combination of the skill queue, animation cancelling and im pretty certain this exact instance in particular was with a macro, its way too perfect that they perfectly spammed gw 5 times into freezing earth and chain lightning into 5 more gw in under a second manually."

Restart on the new servers or have nobody to play with? Yeah, no thanks, it took me plenty long enough to get where I am now never having put any money into anything but a subscription fee. Thanks a whole lot, Trion! This impending doom for my server has more or less sapped me of my motivation to play, knowing none of it will matter in some months' time..   Also, lol, you think a new server will mean no whales? Do you think that when they leave their old server, they will just leave their old belongings behind? They'll cash it all out for credits so they can have a head start on the new server :). ""Stick it to the whales"" heh. Sorry to break it to you, but they'll be the one's ass-raping you until you manage to get geared again. Even if they didn't transfer over their shit, what makes you think they would have any problem blowing even more money on this game?"

And you obviously aren't that experienced a trader, so it's not a first step you'd want to take. Below I have outlined what I suggest you should do:   Start planting larders on your gazebos. You can fit 16 larders on one. And they give you an aged pack in 3 days. Try to plant as many larders as you can run (see point 3 to decide) Get a clipper if you don't have one yet, the one with the harpoon in the front is better. Buy a Crest Trade Pack Storage and put it there. Get Heroic+ sails and a heroic propellant (That's more than enough). Now you can run 2 packs at a time to Two Crowns.  Depending on where your gazebos are your aged packs will either be very very profitable or very profitable. So profitable. Try to determine how many packs you can run a day and plant that many on your gazebos."

archeage,3cu2ef,Cosmic_Accident,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"So for a schooner you would ideally want 2 celestial sails, that's about 1600g could be higher or lower depending on your AH cluster. The plans for the schooner will also go for around 1800g. Pretty safe to assume it will be an investment of about 3500g. Halcy packs are 15 charcoal each at solis. In a perfect world that would be 300 charcoals for a tradeship, but each pack will drop the % and it will already be under 130% in halcy peace time so you'd most likely be looking at 250-280 charcoals per tradeship. The cost of making 20 packs is around 50-60g in itself. You'd be making a profit of 220-260g per run assuming you have atleast 2 people helping you. Depending on your commerce proficiency, your efficiency would be with this trade run 8-10 silver per labor point. That's like coinpurse farming.  All things considered, I'd say the tradeship would be a terrible investment."

Provides stam/STR on all with the addition of several bonuses on each piece (+damage, +magic defense, +crit rates, reduction of cooldown on bullrush/shield slam)   Your best bet out of these 3 IMO would be the 5 piece obsidian, as it can be upgraded later to tier 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, gaining additional stats and bonuses.  Of course there is always the option of full magnificent, epherium or delphinad gear, but these will also cost you far more than a set of illustrious or t1 obsidian."

So, the max speed of all cars will be changing in a future update. That speed cap is currently set to 30 m/s, and that cap will be standardized across all cars in the game. No more tiering speed caps depending on the car you drive. We do want cars to be faster, but they also can't be at their previous uncapped state where they could hit something crazy high like 100 m/s.   Otherwise, what /u/mauledbypandas said is why most people get the Apex Squall. If you flip over a lot, the Apex Squall will help you flip upright again while the Comet Speedster has speed boost skills. I've also heard before the car patch that the Comet Speedster handles better at high speeds, but I don't know after the patch.  If you save up another 400 Gilda for the Timber Coupe, the handling on the Timber Coupe has generally been agreed upon to be the best out of the three cars as well as the ability to offroad drive better than the other two."

archeage,3cpfl8,Lelouch133,0,Thu Jul 9 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'm already noticing everything feels so less clunky.  As a spellsinger with 60% cast time my God's Whip is much faster than it used to be. Fireball has the same cast time but the 2nd and 3rd fireball happen much faster. It's also possible to do 3 fireball rotations after a drop back instead of just 2 (without reduced attack speed). The downside is it gives you less time to weave during the fireball animations so freecast fireball's mobility went down.  edit: I think this mainly reduces input lag on abilities because a player can queue their abilities and the server can recognize them before the GCD, making them instant when they come up in queue."

archeage,3cse90,axi0matical,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:48:58 2015 UTC,"The program itself isn't anything that you can be banned for. It's just what you do with it and especially the macros. If you bind another key on your mouse, that should be allowed. It's like binding a single skill on your mouse. Using the macro recording function to spam certain key to gain advantage, that's what gets you banned. Like the godswhip videos that have been posted in here recently. It spams a key, kills the enemy within seconds while the enemy can't do shit. Or making your mount run in circles using a macro that keeps W+A(or D) down (I still don't get it why people used to do that before..).  So pretty much use common sense when using the macros in Synapse. Are you making it spam a button? Do you get any advantage by using it? If no, then you're pretty much good to go."

With afking it took several days to get it to lvl 50 (did that with my yata when afk kick was removed). But yeah, now with library it's easier and you can do it while you grind yourself to 55 :)"

They aren't looking that hard it seems because I come across bots all the time. I have got back some ""Kill Reports"" from Devs from using the skill/report feature.   That's when they investigate and yup, it's a damn botter and they deal with it. They refund back the 25 labor it takes to report these vermin along with 25 extra. But don't get any ideas like that's going to be a font of labor for you. It takes a long time and only a portion of these things get nailed.   I watched a really slick one the other day, a new botter that can run along in the zone on a predetermined path and picks whatever is growing and ready to pick. It has ran past my 16x16 several times and ran the exact same pattern every time. The last time, I ran it down and tried to talk to it, but it was clearly in an automated mode.   I reported it, but often these things are tricky, they have alerts and bypasses to help them deal with being thwarted or banned. They were sophisticated a decade ago, I can't imagine how difficult they are to deal with now.   A few days ago I went to Halsa to get some friends their quest gear as they were fresh 50s and they aren't ""swipers"" hence it was time to get the starter scrub gear. We found all kinds of bots there and we did our duty and killed them until it grew amazingly boring. I was chuckling at how they'd return over the exact same path to resume their botting. It was so obvious.   I've found entire guilds of bots in Hellswamp, it's down right creepy.   The point is, if they aren't going to cut down on this blatant botting by serious bot farmers who are either farming mats or power leveling characters for sale or something, then I wouldn't waste an iota of sleep over your MMO mouse software.

archeage,3crcr0,donnerstreik,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"Short answer:  Welcome back, Darkrunner is really popular, yes, blighter is viable, and got to the library for xp.  Long Answer: Welcome back! A lot had changed, but it is still a great game. The most popular class, in my personal experience, is Darkrunner. With the combination of shadowplay, battlerage, and auramancy, this class is a glass cannon melee assassin that combos by putting you to sleep to then buff themselves up to hit you really hard with their battlerage skills. Now with blighter, it is basically a bruiser version of that class. You have all of the same damage skills as DR, but you're also tanky and have some cc. Ive seen it been played very well and overall is still a very viable class. As for leveling, you want to go to the library, in Diamond Shores. There is a free teleport gate in Marianople that will take you just outside. Then, just grab the offered dailies and buy some 1st floor bounties (kill quests that you can rack up progress with the daily kill quests at the same time), and head in with a group. The mobs in here are level 51+ and they will wreck you if you aren't careful. Also, in the library, there are bosses that spawn and are able to drop some good stuff. Everyday at 7:00 pm Central Standard time, there is a raid to kill these bosses on all three floors and then do the dailies. Being in this raid is crucial to get leveled quickly as the quests for each boss give a metric fuck-ton of XP. Once the raid has finished their bosses they also go and do all of the daily quests, starting on the first floor. Note that to got to the second floor, you must be level 51, and then the 3rd floor at level 53. I hope this helps, and it's good having more people coming back.  :)"

The other fish you catch are things you can catch normally AFAIK.  When you're ice fishing, you have a rare chance to proc an Ice Floe Ursun which when you kill it has a chance to drop three types of Ice Tuna packs (Fry, Normal, Gargantuan). Looking at the database, it looks like the average price for each is 6g, 20g, and 80g respectively. However, this bear is VERY rare. On livestream, one of the Trion employees mentioned how he ice fished 50 times or so and never got the bear.

So far, not a single bear has spawned for me. As far as I can tell it's safe to just afk fish this way, although the fish come in slightly slower than normal bait fishing in my experience. The glacier crayfish aren't too rare, although until they're used in more recipes than the dawnsdrop boots I can't imagine they'll be worth much more than breaking down into dawn lake light essences. I'm positively enamored with fishing but the Tundra so far has been a pretty big let down. I would stick to sport fishing unless they increase the rates of bear spawns dramatically."

You could go farm these as a live player at any given time of the day because nobody else was doing them. They were easy pocket money for poor people, thats it, not a gold farming heaven.   It's shameful how easily people give up their liberty for the illusion of security. All trion has to do is say ""LOL BOTS GUYS"" and people will blindly believe it and allow them to shit on what was solid alternative game play. I use to go with my lowbie guildies down there to help them make some starter money. Jars were always up, because there were no fucking bots.

archeage,3cnea6,Adanriel,2,Thu Jul 9 14:36:01 2015 UTC,This is quite interesting for me as a game developer. Makes me wonder what would even be better hash if we are talking about random block of memory?
archeage,3cnea6,Tansien,5,Thu Jul 9 07:57:38 2015 UTC,"It isn't looking at random blocks. It's hashing sections of the 'code' part of the dll in memory. Even though the dll is loaded dynamically, those parts of it will always hash to the same result  There are several problems with the approach they chose.  With a weak hash algorithm, its possible to have a version of the dll with different code that will hash to the same value as the 'legit' code.  It isn't effective against any sort of hooks targeting the detection or hashing procedure. I assume they are banking on Hackshield to prevent this route.  The hash you are comparing to is within the client files. Yea.   The best actual solution would be to do what Blizzard does with their infamous Warden anticheat, despite how much they underutilize it. They can send packets to you, without you knowing ahead of time what they contain. These packets ask you to execute something on your client, testing whatever functions they want, and ask for your return value. Pretty much anything outside of running a second copy of the game to execute the arbitrary code is prevented (this is what companies like Glider did).   Nowadays, the way around Warden is to kill the game if a payload is new and it doesn't know how to execute it with 'clean' code. It's an endless cat and mouse game.   Only professional developers are savvy enough to make things able to compete with advanced anticheat like Warden, and it takes a lot of time. They usually sell cheats for a living. Blizzard has been on the warpath suing them, since it's pretty much the only thing you can do at that point, but as you might know, international laws are tough.  Heuristics are very good at banning bots. It takes a lot of really smart people to analyze that much data and get almost zero false positives. This is where the majority of bans in WoW/D3 come from.  Sorry for the jumbled rant, it's really late >>"
archeage,3cnea6,Adanriel,6,Thu Jul 9 08:27:09 2015 UTC,"Basically, this is only targeting a specific series of cheats in which people are passing around modified dll files that give advantages such as the ones I listed in the main post. They're all the rage on the RU servers.  In a few days, they'll bypass this in one of the 200 possible ways."
archeage,3cnea6,Adanriel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does sound like this took more work to make than it will to bypass it. It's just making me more convinced that XLGames either doesn't care much (this path could be because Trion asked them, so they did the minimum to satisfy the request), or they are utterly incompetent.  I did some memory hack prevention in some of my games, which was mostly security by obscurity - placing critical values into redundant places and dividing them all around the place, combining back with some clever algorithm, which could also be all around the place to make reverse engineering tougher. Was for a simple flash game and yet it was probably more secure than this.  But with bots and Trion it just seems weird. I'm not sure what kind of logs they have, but stuff like packs sold/made, black pearls/treasures picked. Bunch of other behavior stuff, all logged, processed on some other computer. Should make it easy to mark certain players for suspicious activity automatically. All that would be left is to have one GM checking it out.  Things like teleport hacks make zero sense to me - how can they be so difficult to fix and detect.  Implementing something like Warden shouldn't be too hard either. It's just a question of coming up with good challenges for client to answer. Ah well."

You can't go wrong with obsidian, if you want to min max 4 piece crafted and 3 piece obsidian is usually your best bet. Or you can just go full obsidian and pick something for your belt and arms, maybe crafted or heck maybe some auroria pieces for some equip effects.

Land demo transactions are honestly not as bad as you make them out to be.  I used to think that I'd never do a land transaction without appraisal certificates because I was like you and didn't want to deal with the possibility of the land getting stolen or me getting scammed. After my first land demo transaction though, I realized it wasn't really that bad as long as you have a trustworthy buyer/seller and you're attentive to your surroundings (i.e. Don't demo in front of someone you don't trust).  Granted, this was back when you needed 1 Appraisal Cert / 100g Selling Price and you had to spend more gold on certs than the cost of the land.

archeage,3cntr3,Konfustrahl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:01:42 2015 UTC,"question for clarification:  were you wearing the ominous cloth, meaning you have to make it cursed before you can sell it? or you wore the entry level obsidian and upgraded it to ominous and now have oppertunity to sell it?  this makes a big difference for more exaclt/relevant advice.  just to math out, im assuming you can sell this ominous level...  the cost of the salvaged items for shirt are about 300-450. multipled by 2 = 600-900 so lets just say for 800 gold you can get 2 salv illus shirts (bought mine for around 350 each by bidding and waiting), thats 200 gold left to buy/craft regrade scrolls and reach heroic. the shirt is worth it as long as the salvaged prices for shirts are close to 400. if closer to 300 i think i would rather craft it myself and have 400g to try for heroic, which isnt too hard or expensive.... most of the time.  the pants seem on par-ish, and the other pieces sound like really good deals actually.  the weapon however is a bit off imo. i can get a salv illus staff for about 300-325. muliply by 2 = 600-650. lets go conservative and say i spent 650 on the 2... thats 550g to spend on regrading. i personally would go that route without a question beacuse celestial or higher weapons are the norm now so it would be 1.2k + whatever i spend to regrade it higher, and 2.) i feel like im paying for your possible regrade losses you encountered + the profit you wish to achieve.  to be honest id rather spend 1.6-1.7k on a celestial t1 (one on my AH cluster right now) and buy the salvage pieces to upgrade it higher. better potential value in the long run. then again i am a gambler and crafted/regraded all my current gear myself except my jewerly."

archeage,3cnqqc,Quipore,2,Thu Jul 9 12:02:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I feel like the biggest issue is the general need of people to feel 'rewarded' for PvP'ing. What do you play the game for if not for PvP? Why upgrade your gear if it's not to kill other players?   I don't know, honestly, how to solve the issue of making people fight more or creating centralised areas with more action. Way back when Auroria was coming out I expected that to be the 'PvP island' because originally in KR (I believe?) it was honour for kills 24/7, which would certainly encourage more PvP there. Sadly that wasn't the case.  It's not just AA though, most modern MMOs suffer from this. The irony is that people are always complaining about it, but due to the very nature of PvP needing other people to fight, despite lots of people wanting to PvP they don't because they go out to PvP and find a lack of other players to engage with. It's a vicious cycle."
archeage,3cnqqc,phubbink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:40:31 2015 UTC,"Frankly, the issue is the very nature of most MMORPGs, not to mention many other games that don't have the MMO aspect of it.  Take Diablo 3 for example.  Tons of people still play that game (and many like it) long past the point where they're able to walk about mindlessly killing things with little to no threat of dying.  They do it out of one simple notion of gear progression, a sort of numbers and optimization puzzle style of dressing up barbie dolls.  It's much the same in AA.  Everyone is largely pre-occupied playing statistical barbie to be concerned with what happens once you finally reach the pinnacle of numbered prowess.  When PvP happens in the game it usually won't be for the simple sake of PvP, but rather what can be obtained from it (Honor) or just as a short break from the tedium of progressing one's character.  You won't realistically see PvP happening of it's own accord until progression is ""done""... i.e. PvP is this game's ""end-game content"".  Unfortunately, you're not going to see that end-game content any time soon because of how XL has designed the grind to BiS gear.  This could be partly due to Trion's late porting of the game, and doing so in larger content chunks, effectively giving us more progression to get done in a shorter amount of time relative to what might have been experienced in Korea.  But even if we were still stuck on pre-Obsidian/Ayanad content we'd still be ages away from the bulk of the community being decked out in fully gemmed Mythic Delph gear.  Then again, one could also argue that if PvP is something you actually want to focus on, why on earth are you playing a heavily progression based game as opposed to something more straightforward like Chivalry or Battlefield?"
archeage,3cnqqc,LaughingGatt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"For me personally i really like character progression and a persistant world. While i LOVE starcraft 2 and even moba games, the fact that u start at 0 every time is what puts me off.  So yea, i guess i would like to way to benefit fro mpvp, wether its money or some more powerful skills or anything really.  Or the ability to fight over a certain thing that again puts ""my group"" ahead of the other. Or at least to be worth fighting over.  Maybe a zone where u can only join once per hour (random spawn points) and i.e. farm in... or i dunno"
archeage,3cnqqc,awkwardvlog,0,Sun Jul 12 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"Well i agree that pvp for the sake of pvp SHOULD be ok enough but even in the first mmos, you could kill people, loot them and get something out of it. , take over some awesome spawn which would give u i.e. more chance to get haunted chests or whatever...I want to leave some impact of pvping. I dont need their delphi gear ofcourse but yea, i dunno, just something more and something more meaningful. You know??  I would definately fight over a spawn that has alot higher chance to get archeum trees i.e."
archeage,3cnqqc,AANeubie,2,Thu Jul 9 11:55:56 2015 UTC,"Sure. I don't disagree with that at all. My view is perhaps a little more idealistic.  Perhaps what this game really lacks is a PvP progression system - look at Dark Age of Camelot's Realm Abilities and Realm Levels, giving another source of progression (which was well balanced to not create another tier of power where those with certain amounts of abilities would always win) and prestige to players. The only equivalent I can think of in AA is the Arena titles and they're just another dull grind mostly."

And yes, together they form a bigger picture, but that wasn't the point.

archeage,3ckexh,WyzeThawt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"i agree with nyym1.  as an archer, attack speed and global cooldowns are great advantages. equiping dual wield to get the 10% attack speed bonus (which also effects your global cooldowns) is much more benificial than the 2hand bonus of increasing Melee/Magic skill damage and heal amount +5% (which dont help archers 1 bit).  DPS archer should go dual wield and tanky archer should go 1h/shield. there is no archer type that you can argue is better to go 2hand except maybe an archer/magic hybrid but even then i would still suggest obsidian katana/dagger.   Maybe when the 2hand bonus gets a buff in 1.8 it might be more viable but right now its archers gain much more from dual wield."

The cost to upgrade it would be anywhere from 9k to 12k, depending on your cluster. Let's say 10k on top of an average price of 7-8k for a divine at T1, and you're looking at around 17-18k. Here's the thing though: The people who have the funds to buy that a) already have a weapon or b) aren't looking for anything less than epic.  As such, if you upgraded it you could probably sell it for a loss at around 11-12k.   But, then again, someone may pull it off at 17-18k."

archeage,3ck9sw,joans34,3,Thu Jul 9 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"Chances of a fully socketed weapon:  p = 1*(1/2)n   where n is the amount of sockets.  So if your weapon has 7 sockets:  p = 1*(1/2)7 = 0.00781 which is like = 0.781%  This the probability of that ONE occurrence where all the 7 gems go in one after the other.  Avg of tries to succeed:   1/p  where p is the probability to succeed.  So,   1/0.00781 = 128 and some change.  Please someone look over this."
archeage,3ck9sw,joans34,2,Wed Jul 8 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"I believe it's more like p = 1*(1/2)6 because the first gem is almost a gimme.    Meaning p = 0.015625 = 1.5%  Average number of tries = 64  The frustration with this straight probability problem is that the Avg number of tries does not tell you how many lunagems you broke.  If you make 64 attempts to get the item fully gemmed, and the first 63 attempts destroy 6 gems a piece, it's a big difference than the first 63 attempts destroying 2 gems a piece.     There was a thread someone did about Ship regrade scroll that included the amount of destroyed scrolls.  It got over my head."

archeage,3co2ty,colcardaki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:06:16 2015 UTC,"Based on this post alone, it sounds like you enjoyed the PvP more than anything else. If that's the case, there's nothing really stopping you from PvPing in the new events or other areas.  For example, the server events are now: Halcyona, Mistmerrow (5 capture points, capture the most points for your faction), Abyssal Attack (Naval PvP, kill Kraken, make packs worth 70g afterwards). On my server, there's a good turnout of people from both sides for all events, so things can get intense. Also, Mistmerrow and Abyssal aren't East vs. West only. Sometimes Pirates show up and cause some chaos too. One more thing about Abyssal, even after the event itself ends, you can PK people and steal their packs. Since each pack is ~70g each, it's a nice boost to daily income.  In addition, with the ship customization changes 1.7 brought, you have more people on the seas which I guess you might consider ""in the wild"". They might not be as massive as tree farm PvP, but it's something that might interest you. You could also camp Freedich during the times the Freedich Gold Trader spawns (~17-25g per pack I think?). Like the other day, 3 friends and I took a couple packs from reds and managed to turn them in walking through about 7-10 of them attacking us (Healers OP, god bless). Felt pretty good being able to take on a larger group even with packs on back. :)  Also, the new Auroria zones (Diamond Shores, Golden Ruins) usually have quite a few people hanging around/farming there, so you could find people there as well to PvP. In my previous guild, there were times when some members went to ""Protect the Turtles"" of Golden Ruins, killing all reds they saw and getting killed themselves.   Back on the mainland, sometimes during CR/GR, we get a ""friendly"" visit from reds which often ends up turning into massive PvP (Or we give up and half the raid leaves because boohoo reds invading rift <.< ). I know some people still hang around Hasla too, but not as much as it used to be.  So if it's PvP that you want, there's plenty to be found if you're on the right server and you put the effort in to look for it. You're giving off the wrong impression though leading off with asking if Rumbling Archeum Trees are gone now."

The thrill of hearing that crackle and seeing atleast half of those people rush in too eagerly just to be wiped out in one mighty blow from the tree, oh man that was the best.

archeage,3co2ty,Better_than_Beckham,3,Thu Jul 9 12:25:52 2015 UTC,There still are massive tree farms. 350 gold per ts is still a lot of money. No one could afford a hauler that required 2000 gold just to get the wagon.
archeage,3co2ty,Adephx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'll have to correct you on that, tree farms are barely viable nowadays, barely. My friend and I planted 500 pines regularly, basically every time we had a spare 5000 labor. The overall chance for a TST with 500 pines is 83%, so is it worth it? If you're lucky yes, one farm yielded us 4 TST, the rest yielded either 2 or 1. The thing is, you spend 100g and 5k labor on planting 500 trees, if you get back 1 TST (remember, you only have 83% for that), you barely cover your expenses, getting two is really and I mean really lucky, so you can't depend on it. In the end, you mostly spend 100g and 200g worth of labor for 1 TST or 40g profit every two days. For comparison I can drive 12 cheese packs per day and gain 216g profit, or rush the story line quest with an alt and sell the gilda dust for 280 profit in less time than it would take me to plant and surveillance the damn farm. Now TST prices are determined by random players, who plant a Rumbling Archeum tree for the ""LULZ"", get a TST with no effort and sell it. If only 500 players on a server cluster plant a Rumbling Archeum tree in a single day, that's 50 TST on the auction house or 200 logs."
archeage,3co2ty,Jerry-Boyle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:59:19 2015 UTC,There are over 3k trees planted on usually three massive tree farms on zeb every weekend. FC also maintains a VERY large one in a hard to reach location. More than likely these are being planted on an alt account. In addition to these farms there are several smaller unprotected farms hidden in every nook and cranny throughout the server. A single tree would cover the cost of the saplings. And another would more than cover the cost of the labor. http://i.imgur.com/YklbKnU.jpg

archeage,3co2ty,axi0matical,3,Fri Jul 10 02:24:39 2015 UTC,"to be honest the Thunderstuck tree market needed to be annihilated at that point. there was so much content coming into the game that needed either the logs or full trees that the demand would have lead to rediculously expensive prices and the richest/luckiest few would have higher tier carts, siege weapons, higher tier gliders, cars, skateboards, etc. TS tree prices dropping was a good thing making these items acually viable to make and have for a larger base of people.  to be honest, it just sounds like you either bought a tree/log before the price shot down or you were sitting on some waiting to make a killing on AH and your plans got shattered. other than that, the tree prices dropping shouldnt be a reason to make you leave, it should have been a reason for you to make your cart into a wagon..."

I don't think anyone would have cared if they had just increased the drop rate of thunderstruck tree's, but putting the rumblings in the cash box was an absolute slap in the face to anyone who play's Archeage."
archeage,3co2ty,joans34,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"not really...  you didnt have to grow one yourself and the AH was flooded with the sapplings, TS logs and Ts Trees. you never had to spend any real life cash and it cut the price of TS trees from over 1k gold to like 300 and the TS logs went from 350 to 75 gold overnight. if i remember correctly at that time the sapplings sold for like 15-30g anyway, they quickly shot up when the RNG boxes were removed.  How did that hurt you? Did it not help you? The only people it hurt were ones still sitting on trees that they hoped to sell for 4 to 5 times more then they became worth."

archeage,3co2ty,ThorBeerson,6,Thu Jul 9 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"You got your answer, it wasn't the one you were waiting for, but unfortunately what vitiate said is true. No one really cares anymore.  You can have your illegal farms and no one else shows up. TS tree prices are between 400-500g each. Rumbling trees are still there, but you need to either pay 35 loyalty or +100g per sapling and the possibility of it being TS is the same, 10%.  If those trees are crushing your dreams of being the TS tree master, then it's easier to do what vitiate says, unfortunately."

archeage,3cle4q,NoxMerely,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Hasla is a waste of time if you can make even a small amount of gold a day. The time you waste on a hasla weapon you could spend getting gold for an obsidian. Personally i would recommend going straight for obsidian gear. You can more or less ignore accessories except for your dream ring when you are able to do that questline. As for weapons, they should always be your priority. I would recommend a septer/shield or katana/shield combination. Also make sure to regrade all of your T1 obsidian to unique (celestial if you can afford it) before you upgrade them to T3. Also dont do any enchanting or gemming until they are at T3 as these will be lost in the upgrade process. Hope that helped some and none of the information is too wrong.    Edit: Some early priorities that i didnt mention would be to get a hauler and a clipper, as well as a 16x16 for upkeep. I focused on gearing and had to later spend time getting these things and am regretting it later."
archeage,3cle4q,eliumdun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:23:53 2015 UTC,"If you just go for the rifts its not rly time consuming. I had 2 night rifts (like 4am real time) with 1 random each time and managed to finish my weapons just from them ...  Especially if u got a class where u need more than 1 weapon (or stat sticks) hasla is perfect for it ... Shield, lute etc. Always worth, if u get lucky rifts :)  I neither like to spend for your stuff early. why clipper if u got an activr guild? They gonna drive you in the first time.  Why hauler? A lot of other profs are available. Let him do the rifts for the 3 Day farm thingy from merrit badgrs then he can decide if he wanna run tradepacks. with the same money he can get a good celestial obsidian weap,  So grinding coinpurses gets easy, also questing and stuff so he can get to 55 faster.  Also watch about your gear etc. to go if possible for tradeable gear like magni / eph / celestial. Since you are new u probably wanna try different classes so you can sell your equip if you reroll classes. :)"
archeage,3cle4q,stevememories,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"Some people like hasla weapons for people that dont have patron or much gold because it is free. It makes sense to me then, but if you can farm gold then just get crafted gear.   You dont really need a hauler, i was just saying that i personally regretted not getting one early on. Now that i have one its super easy to make money. I do think that a clipper is needed though. You cant always call on your guild to be your taxi all over the place, almost everyone has one. You dont need to drop a bunch of gold regrading the sails and getting shiny stuff, the basic one will do.   The normal crafted gear is a good decision because its tradeable. Serpentis gear is also a good option if your guild is able to do runs of it. I like obsidian personally because i hate crafting with a passion, so i just spend the gold on salvaged stuff and can farm mobs for obsidian mats while farming for purses at the same time."
archeage,3cle4q,eliumdun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"disagree. hasla is dead for a reason...  ill use staffs for my example. a T3 Hasla staff,  [Brilliant Staff of Conviction] is EXACTLY the same stats as a [Epherium Meadow Staff] at the same regrade level. A T1 [Obsidian Staff] at same regrade level is barely below these damage and magic attack stats but add in magic dmg penetration. at T2 they close the gap more but are still just barely below the damage and magic attack stats but i do feel that the penetration makes it feel better. at T3 you are better than epherium.  yes the halsa weapons are free besides the time you spend on them but they limit themselves the maxing at epherium level stats and will never get better. if you have an obsidian, it has potential to grow as you earn more money and farm the mats.  in the end, if you are planning on having an obsidian weapon anyway, then skip hasla, its a waste of time to spend it there if you are going to replace it shortly anyway. if you want a delph crafted weapon and need a something to hold you over then T3 hasla is an ok option."

So say you are facing a shadowblade/DR with the exact same gear as you except they are 55, the honor gems you have would not be in effect for him, meaning that he can hit you harder but your damage will be reduced when applied to him.   tl;dr: your focus gems do not work on lvl53+ enemies, but his focus gems will work on you."

archeage,3cknlo,Myrmiron,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"Suggestions.   Base the gold exchange off of the price of Apex.  Apex cost more in EU, so it's not fair for the EU player to give you 400 gold on NA (which would buy an apex) and only receive 400 gold in EU (which won't buy an apex)  You don't really need a middle man, do the exchange in small numbers until you build up enough trust.  Go first and give him 10 gold in EU.  Then go to NA and get 10 gold, and do that a bunch of times.  After a couple weeks, it's not a big deal to mail him 400 gold in EU, and know that he will mail you in NA.   Hope that helps.   Also I'll piggy back and say I'm looking for an EU player in Kyprosa who has an alt on Tahyang.

I have a group of people that earn gold on both my NA server and their EU server and vice versa we have a system where we do 1to1 gold exchange. yeah yeah its not fair whatever you wanna say. but if i buy an apex and sell the credits EU->NA ill lose about 250g. whereas if they transfer an apex they lose about 175-200g. they actual gold lose ratio isnt that bad. its not like im getting an ass ton more out of it then they are. i mean i am in the long run. i myself generate about on average 350g per day. now thats because i have 5 accounts that i make money on. i have 1 person who is similar where he has about 5/6 accounts and makes about 50g less than me per day. we do weekly transfers. and i get about 2k gold and he gets 2k gold. i def get the better deal but in the whole scheme of things we are both winning by getting ALL the gold we make on the alternate server on our main servers.

archeage,3cjz69,campoanywhere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"Get a divine obsidian katana or shortspear. It will eventually out dps a celestial delph at around t4, and will let you play a lot of other classes based on the one you pick."
archeage,3cjz69,Lauralis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:07:56 2015 UTC,I would 2nd the short spear. Especially since a well geared paladin is nigh unkillable if you learn how to play it correctly
archeage,3cjz69,DaFriskyGinga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:15:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know it would eventually out-dps the delphi.  Wow."
archeage,3cjz69,Lelouch133,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:16:35 2015 UTC,It has same stats with a celestial delphi at tier4. So yeah eventually divine obsidian out-dps delphinad weapons.
archeage,3cjz69,Lelouch133,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I wonder if the Strength that comes with the delphi makes up for the lack of base dps?"
archeage,3cjz69,Lauralis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:57:35 2015 UTC,I don't think it would. If you have no plans for playing a healer/paladin just go for hungering blade. STR and +% melee critical damage.
archeage,3cjz69,spliffiam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly the v2 sword is best for straight melee who won't ever want to play anything hybridish. Katana is best for those who may want to move into shadowblade/hexblade or even full mage, and shortspear is for those who want to get into things like paladin, full healer classes or even archer if you go the v2 route. To me obsidian is all about giving me more options to fill more roles."
archeage,3cjz69,a4moondoggy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:44:13 2015 UTC,What makes a obs weapon t1 or t3? and im playing a trickster should i also get a katana? is it 2h katana or the 1 hand?
archeage,3cjz69,Sociopathix,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:03:05 2015 UTC,delphs have 30-50+ more dps usually than their obsidian t4 counterpart.
archeage,3cjz69,Lauralis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"Second this. At celestial, my obsidian T4 1H sword at max temper is about 40~ dps less than its Delphinad counterpart."
archeage,3cjz69,Nambrose87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:59:18 2015 UTC,Except that's at celestial. I'm telling him to get a divine since good obsidians are divine + which at t4 is about on par with a celestial delph.

archeage,3cjz69,a4moondoggy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:55:59 2015 UTC,Buy an eph weapon so you can salavage it and then make an obsidian weapon
archeage,3cjz69,Faddler,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:23:14 2015 UTC,I would recommend the delph because they are tradeable and usually more dps for the gold.  for instance i got a divine delph longspear with 600 dps for 11k.  an obsidian 2hand divine t5 would cost about 20k for similar dps.  the passives don't warrant the huge jump in cost for me.
archeage,3cjz69,Kerrigar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:25:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely work on a divine obisidian weapon. Regrade up to unique, resplendant it. If it goes celestial, sell it for a minor loss or equal, retry. Depending on your luck, this could take quite a bit. Having a divine obsidian weapon places it one tier above it's celestial counterpart. A celestial t5 obsidian weapon would be equal to a t4 divine obsidian weapon. As for what kind, shortspear for the puncture, katana for the crit or sword for the parry. It's all up to you. Delphinad weapons are nice because they are always going to be tradeable, but generally a good delphinad weapon is VERY expensive. Flame or desert swords are most likely 9k+ when a divine obsidian sword is cheaper to make.  As for what to do with extra money left over, definitely work on getting your armor up to T4 for get more strength AND more stamina with less agility. After that, work on the three off pieces you currently don't have. For abolisher, I know people love running earth or desert. The goal after that would definitely be gemming your armor once you hit a place you'll stay at for awhile. T2 gems at least, get some more magic defense, toughness, resillence for sure."

archeage,3cjvr4,hanabudda,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:14:43 2015 UTC,"I would be upgrading my T3 > T4, pop a new superior-temper on it. Divine is A+.  With the rest of the funds, grab a pair of Auroria Mystic Sleeves & Sash to take care of those main slots.  After that, I'd look into crafting up your obsidian to push to T4.  Jewelry? Bah, conqueror's earth rings unless you really want to treat yourself to something nice - I also suggest you look into Serpentis, to grab the dream ring quest-starter off the last boss. That'll take care of 20% of your jewelry worries there.  Oh, and my suggestion would be to try out Cabalist - Sorcery/Defense/Witchcraft.  That is what I'd do in your shoes."
archeage,3cjvr4,Schillwing,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:30:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, crafting is risky so that's up to you (you could double easily with some good RNG). I personally would upgrade that katana to T4 and try to regrade that shield to divine. Whatever money you have left try to upgrade a piece of 2 of your t3 cloth. I'd go for serp cloth if you can to build a set for the OP bracers coming somewhat soon. As for what class...I'd say enigmatist, daggerspell, or thaumaturge."
archeage,3cjvr4,Guccicakes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"I recently put my 10k to use:  I bought a divine t4 Katana, I'm very happy with it and it cost me around 9.2k so I spent the rest of the money on crafting since my RNG is somewhat decent, managed to proc a celestial mag gale earing which sold for 2.8k and then today, with some of those profits I crafted an epherium stone hood all the way from an artistan ocean hood. So in relation to your post I did a combination of things which set me up for making more gold.  Prior to doing all that I had thought about upgrading my armor but to be honest now that I have my katana I'd far prefer to get a completed fully gemmed serp cloth set and spend the gold i make on weaponry. If I were of your position I would only have 3 piece obsidian cloth and a 4 piece epherium or delph cloth set for the set bonus. but once you have epherium grade armor gemming it out is what actually makes it strong. Focus on a t4 katana and maybe go for a t3 shield, you will want to keep some gold to make more gold. Try your luck at crafting some of your desired accessories or armor, I've found that I generally make money or come out even if I dont get the type of armor I wanted."
archeage,3cjvr4,Swiffles33,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:40:39 2015 UTC,It seems best from all the comments to upgrade my weapons then use leftover money for armor. Katanas are like 4.5k on my cluster. Would you think I could try out my luck and craft Katanas?

archeage,3cjvr4,WyzeThawt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"i would always recommend using money in a way to get a return on it, but if i were to spend it all on gearing then this is how i would go about it in order of priority:   salvaged epherium katana for T4 Upgrade ~3.5k regrade shield with repleasent and adequate regrade charm to at least celestial, hopefully divine. if faill build back up to unique and try again or just go to celestial and call it a day ~1k per repleasent w/ regrade try upgrade shield to T3  ~ 500-600g for salvaged piece build/regrade/upgrade any armor other armor needed to celestial then T3, if obsidian   ~ Price too subjective to luck grab auroria sleeves and waist that have benifits to you main class trees and regrade to celestial. trust me, these at celestial are a better option considering $value over epherium or delph piece stats  ~ 50-300g per piece depending on what exact piece and variation + regrading costs buy conquerers or illustrious jewery. this level is only a small fraction off of their higher tier counterparts but for much less money. research it for yourself. also most regrade sucesses only net a flat .1% to .2% increase per regrade level so dont focus too much on regrading them really high. this money can be spent better elsewhere.   the only other spending option i would suggest is if you are in a glass cannon build (i.e darkrunner, primeval, spellsinger [tho primes and spellsingers do need armor stats as well for that exra dmg/crit boosts] ), you could put all of it into your weapon to reach T5 and hopefully kill/kite your opponents before they can even touch you. obviously if you are a tank then armor is much more of a priority than a higher tier dps weapon."

archeage,3cjvr4,Neoxide,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"personally, I like to flip items in AH. find suckers who forgot to change the bid price, i watch high demand items at least every hour to see if they shoot up or down (you can find the percentage out yourself but once you have that figure, you can muliply the price and sometime people try to undercut all the others by so much you can buy it and relist it for a profit), sometimes late night you can find bids for like half the price of the item and it will end in like 3 hours, etc.  Also, if you are good at economics and uses upcoming patch note changes to predict shifts in supply and demand you can make a killing literally overnight. but it is risky and can backfire.  if you are feeiling lucky, you could craft and regrade obsidian weapons to celestial or above then finish building to T3 and sell. i made good money off this for 3 weapons then the 4th ate all my profit to turn that one celestial. can go both ways.  like real life, if you have money its so much easier to get more. just keep your eyes open for any oppertunities."

archeage,3cjvr4,Starslinger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"I would get the katana to tier 4, get the shield to t3 and you'll have about 6k left to spend on armor. As for armor, you say you're going to play hexblade in your flair but cloth isn't what you're going to want to use for hexblade. With this gear, I would play a class like skullknight, cabalist, daggerspell, spellsinger or enigimatist. To be honest, sash and sleeves are not going to be a huge stat increase so what I would do is get serpentis sleeves and sash. Use some funds to get all of that to celestial and start spending money on getting your armor to t4 to drop the spirit. That's how I would end my spending.  Oh, with accessories. The only good accessory really for mages would be the wave necklace but it's not that big of a deal and I know tons of people that prefer halcyona necklaces over it for world PvP."

It seems to be the same people who did the private Blade and Soul server, but for that i heard they set up a modified beta version and thats why that server is so behind in the end game content. not sure how they will do with AA but I signed up and im keeping my eyes on it.

I do not agree with the assessment of the floating ship situation, as its original report was dripping in the histrionic ravings of poor sportsmen who were bested by creative game play. The group who engaged in that behavior knows precisely how to beat it, and offered to demonstrate such methods to GMs, with no response.   Therefore any claim that the use of a harpoon to raise a ship out of the water by harpooning itself or air leads to an unbeatable advantage, and is thus an exploit, is completely unfounded. You had an excellent opportunity to work with the community to understand a situation that had just begun to be an issue as you came on board, and make an informed response accordingly.

Today we’d like to discuss exploits with you all. We know this is a hot topic in the community, and it has led to continual questions on what is and what is not allowed in the world of ArcheAge.  First of all, we want to stress to you all that ArcheAge is very much a game of experimentation and strategy. We love seeing how all of you utilize our in-game tools as you adventure throughout the lands. We very much want to preserve that type of exploration, as we believe its core to ArcheAge’s philosophy.  What we do want to combat, however, are situations where a player can gain an unbeatable advantage against another player. This leads us to how the team defines what an exploit is:  Exploit (verb, /ikˈsploit/) – A behavior or situation that is unintended by the game’s design and leads to a clearly unbeatable advantage.  The important word here is unbeatable. While some unintended situations may give you a benefit that is strong, many of them still can be beaten by a team of coordinated adventurers, or can be countered by a different strategy. (But be aware that said unintended behavior can be patched out by Trion and XL in the future!)  Below are some common situations that you, as a community, have had questions on. Please consider this guide to be our final answer on these situations, and make sure to share it with your fellow community and guild members. As new questions appear, we will update this guide on a case-by-case basis. The AoE Damage Maneuver on Hasla Rift – This strategy is allowed. Damage Immunity on the Hounds of Kyrios – This strategy is allowed. Attack LoS/Range Problems on Morpheus & Hanure – This strategy is allowed, but this may change at a code level in the future. Issues with multi-boss fights on Serpentis & Hounds – These strategies are allowed. Animation cancelling – These strategies are allowed. In PvP, you can still be burned down by multiple enemies/trapped/make a mistake. Additionally, the implementation of the skill queue will likely prevent animation cancelling from occurring in the future.  If you have further questions on any of this, or would like to suggest something be added to the list, please post below. Until then, travel safe and fight well!  Sincerely, The ArcheAge Team"

archeage,3cgt4u,Negative_Mojo,3,Tue Jul 7 20:22:31 2015 UTC,how does animation canceling work
archeage,3cgt4u,ristorilsm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"After every time you press a skill you have to wait 1 second to cast another skill. That wait is called ""global cooldown"".  Certain skills dont cause global cooldown. Other ""exploitable"" skills can be casted DURING global cooldown.   To animation cancel you press a skill which can be casted DURING global cooldown thus ""canceling the animation"" of the skill which otherwise should have given you a global cooldown.   The most notable examples of this are pressing instant cast skills between godswhip strikes and canceling the animation of triplestrike by pressing frenzy."
archeage,3cgt4u,Negative_Mojo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:48:16 2015 UTC,i feel like i can cast gods whip alone without any global cooldown?
archeage,3cgt4u,ristorilsm,2,Wed Jul 8 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"gods whip can be casted during a global cooldown. So, you can cast 1st gods whip, then chainlightning, then instantly 2nd godswhip, etc etc  Now usually you'd have to wait 1 second after casting chainlightning before you could cast your next spell, but since godswhip can be casted DURING global cooldown, you can do it immediately.   Also note I;m pretty sure its the subsequent strikes that can be casted during a global cooldown. I dont think the first strike can be casted during global.   Also note faster attack speed will lower your global cooldown. That's why you see so many people use thwart. If you reduce your global cooldown by 50% you can use 2 abilities every time your opponent uses 1."
archeage,3cgt4u,Negative_Mojo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"okay cook thanks for this, and my gf plays a paladin, so she would do the first triple strike , frenzy, then the other triple strike casts?"
archeage,3cgt4u,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:54:52 2015 UTC,yep. Usually when you press triple strike you have to wait a long time for the animation to finish. If you press frenzy the animation is canceled (but it continues to do damage normally) and you can press another skill immediately. It can be any skill you want.

archeage,3cgt4u,WhySoKyrios,2,Wed Jul 8 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"Quick question whats the standing on the kraken glitch with harpoons? considering it really isnt doing anything different than morpheus/hanure LOS'ing.   Also how do you come up with whats a bannable ""exploit"". it just seems that things are picked to be bannable and not bannable based on 2 criteria. 1 do people care? and 2 how badly does it hurt the game. At this point in time no one cares if you glitch GHA bosses. no one cared before because it was an easy way to get decent gear in the day.  But if you glitch kraken or anthalon using in game mechanics, no different than dungeons in reality, thats considered a bannable exploit. now i can see why because it drastically effects the game. especially kraken because it drops end game gear. but do we only care about this because they drop delph quality stuff? if kraken only dropped illustrious or mag gear and little to no gold would it still be considered a bannable exploit?  edit: i cant spell"
archeage,3cgt4u,Jet_AA,2,Tue Jul 7 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean the floating ship exploit. We feel that one is bannable, as it is a very large step away from the base mechanics of the world, and it prevents a set of players from receiving damage from all sources, even other players. That's why it's bannable -- it removes all repercussions, including PvP repercussions."
archeage,3cgt4u,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"Minor clarification: The floating ship exploit is relatively new, and does seem to be more dangerous as it makes you basically immune even to other players. Comments on this are definitely helpful. However: I believe the thing with the kraken/harpoons has to do with harpooning yourself to the seafloor and winching your ship underwater to avoid the kraken's surface-level attacks.  EDIT: Dunno what specific bug they're talking about with Anthalon. All I've seen is the siege tower strat which was already approved."

archeage,3cgt4u,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:35:54 2015 UTC,Lifting a galleon with a harpoon does not make you immune to other players in any way. You can be hit and you will fall down if it is done correctly.
archeage,3cgt4u,ClusterFSCK,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"The floating ship technique is disrupted a number of different ways. It requires constant maintenance by a person on a harpoon, and specific ship configurations that involve breakable parts. If you can disrupt the person on the harpoon, or deal damage to the specific parts, the ship will come down.   For those who argue that a sufficiently high ship is untargetable by people on the sea, they do not understand the maneuverability of an affected ship is virtually nonexistent. If an enemy identifies a floating ship, another ship similarly equipped can elevate itself into the air nearby. Anyone with a appropriate flier (i.e. pegasus or kraken glider to ignore turbulence) can maneuver between the ships to disrupt the harpooner, and cannoneers on the other ship can fire on the rival ship to either destroy the harpoon, or destroy other components that are easy for the harpooner to target to enable the ship to float.  Keep in mind the incident that spurred this discussion occurred when a group on Lucius that developed this strategy had tried and failed multiple times to use the strategy on the Kraken. The Kraken's AOEs, and failures by the group to keep the ship in the air had repeatedly resulted in ship destruction, even when the ship was at times 130m in the air, and outside of cannon range to the Kraken.   This strategy became an issue when one of these attempts was contested by Lucius' resident bully guild. The bully guild in fact was stopping the Kraken kill by dragging it away from the static floating ship with their PVE tanks and spawned clippers. They engaged and killed members of the floating ship's guild on the water throughout the fight, but not before the floating ship guild was able to get the PVE tanks and clippers killed, robbing the Kraken of targets, and allowing the floating ship to finally finish it off.  Far from establishing a clear definition of ""exploit"", Celestrata's post and the double think inherent in saying the floating ship strategy is an exploit, indicates that Trion's corporate culture has decided on the following definition, rather than the one published on on their forum:  exploit [n]: any circumstance where Trion has lost the ability to positively spin player game play situations into Trion's favor, and must resort to scape goating the players to shift blame away from its own mistakes."
archeage,3cgt4u,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"Hello! I openly admit to only having a cursory knowledge of the floating-ship thing. But something you said bothers me:   ""For those who argue that a sufficiently high ship is untargetable by people on the sea, they do not understand the maneuverability of an affected ship is virtually nonexistent. If an enemy identifies a floating ship, another ship similarly equipped can elevate itself into the air nearby.""   Isn't that basically saying ""the only way to hit a floating ship is to also use a floating ship""?"
archeage,3cgt4u,ClusterFSCK,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"The only way to beat a person with Ayanad, fully potted, is to do the same. The only way to beat a person running Argent with a five Triple Slash + Fervant Heal animation cancel combo is to animation cancel yourself, or use a melee negating strategy like Move speed buffed kiting or Auramancy teleport spam. Unfair gameplay unless you mirror a config, attain a level of gear, or resort to hard counter strategies is inherent to the game.   Thus the judgement that a floating ship is beyond the pale because it is ""unbeatable"" continues to be demonstrated as load of PR posturing by Trion."
archeage,3cgt4u,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:08:41 2015 UTC,"But I mean, by that logic shouldn't going underground and attacking with impunity be allowed 'cause anybody can go underground? How is that any sort of rationale? Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is no gear that helps against this, is there? There is no ""hard counter."" Seems like you either do it too, or you learn to live with the ol' Steel Rain whenever anyone wants to be a dick.  There's gotta be a point where GMs get to say ""alright yes, this is physically possible until we find a way to fix it, but until then don't do it or you're outskies."" The question just seems to be whether or not this particular annoying thing is egregious enough to deserve that call.  EDIT: On a side note, 'cause i know slightly more about it: wouldn't casting any cc/mobility move during the ""fervent+slash"" combo break it and start the cooldown on fervent? Or is the issue that it's only ever used while an opponent is tripped/cc'd somehow, so it's just free crazy dmg?"
archeage,3cgt4u,GGATHELMIL,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"The hard counter is to not let the ship go up in the sky in the first place. As I mentioned before, the ship isn't very mobile up there. It can move maybe a meter or two to a side; it is mostly an elevator. If you see a world boss up, simply camp it to contest and hit a harpooner trying to raise a ship before its even an issue.   As to your concern of 'living with the steel rain', the process of elevating a ship isn't even that fast. It took 10 minutes to set this up with the most skilled harpoonest that could be found. Furthermore, in many locations where you'd want to hang the ship to harass other players, say over a port in Two Crowns or Austera, you have to keep the ship low enough to fire the cannons at people. This is considerably lower than the glider range from towers or other buildings nearby, which again, makes it trivial to fly over and disrupt the harpooner.  The simple fact is Trion is a bunch of cowards who can't think their way out of a paperbag. They've been hounded thoroughly by every player imaginable due to the incomplete designs of XL and their shit management of the Marketplace and game stability. One group of six people howling at the moon was enough to spook them into yet another bad decision, and for me its the last bad decision I'll ever deal with from them."
archeage,3cgt4u,Negative_Mojo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"Haha I get that you're done with Trion, man. You don't have to keep restating it at the end of every comment :p  One last question: you sound like you were there, or at least know the guys who did it. Did anyone (friend or foe) try sailing a harpoon clipper into a nearby waterspout, and harpooning the floating ship that way? Or do the waterspouts not get you high enough?  Because if that works that sounds like a super fast (though potentially difficult) counterplay that's built right in."
archeage,3cgt4u,Meloetta,0,Fri Jul 10 09:54:01 2015 UTC,so if it didnt remove all repercussions then it wouldnt be bannable? i can see making something completely safe a reason to ban it. thanks for the clarification.  also do we know if there are any plans on fixing the guard issues in ports? i know this isnt your area of expertise but its ridiculous that someone can aggro the guards then stealth all 4-10 guards onto a barrel. a ship is one thing because you can drag it and whatnot or get on the wheel. but the barrel is the huge issue imo. you cant get into it. you can drag it with a clipper but because guards on the barrel you cant even get help to harpoon the barrel out.

archeage,3cgt4u,WyzeThawt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"just dont do it.  i saw what scapes wrote about this and what i get from it is that it not being abused enough for them to worry about it when they have so many other issues to focus on first.  it honestly seems like they dont really want you to do it but they really dont have the time to enforce it properly.  honor isnt that hard to obtain tho. doing the dailies will make you a free 1000 honor for like 30 mins of you time. halcyona is great if you have a distance AOE skill. a single well placed meteor can get me 100-200 honor. im sure the archery distance AOE move can probably do the same. also mistmerrow isnt bad for honor if you learn to stay with a group and not die often. last, anywhere in wartime is a good place to go with a party and clean up any reds you find."

Then at 53 I stopped Experia and spent 3 hours in the library every day and got 55 in about 3 weeks from when I started.  It was rough.  But apparently it's easier now."
archeage,3cj8xz,DragoonDM,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:14:08 2015 UTC,"The first time through can be a bit rough because the xp from dailies is gated on lvl requirements (so retarded).  If you only do dailies with a raid that forms at reset (assuming that still happens), It might be awhile before you see the levels come in, but it also won't require a huge time investment in one sitting.  As for other activities, any labor use is still going to help, but the real xp maker is wartime pvp assuming you can land killing blows or play healing song for the passive assists.  Once you hit 51, the library daily xp income essentially doubles and you get access to the bosses that most raids do for massive xp.  At 53 the dailies for third floor open up  increasing your daily gains again, and at 54 you get the ayanad dailies for another bump.  At that point the raid running dailies on all floors will take between 1-2 hours depending on how many well geared players are running that day and will give you a significant chunk of xp every day.  My first time to 55 took me about 3 weeks, and subsequently raising all my other trees took me roughly another 5 weeks time.  I did solo grind on 2nd floor a fair amount at the beginning, and a little later I did a little bit of AoE grinding with a small group on 3rd floor.... maybe 20 combined hours of it, but most of my xp was just through running the dailies every single day."
archeage,3cj8xz,javieloh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"Library is the quickest way. Time depends on how much you like grinding, what class you are, and how good your gear is.  If you're well geared enough to solo-grind fairly quickly (and willing to burn consumables to speed it up), you can hit 55 in a couple days. Make sure you always have XP buffs running (10% potion + 20% potion + 10% Halcyona buff if you can get it)."

I haven't seen an Ayanad scepter design in a while on my cluster(aranzeb) so that will prob take a little to actually obtain and even then it should cost you a nice amount of gold too.

archeage,3cfx8p,DrROWEbotnic,3,Tue Jul 7 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"Here is what I run as an Enigmatist: http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/323772 (You can change out the 8th & 9th passive in Sorcery depending on your personal preference).  I understand that Wings is required for a Guild vs Guild scenario but that is the only time you should be picking up Wings. Enigmatist, in 1v1 situations, is all about massive Magic instacast burst damage. I call it ""the Darkrunner of Mages"".   I would swap out Arc Lightning, or even Mana Flurry, for Frigid Tracks. It's one of the BEST skills in any Mage's arsenal, meaning you are losing out on a lot of damage. This one skills gives you time to cast 3 Freezing Arrows instantly, meaning (depending on your Magic Attack) 3l-5k damage per hit. That is HUGE.  Depending on how much HP you have, you could swap out Liberation for Health Lift, since in most fights, DRs will only be shackling you one but that only prevents Shadowplay abilities, which isn't a huge deal. Against Daggerspells/cabalists/Showknights, they have 1 combo that will Shackle into Silence, but you should always kite them and with the multiple teleport, this shouldn't be an issue. If you find that they do happen to catch you in the Shackle>Silence combo a lot, then I would say sure, take out Magic Condenser in Aur. for Liberation.  Also, the 1st and 3rd passives in Aur. aren't really that great for instacast mages, since 7% damage to Health isn't a lot when you can get 2 shot by geared DRs, and -100 damage could be useful at times (against archers) but not many other classes.  And finally, the WORST part of your build is that you don't use Thwart+Hearten (which lets you stack 3 stacks of Inspire) + then using Vicious Implosion. Thwart will increase the damage of Vicious Implosion TREMENDOUSLY. For example, I will get almost 2,000-2,500 extra damage from Vicious Implosion on top of the base damage. Meaning if you do 3k Damage without any stacks of Inspire, you will do 5k-5.5k damage with 2 or 3 stacks. That is the most detrimental portion of your build. Also, Thwart increases your general cooldowns meaning faster God's Whips, faster drop back into fireballs, faster freezing earth, chain lightning, & Vicious Implosion (which does consume all stacks of Inspire so try and keep that for the end unless absolutely needed).  If you only end up taking 1 or 2 pieces of advice from all of this, take the Frigid Tracks and Thwart+Hearten. That will drastically increase your damage, and in turn, making the class much more fun to play. :D"

archeage,3cfx8p,vannatten,2,Tue Jul 7 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"In both 1v1 and Group PvP, a shield is always the best option. Increased Phy + Mag Defense just from the passive, and whatever Defense it gives, plus stats like Int or Stamina.   For 1v1s against say another mage class (Daggerspell, Enigmatist, Cabalist, etc.) going duel wield will boost your general attack speed and that's amazing considering you don't have to worry about a big ass Nodachi slicing you in half, lol.  But most situations, main weapon + Shield is the best. The v2 Obsidian Dagger at Tier 4 is the best offhand for dual wielding mages since it gives straight Magic Attack. See here: Sleeper's Point  That dagger is more of an end-game, later goal for most since it's pretty expensive for the minor Mag attack it will give, but it is definitely a boost. In the meantime, you could use either a Faust's Destiny which is a dagger with stam and Int., or (what I personally use) a Airain Rock Dissention which is the top offhand weapon for mages, since it gives the most Intelligence so more Mag Attack. Just the only thing with that one is that an Axe's proc is a 14 Second bleed, so watch that you don't overwhelm into a Leech if they are bleeding, since it will break the sleep."

archeage,3cgab1,BrotherFisties,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Nodachi has the same hidden passive as a katana. Just how a Greatsword has the same passive as a regular sword. So also with the added agility, you crit a lot more than a greatsword so i like it better."

archeage,3cgab1,AlycEzi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:27:58 2015 UTC,I play a 2h platerunner. If youre going for only PvE darkrunner really isnt a good choice. I can tank around 4 turtles/jabberwockes with celestial t2/3 plate. But when I used to run Leather I couldnt take more than 1. If youre really just interested in  PvE try out a Blighter. Excelent for PvE fsrming (though make sure you bring okenty of soup)
archeage,3cgab1,ayumuuu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:40:01 2015 UTC,I'm not interested in pve only tho. I think I can do ok 1v1 pve with consumables. 1 at a time shouldn't be that bad because darkrunner has burst and that means I will switch fast to the next target.
archeage,3cgab1,MistukoSan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:10 2015 UTC,Burst requires all of your cooldowns so thats a good 30 seconds each
archeage,3cgab1,ThorBeerson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"Darkrunners can go two routes: 2H bigass weapon route or DW route.  The 2 most popular choices for offhand for a DR are Cold Anguish and the Dancing Queen from Serpentis.  Mainhand it's either going to be Sword, Shortspear, or Katana.  The Obby Shortspear does nothing unless you'd like to run paladin as an offspec or something.  The Sword is probably your best bet because of Deflect and Retaliate.  It also has a slower attack speed than the Katana, but it deals more burst damage with one skill.  For 2H you probably want a Nodachi.  But I would highly suggest going DW because your attacks will be so slow without it.  A DW darkrunner will beat a 2H almost every time because of how slow their attack speeds are.  DW overwhelm will hit before 2H overwhelm with equal ping.  AS for farming, the only real thing I use different is meditate."
archeage,3cgab1,ThorBeerson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"I've shared a lot of information on this sub-forum about DR.  I've been playing DR/SB since alpha.   Here's some things you need to get: Obsidian(or Delph) katana > shortspear > sword - it's in order of my personal preference.  Searing Oath > Cold Anguish. (SO provides more raw strength and survivability, now you won't be a one combo pony)   You need to know how to weave in and out of fights with ease, or else you will fail miserably.

archeage,3chdt5,Grarvindur,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:40:41 2015 UTC,i play both of these classes actually. it all depends on what you want. thurmaturge i feel is a better aoe class for both PVP and PVE. you have a lot of mobilty with auramancy. swiftstone is a much better class for 1v1 or small skirmish battles. i tend to main swiftstone and use thurmaturge strictly for pve farming my coinpurses
archeage,3chdt5,GGATHELMIL,0,Tue Jul 7 22:54:24 2015 UTC,I don't play either of these classes but...  Thaumaturge because Auramancy is bestest around. And my theory build: http://arche-base.com/builds/view/47214-Thaumaturge_theory_only_not_played#7.3.4/0G6ZtBxlxCG1
archeage,3chdt5,veritascs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"No freezing arrow and no liberation? Big no no. I play Thaumaturge and this is what I run in pvp right now http://arche-base.com/builds/generator#7.4.3/JGGZCs31ZBxl  I dont like to use leech because i feel like It's not to reliable. Every person and their mother is running pvp cloak anyways so it feels like a wasted skillpoint. I want to be as tanky as possible so i take the first passive in auramancy, its basically 7% dmg reduction which is nothing to scoff at. Boastful roar is really great because it gives you more damage plus it debuffs the target. Thaumaturge doesnt feel like a meteor strike kind of class either. I'm not really a veteran thaumaturge so I'm not sure my build is optimal but i feel like im doing good in pvp with it. Only thing im having real trouble with is cheeserunners. But i have no toughness or resilience yet so hopefully it will get a little better :P"

The game is kinda boring w/o friends in my experience, but I was able to level up just fine by myself.  Just don't expect to be rich or anything, I guess."
archeage,3ch5th,Serault,3,Tue Jul 7 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"I like this game a lot, but i would not recommend it for a pure solo player.  If you like grinding and questing by yourself, but are are fine with grouping up for dungeons, events, trade runs, etc, then hell yes jump right in. But you're gonna hit a hell of a progression wall if you try to solo this game 100%.  EDIT: I should note that this applies mainly to a non-patron solo player. If you drop a bunch of cash for land and items, you could potentially have a blast running around solo, playing on hard-mode and fightin' god damn everybody. It's GETTING to that level as a solo player that is difficult."
archeage,3ch5th,WhySoKyrios,2,Tue Jul 7 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on what it is you want to do in game. If you are looking for end game gear to be able to compete in pvp, then yes, you are going to need a couple friends or guild to help. If you are happy planting a farm, crafting and doing safe pack runs, you can solo to your heart's content."
archeage,3ch5th,itsamandatoryfield,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"No  EDIT: To clarify my answer; you will be able to level up to 50 no problem playing solo, it will be a couple of weeks or so depending on how long you can spend in game each day. I would struggle to say you'll have fun doing it by yourself.  ArcheAge is a very group/guild centric MMORPG and besides, everything is more fun with friends. If you want to accomplish alot of end-game stuff you are going to need to play with others, its as simple as that."
archeage,3ch5th,wonkysplitdemon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"yes and no, you will hit a wall at lvl50 because from 50 to 55 you need more exp than 1 to 50, but you can have your own land (if you are going to pay for a patron status) and do whatever you want alone. Parties and raids are endgame bosses, but they just drop materials you don't really need if you craft your own gear."
archeage,3ch5th,DarkManiak,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:47:05 2015 UTC,"no. while it is possible to achieve a lot solo, the game was meant to be played with a guild to achieve most end game things.  its not a themepark mmo when you can do everything and craft it all by yourself. this game becomes a lot easier and much more fun when you run with friends/guildies and you are all on the same page."
archeage,3ch5th,WyzeThawt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"You certainly can, although as others have said, it depends on what you want to do in the game and how much time you want to invest in it. Top-tier gear and bottomless finances will require corresponding effort (or pockets of cash). It's about as easy as other MMOs to find groups for activities like raids and dungeons, so you can solo everything else if that's how you want to proceed."

Creating a thread to personally attack and insult other players, or creating threads simply to start a fight for the sake of starting a fight (unattached to rivalry or something of that nature) is something we frown upon in the forums.  For example, you linked the post I closed. I had posted that because another user made this post: http://forums.archeagegame.com/showthread.php?208410-The-salt-is-too-damn-high.

This morning, when I came in, I noticed the moderation in my daily review of the forums. Shortly after, while I was investigating it, Aros contacted me via PM to discuss why his thread was removed and banned. I let him know that I had noticed the situation already, and was investigating.  As I went through my investigation, I agreed that the thread should not have been removed, and I will be discussing the matter with the moderators so we can get things on the same page. During my investigation, I noticed that you also got banned, and a thread you had made was removed. I'm assuming this is where your anger is coming from. I've already reverted your ban, and I apologize for how it was implemented.  Now I stand by my original post regarding what goes and does not go on the forums. Profanity is not allowed. And if someone steals a pack from you and posts about it in the forums, then I very well expect you to get back in to the game and earn that pack back, be it alone or in a group that outnumbers your opponent.  I do play the game, and this isn't my first rodeo in a PvP territory. I'm fully Iron Banner geared in Destiny, a former raid leader from a RP-PvP server in Warcraft, avid MOBA player, former Darkfall player (PvP with a full loot system), and I could go on. This is something I've been very clear about.  I only ask that if we are going to have a discussion like this that you don't use the profanity or the insults. I would never speak to you like that, and I'd appreciate the same courtesy in return.

And it's funny that you mentioned Darkfall, did you ever pass by the forums in there? did you see the kind of posts they have? they are nearly exactly the same as we have and sometimes way worse! Maybe the only difference is that people got sick of it so it doesn't have as much flaming as it used to be, so again I would really love to know if your main mission here is to reinvent the wheel or what exactly are you doing? because if you really think you can stop players from flaming each other in a PVP game then you are going to have such a huge challenge.

So My question stands, what do you all think of that kind of change? do we really need to have this in our community?"

archeage,3cgugt,GGATHELMIL,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:58:16 2015 UTC,also have you considered another 1 handed weapon and a shield? why exactly do you want a sword over lets say a shortspear or even a 1 handed axe.

It's crucial for any Battlerage melee warrior because the more heavily you specialize into BR the more beneficial is the Parry for the Deflect And Retaliate passive.  If your Battle Focus is active you will most likely exhaust internal cooldown of 3 seconds (you cannot reset your skills more often than once per 3 secons), but when Battle Focus is off that's where sword contributes most.  Using Shortspear or 1H axe or Katana is viable too, but for min-maxing it will be always sword (because cooldown reset on 3 Skills: Tigerstrike, Precision Strike and Whirlwind will deal much more damage than Trigger Effects from other weapons)."

archeage,3cgugt,Villentrenmerth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:37:02 2015 UTC,no you are right. getting the optimal weapon for your class is obviously.. optimal. i mean you can get a Shortspear a katana a good bow and maybe a longspear and easily play any class in this game with just those weapons. oh and a Cold anguish to off hand in DW classes. but they wont always be optimal. one of my frinds runs two handed blighter its controversial because no shield means no skills from defense really. just passives. its just shortspear and katana are just that versatile. you can main hand a shortspear and off hand a cold anguish as a Darkrunner and its pretty good since you get both passives its just never optimal.   If im not mistaken koonkoon ran/runs a DR with a t6 legendary katana the magic attack is wasted but he can play any melee class and any magic class with that.

Healing  Cleric: Auramancy/Vitalism/Songcraft  Example: [Fervant Intervention: PvP Cleric] by Rguitar /u/rguitar87  Auramancy + Vitalism are the most powerful healing composition. Adding Healing hymn from Songcraft and Ode to Recovery can be very effective. I recommend watching video for better grasp how to avoid being in the wrong spot at the wrong time. Songcraft's heals are more of a support heals, because they cost insane amounts of mana and aren't really focused. Their HOTs (Heals Over Time) are very difficult to control in raid environment.  Tank  Tomb Warden: Defense/Auramancy/Songcraft  It's not really a tank, it's more like ""target dummy"". Big benefit of this class is that with Full Stamina gear you are basically immortal (weapon doesn't really matter, you can go into the Battle even without any weapon equipped). Only function of Tomb Warden in PVP is constant uptime of Bulwark Ballad and Bloody Chantey, and ofc soaking up as much damage as possible.

archeage,3cezpv,Villentrenmerth,2,Tue Jul 7 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"What kind of alternatives are you looking for? Do you have some experience playing with Songcraft before?  Problem is: Performance skills are channelled, so there are not many options if you want to deal damage. Sorcery tree has long cooldowns that can be combined with Zeal proc very efficiently. I can't see any alternative. Problem with performances is: they drain too much mana if you for example would like to rotate it with Enervate.  There are definitely no alternatives for powerful healing (I'm playing healer myself since day 1), because Songcraft is not really a healing tree. Vitalism's primary spell would be Antithesis, with 3-5 second cooldown, so refreshing Bulwark's Ballad every few seconds is not an option.  Annareth mentioned that Earthsinger is a Tanky DPS, and I would have to disagree with that. Defense skilltree doesn't make you tanky, it's the gear that contributes most. Compare an Abolisher with Leather Lightning, Leather Squall, and Leather Earth. Each of them will have different level of tankiness despite being the same build. Earthsinger is a ""well rounded"" class in comparison to Spellsinger - ""glass cannon"". I was never fan of Glass Cannons, because in any other situation than 1v1 they can be stopped too easily.

It's also what I take on my miner alts to run around node to node since my alts usually don't have mounts/gliders.  With Freerunner, self-cast Shadowstep, Quickstep, and Comet's Boon, you're hitting speeds equal to or faster than mount level at times. With Shadowplay Skill Cool down passive, your Backdrop is on a low, low CD. Then add to the fun with Teleport and Mirror Warp reset passive for RNG How-far-can-I-go travel. If you have a target ahead of you, you can also save Shadowstep and insta-move those 20 meters.

They identify the most common problems and run through the most common fixes of those issues. So lets say you had a unique problem the most effective way to attack the problem would be to systematically run through the most common fixes of said problem starting with the one that works the most right? 90% of the time customers I had refused to go through the most basic steps and 99% of the time it was one of those steps that solved their problem. It's just more cost and time effective to blaze through the script then to have the agent sit there and guess. Also it is the engineers who came up with both the solutions and the order in which to do them. NOT the agent. the engineers don't answer the phone because then that would be their job and not actually fixing things. Once all known solutions have been exhausted starting with the most effective and ending with the least effective you get to a point where the only solution is to take a note of the issue and send that note to the engineers. If the engineers get dozens of the same notes it becomes a priority. But if they only get one it gets added to the low priority fix list and the customer with the problem gets screwed. Which I've had to do a few times. ""Sorry call back in 72 hours"" was our generic saying but we knew that their problem was unique and had no solution.

archeage,3cc2np,Umbram_Mortis,25,Mon Jul 6 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"Star Trek Online (STO) crafting system strikes the best balance between ""all RNG"" (Archeage) and ""you should always feel like you have guaranteed progress"".  Basically in STO, it translates to roughly $8-$10 (if you PTW and don't farm in game currencies for it) for a 5% upgrade chance on one item at end game (Mk XIV gear from VR to UR, or UR to Epic, for those familiar with that system).  If you fail the upgrade on that item, the item holds a ""memory"" of the fail, so that your next chance has a 5%+5% = 10% chance of upgrade. If that fails, your next chance has a 15%, the next 20% and so forth.  Eventually that item will get to 100% upgrade chance if your luck is really bad (and it would have to be REALLY bad to fail at the 95% and 90% chances prior, etc.)  The RNG ""hey I might get lucky"" part of the game is there, but so is the ""I know at some point I WILL guaranteed get the upgrade no matter how bad the RNG. - I am ALWAYS progressing and I can measure that progress "". And yes, the STO players don't like the system much, but the STO system is pure easy-mode compared to current Archage.  Arechage should mimic STO so that the current AA feeling of ""I worked very hard and I have NOTHING to show for it"" goes away.  That model may work in Asian cultures, but not so much in Western ones.  Nothing loses a customer faster than seeing 100,000 honor points (2-3 months of daily work) used up in gems, and the player has nothing to show for it.  Meanwhile the lucky guy next to him used 5K honor and sockets his 5 gem slots on a first try. (And the lucky guy will quit later when the luck goes against him later).  MMO's are about continued, visible growth, where longevity is ""always"" rewarded in a MEASURABLE proportion  (you can not measure RNG!) to effort expended - it's the whole reason to play (and pay) long term for years.    Archeage is an awesome game in every other regard, but it lacks this balance of effort/reward endgame right now.  This one missing balance is holding AA from it's true potential in the West"

And every time I'm doing a trade run/catching a fish/pirating/playing AH/doing another repetitive task that makes more and more gold, it's all done in the name of another sacrifice to the RNG of the game. And then do the same thing again after it fails. It's.. Yeah. Demoralizing is the word."
archeage,3cc2np,dante411x,2,Tue Jul 7 03:36:48 2015 UTC,The next patch removes the RNG component of crafting obsidian armor. You will never have to use anything higher than illustrious to craft obsidian armor. Seems silly people are complaining about this now when the problem is remedied in the upcoming patch.
archeage,3cc2np,Nianni157,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"But this is only ONE aspect of armor. And although there may be a bracer coming out soon that I can't exactly remember what it will do, there are less Obsidian pieces than total slots (7). On top of that, at T4+ some pieces don't seem worth it, at least to me. For example, I am a cleric. I currently have a full set of Magnificent Stone. I am only going for certain of the Obsidian pieces (the ones that boost healing). The others have like decreased cast time or some such. I know this is debatable, but I expect to only get 3-4 Obsidian pieces. I would then consider getting Epherium or Delphinad Stone pieces to fill out the set. Just MHO."

Imagine you are a vanilla player, you do not buy anything from the auction house, and you want to craft a Celestial T4 Obsidian Sword and a Celestial T4 leather chest from scratch 100% yourself. This is all you want to do, you are going to dedicate your time to doing this. Draw out the life cycle to achieve this, and how you would achieve it.""  I imagine it would look like buying X amount of Apex's, selling them for gold, and buying the chest/sword.  That is quite obviously what Trion considers ""optimal gameplay""."

Spending a month's worth of farmed gold, honor and materials and have nothing to show off makes less and less sense every time it happens ... until one day a player say fuck it and never look back."
archeage,3cc2np,ArcRofy,4,Tue Jul 7 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"RNG is not only one path of improving your character. Gold in this game is the be all end all not rng. The longer you play and harder you work (and more you spend) the more gold you acquire. The more gold you get the better gear you can afford. This is different in other mmorpgs in that the gear there would all be BOP and locked away in a dungeon you needed 40 other players to get and RNG to both get the drop and to acquire. So you played for two months got max level and failed a regrade past cele, Guess what? That ain't shit compared to having to join a large guild, earn DKP, and wait in line for your damn drops. RNG seems bad because its right there in your face but I've never worked super hard in this game and have 3400 gs after three months. Nothing to write home about but Thats three months driving a tractor around. I used to put in 10 hours a week every week to raid. Working for gear in this game is easy. It's not like spending hours in a dungeon only to not get your drop or to see it drop but have someone else get it. So I don't really get the whole crying over rng biz. EVERY game has rng it's just hidden from you more cleverly."

Its this. In wow or any other MMO that favors the mentioned system its a measurable growth and not a shit in the face growth.  Sure its arguable to say in a day I make a mag weapon (which is irrelevant at this point) but none the less I make it, regrade, hit celes and break it no big deal that took a day,  But I get all the way up to ayanad or buy an ayanad and spent the entire sum of my time playing getting it and it fucking breaks..."

It's like planting 6 trees a day and wondering why you don't get thunderstrucks. The people who farm thunderstruck plant 3k pines in massive unprotected farms. Or have large farms where they plant over 500 trees a day. The longer you play this game the more money you begin to generate and the easier things are to get. Thats the game.

You have to wait. People who were playing the game before you have BiS. Eventually you may or may not catch up to BiS and then they throw out an expansion which makes all your gear useless and you have to do it again. When I started playing WoW the time it took to get to BiS was about a year. In this game it could be 2 weeks it could be two years. That's the real point. This isn't WoW. You have to play it differently. You have to think of it differently."
archeage,3cc2np,awkwardvlog,9,Wed Jul 8 02:42:14 2015 UTC,Good read. I agree with this 100%. RNG is just... All your work can go down the drain. Upvote.
archeage,3cc2np,MugenFuu,5,Tue Jul 7 04:41:52 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents.   This isn't the game for you.  This game is RNG.   I cannot relate with you at all.  I think my perspective is almost a complete 180 degrees.  It's like you viewed this whole game world, and said ""I have to do everything myself!"" and that just honestly makes no sense, and it's understandable that you are demoralized.  It's certainly understandable to experience a little bit of everything yourself but you are trying to be a jack of all trades.   This game is meant to be a community game.  We have proficiencies so that we can have proficient people.  If you want to grow a garden in the yard, that's an awesome hobby, but you aren't going to compete with the Farmer who owns 100 acres out in the country.  And if you visit that farmer, you will see he grows 2-3 different types of crops.  That doesn't mean he doesn't feed his family meat and bread.  He purchases his meat and bread from the market just like everyone else.  If he divided up his 100 acres to produce a little bit of everything he used in his house, he would be incredible inefficient.   You spent all this time and effort into farming every little tid bit for a T4 obsidian set just to have your name on it.  Well the guy who crafted pots, and has 180k alchemy proficiency bought a T3 obsidian and Salvaged Epherium, and now he has his name on a T4 also.  Except he didn't beat his head on a wall the whole time, and he got it a lot sooner.   I always tell new people to Pick a proficiency and stick with it.  Get the labor reduction bonus, so that even when the market is down you can make a profit.  The jack of all trades is the master of none, and the end result is demoralization."
archeage,3cc2np,4_jacks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:02:12 2015 UTC,"Are you the same guy leaving posts saying to just level one proficiency to 180K and buy everything else? I think your logic is very sound. Unfortunately, it wasn't until recently that I realized it. I have spread proficiencies around (75k tailor, 41k farming, 110k gather, 42k alchemy, 37k commerce, etc.).  At first, I was trying to be self-sufficient. I would do intercontinental trade runs to get stablizers. But that takes time, and my time to play AA is limited (2+ hours / 4-5 days a week), so I started buying them. But when I did the (simple) math, it didn't add up to making 1-2g on something that sells for 30g+/-, because I'd have to sell ALOT taking up the time I have to play. I don't want to sit in front of the computer basically trading in stock by using the AH 90% of the time. :) I think, however, I have found a happy medium. I make some of my mats for alchemy items, buy the rest and craft. But this still is not making me TONS of money that I can go out and buy a my gear. So, yes, I craft some of it. I have some Magnificent and a few Epherium pieces ready to go to get my T3+ Obsidian.  In the end, I realized that the thing that makes money consistently are Trade Packs. And not the Aged packs that take 3 days and give you like 50% more money. What I did was grow the mats and then do the runs. During the Windscour/Rookbourne event, I was making 3 runs a day grossing 100g+ per run. In 10 days I had about 3k gold. I know, it's sad, it took me 10 days to gross 3k gold. And it took a long amount of time. :("
archeage,3cc2np,BluntedJ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I say it a lot, I probably sound like a broken record.  It's just a rule of thumb as they say, it's not like I don't do anything else in the game.  I try to take a pack or two to freedich when the gold trader is up.  I have two 16's and I keep pines on them.  More just hoping for a TST, but I guess I'm a logger.    I think it's great advice for new people. If you have your 180k income stream, buy a snowflake and mess around with something else, nothing wrong with that."
archeage,3cc2np,4_jacks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:41:32 2015 UTC,"I think my point has been missed upon you.  I am not a jack of all trades, my only ""crafting"" profession above 50k is leather working, which currently sits 165k.  I do believe this is a community game, I do personally engage in AH purchasing and guild / friend trading a lot.  Like I said in my post, this is something I chose to do, farming a lot of the more expensive materials myself, and purchasing oils and stuff as a separate item is what I did.   My personal experience aside is irrelevant here, if I make a piece from scratch myself or buy all the mat from everyone, or buy the end product, it still does not change the fact that at almost every stage of any crafting tree, RNG is the deciding factor, from mining materials, from growing archeum trees, crafting the end item, farming the materials from the library etc.  Even then, you spend labor, successful or not, you are governed by RNG and labor restrictions.  Yes I could just buy the armor, or weapon, but once again, someone is dictated by the RNG, even for me to get the 10k+ gold to obtain a piece of the above, would still require me to do something that engages RNG.  I am not anti-rng, far from it, like I stated, it is necessary to maintain some form of in-game differences, otherwise everyone would be vanilla.  But please, someone, stop slapping my face with the RNG dick every time I even look at the crafting manual at every stage.  So many people I have played this game with have quit, not because of broken PVP or PVE mechanics, not because of some random glitch, it has been the continual pushing over and over of ""doesn't matter what you do, its all random""."
archeage,3cc2np,4_jacks,2,Tue Jul 7 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry your point has not been missed by me.  My response to your main point was just quite short.    This isn't the game for you. This game is RNG.   I then went a bit off topic into the jack of all trades, which I believe describes you 100%.  Your main profession is Leatherworking and it's only at 165k.  You have other professions above 40k.   My main profession is 180k and has been for months. I have two other proficiencies above 10k.  One I am working on as an alternate income source, and Larceny from all the purses I obtained grinding library and grinding mobs for my cloak.   Even my alt account in EU, which I play for 20-30 minutes a day is at 180k proficiency.  Do one thing and do it well.  It's just my advice, it works for me, I believe it works in this game.  I'm not saying don't experience other stuff, but what you said about having some goal to craft everything from scratch was pretty far out there.   That was a diversion from your RNG topic, but I don't feel I can add too much more.  I know of two ways games can implement the upgrade process, RNG and exponential cost.  Numerically (rough terms) a Magnificent weapon could costs 4 times that of a Illustrious, and an Epherium could costs 7 times that of the Magnificent.  Instead they give you 1 in 4 and 1 in 7 odds to upgrade.  Overall (rough terms) the number of upgraded gear entering the system is the same.    When you say 'every stage of the crafting tree' you are being a bit over-dramatic. If you chop a tree and get 3 logs one time but 4 logs the next, it does not mean RNG slapped the penis in your face."

archeage,3cc2np,bubbler_,3,Tue Jul 7 18:42:18 2015 UTC,Whats the solution to rng? I've only heard one viable solution so far and it would vastly effect how many people earn their incomes.  RNG = gold to most people. Easing up on it just helps the people who don't want to work to get gold and skip straight to stuff like pvp. The gear grind is far more diverse with the current system. Meaning you can grind your gear doing anything from afk fishing to running packs to farming mobs. To allow people to be able to just craft all the way up the ladder without consequence would require restructuring the core of the game. Suddenly anyone would be able to bis out within a month of starting. all lower tier equipment would become useless. People who craft weapons for a living would lose their main playstyle. RNG is how they gate content. Same as wow. You join a raid you don't get the drop or you get the drop but lose the roll to acquire it. In this game there is no true BiS you can get the same tier weapons with the same grading but have a range of different stat values. What people need to do is leave the weapon crafting to weapon crafters. You are not supposed to make your own gear you are supposed to make thousands of gear and maybe keep the best for yourself. Making a few bows and getting mad because you couldn't get ayanad is not what this game is about. It's about earning gold to buy your gear. How do you earn gold? That's up to you. The game provides tons of ways to do it. THAT is the game. People need to know that and accept that and stop bitching that they can't beat 3% odds with only 10 tries.

Did some thinking today, and, while I still agree, I think the RNG could be slightly more forgiving.  I work a lot of damn hours, but still feel obligated to put a lot of hours into my character.  It's kinda the nature of mmo's.  I like Archeage, but I can't sit there and play it all day like I did other games when I was younger.  It burns you out.    All that aside, I think you are correct that the formula/economy is working right now."
archeage,3cc2np,awkwardvlog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:18:52 2015 UTC,I think it's so integrated into the core of the game that removing it or masking it would change the game into something entirely new. I do like the idea of the item remembering how many tries it's had and upping the percentage based on the number of failed regrades or just making the destruction into double downgrades. That would prevent a lot of rage quitting but honestly I don't have a problem with how the game works because it's fair. People who invest money have just as much of a chance as people who invest time and everyone is bound by the same percentages.
archeage,3cc2np,zylwork,0,Wed Jul 8 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"I do not believe, in this post, I am bitching, nor anyone else. I have stated many times, RNG needs to stay, but there needs to be some counter balance.  I have made 100's of crafted equipment that had been no good to me, and sold them on the AH. I could of brought that Full Delphinad set by now if I am honest, I am trying to convey a sense of a problem that effects the general mass population.  As for fixing it, in particular, crafting, there is a fix in place already, at illustrious you can choose to take the 3 items you have just made that didn't upgrade to convert into an upgradable item, could this not be scaled for the other stages?  It would be an easy fix.  But I am trying not to talk about any specific area of the game, I am trying to talk about how almost everything, rightly or wrong, its attributed to RNG, and how character creation is so entwined in the game for progression, that time, effort, placed into the game, almost mean diddly squat unless one of the 3 criteria are met.  You are blessed with RNG and something rare pops for you and you are able to sell for vast sums of gold.  You are willing to spend hours, days, weeks, months continually running packs to be able to afford that item that takes you to the next step.  You throw vast sums of money at the game.  Where is the 4th option ?  You have paid your dues, you have maxed your skills, you have farmed/brought your resources, you are rewarded.  This is obviously a problem even for the fabled Korean RNG community, considering an upcoming patch is going to address a fundamental part of crafting with regards to chance to upgrade.  Look, let me make it clear, I am here not for an easy ride, I am here for a challenge, I can deal with rare drops, I can deal with rare high end crafted gear, I cannot deal with the continual lottery game it is becoming, that's not a challenge."

Go to favourable spot, Golden Ruins are suggested because of the fairly easy monsters without AOE or Ranged attacks. DPS pulls the monsters and starts killing them. Before monsters die (10-20%), party leader removes DPS from the party. Server ""tags"" the monsters' loot and xp into the 3-man party that was created. DPS can continue killing monsters. After death 100% of the experience goes to You. Dummy is there so the party will not be disbanned while DPS is removed. Speed of leveling depends on DPS' build and gear.

We were able to get him a little over 9 levels in an hour or two (16-25). We did have interruptions from a red several times, so some of that time was wasted sneaking around and fighting him.  Each kill was about 7300 xp for him using this method on the 54 1-star tree mobs in central Golden Ruins, without any xp potions or patron status. I was able to kill them at a pretty constant rate once the red left us alone, but an aoe farming class/very bursty dps would probably be able to do it much faster.  If the person being leveled had patron and an xp potion going, I would assume that he may receive almost 10,000 xp per kill."

If you got cash (gold), buy mats and potions, max out crafting exp and chug pots (""Worker's compensation"" w/ no cooldown) as you craft 70,000xp every ~30seconds, (illustrious) per combine till 55. To compare, library dailies are 80,000xp [floor 1] each, and takes much longer depending on your server and/or its drama).

I was once in a while wondering what is he saying, but after all I felt healthier by not listening to his voice/not reading his messages.

Piss poor initiative by the staff to call a turd a turd and then go beg korea to patch it out of existence because it fucked the game up. Wanna know why Archeage when into the toilet? Because people are tried of your shit, the only time you give two fucks about an exploit is when it affects your monetization of the game. Anything else you just pretend is fine then patch later instead of taking the stance that it is fucked and dealing with the results.   looks at ship destruction gold printing...........yah that wasn't an issue and didn't completely fuck up ship components forever(the scrolls were dirt cheap because millions were being made over and over for hours) now top grade sails are worth nothing.

archeage,3cdp1o,zDecoy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"I think this might be because Artistry benefits are based on proficiency rank titles, not number-wise like other proficiencies (Ex. Other proficiencies are mainly need X proficiency to craft Y item. I think this is the main benefit of Dawnsdrop. Not sure about labor interaction.). In order to play Novice songs without messing up, you must be Vetaran rank, but the system still recognizes your proficiency rank title as Novice despite your proficiency number being higher.   The only benefit you'll get (unless Trion confirms it's a bug) is that the Liberty Drums need 60k Artistry to craft. I don't think any other proficiency behaves this way where it's based on your proficiency rank title instead of number (Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), so it really does suck that it causes an interaction like that. :\"

archeage,3ccrrq,tsbowsta,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:38:35 2015 UTC,The shortspear passive allows some of your attacks to ignore the enemies defense. It's not about the cast time decrease.  Spear   Piercing    When inflicting damage there is chance to ignore enemies Physical defense
archeage,3ccrrq,Hiyakira,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:02:15 2015 UTC,There is more shortspears then obsidian.. aim for either a gale shorspear or a obsidian v2...both full agi
archeage,3ccrrq,Hiyakira,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:34:37 2015 UTC,It depends on matchup for a DR really:  vs Cloth - 2hand weapon (Obsidian Greatsword) deals extra damage on clothies vs Leather -  DW so you can get a sword for the parry - Katana off hand vs Plate - Shortspear for the defense decrease - Katana off hand

archeage,3cb2f5,nyym1,3,Mon Jul 6 15:33:13 2015 UTC,"2h buff is 240ish magic and physical def penetration, and +7% attackspeed.  DW is still meta for DRs atm, but a lot of people will be switching to 2h once patch comes out.  lot of end game DRs in KR have 3 sets of weapon. Dualwield to fight leechrunners and 2h to fight abolishers/ other tank classes.  P.S.  Celestial buffs are getting a buff to btw.  e.g. Celestial leather set now gives +14% crit dmg increase.  so having 2h isnt bad, to be bursty af."

archeage,3cb2f5,Redelfen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"Dual Wield lets you parry ranged attacks and is better in 1v1s because of the increased attack speed. 2H is strong too because of the stupid amounts of damage you'll do, but you overall get less focus and if someone has dual wield that you're against, you will get beat. For world PvP, I would say it is personal preference if you want to insta-explode people with 2H or dual wield for the quickness. In 1v1 arena definitely go for dual wield."
archeage,3cb2f5,Faddler,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"Both have Pros and Cons  Overall the Dual Wield is a more popular choice due to the increased attack speed and faster global cooldowns.  in 1v1 a similarly geared DW-DR and 2H-DR, the Dual wield typically wins as the Attack Spped give their moves priority if both pulled the same move at the same time."

archeage,3cb2f5,Draxick,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:41:53 2015 UTC,What kind of Dual wield would you suggest? sword sword? sword katana? shortspear dagger? im confused.
archeage,3cb2f5,GoodGuyRomex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, as I said, I prefer Shortspear / Katana as that is my current setup. Shortspear because the puncture passive eliminates armor and helps you burst, same with the Katana's crit passive.  A lot of people like going Katana / Dagger for the attack speed passive on the dagger, but I find that the proc chance is very low.  Sword is viable, but don't go two swords. If you're running sword, run Sword / Katana, or Sword / Dagger, because Sword / Sword wastes a weapon passive."
archeage,3cb2f5,soedgy69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:47:23 2015 UTC,Dual wield is also more versatile because you can take a shield and swap classes
archeage,3cb2f5,Bloks3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:15:01 2015 UTC,It's personal preference when it comes down to it. With duel wield the combat will feel a lot faster and you will get combos off much faster. With 2h you have the ability the 1 combo most players assuming your weapon is good. Both have their pros and cons but nothing is wrong with going either.  My personal reasoning for going duel wield is because I like the combat to be as face paced as possible.
archeage,3cb2f5,Venerate,2,Mon Jul 6 15:06:53 2015 UTC,dual wield also lets you parry ranges (with mastery) and reset BR skills vs archers

Plate - Beter for PVE or vs AD melee/ranged Leather - Better for open world PvP vs Magic.  What I miss switching from plate wasn't the passive % health or resistances. It's the % dmg reduction, celestial buff gives you 2.5% for 4 piece matched with grimg for another 3% I lost 5.5% damage reduction :( but much more versatile then plate.  I am Abolisher and I have a plate set 4/7 gimghast, 2/7 obs and auroria gloves and working on obs leather currently, All T1, Chest/Greaves are celest.

Leather is maybe better for 1v1 if you dont have a v2 t4 shield but when buffed up, plate trumps leather for medium and large scale pvp  Edit: Parry will keep you alive a lot vs other melee too and the block from it is really useful vs archers"
archeage,3cbhmy,arcticfox4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:56:47 2015 UTC,Leather gives more total defense than plate. Gemming plate to get magical defense won't give you as good results as gemming leather with mdef/pdef (opposite of what your t4 shield is).
archeage,3cbhmy,Kerrigar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:50:54 2015 UTC,"plate gives you 5% bonus health and 3% bonus defense, you can gain a ton of magic defense jsut from using auramancy skills, and being in plate fully buffed will just mean that you are unkillable by melee and archers and if you use cooldowns correctly, unlkillable by mages"
archeage,3cbhmy,arcticfox4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:53:39 2015 UTC,"You can use buffs, cooldowns and auramancy skills regardless of your armor of choice.

Having glyph launcher up doesn't trigger it. Running AA on other machines on the network doesn't trigger it either. Only the one comp loading AA. As soon as hackshield boots network gets hit. Then 5 min later... Hit again and AA gets dc'd.  I suggest you monitor your network traffic and see if this is also happening to you.  So far I have been unsuccessful in stopping it.

archeage,3cab0u,Seripha,3,Mon Jul 6 09:47:05 2015 UTC,"I also play shadowknight too, but i focus more on Magic damage, and CC with mud/heal. I never had the money to play more melee damage, I had many 1on1 duels, and fought the best player in my server.  I was cloth/scepter/magic damage. http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/323464 My advice to you when playing SKnight, is to keep the cc  going, never let them have a chance to use defenses skills as redoubt/freerunner/courageous action. If they do, kite and run away until they are on cooldown. Your advantage is invisible, finding the right opening and catching them off guard.  Your weapon must have full arena focus, so parry/eva/block does not effect your cc. Note: also change your Skill build offend, depending what class your fighting which range, cloth, plate, melee, caster, each skill build can be change during the fight, focus the things that is not needed (example: remove magic defense, if fighting non-caster). Also Focal Concussion is one of my favor skill to use fighting darkrunners, only be cause its instance cast, and i always get the first hit up front.  FC: Deal damage/Stun 1.5sec and remove any positive buff (example pray that it remove courageous action so that you can fear) Video:   (lvl 50) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlHdCLIGwjs    (arena)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k54r3SRP8o4   (Burn)  I would make more videos,  but i was ban.... :( ....over something i didn't do.   http://i844.photobucket.com/albums/ab8/lastmixwolft/Archeage%20only/combo%20melee_zpskcvblw9c.png  Its gonna take me all day to explain this,  but the idea is to keep them on lock down, so they are not able to hit you. Follow the combos in order, they would be stun/tripp/shackles/silence/fear/stun again or something like that.

Now the match is started with the players lose his/her defenses buff. Once out of invis the fight can start with your opening.

You have to Jump to and cast for this.....  Opps, I am going over my head and typing too much>  Tips and Tricks notes: [For enemy shadowstep] once target the player, just quickly smash down your keys continuously fast for ""Focal Concussion"" and turn your camera enough to catch line of sight.... just keep hitting the key until the shadowstep behind you, and hope you are fast enough to catch him before the player hits you.

Your damage is going to be pathetic, your main magic damage skills from witchcraft are missing, You have fear + sleep combo, what for? You don't have any valid long cast spells to justify sleeping people. I mean, it's just an obsolete class, like dreambreaker. No damage, just decent tankyness due to witchcraft defence.

Basically just a full cc build, you said you have a katana so utilizing magic and physical damage is optimal. Basic combo. Stalkers mark>shadowstep>overwhelm>shadowsmite>shield slam>bullrush>purge>poohand combo>fear and lassitude(bubbletrap against WC users) wait for cool downs and repeat. Rapid strike and Ursine Roar(10th defense passive) are interchangeable. ShadowKnight is very good against most classes, cc is your best friend and will be your main output of damage. Rapid strike is strictly for when your cc is on cool down or you are fighting someone with witchcraft/battlerage and is best used with redoubt up, if your opponent runs from redoubt it doesn't matter because its burning time while your skills are on cool down. Focul concussion should be used if you see your enemy overwhelming you or shadowstepping to you/them. dahutas breath should finish off your rotation or be at the very start if you bubble and dahutas breath them while they are in a bubble which deals quite a bit of damage."

archeage,3c8tge,awkwardvlog,3,Mon Jul 6 00:37:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks we will see what they say now the waiting game of how long to wait before they fix the problem., as for the accusation of me being a cheater in game a few jerks like to say.  1.) http://imgur.com/a/HyXtx     | Here is my account history take a look its how I got started in the game buying up land and making profit legally.  2.) http://imgur.com/a/ZBsi4     | For the drama, here is my ex.guild leader who never showed me any rules to the so called guild, and then tells me I broke them. So for those who wan't to know I pretty much helped players I know from this guild to acquire free land, not to mention the massive donation made to the guild in good faith of having good helpful players which some were nice players. To make it short I find it funny that one of its members was allowed to use hateful language in chat which would offend most people and did and nothing happens to them, but for the first time I get accused of buying gold or something over a large market sell done in one day of crafting mats, and all of a sudden my accounts are immediately removed. (Well I hope that Trion does restore the gold so I can be like I told you so.)  Lets not forget the large amount of transactions I have done with other members from the same guild.  ^ I just really don't like the amount of jerks, and leaders who wan't to have control over everyone's game play especially things that happen outside of chat, and when not even shown a list of rules they complain you broke.  3.) As I have said before in game when someone started talking about gold sellers before in Faction Chat, and prices of credits, my personal opinion is I don't care if players sell their own hard earned goods for real money, I am not saying it doesn't break EULA or TOS because it does obviously, but I personally won't care or bother reporting someone for this as long as its legally obtained, for those who also read in game and wanted to bring this up again.    I just think that Trion needs to do something more to fix bots in this game rather than get involved with player to player transactions, or market transactions and screwing over its legit players, I mean what if I needed that gold really badly right now for something, and I don't have it so I lose a good piece of epic loot, or something because of Trion.    I guess its just the waiting game to see how long it takes Trion to fix the issue, on the other hand I went from 2 gold, and already back up to like 800 gold, soon will be back at 1000 gold I don't care, I just care because Trion does this to its subscribers and players who actually play the game."
archeage,3c8tge,awkwardvlog,5,Mon Jul 6 02:36:45 2015 UTC,"""I just care because Trion does this to its subscribers and players who actually play the game""  These are bot traps. That Very rarely catch legitimate players and when they do it's usually just an appeal away from getting unbanned (or your gold back). So you can make a fuss or just wait for the appeal to go through.   I was banned a few months ago and managed to get through in less than 48 hours. But it could be longer. I didn't come to reddit and make a big fuss and accuse the company of banning everyone.   It's just more reddit/ forum drama and everyone is sick of it. Appeal and wait. quietly. There are thousands of players in this game and very few get into this stuff and most get out of it with an appeal. So when you accuse Trion of doing this to everyone it makes you look silly. and when you bring up how much money you spent it makes you look entitled.   As for your guild seems like they should have waited for the appeal to go through. But I don't know what your history is with them."
archeage,3c8tge,awkwardvlog,-5,Mon Jul 6 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"1.) No player should just get banned from the game without a given reason (Even though their (TOS/EULA) says they don't have to give one.  2.) I tried to go through customer service quietly before, I waited a week for a response to a major issue I was having with game, got an answer they can't fix, So I posted to the forums & Reddit, and other game forums, and finally after like 2-3 tickets I got them to fix the issue.  3.) No one should get banned, or have gold removed for player to market transactions it should be a (Safe Area) for players to trade their goods without risk of getting any gold removed with (No Item Refund)  4.) Why complain? Because I read the Archeage forums quite often, there is a huge number of exploits, and still players who never got their items back after the coin purse exploit I don't care about a few K gold lost, but I would rather not loose it because I could make that 3k gold turn into 5k gold easily.    I totally believe Trion needs to hire GM's who can actually help players with their issues in game faster, get things done, as well as GM's who can actively monitor for bots, and fraud, I remember back in the day when GM's used to actively play the game Teleport around locations invisible, and look for cheaters, or bots, that just doesn't happen anymore, however its something we need, how hard is it to get players like this or GM's rather. ( It would be a lot easier to stop botting of things like Stone before it makes it to the auction house and messes with the economy.)  . Take for example if I report a bot, for botting there is no reason a GM can't teleport there within 30 minutes and ask the player if they are there or not and if not (Ban them) for botting. Especially when they are mining stone and running around doing it.  . Another thing is Griefers, It should be a punish worthy offense even though players say griefing is part of the game for example bridge blocking players trying to play the game.    On another note that guild leader just has no idea how to lead a guild especially after what I saw yesterday, and getting into trouble myself today for just saying I had roughly 3000 gold removed and getting into trouble for that, a true leader wouldn't treat its members like this."
archeage,3c8tge,balzor,4,Mon Jul 6 05:00:39 2015 UTC,Your ideas about what a gm can and can't do have no merit. Players do see when they are banned. But specifics of how they are caught are never and should never be given. Your gold was lost and you assume its because of X but you don't have proof. So submit your tickets and wait until someone investigates the issue. Don't assume trion is full of psychic warlocks who know exactly what happened to your character.   I agree about griefers but I respect those aspects of the game. Say I wanted to set up a toll bridge. I could do that. It's part of the game. Preventing land barons from running packs is part of the game. Some people feel strongly enough to leave their character there and deal with the KoS. That's the game.   Like I said before all you do when you bitch and bitch is get yourself ahead of someone else in line. It's just like cutting except we have to hear about it as you cut in front of everyone else.   They need to just outsource gms to india and have a million of them policing everything but then we'll have people getting banned over language barrier issues.
archeage,3c8tge,nenjaraia,3,Mon Jul 6 05:15:38 2015 UTC,"I am seriously confused as to why you are wasting your time here.  You obviously just bought 3k gold from bots and you know that, lying to us wont change the facts.  And why bother lying to us?  We have no power to get your gold back, only trion does.  The only one you should go lie to is them.  Of course they'll see right through your lie when they look at their logs and see where your 3k gold came form.  In conclusion, if you want to whale, do it through trion."
archeage,3c8tge,Villentrenmerth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"1.) I would not waste my time lying about a 3k Gold Purchase when in less than 48 hours I have already made back 1.8k I could have done more if  I was completely focus on it.  2.) My problem is that this isn't the first time Trion has done this, First time to me yes I lost around 3k Gold could have been more or less I don't have an exact number so its why I am saying 3k.  3.) If you go look on Trion forum's you can see that other players lost items during the regrade exploit and they even have a hard time getting anything done about it, I know its a different issue, but still, players are getting screwed over, what if that was me and I had upgraded an epic sword before buying a mythic for example, and then I find out it was exploited I got my other one destroyed and then I have no weapon because of this.  http://forums.archeagegame.com/showthread.php?205778-RegradeGate-AH-SAFE-FROM-EXPLOITERS-PLAYER-TO-PLAYER-TRADES-APPARENTLY-NOT./page7   First of all, there's no one saying that using trading shouldn't be done. Just wanted to clear that up. Second, I hear where ya'll are coming from, and it's all valid points. However, this was the instruction that was given to me to do, and I did. If you look at from the auction buyers point of view, think of it this way. You wanted this bow from this guy for a LONG time, and you finally had a way to obtain it. Let's say you'll rarely get a chance at this bow again, since ya'll managed to explain it's rarity IF even seen. You save your gold, and you blow it on this exploited item that you're unaware of, and make the trade. BOW GET! You finally have the dream bow you've wanted, and you didn't pay nearly as much as you thought you would for it. Both sides of the party are now happy, as one has their katana, and the other has their dream bow. Now we come along and strip you of your katana, and you're upset about that, naturally. So we say let's reverse it all! We strip the bow from the other guy, slap back his money, and go, ""sorry this should have never happened."" That's fine, everything is back the way it should have been. But maybe that guy really wanted that bow, and now he doesn't have it. So they ask, ""Why can't I just keep the bow? I traded for it fairly, and I had no idea I bought an exploited item."" It just seemed like the lesser of two evils. I'd do the same for any of you should this have occurred. I don't want to get into any more detail, and I'm sorry for those who feel it was the wrong call, but it was the one that was made.   My point is that Trion doesn't always make good decisions, and someone gets screwed over, this needs to stop  4.) Back on topic, I had a Developer looking over my claims yesterday on the forums  questioning what I did when I flipped the market and lost Gold, I sent a few response to them after he contacted me, and he questioned my trades that I flipped, because I sold some Archeum trees for over 40 gold or more I think it was don't even remember honestly  (No Joke) Someone bought them all and started listing at like 100+ gold so I did the same, and someone actually bought them.  . What I did was not illegal in any way  . If I see a lucky sunpoint up there for 150 gold bid like I did yesterday but I stupidly missed the bid, What do you think im going to do (Im going to bid on it) and try to get it when the time nears expire, This isn't illegal either and its not my fault someone didn't pay attention to the listing bid and someone takes a 400G item for 150 then resells it for more profit.  . For that matter if I want to sell a <Egg> for 10 gold on the market and someone buys my Egg, how is this illegal or even question worthy no one in their right mind would do this obviously, but its not a punish worthy offense.  5.) There is a reason GM's generally do not get involved in player to player transactions, nor should they be getting involved with the way I choose to play my game, which is all legal, the moment they start removing Gold, or Items bought from players from the market is the moment I am being told playing the game and using the market is Unsafe.  6.) Here is a snapshot of how much gold I make passively just doing the basic mining (Only on one account) that is before refining, or processing it into higher costing items and selling, which mainly im just leveling up my 3 other accounts the same way, but lets do the basic math here 90 gold x 4 accounts = 360 a day that is before processing it, or passive gold income, or trade-pack runs for that matter. (Technically this is every 2 RL days but considering I login to my Alts every 2 days to make profit its good.)  http://i.imgur.com/PvMCDb9.jpg  7.)  Lets not argue that Arche Age is a Pay 2 Win Game / Pay 2 Enjoy Game (You don't have to but won't get anywhere as fast when you are like me going for the good stuff.)  . Either you use a single account and you spend a long time working towards getting the best gear in game, mythic sails etc.  . You buy gold which is illegal, or Apex  . Or you are like me and you play the market, look for good deals, be a land flipper, and use multiple accounts to get somewhere faster.  Which to me $60 a month is nothing my Cable Bill itself is way higher, let alone the other games I used to play.  8.) This is the biggie, if Trion spent less time trying to worry about the illegal gold buyers, and wasting their time having to review players account history, but instead put that time towards (Banning) the ( illegal gold spammers) the (Bots) and added a real report system where GM's actually remove illegally (Botted) stone and other items before it ever made it to the market, then perhaps I would not be having the issue I am having right now, of course the only thing to do is wait I understand, but I should not have to, and neither should other players who have had issues, before Trion takes action they should know what is going on is what I am saying.  9.) Lets not forget this is all after the awful experience of having to wait a week or longer to deal with my farmers workstation issue which did slow me down quite a bit until I finally got a helpful GM to actually fix it and honestly if they didn't fix this I would have left the game because I was really screwed."

And people need to be reminded and informed so that when it happens to them, they can understand what went wrong and why.   Trion does not support archeage. They literally bot more than the gold farmers, with most bans and gold seizures being an entirely automated process with little to no oversight and that is entirely inexcusable on their part.   Trion basically manages this game much like a dictator manages a socialist state. They lie to the population about free markets while actually controlling the economy behind the scenes, and instead of using legitimate means to police their playerbase, they let a robotic secret police of automated scripts execute people and remove their property on a whim.            No, the markets arent safe. They have never been safe. Trion picks winners and losers every time they release a new cash shop item. And when inflation gets too high, their automated system starts targeting players who arent making money the way trion wants them to: strictly buying things at inflated values for a real money from their cash shop. And if you complain about it? They take your account out to the mini Lubyanka they have in their office and shoot you  the head."

The game is not dead. Most of the nay sayers have left the game and just hang out on the forums and the sub reddit because they are pathetic losers with no lives. They feel like trion cheated on them with another girl or something. I've said this before. I played Rift from the beginning. It was sub based. Just after launch people started trash talking the game and saying it was a dead game. A year later it was still going strong but had a lot of competition from all the other games coming out. It actually did start to lose players. They talked about going free to play but said it wasn't something they wanted to do. After laying off dozens of people they really had no choice. They decided they would make the game free to play but instead of hiding content (map areas, dungeons, levels) behind a pay wall they would make the whole game free to play and function off of micro-transactions. Boom suddenly the servers were full again. And its a system they've implemented into all their other games as well. Their number one sellers? RNG boxes. So when people ask why they don't change their strategy the answer is because it pulled them from the brink of bankrupcy and continues to make them money. I've been on dead mmos and this is not one. Don't listen to people. If you took the game as it is and played it with out getting into corporate politics or player bitching you will find a great game underneath. That p2w bullshit is fake too. It's just people bitching because they can't figure out how to make money or they don't want to join a large guild."

archeage,3c8asq,Hindsight-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:39:52 2015 UTC,None of this is proof of anything. Those guys regrading do it for a living (in archeage) or they do it for their guild. Those certain large guilds are making shit tons of money off of castles and events. They use that money to gear themselves up so they can maintain their revenue. Unless you are in direct competition with them (soloing kraken) Than it really shouldn't effect your fun that much.

They also feel the need disrupt people's attempts on world mobs they don't even care about, block bridges, monopolize abysall and other events, dominate arena, completely discouraging people who have to work for their success.

But let's be honest- there's been a lot of cheating on AA. Lack of proof doesn't mean there aren't shenanigans. Given the amount of duping and exploitable content that was also there in other releases it's hardly a stretch to imagine it's going on now, especially given the relative (to people who play legitly, daily, trying hard) wealth accumulated by certain guilds who've been around and played foreign releases."

I'm sure that people are cheating every day and will continue to cheat in any and every game. But I don't look at every regrade success and assume they are hacking or see a guild making tens of thousands of gold publicly each week and assume they got their gear by cheating.

With the gold they buy gear someone has already crafting effectivly counter it self for p2w argument, but do people look at the fact that some one crafted it ? LOL nope they just see some one have better gear and they whine.  Then it's the rng boxes that can be argued to be P2W as it is the only source of red and superior red regrade charms. But then u have yellow and superior yellow that gives 1.5 instead of 2 that the reds give.  Other then that i don't see how anything else can somehow be seen P2W. But i still see people that is smart earn more gold then whales by just being smart and use the market. As an exampel the best geared player on my server has the highest ES(Equipment Score) by 1k and all he did was flip stuff on AH. And the p2w whals was 1k ES after him."

Things like Hauler upgrade, Gazebo Upgrade, Crest Trade Pack Crate, and most recently, the Dragonling battle pet, to name but a few.   I came from a F2P game that made tons of money from their cash shop, which contained only cosmetic items that gave absolutely no in-game advantage other than different skins for your items. The marketplace items in this game can give players an in-game advantage. Some of the items are tradeable, thus available through the auction house to players who are not paying. Still: if you pay, you can get an in-game advantage, be it gold, or buffs that players who don't pay can not acquire."

But yeah if they was used more then for now yes. But xlgames wont nerf it cause pet gear aperantly should make all pets more balanced.

You are looking at one small aspect that no one complains about and saying that's the only complaint we have.  The best 16x16 farms are on the marketplace, the best trade pack storage for ships is on the marketplace, the wagon upgrades, the land expansions, the longboard upgrades, all high-end storage containers, inventory expansions, etc...  The items people really want are all on the marketplace.  APEX is not the issue and it never has been.  Many crafted/farmed items have been grossly devalued by Real-Money items countless times.  If the players really need more of something then they put it on the Marketplace.  That's the P2W issue."

Can't u craft equaly good one ? I think u can even craft a better crate down the line.  Can't say anything about the hauler. But i will get it through apex. With 1-2 weeks work.  Land expansion can be crafted i think from same place where u craft ur taxes.  Longboard upgrade is crafted with TS logs 15 of em.  U mean chests for ur house ? U can craft them np i have crafted a lot of em.  Inventory is a convenience so ofc that is in the cash shop. Convenience is always in tge cashshop.  The fact that u can sell almost all if not all items from cashshop and get apex makes it less if not pay to win.  And note i said I said ""I don't see how anything else"" a complete subjective thing implying only my point of view no one else point of view. So don't come here and say that i said that what i wrote is everyones opinion when i clearly said that I don't see.

The rest i just said u could craft or that i was unsure if u could craft it cause i have not ben interested in thise aspect yet as i only do what i feel i want to improve. And if y can craft em then that eliminates the p2w aspect. As u can get a equaly good or better one from crafting. So u cant buy something that is a ""free win"" button."

It cannot be placed on any ship (Clippers, for example) and you have to craft the highest tier in order to weigh the same as the marketplace one.  I didn't address this because it's far too obvious and was a waste of time to address every single item you mentioned.  It's a bit difficult to decode your lazy and haphazard typing for your second paragraph as well.  Yes the hauler is yet another Pay2Win example but I don't get why you are still defending crafters losing profits directly because of the marketplace directly driving down the prices of crafted items."

There are many valid criticisms for archeage but ""p2w"" and ""dead game"" are neither.  I can think of a handful of mmo's that offer less incentive for free players as well as mmos which have had much much less lasting ability.  The apex system allows any free player to access nearly everything in the game without paying a dime.  I utilize this and find it quite beneficial.  As far as a dead game?  Certainly less people than when it was new but far more populated than many other mmos.  Again i feel most of the complaints are people venting because they made poor decisions like exploiting bugs, buying gold, regrading things that have a 95% chance to break, spending money when they could have done the same thing freely with knowledge of the game."

They can't ""undo"" that. Say they stop selling items that can be turned directly into gold altogether; the whales will be effectively frozen with amazing gear, the baby whales will be stuck with better gear than most, and it still does nothing to address the fact that people who never could afford to buy in anyway are still stuck with the same shitty system of advancement.   It would also cripple the revenue for the game, which is not what any business wants of course.

That IS in every mmo I have ever played. However, land-bots or people using 3rd party software to claim land from 20 or so people attempting the same demo have kind of reproduced that ""when the fat lady sings"" finale moment for me.  But please, hear me out. I played in Beta & Launch, right up to December when an Apex exploit got my account banned for no reason other than I had apparently purchased some ill-gotten Apex from the AH. Granted I sent a ticket and they unbanned my account but I was a Guild leader at the time and 3 days gone made me so upset that my husband and I both left the game.   Cue 1.7. We start getting emails from Trion that are hard to ignore; changes to so many game aspects, Patron bonuses, ect. We decide to give it another shot. We start playing again in May/April. We have been playing since. But for all the excitement we experienced for the first few months, we have also experienced some of the same issues that we encountered previously. Exploits everywhere, accidental bannings of other players  accounts, deletion of items by mistake, ect.   And then there was the land botters. My, God! For two months, myself and a handful of Guild mates and other players would camp these Demos. EVERY SINGLE TIME the same exact bot/3rd party program user would get the land! His name was Wiez. Every. Fucking. Time.   My last breaking point was when that bastard took two of the plots, each adjacent to my myself and my husband's houses/farms from again, at least 10 people waiting to try for it. He then proceeded to build them into 1 16x16 enhanced farm, and another 16x16 house. The farm he sold for 1100g and the house 700. That's when I got curious.   I hopped on my beautiful credit-purchased horse Strawberry, and toured all the housing areas I could and would you believe what I discovered? In each housing province, 2-3 houses/farms owned by Wiez, for sale.   Fuck!   I had reported him countless times as had others. I kept receiving response tickets to my claim saying; we are investigating it but you won't be notified of our results.   Of course not. Because no one was doing anything about it.   So yet again I am limping away from a game that I fell in love with and who broke my heart repeatedly. 300+ bucks the first time, over 400+ down the drain this time.   I will miss my Guild, as they are great people. And I will miss my horse. And honestly I will miss the ocean and my beautiful character. But I am done. Again.   Goodbye, Archeage. Trion and XL can have their corrupt players and botters. I have enough shit in my life and not enough money to pay for it all to just disappear like everyone else."
archeage,3c64mv,Livingloveliz,2,Sun Jul 5 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"That damned Wiez. Ive been playing for a month now, decided I wanted to camp a few 16x16 demos in halcy, so I got on 20 minutes before each land was set to demo, there would be 5-10 people camping it as well, but every time, none of the people that were there got it, Wiez somehow got the land even though none of us saw him anywhere near the property. I've been enjoying the game, the sandbox aspect of it is just so good, but the 3 times that happened to me in halcy were the first things that really made me reconsider if I wanted to play. I really don't like the whole pay to win aspect of the game, but I can deal with it. The botters and exploiters, sure, whatever. But the land owning aspect of archeage is one of its most prominent and advertised features. Theres no satisfaction in camping a piece of land and then never actually having a chance at getting it. Sure, you can just go pay for a plot, but half of the fun in getting a piece of land for me was going to be beating others to it. I don't know, I was looking for another mmo, archeage has all the right features, but the management of this game is just so terrible, I don't know how Trion is so helpless. I know there's the typical response to this that, if you don't like it, don't play, you won't be missed, etc. It's just so frustrating looking at the potential this game had and has, but how bad it is in comparison to what it could be. Progression is kind of meaningless when someone can buy that progression. Land grabs are meaningless when you don't have a chance to actually get land. Meh. I don't know.

You can't simultaneously claim they are inflating the market and deflating the market. AS for bans They ban people everyday. I know because they come to reddit and the forums to claim their innocence. What they have said countless times on the forums, reddit, and the live streams is that the bot people get banned and make new accounts and come back. There is no way to stop that. It's their activity that makes them ""catchable"". The use of third party utilities is what hackshield is supposed to catch. The problem is that most bots you see are not bots but actual people. They use ip maskers to hide their source and they are capable of remove the debuff themselves. So how do you differentiate them from normal players? Their spam (these guys usually hit once and reroll with a different ip and are back in the game an hour later) the other way is their transaction history. This usually means they are sending all their gold to just a few sources. These sources are not spamming or farming they are just playing normally and sending mass amounts of gold to the players who buy them. So now you have gms busy fighting off the spam bots and actual bots and a few other ones tracing thousands of transactions to find out if someone legitimately sold a single log for 1k gold or if it was a goldseller transaction. Then how do they prove it? So the real problem is not automated bots but actual humans hiding thousands of transaction in order to launder gold from an endless swarm of bots to a gold buyer.   The other issue is that we don't know how many hundreds of bots get banned a day because we only see the ones that make it through. It doesn't help that tons of dumbasses are reporting legitimate players either out of spite or lack of experience. If we see 10 gold seller spams a day that doesn't mean they didn't ban any it means that anywhere between 0% and 100% got through that day. Which makes posts like this pointless.  Do you think trion security should expose their weaknesses and strengths to you and gold sellers just so you can feel better about the situation? Again it's pointless. These are problems every mmorpg has. Hell they made documentaries about the goldsellers in wow."

Inflation killed off that market by having the sapling prices rise while the prices of archeum itself fell due to bots and boxes.  As for the second issue, it just seems really odd that the bots and gold sellers almost completely fell out of existence for about a month after their mass bannings. I just want to know what is stopping them from continuing the near airtight banning since it seemed to work extremely well. I'm not asking for what specific strategies they're using. I just want to know how it went from something that was working really well to something that seems like its almost not being regulated at all. Most spam messages in chats are auto banned by the system when they receive enough player reports so i'm assuming it's not trinos work right there.  Also it just helps the moral of the playerbase to know that they acknowledge that there's a problem, and are trying to solve it."
archeage,3c64mv,awkwardvlog,10,Sun Jul 5 06:51:42 2015 UTC,"They said countless times on reddit, the forums, and the livestream that every time they find a way to block them they find a new way to get in. There are no permanent solutions or blizzard with it's billions of dollars would have found it first.   You have to realize that what you are asking for is unrealistic. They've acknowledged the problem dozens of times. Why was the last time they acknowledged it not good enough for you (Thursday on the forums)? And if you are unaware of the acknowledgment why didn't you bother looking it up before posting?   Blizzard even went so far as to sue and win against bot makers several years ago. Guess what they still have bots today.   These posts bother the hell out of me because I used to work tech support and people act like you are not doing anything when in fact you are working your ass off. No nobody is going to say anything more than that they are working on it. Why? because it's a huge security breach to say anything else.   They probably got the point when ten million other people complained yesterday and the day before and the day before. It doesn't matter that its better now than it was before. It doesn't matter that it can and will get worse. It only matters that you get your moment to bitch and act like nobody is doing their job when in fact the people in charge are probably working their asses off.

Which means freezing time will be reduced and you can escape before the meteor lands?   Also wearing full cloth will provide more magic defense? I dont know I think a skilled Daggerspell can easily fake or CC bait you into wasting your invulnerability from defense tree and then finish you off with their own sleep/bubble +meteor combo and that is BEFORE you can get close for that knock down and frigid tracks combo

archeage,3c72sh,Ecchii,3,Sun Jul 5 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"It has not changed. Just tested it in-game, proof: http://i.imgur.com/miA4NSF.png  As you can see, I auto attack for around 200-240 damage, but when I gain the Puncture buff, I do 350 damage.  Made sure that Battlerage passive wasn't selected, so it's most definitely from the shortspear I'm using. Slightly related, I found it mildly interesting watching the two passives stack though."
archeage,3c72sh,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:51:24 2015 UTC,holy crap. do the punctures actually stack to shred through up to 4k physical def or does it cap at the 2k??  thats insane if the double puncture actually works.
archeage,3c72sh,WyzeThawt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"I thought at first they stacked too and thought WOAH OP, but then I noticed I crit on that auto attack (Battlerage passive procs only on crit) so that skews the numbers.   Shortspear passive from the Wiki says ""When inflicting damage there is chance to ignore enemies Physical defense"", so based on this wording, this should mean the spear already reduces defense to 0. So unless double puncture causes defense to go negative for more damage (wtf op), Battlerage passive shouldn't cause defense to drop any lower. It can definitely be possible that it just looks higher due to Battlerage passive proc'ing on a crit = higher damage number.  Although in that case, it can also be possible that if you proc both Punctures, the shortspear puncture reduces defense to 0 and you crit through 0 defense vs. only proc'ing Battlerage passive for -2k defense and critting on that.  I'm not at my computer with ArcheAge right now, but I will definitely test it again and edit this post with results when I can.  Edit. So here's what I think is happening (After killing my alt in a ton of duels), Battlerage passive procs when you crit and then applies a debuff which reduces opponent's defense by 2000. If your opponent's defense is less than 2000 and you proc the shortspear passive (ignore all of opponent's defense), it does nothing because you've already -2000'd your opponent's defense to 0.  Now if your Battlerage passive procs and the debuff is on the enemy, against an enemy with 2000+ defense, if your shortspear passive procs, you ignore your enemy's defense, doing more damage (Ex. Against a 5k physical defense person, if you proc shortspear passive, you hit them as if they had no defense regardless if battlerage passive has proc'd or not).   Now, if a shortspear passive already reduces defense to 0, why does it look like the Battlerage+Shortspear passive does more damage together? This is because Battlerage passive procs on -crits-. For example, against a 5k defense enemy, if you only proc Battlerage passive, that means you will hit a crit on them while they have 3k defense. Now if you proc Shortspear passive, you are hitting a crit on them with all their defense ignored, meaning your crit is going to hit harder. Just keep in mind crit procs Battlerage passive. The same effect would happen if you proc'd shortspear passive + crit even without the Battlerage passive selected.  Also another thing that became clear to me is that the shortspear passive does not reduce your enemy's defense. Your next attack ignores their defense, but their defense does not go to 0 (Unlike Battlerage defense decreasing your enemy's defense by 2000). This means in group PVP, Battlerage passive is useful if your team comp is heavy physical damage since it'll reduce your enemy's defense whereas shortspear passive will only make your own attacks stronger. Nothing for your team."

You can grow archeum trees on Auroria. Land on Auroria is hard to get regardless of your server. The mineral water pack is used to water the trees which can be obtained by mining mineral water ores.

archeage,3c6sn2,SirLafayette,4,Sun Jul 5 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"Abolishers & Paladin come to mind as far as 'extremely stress-free'. In fact, playing those two, you may make up your own stress at just how stress-free they are!  Personally, I love hybrids - They're a way to mix it up and go a -little- outside the box:  Hybrids you may want to consider could include Hexblade, Doomlord and Crusader. Still mostly stress-free, but if you want to get creative and try crazy things, that's how you can go try."
archeage,3c6sn2,Schillwing,3,Sun Jul 5 11:59:45 2015 UTC,"Gonna hop on board the Paladin train here. Very versatile class. I am able to win in arena, world pvp, and random duels. I'm tanky enough to go charging in and sustain a 3v1 using redoubt and heals u til I can get back to my group or healer. I have knockdown and stun abilities, as well as decent dps. Best part, even when I'm drunk off my ass the class is simplistic enough to still kick some ass.   If you are skilled in pvp you are able to stand out from other Paladins and be considered a threat. For example Zumwalaa from OPP is one of the best Pallys on Kyrios, he out gears me by about 1k. Since I know the class and play it decently, I'm still able to give him a run for his money. If he is lazy or makes mistakes, I'm able to kill him due to the versatility of the class."

Now they are going to need this by the time server migrations happen to the low pop servers but when exactly this will happen I don't know.  Initially I thought they would let us pay for server transfers before the migration happens to auto balance servers but now that they have said which servers get migrations I highly doubt they will allow transfers before that happens.

archeage,3c3y1e,jungyhasababydickbow,3,Sat Jul 4 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"(remember this is ripped straight from another comment chain so it may appear I'm talking to ghosts)  Perhaps diminishing returns wasn’t the correct choice of words. I do see what you’re saying, but due to the flat damage reduction armor pen sucks in conjunction with endless arrows. In theory, yes, armor pen's relative increase in damage scales linearly, even if the absolute increase in damage does not. Unfortunately, because the absolute increase is lower at higher physical defense values, it is much less effective for low damage skills due to other sources of damage mitigation. It's actually more effective to socket +6 ranged attack over +60 defense pen for endless damage. Here's the math (sorry if things look funny didn't know how to get asterisks to display as text on reddit, also armor pen actually sucks even more than this for endless arrows because most people have over 80 flat damage mitigation):  Two targets:  Target A target has 10,000 physical defense and 80 flat damage reduction from a book (this is wrong, books only give 60, my bad. Still almost all targets have >80 flat damage reduction)  Target B has 1,000 physical defense and 80 flat damage reduction from a book   Damage reduction formula is  (Physical defense/(physical defense+5300))100%  Before applying any physical defense penetration:  Target A has  (10,000/(10,000+5300))100%  = 65.35% physical damage reduction  Target B has   (1,000/(1,000+5300))100%  = 15.87% physical damage reduction  After applying 300 physical defense penetration:  Target A has   (9,700/(9,700+5300))100% = 64.67% physical damage reduction  Target B has   (700/(700+5300))100%  = 11.67% physical damage reduction  Now let’s assume I use endless arrows and my ranged attack is 1,000. I’m not online but Archeage Database says endless arrows deals 50% of ranged attack damage  (I’m pretty sure my tooltip says 60% but I guess that must be because I have promise fists). That means that every endless, before mitigation, should deal on average 500 damage. This formula does not include toughness or any other damage modifiers. If they did it would show armor pen sucks even more with endless.  Damage before physical defense penetration is applied:  Target A (high defense)  (500-(65.35%(500)))-80 = 93.25 damage  Target B (low defense)  (500-(15.687%(500)))-80 = 340.65 damage  Damage after 300 physical defense penetration is applied:  Target A (high defense)  (500-(64.67%(500)))-80 = 96.65 damage  Target B (low defense)  (500-(11.67%(500)))-80 = 361.65 damage  Relative damage increase  (96.65/93.25) = 1.0364 = 3.64% increase in damage on Target A (high defense)  (361.65 /340.65) = 1.0616 = 6.16% increase in damage on Target B (low defense)"
archeage,3c3y1e,WINTER_1S_COMING,3,Sat Jul 4 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"(reply to someone who said defense pen is only bad for low damage attacks such as endless. He's not wrong, however I was suprised to see that ranged attack is better than armor pen even using a theoretical ranged attack with a 1000% modifier.)  Look, you're correct in theory but in practice it doesn't make sense to tell people to gem physical defense pen versus high armor targets. It would make sense if +6 ranged attack lunagems weren't available, but they are better all around.  Here is the math behind it using the same high defense target and a theoretical archer skill that deals 1,000% of ranged attack with a base ranged attack of 1000. I will use five of each gem in the test (+30 ranged attack, +300 defense penetration)  ((10300)-(.6535*10300))-80 = 3488.95 with +30 ranged attack from gems  ((10000)-(.6467*10000))-80 = 3453 with +300 physical defense penetration from gems.  It is wayyy better on lower defense targets though.  (after I posted I decided to actually go do the math... turns out it isn't actually all that much better. Still better though)  ((1000)-(.15687*1000))-80 = 8604.239 damage with +30 ranged attack from gems on low armor target  ((700)-(.1167*700))-80 = 8753 damage with +300 defense penetration from gems"

archeage,3c3y1e,subignition,2,Sat Jul 4 18:08:05 2015 UTC,I think the only thing you're forgetting is that some skills have a base damage in addition to the modifier which will nudge them a little bit on the penetration side.  And then the multiplicative addition of toughness might wonk it out a bit.  I will make a spreadsheet when I have some free time tonight to explore the things brought up in this post and hopefully put them all to rest :v:
archeage,3c3y1e,krazypunk1018,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"Where can I get these damage and defense formulas?  I suspect it may be the case that the optimal solution mixes and matches gems, but without the ability to tweak all the variables that's hard to determine."
archeage,3c3y1e,subignition,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"Optimization depends largely on your base range attack and the target's defense. Considering a base range attack of 1000 is very high most archers would benefit more from flat damage than from armor pen. Even I do and I have a mythic ayanad bow with 718 DPS. If your ranged attack is incredibly high when full potted you might be better off going with defense penetration gems, or of you are BR melee (puncture and high base dmg makes flat less effective).  For archers it would be silly to gem defense pen as flat damage is a much bigger boost to endless(even though it does suck) and a somewhat equal or better boost for all other skills on high armor targets. Especially if your ranged attack isn't very high or if you are fighting well geared targets.  Not sure of the exact damage reduction formula. Reduction from defense has been tested to be ((defense/(defense+5300))100%). Flat damage is applied last, I'm not sure about toughness but it shouldn't affect the results as it applies before flat damage.  There may be some cases where it is more optimal to mix and match gems, but since you would have to be right on the transition threshold for that to be the case it's unlikely that the difference will be significant over socketing one gem, or that many people would be better suited by mixing gems at all."
archeage,3c3y1e,tuieee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:46:46 2015 UTC,Does this work with magic dmg and magic penetration? If so at one point does magic pen work better than magic dmg?
archeage,3c3y1e,Kloonike,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know the exact numbers, again it depends not only on your magic attack but also the defense of your target. If I remember correctly mages also only have +4 flat magic attack big gems so it would likely fall off earlier than with archers. This should work with magic damage and magic penetration as far as I am aware, so if you want to plug in some numbers yourself to get the results it should work fine."

archeage,3c3y1e,Kerrigar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:27:31 2015 UTC,The equations shouldn't be any different you'd just have to plug in different damage values and if you want figure out where toughness factors in. If you look down to my second comment you'll see I also did calculations for a theoretical archer ability that does 1000% of ranged attack just to test the extremes at the other end of the spectrum.

It is incredibly good because it allows your endless to gain enough damage to overcome flat damage reduction to an extent."

Current politics are Red Sky threatened to go to war with Crippling Debt if they didn't do things their way, Crippling Debt doesn't like being threatened and has a KOS policy on Red Sky till they are satisfied, Red Sky hasn't been handling being camped well and Is suffering from member unrest.  Disorderly Conduct is staying out of the fight but are un happy with the actions of Red Sky recently and in turn the conflict.  Then there are a couple smaller guilds like watermelon raiders and hello kitty hit squad.  The big guilds have things they focus on more, CD focuses heavily on PVP while still doing things like CR and Serp. RS focuses more on PVE/ocean PVP to a degree, though CD have started building up their fleet. DC likes to ocean PVP and PvE while leveling their members who are not yet 55. No one is entirely sure what the smaller guilds do.  Pirate faction is fairly strong, they have won mistmerrow a few times, some times with as few as 17 people (mostly CD members) and is recognized as a real threat to east or west faction players attempting to do Morph and other dream ring quest stuff, often requiring guilds to pay the faction for a chance at attempting morph without interruption.

As for weapons, because our ""bread & butter"" skills work a bit different here in EU/NA most people choose not to use 2-handed weapons as the animation for Triple Slash is incredibly slow, they do however work but if you want that ""assassin-feel"" you probably want dual-wield as they make you feel a lot less sluggish and more like a proper rogue!  For armor your best bet will probably be your best bet and your stat allocation would look something like this : STR -> AGI -> STAM (the last 2 are reversible and depends on what your playstyle is)  I hope you'll enjoy your time and if you have any questions, feel free to hit me up!"
archeage,3c4nef,wiirgy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:26:51 2015 UTC,More details on the nerfs pls ? :p Seems interesting.
archeage,3c4nef,Maiqbestplayerworld,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:40:25 2015 UTC,"the combo you wrote was a bit wrong, you should precision strike first and then shadowsmite because precision strike increases critical damage by HUGE amount so if you crit with shadowsmite they are basically dead, but I am going to write my combo I used : Stalker's Mark -> Shadowstep -> Leech -> Overwhelm -> Precision Strike -> Shadowsmite -> Charge -> Triple Slash (run away while triple slashing) -> Behind Enemy Lines -> Tiger Strike and finish him off with triple slash if the guy isn't dead yet, but remember to always stack inspire"

It seems like to show off skill, in which case, the pointless tunnel vision effect on the entire screen destroys any chance at this being a quality video in my opinion. No sound besides the very generic loud dubstep-esque music. However, this sounds a lot like im being an asshole, so to try and move away from cuntishness and more towards legitimate feedback, the video quality itself is great. 10/10 720p/1080p.  Suggestion: Never use effects that just darken the screen for no reason. Highlight the abilities that are being used at the time they are being used by showing a blown up picture of the icon on screen with the video. Helps explain the plays being made at the time without being overly complicated."
archeage,3c41df,bmaut1991,2,Sat Jul 4 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"1) Library 2) Obsidian 3) Depends where you are looking and what you want, but most of the best areas are full"
archeage,3c41df,engi_valk,2,Sat Jul 4 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"Lol clarity  1) Go to diamond shores, you'll find an massive book that has three levels of mobs. Floor 1 is from 50-53, floor 2 is only available when you hit 53. They also house varying levels of mobs, in terms of level and damage type (phys/magic). To level quicker pick up xp pots. There are also daily quests that return very large amounts of xp.   You can also plant Expedia patches that give large amounts of xp when thy mature.   2) You can go ahead and create the new obsidian armours but I'll say that running the serpent is dungeon would be far easier, and free. You may need to level a little more as the lower level you are, the more squishy you'll be thus you'll need to be carried harder through the dungeon. It's very tough for lower levelled and lesser geared players.   In terms of weapons, obsidian is the cheapest way to be more competitive. The materials required can be farmed all over auroria. Check out your folio for more details.   3) The choice housing is the same, depending on how populated your server is, crammed but you'll still find open or expiring plots if you look. PvP zones will always have some spots available.  Land isn't as mad profitable as it was near launch so you may even be able to make a reasonable deal with somebody."

There's no real reason for any gear other than quest gear before 50, but I suppose you could use gold to pay people to power level you, so start whenever.   As far as my 10k estimate. With that you could buy a mediocre delph and regrade to celest and a set of mag gear. Now, depending on class, mag gear could be either terrible or mediocre, so pick a class that it's mediocre on, like DR.   To be really uber geared..

With NA apex around 450-500g each, you can make that calculation. You're looking at around $200 to be viable, $1000 to be damn good and $5000+ to be absolutely ridiculous."
archeage,3c2g21,dante411x,2,Sat Jul 4 03:56:45 2015 UTC,With 200$ i could get about 16k+ gold from buying credits instead of 10k from buying apex.
archeage,3c2g21,Baunk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:02:22 2015 UTC,I just did the apex conversion because it was easy. Sorry. Lazy here. You could definitely knock those numbers way down using credits vs apex to sell stuff

Then I started thinking how far do I want to take spending real money on this game and how far it could take me and cost.   Would you say getting a 16x16 plot of land now is a good idea at lvl30? The class I love right now is Blighter. My goal is when I hit 50 I want to start doing Lib ASAP. What will I need, what's the fastest and cheapest way to accomplish this?"

You don't really need gear to start library, you'll get quest gear that isn't terrible and if you join library groups, you'll level fairly quickly just by doing the daily quests in groups."
archeage,3c2g21,JuicyCardboard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:29:01 2015 UTC,You get a free 16x16 and 8x8 from doing a questline. Once you are level 30 go to the bluesalt brotherhood people in Anvilton Tigerspine and find the quest which tells you to do a trade run. It'll make you do 3 trade runs.
archeage,3c2g21,Swiffles33,2,Sun Jul 5 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"Dont go all out until you are totally happy with your class, experiment, take your time, there is a lot of different play styles out there :)   When you do buy gear but are still not entirely sure, check to see that its not bind on equip gear so you can re sell later down the track. On a side note you might want to buy cheaper gear that allows you to do Serpentis to save a bit of money (arguably equal to Epherium tier) but make sure you get a good weapon for a good buy.  In regards to the lvl 50 - 55 businesses, its not to hard if you can attend the daily library raids for the bosses which give you a significant amount of xp to power through those levels, consume xp buff potions to extend this gain even further. When it comes to pvp as long as you know your class and have the decent gear you can still best level 55's. Level 50 is a good place to start, as long as you know what the level 55 skills do then you can still make worth while decisions."

There's a big difference between ""I have a few hundred bucks I'm willing to spend"" and ""I just won the lottery and I will be king of archeage now"".   What I would advise, more than anything. Before spending any real money (let's say more than $200), get to lvl 50-55, get in a decent guild, experiment with what you want to do in game. There are plenty of ways in game to make gold that would equal to spending $20-100 per day otherwise."

I swap my account to eu for 30 mins a day able to get 6 apex which when you open are global so will be on your na or which ever. Able to afford patron just with my eu account and can do anything I want with the 4 other apex. Mining works well to make money on the throwaway server you want to use.

archeage,3c1aon,jungyhasababydickbow,3,Fri Jul 3 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"i'm not a well geared archer or anything, but form what I saw the problem is the way flat reduction works in this game, it is applied after the % reduction which is totally STUPID, I mean, every game has that it is applied BEFORE the % reduction otherwise players will hit 50 when they should be hitting 100~150 (not that much more but it helps i guess). It should be : (Raw damage - flat reduction) - % reduction and not the other way around What I don't get is, I know it's not worth to be an archer if you have ridiculous amount of gold to be very well geared( like 5k~5.5k gear score), but it is a problem for ""normal"" people with 3~4k GS that's fighting against other ""normal"" people? Or is  meele better at all times?"
archeage,3c1aon,NSUNDU,6,Sat Jul 4 05:25:30 2015 UTC,"Here is a good post on the forums as far as archer life goes, I don't necessarily agree with his suggestions for fixing it but he describes the issue much better than I can. I don't like having constructive discussions I just like to shit talk people and have a mythic bow so I probably shouldn't be the bannerman for adjusting archers.   I am a 4900 gear score stone arrow. I have a celestial delphinad volcano bow, several pieces of delph earth leather, celestial epherium desert breeches (max toughness), and promise fists. I have about a 65% chance to block, evade, parry an attack and 3k buffed toughness in PvP. Physical defense is buffed to 8k, mage defense is buffed to 6.5k. Ranged attack gets buffed to 600. I have 24000 hitpoints.  Prior to the 1.7 patch, I shredded almost everyone in arena. Daggerspells, darkrunners, you name it, I shredded it. Even super tanky abolishers with divine plate and 28k hitpoints I was able to best. This was not because archery was over-powered, or because I was well geared (the gear helped), but because I KNOW HOW TO PLAY MY CLASS. I know when to redoubt, when to drop back, when to use the (former) cast cancel piercing shot. The only class I struggled against were paladins, because self heals were (and still are) absolutely broken in 1v1.  Did I feel archery was balanced? No. I truthfully never have.  Archery has always been a ""you must have uber gear to pull this off"" skill line. I wrecked so many people in PvP from launch on because I was the first on the server with a delph bow (second bow I crafted went all the way up), I was one of the first to level 50, my guild was the first to finish GHA, and I swiped. I got a lot of gear really quickly, and people with super low gear scores I just ate.  As the server began catching up though, it became brutally apparent: I could never just sit on my gear and be happy. I needed to go for better gear, better buffs, more money. I needed my gear gap to be significant over my opponents in order to maintain an advantage. And then players in the other faction swiped much harder than I ever could. Some bought gold from sellers, some bought apex, all got massive armor scores and weapons, and my advantage slimmed. I would still win arenas because, lets face it, they couldn't play their classes. But I started realizing very quickly, archery just couldn't keep up with melee and magic in the long run. And here's why:  Melee has the ability to shred through your armor, and reset itself upon a parry. Which means you just get to spam your stuns, spam your parries, and keep trying if your attacks are parried/evaded.  Magic has the ability to not be bypassed by evasion, parry, block.  As time progressed I started being blocked, evaded, parried a lot more. You see, I only really have 5 damage skills that all have decently long cooldown timers, and even though I have a divine sword with max focus, it's still not usually enough. Out of every fight I would get into in 1v1, I'd be blocked or parried or evaded at least half of my attacks. When I'd fight through a dark runner, I'd need to rely on redoubt and invincibility to not get knocked down and 4 shotted (even with 24k hp). When I'd fight a dagger spell, I needed to guess when the meteor was coming and redoubt right through it so I didn't get bubbled and insidious whispered to my death (because apparently gravity affects whales with hitpoints more??? explain that please). My advantage faded fast and I knew that I couldn't hold my own as an archer anymore. People caught up in gear and my attacks started doing less and less.  And then 1.7 happened.  Classes I could normally fight off were destroying me. Self healers rose, melee gained popularity, and I started losing a lot more. Even with raising my gear score further and further I couldn't keep up. I'm now being destroyed by 3k gear score paladins in cloth, 3k gear score abolishers, and 3k gear score darkrunners. Anyone who has plate armor as well is pretty much game over for me. I just can't damage them.  There is no more gap. Gap closers are a dime a dozen. All of my pvp combat occurs within 8m now. Everyone has toughness now which shreds down the little damage my attacks actually do (since our attacks are on the low end of damage anyway). Everyone has physical defense now. Which further harms my attacks. Even when stacking ranged damage, my melee hits harder. My overwhelm/shadowsmite combo does more damage than my full rotation of arrows. I've almost come to rely on it as my burst in pvp. In open world, I survive very well (from those high mitigations) but I barely hurt anyone. It's come down to me launching snipes into crowds and finding the squishy kid, and then killing him over everyone else. Otherwise, if I guess who is squishy wrongly, I lose my attack rotation and have to wait until they're off cooldown to try again.  Honestly, playing archer for this long has just led me to roll melee. I do way more damage as a melee, farm dungeons and mobs much easier, and kill people much quicker in pvp. I'm actually much more mobile as melee as well, and every time I parry (15% chance) I get to spam my rotation again immediately.  Want to balance archery?  Remove the 8m debuff.  Remove the stun from charged bolt. Re-add the cancel from piercing shot. Re-add bloodthirst generation Change feral mark to be applied to all archery attacks and add a (small) armor penetration bonus for it or a move speed >bonus. Change how focus works and make focus = toughness mitigation Re-add stats to CRAFTED costumes Boost the damage of endless arrows to match triple strike.  Want to balance the rest of pvp? Melee is alright where it is.  Mages need to be SOME of the following: Blockable, evadable, parryable. Fix bubble Reduce cast time if adding block, parry, evade Add more casting interrupts if not.  All need some of the following: Diminishing returns on stuns Shorter ability effects in pvp (sleep, silence, etc) Self heals need to be diminished"

Primeval is one of the best 1's classes in the game because of its versatility.  You can kite a tank forever.  Beating a DR is as simple as Sleep->Concussive.  Beating a shadowblade is easy as hell at 55 because of mirror warp.  A good daggerspell is the hardest thing to beat as a Prime.

Alternatively you could focus on gearing with accessories which ignore enemy defence / get armor pen gems if there is such a thing?   What I'm trying to say is, you could wait for a patch which could see a positive change (who knows when that will occur) or you could manipulate your gear to appeal to the numerous amout of shield bearers that have emerged lately. I also think the trade off between damage and survivability is fair at the moment. I 2H wield and when I crit targets are deleted from the fight, however I am significantly squishier."

If you had read my post or the original forum post with the screenshots you would realize you essentially just agreed with me. The dmg test was against a cleric (vitalism/songcraft/auramancy) in cloth, there is nothing inherently tanky vs physical defense about the class. I can't exactly focus people without shields because anyone who is even remotely decent at the game (pvpwise) uses a shield and may switch off to dual for attack speed.

archeage,3c1aon,soedgy69,2,Sat Jul 4 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps diminishing returns wasn’t the correct choice of words. I do see what you’re saying, but due to the flat damage reduction armor pen sucks in conjunction with endless arrows. In theory, yes, armor pen's relative increase in damage scales linearly, even if the absolute increase in damage does not. Unfortunately, because the absolute increase is lower at higher physical defense values, it is much less effective for low damage skills due to other sources of damage mitigation. It's actually more effective to socket +6 ranged attack over +60 defense pen for endless damage. Here's the math (sorry if things look funny didn't know how to get asterisks to display as texts on reddit, also armor pen actually sucks even more than this for endless arrows because most people have over 80 flat damage mitigation):  Two targets:  Target A target has 10,000 physical defense and 80 flat damage reduction from a book  Target B has 1,000 physical defense and 80 flat damage reduction from a book  Damage reduction formula is  (Physical defense/(physical defense+5300))100%  Before applying any physical defense penetration:  Target A has  (10,000/(10,000+5300))100%  = 65.35% physical damage reduction  Target B has   (1,000/(1,000+5300))100%  = 15.87% physical damage reduction  After applying 300 physical defense penetration:  Target A has   (9,700/(9,700+5300))100% = 64.67% physical damage reduction  Target B has   (700/(700+5300))100%  = 11.67% physical damage reduction  Now let’s assume I use endless arrows and my ranged attack is 1,000. I’m not online but Archeage Database says endless arrows deals 50% of ranged attack damage  (I’m pretty sure my tooltip says 60% but I guess that must be because I have promise fists). That means that every endless, before mitigation, should deal on average 500 damage. This formula does not include toughness or any other damage modifiers. If they did it would show armor pen sucks even more with endless.  Damage before physical defense penetration is applied:  Target A (high defense)  (500-(65.35%(500)))-80 = 93.25 damage  Target B (low defense)  (500-(15.687%(500)))-80 = 340.65 damage  Damage after 300 physical defense penetration is applied:  Target A (high defense)  (500-(64.67%(500)))-80 = 96.65 damage  Target B (low defense)  (500-(11.67%(500)))-80 = 361.65 damage  Relative damage increase  (96.65/93.25) = 1.0364 = 3.64% increase in damage on Target A (high defense)  (361.65 /340.65) = 1.0616 = 6.16% increase in damage on Target B (low defense)"
archeage,3c1aon,xmatt24,2,Sat Jul 4 07:04:30 2015 UTC,"you're showing why flat damage reduction is unfair to rapid, less damaging attacks, in comparison to large ones  and yes, the higher defense you have, the lower the attack hits for, and the more % of the damage book removes  this is separate from the point i was making and i agree with 100%  the total amount of base damage you can take increases linearly as you increase/decrease armor  the flat reduction is the problem that starts to wonk it out when it becomes a significant percent of the leftover damage  if it maybe makes you feel a little better, in 1.8 you can only have either unstoppable force or the dmg reduction spellbook, so only healers will be impossible to kill because everyone else likes to see big numbers"
archeage,3c1aon,soedgy69,2,Sat Jul 4 07:30:29 2015 UTC,"Look, you're correct in theory but in practice it doesn't make sense to tell people to gem physical defense pen versus high armor targets. It would make sense if +6 ranged attack lunagems weren't available, but they are better all around.  Here is the math behind it using the same high defense target and a theoretical archer skill that deals 1,000% of ranged attack with a base ranged attack of 1000. I will use five of each gem in the test (+30 ranged attack, +300 defense penetration)  ((10300)-(.6535*10300))-80 = 3488.95 with +30 ranged attack from gems  ((10000)-(.6467*10000))-80 = 3453 with +300 physical defense penetration from gems.  It is wayyy better on lower defense targets though."

archeage,3c1aon,Linkd3th,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:27:54 2015 UTC,If an archer can sustain damage and out kite a 1v1 it can be viable. If you up the damage/burst and to make it an arena dps race it becomes op in world pvp beacuse you have groups of archers melting anything that gets near them from range. Archers doing just okay damage like they are now is preferable to them killing well geared players in a few rotations
archeage,3c1aon,GoldenGonzo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, considering that BR and Sorcery can melt an opponent in half a rotation, it doesn't seem that unreasonable that Archery can do it in 3-4. Even 4-5 would be reasonable. Right now I'd say it's more about 8-10 rotations depending on the opponent's gear of course."
archeage,3c1aon,TankinJenkins,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:43:11 2015 UTC,Well geared players are not dropping in one rotation to br or sorc and those cannot be done from range before you even commit to engage

archeage,3c1wxn,FlippehFishes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:03:57 2015 UTC,Ranger is somewhat viable but it's extremely mana hungry.
archeage,3c1wxn,DHTs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:03:47 2015 UTC,I played ranger for a bit as and I can say it's a very weak class. You rely on free runner and drop back for mobility which won't be enough to save you. No cc breaks either. Stone arrow can get away with this since they have defense tree and a shield. Also you are more likely to get bursted down before you can use vitalism to heal yourself.   Healing has a high mana cost which doesn't help with how mana hunger archers are already. You would need to run sub optimal gear to help to heal yourself always and that would lower your damage.  If you want to play a healing archer druid would be better since you have survivability  which then allows you to heal and out sustain your opponent. Damage won't be as high since you lose shadowplay but you should be healthy throughout the fight. Thus class is very immobile so don't play druid in wars or RvR.
archeage,3c1wxn,the_boozle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:04:04 2015 UTC,"Most classes are viable, honestly. The problem with Ranger is that it's mana hungry, it lacks the mobility of a Primeval or the sturdiness of a Stone Arrow or a Druid, and Vitalism just doesn't offer much in the realm of CC breaks/immunity outside of Mirror Light. When all that's said and done though, gearing a Ranger wouldn't be very different from gearing any other archer class. You're going to need an Obsidian Shortspear though, and you may want to consider whether or not you want to dual wield with an off-hand stat stick or use a shield."
archeage,3c1wxn,iBlackguard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:03:32 2015 UTC,Just play the class that you want to play.  Each has there plus and minuses.    Learn the ins and outs of that class.  Don't play a certain class just cause everyone else is because of OP.  Master the class you want to play and you will hold your own in combating

What if those large group of players do feel like you are being spammy? What if they think your method of discussion is polluting the chat channel?

People are allowed to maintain whatever personalities they wish to, as long as they're not abusing a bug, or abusing an exploit. Point is, no spamming was done. The chat ban occurred whilst me responding to simple questions from neutral guilds such as ""We need assistance as Hanure, CAD Members are killing us."" I promptly responded just as I always do, that if anybody from the East side was getting griefed by CAD members in Auroria or the sea (Since we're pirates) to please give us (<REST>) a heads up, and we'd come assist.

I would understand your point, if you would only chat and shout about inconvenient truths about certain guilds and individuals like those, who actually exploit the game etc. But you are one of the persons on our server, who sometimes indeed spam the /f or /sh chat with disrespectful and vulgar insults, which in my eyes is wrong."

You have obviously had plenty of options to block me if you find whatever it is I post as disrespectful or vulgar. Again, the button to do so is block, not report spam. That's all this post is about.

Being respect- and mindful of others has nothing to do with this being a sandbox game, don't use that as an excuse to insult people. No idea, if you act and talk like that in real life, but where I come from people respect each other or face the consequences. I don't hold a personal grudge against you since you never insulted me and since you also never insulted personal friends from me I never reported you for spam, but even if this is a sandbox game, it's still not right to verbally abuse others."

archeage,3bzzap,Workaholico,4,Fri Jul 3 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"The best naval warfare classes would definitely be tanky classes or ones that buff your cannoneers to keep them alive. Tanky classes like Shadowknight, Abolisher or Skullknight can board another boat and CC their entire non-cannon force with allows an opportunity to absolutely decimate them with their own cannons. On top of this, boarding a boat causes a lot of panic to the cannoneers on that boat which might make them hop off the cannon, dropping the evasion buff.   If you're not too fond of getting into the combat directly, I'd recommend spellsinger because if you get a magic circled + zeal'd arc lightning off into someone, you will literally hit them for 10k+. On top of this, the lightning debuff spreads like a skittle dick-inducing STD on boats. Everyone on the boat will be suffers from 200-500 magic damage ticks which combined with cannon shots should kill quite a few. Spellsinger is extremely powerful right now, strong enough to kill their healers for sure.  If you'd rather be an archer, I would recommend bastion, druid or primeval. Bastion still has some mobility while having inspiration stacks and abolisher-like tankiness. Druid is Bastion without inspiration stacks or mobility but instead, you can off-heal people on your boat. Primeval is just a very mobile archer that can be used to chase people down once the boat is demolished as well as they have the highest movespeed so getting packs from the bottom of the ocean can be down quickly without dahuta's."

archeage,3bzzap,Villentrenmerth,3,Fri Jul 3 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should really be focusing on the Damage dealing as a Naval class. If you consider equal battle of GvG for example you can apply standard role distribution: Tanks, DPS, Healers.  On the sea, you can't apply standard tactics, I wouldn't ever use Archery for DPS, as you can see in this thread:   https://www.reddit.com/r/archeage/comments/3bwxuw/trion_plz_take_a_look_at_this_thread_and_rundown/   Where a guy with Ayanad Mythic Bow complains his spells deal low damage.  Soulbow is built to keep enemies at bay, and restore HP of your crew. Equipped with leather armor there is nothing enemies can do to board your ship.  One mentioned Sorcery as primary damage in the naval combat, which basically makes any Abolisher to laugh at your spellcasters when he proceeds to Triple Slash your squishy asses to death. Only Physical Damage is unavoidable unless they use Invincibility/Redoubt, which hinders their movement."

Let me cast this CC and heal myself and my friends back to full HP.""  Vitalism counters all classes without Nuke. Witchcraft helps to counter classes with nuke (via CC), Archery is there to use long cooldowns like Boneyard, Concussive Arrow, Missile Rain and Snipe."

Cabalist would work well, due to having witchcraft and defense, while being tanky and being able to do damage with sorcery. Fear, fortress, dahuta's breath makes excellent crowd control.  If you'd like mobility you can try Enigmatist (Sorcery, Shadowplay, Auramancy) which is pretty much a mage darkrunner."
archeage,3bzzap,Dopethulhu,3,Fri Jul 3 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"Spellsinger is a jack of damage and not much else. It lacks cc, cc break, and general utility. You're going to get more mileage on the ocean with witchcraft cc than song craft damage.   That being said, archery is stronger in Ocean combat than sorcery is because it is mostly instant casts and has mobility so LoS isn't as much of an issue."

archeage,3bzzap,FlippehFishes,2,Fri Jul 3 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a Spellsinger, the class you're asking about. The damage is great but on the ocean the cast times can be a pain with the boats causing LoS issues. An archer can just outkite me and if a melee gap closes to me I have no defenses other than drop back to evade them.  If you're looking for a naval mage class I would suggest something with Witchcraft first for the AoE fear and knockback. Second I would suggest shadowplay because shadowstep is very helpful for getting on ships. Daggerspell is probably your best bet but if you're set on Spellsinger damage I would suggest Lamentor instead."

archeage,3c1je4,Meloetta,2,Sat Jul 4 08:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not very friendly to people who want to play without spending a dime. There's fun to be had, but it's much easier to spend 15 dollars on the game (think of it as buying the game), and use the labor, loyalty, and various other perks to buy APEX for the rest of the game.  If it was super easy to be F2P for everyone, everyone would be."

When the game first launched, the opinion of most was to buy the first month sub, which will make making the money for Apex much easier."
archeage,3c1je4,WretchedChild06,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:26:54 2015 UTC,I'd say just buy one month of Patron and then you should be able to get more money because you'll have the labor to do it. If your high enough lvl you can sell honor and just do Crimson Rift and Grimgrast Rift that'll be 1k honor a day and 3-4khonor sell for around 250-350+ gold. there are loads of options to getting money not just trade runs.:)

archeage,3c1je4,DHTs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:41:03 2015 UTC,Focus on leveling and breakdown all your old equipment for archeum and sell it. Sunlight archeum (from weapons) sells for quite a bit. Once you have your initial 2 apex it becomes significantly easier to maintain it.
archeage,3c1je4,GrowlingMoose,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:16:58 2015 UTC,Invest on a hauler first. It will save you tons of time and will actually make the money back really quick. Hauler allows you to take 7 packs at a time > easier money > easier to get APEX in the future.

archeage,3c1je4,IIReignManII,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:20:36 2015 UTC,I bought patron ONCE way back in October and eventually found myself maintaining 4 accounts with in game gold using apex to maintain patron up until the past month where I quit entirely....
archeage,3c1je4,wagwanimal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"All this advice is horrible...If you dont have patron, you dont have any sort of farm hauler, or land...the absolute best way you can save up gold to get Apex is farming Princes Coinpurses.  Kill the lvl 51 mobs in Diamond shores, open all the bags/purses/safes you can until you have 0 labor.  Sell everything you get in the purses on the AH...when you run out of labor just keep farming and saving them up, that way when you regenerate more labor you just open some more.  Absolutely easiest way to make gold  Also, make an EU alt, and just use it to mine or something...you can sell the stone until you have enough gold for an APEX and then use the credits from it on your NA account...the accounts are linked but they have seperate labor pools...this is a lot slower but costs abolutely nothing and is supplemental"

Any decent budget GPU like AMD's R7 260X / R9 270 or Nvidia's GTX 750/ 750 Ti should do.  If you want to play newer or more demanding games, consider getting a better GPU.

Dont skimp here.  Then, get a bronze or better rated power supply.  This saves many headaches later.  Any SSD gives amazing results, budget in this category is just fine.  You can get a smallish one and just install games on it, using an old drive for the OS.   Games that sort through 25 gigs of data are really helped by this for loading times.

So far the only performance issues I've had are in veerryy crowded fights (drops to 20'ish fps in halcy on kyrios) which is just my cpu hitting it's limit (no OC) which is definitely something to take into account.

archeage,3bx7gr,Sociopathix,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"Transfers would've solved all of this. The best way to handle it would have been to give everyone who owned property already their fully-built deeds back (place the deed on another location and it's already built), and allow them to transfer off to another server (open only the lower population servers from the remaining existing ones).  Analyze later and see which servers need to be closed, and close one of them at a time until there's a healthy population everywhere. You could even incentivize transferring to a server that needs more population by saying, ""We're having an event on X server to welcome new players."" Make the event available to everyone on that server so the people already playing there aren't screwed over.  There were just so many better alternatives to what is going on now. And they can't say, ""Oh, transfers are just too complicated!"" No, they're not. They may be difficult for a skeleton staff to complete easily, but they're far from impossible. And I say skeleton staff because it seems like there's maybe 10 people dedicated to running this MMO."

archeage,3bx7gr,Sociopathix,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:20:33 2015 UTC,Chargeback =/= refund.  Refunds are up to Trion. Chargebacks are up to the banks/credit card companies.
archeage,3bx7gr,awkwardvlog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:25:01 2015 UTC,"Thats not accurate. The chargeback is issued by the card company and can be disputed by the company in question. In my state MT it's illegal to make chargebacks when you've used the service. It's called ""Theft of service"" It includes any thing that doesn't have a physical object. Subscriptions, memberships, ordering pizza and not paying for it. All these types of things fall under it. So you can go with the herd and pretend its a cure all but in reality the only reason people are getting charge backs is because Trion is allowing them to. If you are banking on playing until you get bored and then doing a charge back you may well get it. But you could also end up in hot water as well."
archeage,3bx7gr,Sociopathix,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"It usually is illegal, yes. Where it's not theft of service, it's credit card fraud. But that doesn't mean charges are ever filed; in a vast majority of cases, charges are never filed and investigations never take place.  'can be disputed' does not mean Trion has the final say. The credit card companies/banks are still the final word on the matter. The reason they are getting chargebacks is because either Trion did not dispute it or Trion's argument was viewed by the banks/credit card companies to be insufficient during their review. (Which, knowing Trion, they probably don't even reply to these inquiries.)  I wouldn't do chargebacks, but that doesn't mean a vast number of people haven't successfully done so and will continue to do so. And that's why the word 'Forever' doesn't work in your comment; it's already been proven not to be true.  It's not a matter of legal liability. It's a matter of what has and what will occur. (And what will likely occur based upon past precedent, which is receiving chargebacks without prosecution.)"

archeage,3bwxuw,jungyhasababydickbow,3,Thu Jul 2 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am MrPicklez.  Yes, defense is strong, but that wasn't the purpose of the post. If Ayaka had respecced templar (she is cleric in these pics) the low damage would make you cry. Rather I posted this to show you don't need to play a tanky class in this game to take no damage from spammable skills like endless. You can play a darkrunner and if you use a shield, put in a few gems and go full toughness  you'll still do insane damage and be incredibly tanky. There is no tradeoff. If someone has defense I just tab target to the next guy. If I target a darkrunner and am hitting them for 50 endless simply because of a shield and being able to gem, that seems like a bit of an issue. Archers are much more affected by this than most classes because of the low base damage and the fact that endless is supposed to be the sustained dps source. I feel so bad for archers that don't have the bow I have.  You have to understand that I have a mythic ayanad bow so yes, my damage is stupid. I 2-3 shot about 95% of people on my server. Those people are undergeared, and to be honest I think that archery damage should be lower on undergeared people and raised on geared people (geared, not tanky, ie not templar but a class w/o defense and shit). It's silly how much damage I do to people who are undergeared. It's also silly how little damage I do to people who are actually geared properly.  Everyone in FC laughs at the damage the WTF archers do (well, they did. Many members are undergeared as well now), simply because they can't do shit for damage. When zazen's jumps someone it's a clusterfuck, or any geared melee for that matter even if not playing DR. If slippy or sweetness shoot at someone people crack up (slippy has a legendary t6 bow, so his bow is no fucking joke). I used to have full focus to do a bit of extra damage on people as archer but there is really no point, I died in 2 hits and did maybe 10% more damage. Now I die in 200 hits and do 10% less damage. Toughness is just so much better all around. Im sure geared people on the west laugh at my damage too. Watch the siege video of slippy as prime jumping around on the outskirts doing 0 damage and focusing Ayaka (a cleric, ie no defense) 70% of the time, it's hilariously sad. It's just archer life guys.  It is true though, endless arrows and mana stars suck terribly on anyone who can gear their character correctly simply because of the way damage mitigation is applied. Hopefully the upcoming changes to pots help alleviate this somewhat, but it's doubtful. There is really no reason to pop an unstoppable force over a brick wall in important PvP if you are geared. I mean it adds what, 8% more ranged attack for me?"
archeage,3bwxuw,jungyhasababydickbow,2,Fri Jul 3 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"Here is a good post on the forums as far as archer life goes, don't necessarily agree with his suggestions for fixing it but he describes the issue much better than I can. I don't like having constructive discussions I just like to shit talk people and have a mythic bow so I probably shouldn't be the bannerman for adjusting archers.   I am a 4900 gear score stone arrow. I have a celestial delphinad volcano bow, several pieces of delph earth leather, celestial epherium desert breeches (max toughness), and promise fists. I have about a 65% chance to block, evade, parry an attack and 3k buffed toughness in PvP. Physical defense is buffed to 8k, mage defense is buffed to 6.5k. Ranged attack gets buffed to 600. I have 24000 hitpoints.  Prior to the 1.7 patch, I shredded almost everyone in arena. Daggerspells, darkrunners, you name it, I shredded it. Even super tanky abolishers with divine plate and 28k hitpoints I was able to best. This was not because archery was over-powered, or because I was well geared (the gear helped), but because I KNOW HOW TO PLAY MY CLASS. I know when to redoubt, when to drop back, when to use the (former) cast cancel piercing shot. The only class I struggled against were paladins, because self heals were (and still are) absolutely broken in 1v1.  Did I feel archery was balanced? No. I truthfully never have.  Archery has always been a ""you must have uber gear to pull this off"" skill line. I wrecked so many people in PvP from launch on because I was the first on the server with a delph bow (second bow I crafted went all the way up), I was one of the first to level 50, my guild was the first to finish GHA, and I swiped. I got a lot of gear really quickly, and people with super low gear scores I just ate.  As the server began catching up though, it became brutally apparent: I could never just sit on my gear and be happy. I needed to go for better gear, better buffs, more money. I needed my gear gap to be significant over my opponents in order to maintain an advantage. And then players in the other faction swiped much harder than I ever could. Some bought gold from sellers, some bought apex, all got massive armor scores and weapons, and my advantage slimmed. I would still win arenas because, lets face it, they couldn't play their classes. But I started realizing very quickly, archery just couldn't keep up with melee and magic in the long run. And here's why:  Melee has the ability to shred through your armor, and reset itself upon a parry. Which means you just get to spam your stuns, spam your parries, and keep trying if your attacks are parried/evaded.  Magic has the ability to not be bypassed by evasion, parry, block.  As time progressed I started being blocked, evaded, parried a lot more. You see, I only really have 5 damage skills that all have decently long cooldown timers, and even though I have a divine sword with max focus, it's still not usually enough. Out of every fight I would get into in 1v1, I'd be blocked or parried or evaded at least half of my attacks. When I'd fight through a dark runner, I'd need to rely on redoubt and invincibility to not get knocked down and 4 shotted (even with 24k hp). When I'd fight a dagger spell, I needed to guess when the meteor was coming and redoubt right through it so I didn't get bubbled and insidious whispered to my death (because apparently gravity affects whales with hitpoints more??? explain that please). My advantage faded fast and I knew that I couldn't hold my own as an archer anymore. People caught up in gear and my attacks started doing less and less.  And then 1.7 happened.  Classes I could normally fight off were destroying me. Self healers rose, melee gained popularity, and I started losing a lot more. Even with raising my gear score further and further I couldn't keep up. I'm now being destroyed by 3k gear score paladins in cloth, 3k gear score abolishers, and 3k gear score darkrunners. Anyone who has plate armor as well is pretty much game over for me. I just can't damage them.  There is no more gap. Gap closers are a dime a dozen. All of my pvp combat occurs within 8m now. Everyone has toughness now which shreds down the little damage my attacks actually do (since our attacks are on the low end of damage anyway). Everyone has physical defense now. Which further harms my attacks. Even when stacking ranged damage, my melee hits harder. My overwhelm/shadowsmite combo does more damage than my full rotation of arrows. I've almost come to rely on it as my burst in pvp. In open world, I survive very well (from those high mitigations) but I barely hurt anyone. It's come down to me launching snipes into crowds and finding the squishy kid, and then killing him over everyone else. Otherwise, if I guess who is squishy wrongly, I lose my attack rotation and have to wait until they're off cooldown to try again.  Honestly, playing archer for this long has just led me to roll melee. I do way more damage as a melee, farm dungeons and mobs much easier, and kill people much quicker in pvp. I'm actually much more mobile as melee as well, and every time I parry (15% chance) I get to spam my rotation again immediately.  Want to balance archery?  Remove the 8m debuff.  Remove the stun from charged bolt. Re-add the cancel from piercing shot. Re-add bloodthirst generation Change feral mark to be applied to all archery attacks and add a (small) armor penetration bonus for it or a move speed >bonus. Change how focus works and make focus = toughness mitigation Re-add stats to CRAFTED costumes Boost the damage of endless arrows to match triple strike.  Want to balance the rest of pvp? Melee is alright where it is.  Mages need to be SOME of the following: Blockable, evadable, parryable. Fix bubble Reduce cast time if adding block, parry, evade Add more casting interrupts if not.  All need some of the following: Diminishing returns on stuns Shorter ability effects in pvp (sleep, silence, etc) Self heals need to be diminished"

archeage,3bwxuw,Irelia95,0,Fri Jul 3 08:08:28 2015 UTC,7.4k defense (with pot) and 1k Toughness - I still get hit by 14k Snipe crits at abyssal...
archeage,3bwxuw,Lelouch133,3,Thu Jul 2 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"1k toughness is really nothing though. You can achieve that with just a frost on chest/legs and a single gem in legs.  The real issue comes when you're shooting someone with full gems and you do no damage (with BiS bow,) vs. battle rage or sorcery still doing acceptable damage with an OKAY weapon."
archeage,3bwxuw,Sociopathix,0,Thu Jul 2 22:16:55 2015 UTC,"My legs aren't t4 yet so I haven't really put much on it.  Lunafrost on feet + legs + 5x Lunagems + Honor cloak would give ma a total of 2935 Toughness (the 3% dmg reduction on chest is superior)  Assuming the formula on the offical forum is correct [toughness reduction = toughness / (toughness + 8000)] I would get a total of 26.8% dmg reduction.  I'm currently at 970 Toughness which would give me 10.8% dmg reduction,  thats 15% difference - I would still get over 10k Snipe dmg :)  that sorcery deals more dmg is pretty obvious ~ most people try to get their physical defense up, so they lack magic defense (+ Mages got so many penetration items....)"

It's unfortunate that wearing high pdef gear doesn't allow you to melt my face off. I'm so so sorry.  Defense tree is for sustain. You're not supposed to be able to burst down a tank easily. And now that we don't have crap gear anymore, Defense is actually worth it."
archeage,3bwxuw,Metsuro,6,Fri Jul 3 00:09:51 2015 UTC,Problem with defence is that you don't have to be a 'tank' to survive for unreal amounts of time anymore.

The damage disparity done against lowbies and ungeared people is ridiculous compared to developed and well-geared characters."

Sure, archery may not be op against plate, but I wanna see those same screenshots vs a cleric in full cloth.   Actually, I have to edit this. That's full celestial plate plus shield and op says that the target has at least 3k toughness. Since FC, I'm going to assume that it's either high tier obsidian or delph+ plate. And that's not even mentioning/wondering just what that shield is. I'm pretty damn happy that a mythic ayanad bow doesn't at least one shot ppl in plate. If he tried that with me, in t4 obs cloth (all celestial) with 2k toughness and a t3 celest obs shield, I'd bet that I would take 700-1000 damage per hit of those endless arrows."

archeage,3bwxuw,Lelouch133,3,Thu Jul 2 21:19:35 2015 UTC,You're most likely not hitting the same level of tank. I have a divine t5 obsidian bow and 3 piece obsidian 4 piece epherium gale. It's a good day if my charged bolts hit for 2k against anyone 4000gs+ with a shield or plate armor. I have 1100 armor pen. Rotation doesn't really matter because he's simply showing the damage of charged bolt.
archeage,3bwxuw,Baunk,-2,Thu Jul 2 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think that op is just bad I have been on the receiving end of the damage of lesser geared archers and their damage is fine, yes it is not darkrunner damage but that's not what the class is. It's sustained dps that generally kites so you can attack for free from long range whereas melee need to be up close to you because of this you have less damage. Yeah let's make archers hit like a truck from nearly 30m away."
archeage,3bwxuw,Lelouch133,-2,Fri Jul 3 01:33:28 2015 UTC,So ur shooing plate/shield and whine...  cann we get a mage buff then? hf killing a decent healer as a mage...

archeage,3bwxuw,incifan,0,Fri Jul 3 12:26:23 2015 UTC,At least melee doesnt have 30 meter range. But I get your point. Battlerage is TOO OP!
archeage,3bwxuw,FlippehFishes,2,Fri Jul 3 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"they dont have 30 meter range i'll give you that. But they do have enough gapclosers to close those 30 meters and then some. I can agree that melee should probably deal a lot of dmg but what they shouldnt be able to do is close the gap indefinitely. Peoples argument to why archers shouldnt deal so much dmg is because they have a lot of range and can kite, problem is, no one can kite melee in this game."
archeage,3bwxuw,AggressionSsb,3,Fri Jul 3 14:36:34 2015 UTC,I agree BR has so many gapclosers it gets kinda hard to kite after you use your backflip and teleport. BR has charge/tiger strike/teleport/backflip/behind enemylines (about 50-60m worth of distance all combined were as archers with teleport and backflip have 30m)
archeage,3bwxuw,Faddler,-2,Fri Jul 3 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Boohoo, i am spamming Endless Arrows and it does not one shot someone. Please Fix."
archeage,3bwxuw,O115,2,Fri Jul 3 12:02:32 2015 UTC,"Have you even played archer before? He has BiS bow for archer + almost 900agi UNBUFFED and is still doing fuck all damage. But if he were a darkrunner using celest t3 obsidian gear (far worse then what he has on his archer) using a basic battlerage attack he would do far more dmg. Right now archeage has been nerfed so much even with super OP p2w gear you cant even hurt people. Also if you looked at the 3rd pic he crit a charged bolt for 15,400 dmg but because the person had decently slotted gear he only did about 2k dmg."
archeage,3bwxuw,Faddler,-5,Fri Jul 3 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"Archers can out kite anyone in existence. How is this unfair? When I'm a mage, I can't even fucking hit him."
archeage,3bwxuw,O115,9,Thu Jul 2 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"It's unfair because the best bow in the game causes you to hit for 2k crits on people in celestial delphinad gear + shield with an ability on a 9 second cooldown. Sure you can kite, but melees have so many gap closers that kiting doesn't matter anymore really. Archers do much less damage than mages, and with the rise of spellsingers and enigmatists they don't even have much more mobility. I play spellsinger most of the time and gods whip is absolutely retarded. I have 3500gs+ when I'm in my archer set and it's actually awful. I've seen T3 hasla mages with gods whip take a shit on people harder than an archer can against a shield."
archeage,3bwxuw,80WillPower08,-2,Thu Jul 2 22:05:20 2015 UTC,For the charged bolts it doesnt even show the target at the time could have more buffs then the first picture.so there is no point really based on the info given you could just as easily say damage is so bad but in reality the target could have full buffed had stuff that cuts damage in half
archeage,3bwxuw,xmatt24,5,Thu Jul 2 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that the pictures couldn't have been inaccurate however, when I play with archery I notice the exact same thing. Comparing it to an equally mobile mage class it shows that archery really does suck monkey balls."
archeage,3bwxuw,onzaurusrex,-3,Thu Jul 2 23:13:06 2015 UTC,What are you comparing exactly? Charged bolt to god's whip? its hard to compare especially because most mage skills have cast times the one thing i can agree on though is that magic has an advantage against any type of physical damage just due to the fact it cant be blocked parried or evaded
archeage,3bwxuw,xmatt24,4,Thu Jul 2 23:18:12 2015 UTC,anything with aura+battle catches us and then stomps us into the ground... kiting only works when you can out maneuver your opponent :/
archeage,3bwxuw,onzaurusrex,2,Thu Jul 2 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and considering that most melee characters are rolling Darkrunner at the moment, it's looking like I won't have any choice but to roll Primeval if I want to continue playing Archery. You can't kite anything with Auramancy without having it yourself."
archeage,3bwxuw,awkwardvlog,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:15 2015 UTC,"Actually thats not correct if you only consider 1v1,  since Darkrunner have at least 2 more gapclosers then you would have as Primeval, the best classes for archer are now Bastion, Druid, and Stonearrow"
archeage,3bwxuw,FlippehFishes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"I am currently rolling a Stone Arrow, have been since I first started playing so I like to believe that I am experienced and at least somewhat capable at the class. That being said, 95% of the time if a Darkrunner attacks me, I will be dead before the stun/trip CC ends. If I manage to pop Redoubt before I'm tripped (which isn't likely considering any Darkrunner who isn't unloading his combo is hiding in stealth right before they attack), I might survive long enough to get off a Bull Rush > Shield Slam (or w/e the order is) > Boastful Roar > Drop Back. Great, now I've got some distance.. except I don't. The moment they get up, they'll teleport straight to my face and by that time, Redoubt will have expired but their combo is back up and I'm as good as dead :). Auramancy needs a hard nerf. Whoever thought to give it a second teleport needs to be fired. Terrible idea that more or less makes the skillset a must-have.  If you've got some advice, I'd love to hear it. I won't pretend to be the greatest at the game and I'm always down to learn something."
archeage,3bwxuw,FlippehFishes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"they can only trip you as long you have stalkers mark on you, so if they hit you with stalkers mark and you dont block, dodge, parry it, just use your invincibility and after that imprison to keep them out, after that just let them come close, pop redoubt and use your normal combos"

I also run into a lot of players that take near 0 damage from my spells (730 spell damage and a fair bit of penetration)  The only tip I have is the honor cloak that will break darkrunner cc combo, once you get out that instant aoe fear would be a good choice and go from there.  Also, get some pants and chest to the tier you want (if obsidian) and start putting in the best toughness and resilience gems.  Honor gems are way to OP, there is a large quantity of players that just take no damage & I'm sick of doing honor dailies , I'm starting to see why people exploited honor the RNG is garbage and dailies get pretty old after a year."
archeage,3bxh69,GGtesla,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yup yup.

I use/waste all my extra honor trying to get more toughness in my pants...  Also as a caster, I sacrifice move speed in boots for the toughness lunafrost."
archeage,3bxh69,hanabudda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:17:44 2015 UTC,For gear get at least mag gear so you can put lvl 50 gems in it. Toughness is awesome at helping you reduce damage. You could go shield off hand as well. If you can run serpentis then do it. The set bonus is awesome. Also get lvl 55 so your on the same lvl. As daggerspell you need to cc first to beat darkrunners. Fear lastitude meteor circle bubble chain arc win. If you get the whole thing off they will probably be dead. There are lots of other combos as well like mark overwhelm smite. You are a mage assassin so don't over engage. Just kill outline players in open world. Also find a good daggerspell on your server and ask for tips.
archeage,3bxh69,Craigerade,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also if you are set on normal crafted, then upgrade to mag asap. Illustrious is just garbage now with the new level cap.

However on a positive note, there's multiple ways to level that's not necessarily a grind.   You can do experia if you have land, I've heard it's expensive but I think people have that conception just because each plot isn't just like 25s. I mean 4g per plot could seem expensive to some people. I did a couple sunflower patches. 25 sunflower seeds (1g) 3 blue salt hammers (3g) and 4 memory ink, if memory serves me correctly. Takes less than ten labor to craft and 20 Labor to harvest and you get 36k xp... Seems fair to me. Oh and roughly 3 hours harvest time. Plus the fact that you can win 10k gold if one of your experia happens to be best in the bluesalt ribbon board. (Ctr + u and the third or so tab over)  There's also a daily library raid with bosses on all three floors that starts at 8pm est every night. With the chance of multiple bosses on the second floor. Along with the quests you can pick up from the npc outside the library that are kill quests for a certain amount of mobs. The bosses give amazing amounts of xp.   Just another suggestion, you can do trade runs. The labor cost had risen slightly, but so has the monetary value of the trade packs. You can make money, use the money to craft whatever you feel like, ie armor or weapons that you feel are being bought often on your server. You make a decent profit from tradepacks along with the chance of procing a valuable item you crafted, all the while burning labor and getting xp. Just a thought though.  If anyone could chime in on the experia and library info with more accurate descriptions or adding to it, would be appreciated. I'm at work and on my phone so I don't want to falsely add misinformation."

Standard ""Kill x monsters"" or ""collect material"" or ""craft obsidian weapon"" missions. Library daily quests can be good. Kill 20-40-60 monsters and one special quest/day in all floor. This quests are easy in raid. You can buy similar ""kill"" quests near the Library portal too. Kill monsters in library! This is good in solo. You can get lot of xp/kill. I think library monster XP nerfed or you can earn less XP in Lvl 55 (other skill tree leveling). Halcyona war buff + xp boost + elixir (extra 40% xp) = 24-27k xp/ floor 3 monsters. In lvl 54 was 30k/monster.  farm coinpusrses: you can kill easy targets. 1-3000 xp/kill and lot of coinpurses. (lvl 50-54 monsters in Auroria). And good gold too when you open coinpurses.

I don't know another game that allow me to build a house, boat, farm vehicles, galleon. It's kinda what you want to make it to be. And there are so many ways of making money unlike other MMOs. For example, I fish, farm, trade, craft, and sell/buy good on AH for a living. You can earn gold as a group or network with other ppl for a bigger payout. A couple of guys in my guild got clever and extort the opposite factions in a pvp zone for gold: 16g/day, if they don't pay up, they harass, kill them. And the daily world events can be pretty massive.  Bar the money grabbing way that Trion is doing, I think it's a pretty solid game, worth y of sinking a few months. If I were you, I pony down for 1 month subscription and give it another shot.  Land isn't exactly free on Ollo but if you search, there are demo sight every day. That's how I got all of my shit now: 3 16x16 and 3 24x24. You can also easily buy a plot for 200-300g in a pvp zone.  As a mother of fact, I'm starting a new toon on Harani (East) Ollo.

archeage,3bvn0w,GoldenGonzo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed,   On a tangent, I believe the reason Trion is able to progress as a company is sizeably influenceed due to the revenue they accumulate from P2W players. I fear gradually as Archeage progresses (and a few others have highlighted on this thread) P2W player presence will dwindle due to the fact that other players have the capacity to make substantial amounts of gold with their guild or guilds.   As a consequence to this I ask you guys; will Trion, in 2016, continue to focus on shaping archeage and apply the same level of effort they do now into making this game continuous? Or will they move away onto their next (I've forgotten the name already) project?   Food for thought: Is it right to assume that P2W players keep this game funded/running?"
archeage,3bvn0w,awkwardvlog,6,Fri Jul 3 14:52:23 2015 UTC,The players who work together far outnumber those who paid thousands of dollars for their gear. But anytime anyone sees anything they can't afford they claim it's pay to win. Which doesn't even fit the true definition of pay to win. The number one source of gold entering the economy is kraken packs. Who gets kraken packs? The people who work together. What do they do with their gold? They gear up so they can keep taking the packs. Dominating the game with huge trade runs and controlling events has always been the biggest source of gear for the people with high gear scores. Walk around the shoreline you see all those aged packs sitting next to the ocean? That's thousands of gold waiting to head overseas. Go to freedich you see all those people fighting over packs? That's thousands of gold in dispute. Usually with the biggest guild taking the cash. But lets keep claiming it's all people dumping thousands of dollars into the game so you can feel better for being too lazy to work for your gear.

archeage,3bvn0w,Kloonike,2,Fri Jul 3 09:26:44 2015 UTC,"I have worked hard in ArcheAge and I don't see high paying players as a problem, not many are ahead by huge margins. They are only a problem for players who don't work as hard and then ofcourse it's time to blame something else, other than yourself... The ceiling is set very high in Archeage and it's certainly out of reach for casuals, yet reasonably high levels are achievable with dedication over time.  Going to quote /u/Kreinzord here:   Clear-cut view on pay-to-win MMOs for me is this: you can always find a way to get ahead with real money. Buying accounts, items on eBay, paying people to run you through dungeons for Bind on pickup items (hello Tera), paying for ingame currency, paying for exploits/illegal software. There will always be a way to exchange your cash for ingame means, by that standard every single MMO ever created would have to be considered P2W. It's never black or white, it will always be somewhere inbetween."
archeage,3bvn0w,Sociopathix,2,Thu Jul 2 23:21:38 2015 UTC,"As far as im concerned players who spend mass amounts of irl money on this game end up ruining the game for themselves more than others.   My evidence is anecdotal, but every whale/swiper I've talked to has had the opposite reaction; they spend large sums of money to get exactly what they want, and they enjoy the game more, especially when ""schreking"" their enemies.   But the fact that there is a large P2W presence in this game should not be the be all and end all reason wether or not you should play/ continue to play Archeage.   This is true. Those who spend tremendous amounts of money have dwindled somewhat, and there are far more players who don't pay vs. those who do.   I feel that as a player base, the non p2w community of archeage has to stop worrying about the p2w demographic because it is getting to the point where all we seem to focus on is exactly that.   This is true. The problem with many of the salty players complaining about p2w is that they're experience a tactical problem, not a financial problem. It's not that they're not paying enough, it's that they're not planning enough.  A whale cannot kill what he cannot see. Utilize Shadowplay for out-of-safe-zone runs. Use your brains and make better plans. Hell, I stole a hauler the other day from a guy I've stolen from SIX TIMES before. This time, he actually said, ""So, I can't believe I left my hauler unmarked again...""  TL;DR:  Finding very difficult enemy players at a port you're trying to visit? Bring friends, scout it, wait for off-time to deliver packs, USE SHADOWPLAY, etc.  Lost your fishing boat and fish to a pirate? Bring a friend or two. Don't fish next to Growlgate, etc.  Losing your merchant ship on Freedich to a gang of well-geared pirates? Bring friends, scout it first, or make your run on an off-time.  No amount of pay is going to make you smarter. Some swipers are actually very bad at this game and depend solely on gear to survive. So use your brains."

I guess it works both ways and really depends on the type of gamer they are but I have had a different experience with heavy p2w friends who had quit the game months ago. When I asked a few of them if they would ever come back one replied to me something along the lines of: ""no, I think I will just wind up doing the same thing, I might as well wait for BD"" so in a way its bursts of enjoyment on my end of the story.

archeage,3bvn0w,shirtandpantsguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:53:29 2015 UTC,"Oh lord. Well let me tell you a true story. At some point not too long ago I switched guilds. About 3 weeks later I met a former guild mate from the old guild and we talked a bit. When I left his guild, he had a gear score of ~3.4k, mine was at ~3.3k. Said three weeks later the guy has 4.4k gear score, celestial armor buff and can take roughly 40% more damage than I do being at 3.5k. I know the guy quite well so I dont hesitate to ask how he got from 3.4 to 4.4 within 3 weeks. He laughs and says ""man I'll be honest with you, I sold a good bunch of apex and cash store items to get there"". No big deal for him since he just got into a new job so it doesnt bother him to spend that money. For me it was just another gamebreaker and one more reason that eventually lead me to quit this game. To me, all the people who still defend this game, saying it ""isnt heavily p2w"", ""f2p can compete with cashers"" or anything along the lines are simply out of their mind."

I built some pretty janky decks, or by the time I had a competitive-tier deck, the format would change and I'd have to build a new one. As I got older and had more disposable income, I could easily build a new deck on a whim.   I guess what I'm trying to say is life is pay to win. When you get older $20 here and there isn't a big deal at all, and if it will save me some time or get me a new piece of gear for $40 or whatever, I'll do it, and you can do it too when you move out of your mom's basement."

archeage,3bwc99,axi0matical,2,Thu Jul 2 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"3 piece t4 obsidian leather + 4 pieces of auroria seems to be the sweet spot if you're on a budget. The t4 obsidian pieces can be chosen to your liking, I would personally go for the cap, jerkin and breeches (The defenses added bumps your resistances up to full delphinad levels) and Auroria Wildborn boots and guards, Promise belt and fists. What this gives you is cheap performance in the form of great passives until you can afford 4 piece epherium/delphinad gale to replace the auroria stuff. In the end, you're looking for 4 piece gale + something else, so that's why I'd recommend gearing this way. It also gives you a lot of stamina so you can have a bit of a ""crutch"" at the start of gearing, then shed some of the health for damage later on."
archeage,3bwc99,Faddler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"I would say take obsidian fists over promise fists these days. With the amount of defense people have these days, the 10% to endless arrows isn't that much anymore. The crit you get from the oby gloves would be much better"
archeage,3bwc99,Lt_Dan86,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"The reason I say promise fists is because it is a ""cheap"" (relative to t4 v2 obsidian) and good pair of fists that allows replacing later. If you were to take the fists, you would either have to abandon them when you get a 4 set of gale or drop another piece, like the obsidian chest or legs. I wouldn't drop either of those because the resistances they offer you boost you pretty much an entire crafting level on your stats.  On top of this, the obsidian fists may do more damage, but you only get half of the displayed bonus because of the way crit damage is multiplicative. Even at celestial, that means T4 V2 obby gloves will offer an effective 4.5% crit damage buff which still is nothing."

archeage,3bvpzx,JuicyCardboard,2,Thu Jul 2 15:35:38 2015 UTC,T4 V2 Divine Obsidian Bow or better. T4 V2 Celestial Shortspear or better. Celestial Obsidian Dagger or better. As for gear Eph Gale Unique might cut it. But I think most primes go for Celestial Delph Gale or Celestial T4 V2 Obsidian armor. That should most likely get you to 600 ranged damage. Some Primes go for Epic bows as well.

As for gear,  for prime I would go full delph gale and minimum celestial delph bow (preferably gale tidal or lightning) or better.

Save for any delphinad because there's not much worth your time or money between Hasla and delphinad. Then, think about epic obsidian.  Main hand: T4 V2 shortspear preferred, any tier obsidian dagger  Off hand: Obsidian dagger with obsidian shield on hotbar to swap as needed  Instrument: Proven warrior medal archery or shadowplay. Shadowplay has better effect, worse good stats.  Glider: Sloth or squirrel for drop back  Head: T4 obsidian, Gale, Tempest Seastorm Tricorne from Dahuta dungeon  Chest: Gale  Waist: Auroria Promise, Gale, Combined Reckless Captain set coming in 2.0  Wrist: Auroria Wildborn, Gale, Combined Serp set coming in 2.0  Fists: Obsidian T4, Gale, Auroria Promise for PVE  Cape: Auroria move or attack speed, Honor toughess (Unyielding Spirit)  Legs: Gale  Feet: Auroria Wildborn, Gale  Necklace: Halcyona until you can get any lightning neck  Earrings: Flame for evasion or Karkasse windy fire (arguably a waste of time this patch)  Rings: Dream ring, gale  If these look out of reach, they probably are for now. Focus on your weapon and get any cheap leather Auroria pieces (even if they don't have the effect you want) for now. Consider keeping the 3-piece GHA for the crit damage. You need to focus on DPS, defense penetration, move speed and mobility, evasion, crit chance and crit damage. Get tradeable gear whenever possible and think AHEAD.

The public test server in this game is there as a smokescreen in this game, its really there to hype up the new patch and drive those sales.  My opinion is that due to the need to constantly develop a cash shop item that sells to make money developers tend to lose focus on making a game that's enjoyable to play. Everything has to be developed so that you may or may not be able to obtain it in game for now money but it has to be painful enough that a bunch of people will just buy it now.

The exchange rates are just way too different.  Rng box or apex isn't that significant unless you are throwing thousands of dollars at it. Not to mention this can also be purchased with game money by exchanging gold to apex though sort of inefficient.  I would say stuffs that actually affect gameplay more would be some of contents on cash packages trion has been releasing and gold sellers which would be against the terms of service.

With no cashshop. just a complete restart for the people who want to play this game but without a pay2win system. I loved archeage when it launched . i played for 2-3 months. One day i finally got a thunder tree which was like 1300 gold. I kept it thinking it would go up in price in some days. But the complete opposite happened . Trion introduced that one tree i can't remember its name that has 10% or something like that chance to become a thunder tree. The prices of thundertree dropped insanely. That was the reason i quit. I mean wouldn't it be great to start over. This game had so much potential to become a WOW Killer. Trion... Let us start over again. Fix your mistakes . -No Bots -No cashshop -No lagg/Crashes -No hacks. This game would become so popular
archeage,3bsa6e,DrSlugger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:44:21 2015 UTC,The tree was the reson my GF quit too.  She saved FOREVER to get enough TS trees to build a hauler and then literally less than a week later they sell them on the cash shop and the price drops like 800% overnight.

archeage,3bsa6e,Lauralis,10,Wed Jul 8 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"The cash boxes affect the ""player run"" market. Thunder struck trees were very rare. Often up to 1000g. You could buy VERY VERY good armor at the time for that much. I think the apex which costs 10 dollars was maybe 50-100 each at that point. Anyways Trion decided to release a cash box that had Rumbling Archeum Tree. It had a very high % chance of becoming thunder struck. Within a couple hours Thunder Struck trees dropped from 1000g to about 200g.   The best way to make money in Archeage is pretty much waiting for a box to come. Buying all the cheap items from it and waiting for the prices to go back up. If you're sitting on rare materials and they release a box holding them you lost a ton of money.  TL;DR RNG boxes crash the player made market almost every box."

When the archeum trees were released, us lowbies who wanted to get started in commerce, and fishing were relieved since they weren't so ridiculously priced.Grinding out all the Gilda for those ship designs was already hard, then we had to grind out all the gold as well. This took months, and the grind wasn't even fun.   While I agree RNG boxes ruin the economy for the most part, but this helped the economy more than anything if you ask me."
archeage,3bsa6e,HyperJuni,-3,Thu Jul 2 08:04:24 2015 UTC,Crash? Lawl. If you say so. Crash and temporarily devalue certain aspects of the crafting game are entirely different.    Banking on a single thing to make you a lot of money is terrible investing. You want to talk about a barrier for players and ignore how the cash shop enabled many players to acquire TS trees directly or indirectly which put them on a more even playing ground in terms of gold generation? Go for it. I don't do trade runs and I had 6 TS trees before the devalue of them. Didn't make a difference in how much money I continued to generate afterward because I'm not retarded and invested in more than one thing in this game. Good luck.
archeage,3bsa6e,Hindsight-,6,Thu Jul 2 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"If the TS was an actual issue it should of been addressed in the game not via Cash shop. I agree that the TS was better for the game as a whole, but the cash shop was not a good way to do it. Trion has the power to do events. They could of easily done an event to help instead of using the cash shop.  The TS was a crash the rest generally is a temp devalue. I have not seen TS rise back to 1k, but I have not played in a few months.   You don't have to invest to be negatively affected by it. Let's say I built something which required 2 TS. They dropped those chests with little to no warning. That's 2k gone essentially when the next day that would of been 400g.   That's the biggest problem with those chests. They are cash grabs and band aid fixes for core game mechanics that could be handled different."
archeage,3bsa6e,turkletont,2,Wed Jul 1 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"That's a logical fallacy. You can't think like that. It's like losing at a card game then flipping over the next card and going ""Oh I would have won..."" No you wouldn't have won because you already lost. You don't lose money when the price goes down. Because when you bought it the price went up. It's basic economics. Right now the public tree farms are dropping the TS market by about 75 gold every week. But they are also dropping the lumber market by 5 gold per stack. Considering you need lumber more than you need ts trees the lumber market is being effected more negatively by the rarity of t.s. trees. So your logic would say to let them stay rare. Well that would force more players to make even more public farms and drive the lumber prices even lower. Now if they made t.s. trees super easy to get. people would stop planting public tree farms and lumber prices would raise. Which would cost the general public 5-10 more gold per stack which would raise the cost of weapons, houses, furniture, vehicles, etc. The fact that you think the game company shouldn't fix issues of players not being able to get the mats they need to further their progression is just silly. Black pearls are now as rare as ts trees were. If people sat on their blackpearls when the t.s. tree market ""crashed"" they'd be rich right now. (25 gold compared to more than 250 gold now). Anyone sitting on those pearls now will be just as upset when the event happens that grants black pearls (announced for the future). But that's the game."

If not, you shouldn't even be concerned with the items and be more concerned about what you're going to do rather than play the game.    You're still playing though I'm guessing.

archeage,3bsa6e,FlippehFishes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:51:08 2015 UTC,"I've played a lot of MMO's, going back to UO, and seen a lot of different systems and in combination with varying themes. Presuming a game is good enough to last the first year, what keeps people's interest is feeling like part of a healthy rat race. What kills games are: 1. mudflation, 2. cheating. 3. nerfs/ changes that invalidate time and money spent. 4. Pay to Win   Mudflation is unavoidable. Content falls behind itemization forcing new content. Well designed games balance this carefully. AA doesn't do this well, the rich get richer.. get bored quit, while the poor give up. Cheating. AA has a horrible track record here.    3 and 4. Nerfs/ changes/ P2W. AA has focused too much on adding more carrots (for cash incidently) instead of  fixing things that could make the game better. Take fishing for example. They have a great infrastructure for fishing in AA, slightly lacking, deserving some tweaking, but instead of making it better they add ice fishing?  By enhancing boats they encouraged people out on the water while at the same time nerfing fishing boats. Not only did fishing boats not get any significantly functional upgrades, they lost the ability to burn eco fuel making them even more sitting ducks, all while other boats got better. What they should do with fishing, and fishing is but one example, are things like: 1. Make the existing boats more functional, i.e. more accelleration, better radar (that doesn't cost so much effort to acheive,) more defensive. 2. Add random fishing rewards like random chests to sportfshing. 3. Make it easier to find fishing nodes. Driving around for an hour to find fish is LAME, especially considering how boring and the low risk/reward value of fishing. More fishing = more fun for fisherman and fisherman gankers alike. I kind of digress with fishing- but there are other places that need help. Why not scale mobs up, and I'm not talking sea bugs which have always been just annoying ..and don't get me started on stupid jellyfish, the ultimate troll mobs.How about Auroria being made a giant honor zone. Sure it's a conflict zone, but why no honor?  Where's the massive open-world PvP? Where's the incentive to get really good gear? This goes back to mudflation- the mobs are cake to kill, the dungeon content is weak, and the disparity between the combination of p2w and hackers and the struggling masses is so great that both suffer. We need more playgrounds. How about tiered gladiator PvP arenas based on gear score- leave the open one as is, but add options.  Then there's crappy support which I haven't even mentioned.     The main point I'd make is that people's interest is based on being part of a healthy rat race. When things get out of balance people's interest drops both on the high and low end- populations drop, which causes accelerated degradation of the game (because people attract people.)"

The problem with the theory that without a cash shop things would be awesome is that it never was. Things took ages to do back then. Getting to max level was something you were going to spend several months doing. In most modern mmos you can do it in a weekend. So while you may feel like progression is being artificially held back imagine spending literally 10 times as much time to do anything so they can maximize your sub time. Most people who trade time for cash would leave since they don't have the time needed to progress. The dream is an illusion that never existed and never will. There are too many people who want to play but don't have the time to invest because of work and family. And modern players are too used to having everything handed to them to put in a years worth of work to progress. The balance gets further screwed up by hardcore players who invest so much time into the game that you can never catch up to them, and there you have the same problem of having a small elite few ahead of everyone else.

archeage,3bw32m,Orihara_Izaya,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:23:37 2015 UTC,Very curious what classes are best at farming. Anyone know of a good guide? I have all the magical classes up to 50
archeage,3bw32m,WyzeThawt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:02:28 2015 UTC,Pick up sorcery or occultism for the AoE the rest is your choice. I would suggest picking up either Auramancy or Witchcraft for Meditate/Play Dead because they regen your MP back. Saves you money on pots.

archeage,3bwvxh,RtuDtu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"1) They're are many crafting guides throughout Youtube. 2) Focusing on one certain profession is a bit tricky in AA, however sticking to carpentry, weaponry, or artistry is a good choice, due to the demand for weapons/bows/jewelry. 3) I play on Kyrios, and you can find an 8x8 pretty much anywhere for free, as well as you can get the 8x8 farm plot for free by doing commerce quests in falcorth."
archeage,3bwvxh,mimw,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"I would like to know if there any good crafting guides out there.   The database is pretty intuitive with recipes.  If you are meaning on how to best level each thing, not sure about that.   Also, while I level which profession should I focus on for endgame gear? Leather or weapons?   Honestly your professions should probably just be gold-making professions.  ""Making your own gear"" seems great in theory, but most of the time you'll be making deadend gear or gear for salvage, which most of that you can do at low levels anyway.  The RNG of making your own gear is pretty bad.  Let's say you want Epherium Flame 7/7.  If you start from scratch, you have a 1/4 chance of upgradeable illustrious, 1/4 chance of upgradeable mag, and then 1/7 chance of Flame.  1/112 chance.  If you craft a piece of dead-end illustrious you have to make 2 more to be guaranteed an upgradeable illust, which then you have a 1/4th chance of deadending again.   I am looking for a 8x8 plot of land to get started   They're everywhere.  Just plant it somewhere you'll be a lot and you're good.  1 lumber is like 10s.  If you want to buy a 16by scarecrow or higher, they vary based on location.  On NA, a 16x in Hellswamp goes for about 500g, a 16x in Lilyut or Solzreed would probably only go for 300-400 at most. You could also just check all the land in an area you want a farm in and check demolition dates and try to win a landgrab, then it's free!  The Scarecrow you can get by doing the trade-run quests fo blue salt in lilyut and/or Tigerspine"
archeage,3bwvxh,ayumuuu,2,Thu Jul 2 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think just because there is a 1/112 chance of getting your desired item it shouldn't stop you from experiencing a certain part of the the game. I started off as a stone arrow thinking that it would be better for me to craft my own Gale/Squall gear and ended up crafting T3/T4 Obsidian leather and switched to a blighter.   I am 70k in Husbandry from all the buffalos I slaughtered, sold the meat to recoup 90% of the gold and processed the leather to sell and craft my armour Had 4 16x16s worth of cow pens, got fertilizer and milk which I sold or made eco fuel when it was profitable.  did the Yny to Falc cheese runs for gold which I made from my own milk and I also grew lemons. grew some olives for Yny olive oil packs when the guild had a Freed run for gilda stars(have a 24x24 outside of Caernord where the large housing area)   Crafting and salvaging leather gear would be more profitable than if you were to craft weapons/swords for your blighter. More players looking for salvaged leather than a specific weapon. Best thing to do is calculate how much it costs to craft an illustrious leather piece and then how much it would sell for minus the AH fees.   I have been able to craft and sell 3 eph bows (2 gale and 1 lightning) which sold between 2k - 4k. crafted 1 desert cap and 1 flame jerkin - which I eventually used for my T4 obsidian pieces.  If you manage to hit an eph piece you pretty much have 4k item (depending on AH cluster) in your bank.   I've gone from being a GHA/hasla stone arrow to a T3/T4 obsidian leather sword and board blighter by crafting my own gear and selling salvaged illustrious+ items. I also have an arcanist in unique mag lake plate and also unique eph/delph lake cloth with a T3 katana and shield.  I have 2 gazebos in Hadameer to grow my own archeum trees which I get from farming purses, when I don't have trees to grow I raise buffalo for leather and small coin (leather is 16g/100 atm on my AH cluster), or trees for wood, I have 45k mining if I need stone.  Playing Archeage is like a good diet plan. Your input needs to be less than your output. Meaning you have to buy less and sell more. I'm telling you all this to show you that there is no one right way to play the game. Some ways are better than others but if you have an idea of what you want to achieve in the long run and paying attention to what is happening around you, you can still get pretty well geared crafting yourself.  Tl;DR crafting own gear = salvaged pieces for obsidian gear and AH sellable items."

archeage,3bwvxh,ayumuuu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:07:58 2015 UTC,Honestly if you're starting from nothing you either want to do coinpurses(larceny) since you'll have limited land space or some gathering skill like farming/gathering/husbandry.    Then later when you've got some gold you can buy a trade cart and upgrade it to a hauler so you can do land trade runs.

archeage,3bw0z9,paixism,2,Thu Jul 2 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"Jesters aren't worth it anymore.  Comparing library purses to princes, princes are going to be more money right now. This is the case because archeum tree sapling prices are slowly rising and the coinpurses are MUCH easier to obtain. You get regrade braziers, archeum trees, tons of assorted items from prince coinpurses as well. With librarian purses, you get a solid amount of gold but the amount of drops really takes a cut out of the profit. You don't need to use any potions or indexes to farm auroria and you get a chance at auroria armor/haunted chests which are valuable.   Overall, princes for sure. Easier to obtain, better payout and drops alongside a chance for auroria gear and haunted chests!"
archeage,3bw0z9,Faddler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"In my experience the silver/labor ratio is better for Deans than Prince in the last weeks, since they nerfed in about 50% the drop rate of archeum trees. It was a stealth nerf that a lot of people who farms these purses (prince) noticed and thats the reason why the prices of sappings are sky rocking. With the sapplings/braziers nowadays you get from prince aprox. 6 silver/labor with 180k larceny. With Deans you get 5,5 silver/labor JUST from the direct money you get when you open it. Considering the drops, you make about 8 silver/labor. The only downside is the gear level you need to be to farm these purses efficiently. But I know people that AoE farm Lib 3 and its beautiful... lol  In my opinion If you dont have the gear to farm Lib 3 mobs fast enough you should farm Princes. Never go for Jesters, etc."

I would go through and explain it all, but personally I feel like he does a much better job than I do. Spellsinger is really unique, because it fits awesome 1v1 potential, great naval ability, group pvp damage and support into one class. It does the most damage in the game, no questions asked, but can also make your entire raid gain 1500+ defenses to protect against shelling AND gain 21%+ damage output. On top of this, if you ever board a boat or get boarded, you can use alarm call to keep your entire group immune to stuns and sleeps."

Your single job is to explode people, however you offer buffs to your team. Mana is a problem for pretty much any class out there, potions are a must for an extended fighting. If you're in small groups, you can have some issues with CC but usually mark > overwhelm > gods whip + chain lightning is enough to kill someone trying to jump you."

Depending on server choice, you might end up with 60-70% of your initial gold value, but I think safety is priceless in this situation, because Customer Support won't help you if you get scammed in Outside Game Trade.

archeage,3buijm,awkwardvlog,2,Thu Jul 2 07:27:47 2015 UTC,You can setup a script that checks for people messaging more than once a second. Any legitimate player will be told they need a cooldown time if they try it quicker than that. At most you'd have 1-2 people hit per bot banned.

Then there was a massive ban wave, all the spam practically stopped, and the forums were flooded with cry baby threads of how they were fishing and don't understand being banned. (Apologies to those who were false-positives)  Then things slowly started trickling back, faction spam, in game mails, etc.  But the prices were way more expensive.

archeage,3bur1x,Spaclos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:58:23 2015 UTC,"For the ppl that can't reach the forum for what ever reason ill just post copy paste it here:  @Celestrata: Ayanad Designs  As many might not know but we have shortage of Ayanad design ever since the start of the Library. Back then when thousands of players farmed the Library there were barely any designs. Players have killed 10.000-20.000 monsters and never even see any designs. We are now at the point where crafted gear is the endgame and it is reachable, there is enough archeum and other materials to craft upgradeable weapons and gear.  So let me get more specific. I play on the biggest EU server Kyprosa, its also in the auction house cluster with Shatigon which is known to be a very high populated server and the cluster also has 4 instead of 3 servers. Considering that it is safe to say that this is the biggest and most populated Server cluster. Currently on Kyprosa there are 5 Delphinad Volcano Bows that i know of, several Delphinad Typhoon, Ocean and Quake pieces. And as for Ayanad design, well there is one Ayanad Necklace design on the auction house and it takes about 1 week for a new design to pop up.  Ayanad bows are the only possible endgame for archers since you need a leviathan eye to craft the v2 bow to t6, which is even more impossible to get than an Ayanad design. People even with Delphinad bows cant hold up anymore because ever since the ""Bound"" Destructive Prevention Charm obsidian weapons with grades Epic, Legendary and Mythic popped up left and right, increasing the gear gap even more. There are players even considering that Celestial Ayanad is not good enough anymore.  On average there is about 1 Ayanad bow design popping up every one or two months which would take ages just to upgrade all the current Delphinad Volcano Bows.   So the problem is that everybody is 55 now and no one farms the Library because its not worth it. The coin purses don't drop Archeum trees, the gold to labor ratio is only good on floor 3 and those have too much health to get a reasonable farming speed. And for a single person, farming for just 1 design (bow) it would be impossible.  Solutions:  The first solution would be to increase the droprate to give players incentive to start farming the library again.   The second and better solution would be (and Korea has already realized this) to put the Library design pouches on the Loyality market. 150 Loyality tokens would be 1 month of patron. It would be expensive but not too much. Good designs would be at around 2000-4000 gold and bad designs would cost 300-500 gold. Those figures will of course change considering inflation or possible deflation.  So I ask you to consider helping out the community by introducing the designs to the loyality market, it would help experienced players to progress and make it easier for new players to gear up since the experienced players will sell this old stuff and there is gonna be more supply of Epherium and Delphinad gear meaning lower prices.  I'm sorry for any grammar, spelling or format mistakes and I hope I didn't drift off too often.  TL;DR: There are not enough Ayanad designs. Please give us desings in the Loyality store.  And before that shitstorm starts, yes I'm one of the players with an upgradeable Delphinad bow"

They are rich assholes that arent happy unless they 1-2 shot you then.  There are designs out there they just sell them to friends before going to trade chat or AH (most wont even go AH since the price to post it and the probability of someone buying it makes it risky in itself).
archeage,3bur1x,Riisescheiss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:40:28 2015 UTC,I guess they will change it with 2.0 anyway similiar to how it works in korea. Still its a good gold resource if you farm library like I do. I usually do a 2 hour session per day in librarby and so far had 4 designs drop. It will take time but nearly everything does in Archeage.  The AH isnt necessarily the best place to check the availability of stuff though. Of my 4 designs none made it on the AH as I rather sell them to a guild member than some random from the AH.
archeage,3bur1x,Podalirius,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:17:00 2015 UTC,"You are right the AH isnt necessarily the best place to check the availability of stuff but it gives you a comparison for upgradeable gear to designs since the gear also is not always sold on the AH. As for rates how often bow designs drop, this is not based on the AH house but on how many are sold / found based on my faction chat (east and west together) aswell as forum posts.  Also 4 freaking designs? You must be insanely lucky"
archeage,3bur1x,Podalirius,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say maybe double the drop rate. And designs should be worth way more than 2-4k, it should be at least as much as it costs to craft from T5 to T6 on obi weapons, which is upwards of 15k."

Removing the cash shop removes their source of income, which would need to be replaced. Personally I wish that's how it was from the start because I think most F2P games are fundamentally flawed and I don't mind paying for superior gameplay.... but I'm getting the impression that you hadn't considered this.  It's also too late in the game's cycle with current pop numbers to try to release a new server and fracture the game's population even more."

archeage,3buf74,4_jacks,2,Thu Jul 2 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Smaller amounts of Gilda will be way more readily available and much cheaper as on a gold per gilda basis.

At the time timber coupes were released I was able to sell the 1,200 gilda for 7.5k.  Had I sold that in smaller chunks, I would of gotten much less."
archeage,3buf74,gamegenius86,2,Thu Jul 2 06:43:37 2015 UTC,"The price per gilda varies based on how many gilda is being sold / bought.  I've noticed on Kyrios it ranged from 1 gold at 50 gilda and upwards to 5 gold at 400 gilda.  So a small clipper (50GS) costs 50g but that merchant (400GS) will cost you around 2000g.  On Kyrios, i've seen the 250GS ships go for around 1000g.  Also something to note is that the price of the designs are different than price per gilda because of supply & demand.  Someone might buy a design no one wants, and therefore the price is lower.  But at the same time someone may buy a design everyone wants and the price is high.  (2 days ago i bought 400GS for a merchant ship for 1650g, but AH had design for 2500g)"

archeage,3bucsf,Spaclos,2,Thu Jul 2 07:43:32 2015 UTC,"Where are you farming purses? It shouldn't be in a safe zone.

archeage,3bucsf,awkwardvlog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:51:28 2015 UTC,i think the safe zone part about getting ganked while in rook is that if you get ganked while farming mobs you dont lose anything if you can still kill the mob.
archeage,3bucsf,jonmcfluffy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:57:04 2015 UTC,Yeah sure but thats kinda pointless to the argument. You can make far more running packs up the hill than you can farming purses.

archeage,3bucsf,awkwardvlog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"Here is my take on it:   It's going to change.  Doing a trade run is a set price.  When the value of gold is low, that set price is going to seem like a bad deal.  So if you netted 20 gold from that run and 20 gold can only buy you 10 spellbooks, then it's not worth the effort.   However when the value of gold is high, it's a better deal, the same 20 gold will now buy you 30 spellbooks.   Prince purses give about 21 silver per, plus drops.  The drops go up and down with the market.  So value of gold is low, and ppl pay 25 gold for one archeum tree, then this is way better than trade runs.  BUT the next day the value of gold is high, and that archeum tree is now worth only 10 gold =( then you go back to trade runs.   Not to mention RNG in purses, opening 200 and getting no trees is enough to drive you mad."
archeage,3bucsf,4_jacks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:10:19 2015 UTC,"I farm prince purses and save the mats for the weekends when theres more ppl online and prices go up.  You need gold to make gold. Save till you have 1k+, then invest when you see something cheap on the AH and sell it when it's high.  Also, sail lottery is good, buy some triangular rigs, regrade till celestial, profit. If you are lucky you can make lots of gold."
archeage,3bucsf,elgafas,2,Thu Jul 2 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"There's no secret to making gold; you exploit the labor system by spamming multiple accounts with patron and converting the labor into gold.  Alternatively you can join the biggest zerg guild on your server and do ""risky"" trade runs/fishing and have all the world events on farm.   There's also paying to win or getting stupid lucky with crafting/regrading. Being a merchant on the AH is also an option."

You will not find land for free unless you get really really lucky. That being said I'm on a high pop server and there is land available for sale all over the place. This isn't a game where you just going out and plop down your house. Theres a player run economy so you are going to have to deal with other players to get the land you want. What I did is went to windscour (east) built up my land until I was making decent money and running out of labor. Then I sold it all off. I traveled the world looking for good spots made a list of where I wanted to live and hit those places hard even mailing people about their land if it didn't look like they were using it. I ended up with a nice spot in a place i wanted and then started building up land again. Sold all that off for my car. Now I have a nice house and a car and I'm broke again. :P Eventually I'll come back though and start working on my shitty gear.
archeage,3bu8m2,awkwardvlog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"from what i understand there will most likely never be a spot that i can make a house in a non-pvp area?   This is partly true, but warrants better explanation. There will most likely never be a spot that you can make a house in a non-pvp area freely available. This does not mean you cannot get a plot of land or that you must pay a lot of gold to get it.  2 ways to get housing:   Buy with gold: the costly but more surefire way is to find a landowner willing to sell and buy from them. Look for sale signs on the corners of properties or contact land owner in a desired area regarding price/willingness to sell. Also google or look into guides to avoid being scammed (its simple, really, but a bit of knowledge goes a long way). Winning a demolition: When a player does not pay their taxes, their land will be demolished; this information is shown at the building plaque for 1 week until the day/hour/minute of the demolition. Find and inspect building plaques in a desired area(s) and look for red text noting scheduled demolitions. Arrive on time and be the first to place your plot down when it is demolished. Googling guides on this is a BIG help.    does it even matter what server youre on?   It does. Many high or medium pop servers are plenty full on land, though I hear of some of the very low pop servers having open land. I would not personally recommend the lower pop servers just for land reasons, as high-med-low population has other, far more important impacts on your gameplay experience than housing availability (plus upcoming server merges for the low-pop servers)."

What you had going in alpha was great, then after adding a cash shop which completely allowed people to buy their way through the game, there was a steep population decline at release. It's not even a small problem with the cash shop. You're DIRECTLY allowing a transfer for cash to valuable in-game TRADABLE items. How could you not see this being a problem? I, as well as many others, tried to push past this and enjoy the game, but it's extremely difficult. Also, you're talking about communication. How can you NOT see what's being said. What you need to do is post a video, or a detailed explanation, of what the hell is going on with AA. The game has so much potential, and it's being brought down by terrible decisions with no explanations.

Sadly the lack of communication like this early on led to many people moving on. Whether it was Scapes fault or Trions for not letting him communicate I do not know, but the damage was done. Trion made short sighted decisions to make the quick buck instead of investing in the long term stability of the game. Because of this the population is a small fraction of what it should be.   I am aware Trion is just publishing, but most of the bad decisions were directly in their hands.  From horrible server stability at key times (land rushes), adding more servers when anybody who had ever played an MMO much less published one knew they would not be needed after the initial rush(what a rookie move) now leading to mergers in a game centered around land ownership,  the increasing p2progress faster of the cash shop, inability to effectively combat bots/spam, and inconsistent policy on exploits.  Like I said, I love this game. It has more depth and more to do than any MMO Ive ever played. It could have been a huge contender on the market if not for the short sighted decisions made.

Two years later by the decision of Executive from the Holding Group Good Guy Greg was replaced with the Scumbag Steve. Steve started to squeeze the company like a rubber piggybank.

As in if you need to heal someone fast, or maintain buffs, or maintain slow generation go health, etc. You'll be wanted to heal even Serp n etc. Just get shadowplay for stealth for some certain fights.   It depends on your talent tree, I can take a pic of mine of it would help, im just about pure heals with buffs and bard (songcraft) spells that I can run 4 of simultaneously."
archeage,3bscvw,Khetna,2,Wed Jul 1 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"Run the Greater Howling Abyss (GHA) dungeon for the cloth armor, it's pretty decent for healing. Ultimately you will want stone cloth of some sort if you are going to be a dedicated healer, and probably you will want to pick up an obsidian shortspear or obsidian 1H club. This allows you to equip a shield which will extend your survivability a good deal.  Also get to 55, and consider picking up the defense and shadowplay trees at some point. They can make a big difference."
archeage,3bscvw,DHTs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"I've heard about the stone armour, is it craftable?"
archeage,3bscvw,DHTs,5,Wed Jul 1 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if you don't know how the crafting system works you might want to just save up money to buy it.  Once you craft a piece of equipment up to the ""Illustrious"" tier, which is level 44, it becomes randomized. Look at bows, for instance. You are crafting a volcano bow the entire time, but once you get to level 44, you get a ""Sealed Illustrious Bow"". Once you unseal it, you get one of like 6 or 8 random bows. It might be Flame, it might be Lake, it might be Volcano, which is what you need to upgrade to the Magnificent tier. Repeat for magnificent, repeat for epherium, repeat for delphinad. High end armor is extremely expensive in this game because you may have to craft 90 pieces to get the one you are looking for.  I would start with Magnificent stone. Just buy it, it shouldn't be too expensive, and it is good enough to hold you through all major dungeons and world bosses. Once you have a lot of crafting materials or money saved up you can consider getting epherium or better tiers of armor.  BUT. Get a good weapon first. Like get a tier 1 obsidian shortspear or club up to unique, use a resplendent scroll to get it to celestial or divine, take it to tier 3 and temper it. Just use GHA armor until you can afford to do that. One of the big mistakes in this game is trying to upgrade armor before weapons. A single weapon at divine is more effective than having an entire suit of armor at divine and costs significantly less."

archeage,3bscvw,timeunroot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would just craft an obsidian shortspear, because the equip bonus is better and a shield adds a lot of survivability. There is a short series of quests near the tents in Diamond Shores which should help you get the sunlight archeum crystals and money to get you started on it. Once you get the shortspear to tier 3 (and at least heroic), it will be better than a tier 3 hasla club with significantly less grinding."

Have you done the Hasla/Karkasse armor quests yet? (1200 ep, I wanna say no) Sure, not a ton of Spi, but you'll want the defensive benefits starting out (armor/arcane buff). Work on easy shield and 1h (wait for cheap lvl 40+ w/ high healing power to come up on AH), until you find better. Practice proactive rather than reactive healing skills. (I'm not speaking from a point of mastery of this in AA.) Like in PvE, when waiting for the tank/group to take damage could end up with dead, you want to practice anticipation & precasting+cancelling. From PvP perspective, study the common PvP specs, stunlocks & counters, self-preservation (PvE too, you'll need that for CR/GR healing aggro, seabugs, etc.), where to move in relation to group, when to just let someone die, etc. and how that applies to you. Learn to anticipate where the damage is going to be. Every healing opportunity is a practice opportunity. Find yourself some fights, win or lose spectacularly, as long as you learn from it. (From leveling PoV, do more practice where you won't lose exp.) Look into other support/healing specs and level those trees. You'll want the flexibility later. (This is simple to do with armor wrist/waist crafting, xp, & professional tonics. Or find someone grinding purses in Exeloch. There are other options, but those are the ones I've used.) Practice CC (crowd control). Make a throwaway alt. Speedrun the story questline. Buy your Clipper design. Craft it. Propellant, sails, rudder. Make the fucker fast."

I think the 7-set bonus is a very good trade-off, though, and one of the only crafted set bonuses I would deem as worth going for.  Sure, Flame has the exact same 7-set bonus with a better 4-set one, but in most cases a melee tank can't afford the missing stamina, which still makes Desert worth getting for them in my opinion."

Maybe it used to have a +max HP like Ardent Oath set but they thought no melees would choose Flame or Lightning over Desert and decided to nerf it.  Just my theory, because I can't possibly even imagine how someone not high could think that +3 HP regen for epherium desert (4delph, 5aya) is anything but utterly useless.

Unfortunately I don't have a link, but they will give a great bonus.    I'm just using a obsidian katana right now   Divine or gtfo   The bigger thing I'm wondering though, is what accessories should I be getting and where do I get them?   This should be the last thing you even think about  Weapon > Off hand > Armor > Bow > Accessories.   I literally just picked up cheap stuff from the AH that has INT.

They will cost thousands, wont give much more stats than auroria or epherium counterparts at equal regrades, and you cant hit any of the set bonuses. Compare them:  [Delpinad Wave Sleeves] at Divine provide:   Defense - 56 Magic Defense - 284 Intelligence - 38   [Auroria Mystic Sleeves] at Divine provide:   Defense    - 48 Magic Defense - 240 Stamina    - 23 Intelligence - 12 Increases Freezing Arrow (Sorcery) duration +1 second.

I mean build your gear up, but eventually to play with the big boys, you are going to have to start regarding to divine.   The bonuses on accessories are pretty crap.  Just compare the bonus of a Celestial Epherium Wave earring to that of a Celestial Illustrious Wave earring.  Not much of a bonus for such a LARGE increase in price.  Not compare that to some no name earring on the AH that cost 3 gold and gives you +11 INT.  Which honestly doesn't give you much extra m.atk.   You have 4 black pearls!  Effing sweet, if you can keep getting them, there is your income.   No, I don't recommend crafting Earrings.  It's all RNG.

There is only you get in Dewstone somewhere along the lines of running SM.  There is one you get for serving on the jury, and there are cloaks that drop from the Haunted Chest, which you get from Auroria Mobs.  The Haunted Chests cloaks are pretty good, however they are bind on pick up, and pretty class specific.  Worst thing, they don't drop very often.  I grinded about 8k mobs for a cloak, the first I got added 480hp, which is pretty lame, after that I got one that adds 5% parry and 5% block(if I use a shield).  So I kept that, the one that casters really want is the Cast Time reduction.   The only redeeming thing is you need auroria drops for obsidian crafting and prince purses are half decent money."

archeage,3brvjm,Lauralis,2,Thu Jul 2 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"Here is what I would go for if money wasn't a factor...and even if it is this should still be a long term goal. So sit down and read this wall of text. Formating will be shot since I'm on a mobile. Feel free to msg me for more info or post a reply.    First goal of armor is obsidian helm and chest. These are the 2 most important parts of any caster. You can go 5/7 obsidian or not but you will always get obsidian helm and chest b.c the MA bonuses are broken as fuck. Get these to celestial or divine. If you have money..divine is the goal. Celestial is also good if you plan to regrade the serpentis bracers.  bracers and belt can be what ever you want. They are releasing another one of those medal combination things in a few patches that allows you to combine a 7/7 set of serpentis into 1 bracer so it'll give you the set bonus for 1 item. For this safe will be celestial. Divine if you get a great sucess...but I wouldn't risk a celestial regrade. Some guildies has stated they would keep it at rare so as not to break up their divine buffs. Personally I would make it celestial and this means you can keep all your other items at celestial too. weapon should be katana and shield or staff. V1 katana is best if you plan on switching specs but v2 is great for spellsinger but only spellsinger. Obsidian shield ofc. V1 obsidian flute for more pdef. halcy neck r7+. You can use a wave neck or the necklace that drops from kraken. I forgot the name of it but I spoke with another  caster I've pvped with and he said this one was very nice. Comes with a 5k+ price point though. wave earrings for the % dmg reduction. Library earring is good too dream ring and a wave ring. Life is another choice for the %skill dmg. cloak should be the 5k honor toughness  one. It does not go away after 10 days. Only the active. Otherwise block or cast reduction are nice too. toughness enchant on almost every piece.  standard gem sockets though. Pdef 100 on everything but pants and chest. forgot to mention a bow. Wave for stat stick or obsidian for more hp..and mana  flute, bow and weapon should be MA sockets. 4.0 ones if you have money."
archeage,3brvjm,krazypunk1018,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:38:20 2015 UTC,Magic pen on bow and instrument are way better imo. Life ring is also more damage than the small bit of cast time and int from a wave ring would give.
archeage,3brvjm,NgArclite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"It actually depends on how much magic attack you already have, I've done the math and adding magic attack gems on my bow and flute give me a tiny bit more damage than magic pen but barely a difference, also magic attack is probably cheaper to buy or make"
archeage,3brvjm,NSA-SURVEILLANCE,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:38:57 2015 UTC,It's a preference thing. Also I rarely see life rings on ah when I check it. I'd go wave personally but I can see life being a good cuoice

archeage,3brvjm,krazypunk1018,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:40:52 2015 UTC,You can always just use the halcy neck r7+ for the active. I dunno if it will work out well since you have to equip it to use the active...and that can't be done in combat...thus I'd suggest using that. It's the more defensive option since it give you dmg reduction and 1000 more hp off the effect . I see some users use wave..but hey..I'm cheap and halcy is free. There is a kraken neck at 5k golds but I hear the effect actually isn't that good.   I've talked to a guildie about katana and dagger. He like dagger for more cast time reduction and the procs. Id like to try both but my staff proced divibe..so I'm making stick with that
archeage,3brvjm,NgArclite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"That's totally understandable, I was comparing the other day katana and dagger to staff all at t4 and all at celestial and of course the staff did about 30 more magic attack easily, but katana and dagger gives you dual wield buff and good amount of cast time compared to the little magic defense pen the staff gives. I guess its more personal preference. I got my katana to divine so I'm sticking with that for now with my divine shield, I could make a staff for more dps or a dagger, would probably cost around the same but a dual wielding mage just sounds badass :P"
archeage,3brvjm,krazypunk1018,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:00:31 2015 UTC,I've seen it work. Some streamers were dual wielding. Back I  the day they were using Faust destiny...which I actually got so I might still be able to try . But obsobsdagger actually have added cast time reduction.  I'm going to be using v2 staff for spellsinger. I hear it's nice so that's why I'm doing good that. If I ever get super rich I'll go dagger too.
archeage,3brvjm,NgArclite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:04:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm definitely not super rich so all I got is my katana and shield, I heard v2 staff is amazing for spell singer cause of the extra effect which makes auramancy users not be able to shrug off the charm. Ugh like I said I'm torn between making a staff or a v2 dagger for when I want to go full dos no shield. I will say that if you use honor nadachi that switching to 2 hander from the nodachi is easier then re equipping 2 weapons lol.   I might think of working on my obsidian flute after I'm done with my weapons but the warriors medal flute is so nice being delphinad quality and making insulating lens stronger"
archeage,3brvjm,scarlettII,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:09:39 2015 UTC,Remember than you'll need 500 medals and 7/7 serp set to combine into the op bracers. Much more important than the honor intruments. The obs one comes with physical def. The honor one has a nice skill boost but you can switch it and use the skill and switch back mid combat
archeage,3brvjm,NgArclite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"For the record, these 2 classes require different ways of gearing to be optimal on them. Daggerspell can actually defend himself while spellsinger is mainly glass cannon and if you get caught you'll be dead anyways."

archeage,3brvjm,NgArclite,0,Wed Jul 1 19:06:37 2015 UTC,Wrong so wrong. My spellsinger sits at over 8k mdef and pdef. That's at least 2k+ over the soft cap needed. Hitting 60% dmg reduction before toughness. I'd say daggerspell is more glass cannon if it wasn't a walking cc bot.

As long as you can be sneaky + use the world to your advantage you should be able to kill almost anyone very quickly if they dont have the defense tree (redoubt = archers nightmare).

Defense is strong, but I feel it needs to be since it's the only answer to the grossly overpowered battlerage. It's the only thing that will stop you from getting  exploded in 2 second by a geared melee."
archeage,3bsevb,Yuzuriiha,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"mobility or cc works too, so basically you can use def with ALOT of trees and make it effective and overpowered. mobility classes include aura, shadowplay, battlerage. then cc it works well with vitalism (snare from mirror's light) or witchcraft. you mix any 2 of those with def and you are god mode in 1v1. one wrong move, and it just takes one... you are done for as an archer :/"

archeage,3bru7e,mrfishmanify,3,Wed Jul 1 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"There is already a gold cost quasi-attached to crimes.  That is the cost of draughts of forgiveness.  They could greatly effect what your talking about by raising the cost.  Right now green-pirates either have to limit their crimes to what they can clear in the daily quests, or make sure that what they profit from your pack out weighs the cost of the draught.   The reason they don't really care to watch things that closely is because green-pirating is considered ""content"".  Most green pirates don't actually profit, some do, but most make a small upfront profit, but later spend more on draughts.  They mainly do it because they can.  They consider that a fun way to play the game.  Because they can, the rest of us have a whole new level of social interaction, including the court (which is extremely novel, and worthless outside of RP).  But it also causes us to group up, stick together, protect guild members, etc etc.   TL:DR.... It's content."
archeage,3bru7e,4_jacks,5,Wed Jul 1 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"The reason they don't really care to watch things that closely is because green-pirating is considered ""content"". Most green pirates don't actually profit, some do, but most make a small upfront profit, but later spend more on draughts.   Green pirate chiming in.  If I steal, lets say, 1 hauler of Hellswamp Spicy Meat, that costs me 22 crime points.  If draughts are going for 40g like they have been, then that meanas 100crime = 40g.  So 22/100 = .22.  .22*40g = 8.8g.  So that means ONE pack that I stole pays for all the crime I just gained and then-some.  So even if kill a person for one pack I'm still making some money.  You also have to account for theft on the ocean.  If we catch up to your fish-boat and board it, kill you, and take the boat, then drive it for a bit and blow it up with a galleon.....will you drive back out to the spot we killed the boat to turn in the bloodstains?  Will someone else see the stains and stop?  Probably not, meaning a large portion of the time, we gained packs for no accumulated crime.  Long story short: Crime pays."
archeage,3bru7e,ayumuuu,3,Wed Jul 1 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"An educated and thought out response.  Obviously Ayumuuu profits from green-pirating because he knows the cost, and knows what he is doing.   But how many lowbies have been jacked on their donkey for a single pack by a green-pirate scrub? Plenty of them.  So you have pirates like Ayumuuu who evalulate the profit v cost, and you have pirates who just gank whatever.   In the end, It's all content.  No pirates = less content.   Reminds me of that Chapter in Freakonomics where some guy befriends a drug dealer and does a detailed analysis of their books and how much each dealer makes, and what they actually face.   http://freakonomics.com/books/freakonomics/chapter-excerpts/chapter-3/  off topic, but a decent read."

archeage,3bru7e,nintendojunkie51,2,Wed Jul 1 22:47:34 2015 UTC,I like this idea but I think it would work better if the person that committed the  crime and got sentenced could pay a bail to be released from prison. Like say they got 10 minutes in jail they could pay a 20g fine to avoid jail altogether. I mean if we can p2w we should be able to pay to not go to jail like in real life.

You want to fix the justice system for purpling in Archeage?  Make it so if the person is wanted, you can purple on them, free of repercussions, and receive a bounty, based on the level of wanted...ness, paid to the person that killed the wanted person.  Actual, game-encouraged, bounty hunting.  It could have an entire achievement/title system and everything.

People like you are the reason my server can't have a faction-wide Abyssal event, because green pirates can't be trusted not to steal your packs if they're in your raid. It's the reason we can't do faction fishing events anymore, because green pirates will use our global chat to find us and kill us. It actively makes the game less community-oriented, less kind, and less enjoyable. So even if you're doing it for money, you're still being a douche."

They wouldn't pay it on the spot, but rather build up a dept, which would be slowly payed off by taking percent off of the trade packs they turn in/their auction house profit etc. this is all just brainstorming though..."

There's no sense direction from admins and development (just updates without any real purpose or meaningful content, such as a new instance to gain new lvls but for no end game purpose save for the sake of extending the game life with a new tier of gear and one new skill per class).  There's no balance among classes, again a lack of developers that actually care and play the various classes. The game is plagued with exploits, bugs, and bots. And customer service, although from my experience they're great at returning items within reason (like marketplace errors with credit charges) they're very vulnerable to fraud. I won't go into detail, but I've seen it with strong credibility.   At the end, unless you're about money or luck stay away from Korean games.

archeage,3brhba,WyzeThawt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:24:44 2015 UTC,Game is pay  2 advance.   Pvp is mainly the part where people scream p2w. So if you only pve you should be fine. But know that unless you stay in 100% peace areas you can and will get killed.  Depends on your server and faction I guess. But most people are generally nice to you as a new playet.  Labor in the game allows you to do certain things like farming and craftong. It's not something you should worry about yet.
archeage,3brhba,NgArclite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:50:04 2015 UTC,I am going to say this is a PvE game with major PvP risk there is no way you can be mainly pvp and progress in this game. Ass for pay2win its kind of a lie as there is nothing in the store that directly powers up your character to make you win a fight. What people are not saying about p2w are people are buying gold from 3rd party to buy in game gear witch is going vs the ToS. There are people that do buy apex and sell for gold to but still at the very far reaches of gold that you make there is still a player some where that had to craft the gear. So he didn't pay to win anything.
archeage,3brhba,Trixstir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"I'll be completely real with you. PvE is virtually nonexistent, as far as dungeons/raiding goes,  and it is definitely not worth playing for it."

You can have a skate, you can have a clipper, a galleon, a merchant ship, a fishing boat, u can have a glider and fly all over the map, u can go to the deep sea and find sht you would never expect to find, u can plant, herbs, fruit trees, big trees, medium trees, small trees, u can see a huge mountain in front of u and challenge urself if u can climb it, etc.. All ive said to u was pvp or pve?? It really doesnt matter, archeage is só big and has so much diversity, that only trying u can say if its worth or not!! JUST DO IT! xD"

But yes there are no grand raids and epic dungeons. just a few dungeons and loads of open world content. If you like a game where crafting and such actually means something, archeage is the game for you. It's the only game I've played where you can level completely and gear up completely without killing a single thing. AS for p2w your gonig to find that argument everywhere with a cash shop these days. It's almost never true."

archeage,3br0wh,RtuDtu,2,Wed Jul 1 13:25:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on the kind of wpvp. Melee classes are common in Mistmerrow and Halcyona because they're very viable for killing a single target fast and getting kills as a solo player or small group.  In organized large scale PvP you're going to want lots of initiators, lots of healers, and lots of nukers. Your pvp leader should be a high-survivability initiator like skullknight, but then have multiple high-damage initiators like revenants. Have healers assigned to each initiator. Once your initiators suck up clumps of enemies, hellspear them in place, then your nukers who should IMO be songcraft mages such as spellsingers, lamentors, earthsingers should drop their AoEs on the clump.  The biggest mistake I see in WPvP is that players aren't willing to change their classes to contribute to the group. It's not uncommon to see a guild running around with tons of plate darkrunners or daggerspells which are selfish builds that contribute little to large scale PvP.  Sorcery provides the best AoE damage in the game, Occultism is godly for initiating, Songcraft is a great damage amplifier. Battlerage, Shadowplay, Witchcraft are are better suited for smaller scale or single target."
archeage,3br0wh,Neoxide,2,Wed Jul 1 15:26:41 2015 UTC,Archer is still really good in open world PVP.  That's how KR originally beat the mage blenders.
archeage,3br0wh,phubbink,-1,Wed Jul 1 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Why should the leader be a initiator? How is he able to see what is happening with his raid while he is in the middle of the enemies? I guess for a zerg who is 100% sure to win, it doesnt really matter.   Y'all need an indian songcrafter to lead.  Also i would love you fight you. No fear immunity on initiators or healers? Let me get in on that."

archeage,3br0wh,ayumuuu,0,Wed Jul 1 13:30:49 2015 UTC,Depends on what you're looking for. I would say Dark runner is better for WPvP solo. Group PvP Casters are pretty good due to aoe.

I reply to anything that may come to mind regarding my corporation.    Not bots. I have never botted nor will i. I get on each character and play them according to trions rules. I tend to use the follow command in raid/party to make things much easier. I am actualy very anti bot and anyone who knows me will tell you this. There is nothing in the TSA or EULA or Code of conduct to stop me from playing the game i choose to play this way. Yes i am multiboxing, I have paid much more than you would expect to be able to play this way. I have a dual xeon cpu 256GB ram server set up to handle this kind of load. I could have saved money just setting up 15 laptops at 400 bucks each. I chose this way becuase i prefer high resolution gameply so i can fit more on the screen vs having to look at 15 small screens. Not getting any younger. Yes my IGN: Kuktar, Tahyang east. I am manualy controling each and every account. To do simple tasks like log in after server reset takes me 2 hours. I have to go through each one the same as anyone else and put passwords and enter the location security code. This is not as simple or easy as most would belive. Remember that one time you had to re enter your password 4 times becuase you kept messing it up, imagine that but 10 times in a row. welcome to kuktar inc. Men in Stripes :P That actually has a really nice ring to it. Doing leviathan is the highlight of my current day to day, I have to have each one climb the mast so they dont fall off. So far no gear yet. just moonpoints and lunarite. Big shout out to Trion_Celestrata. Nice to meet you. I know you are replacing scapes and i appreciate you clearing up the rules on VMs. And yes the main reason i am still going strong today is becuase i have never used any software to control my alts. Games like this thrive when we all play fair. What i am doing is something that anyone can do easily. Setting up VMs is very easy but you need to properly lisence windows and you need the right hardware. I have always offered advice to anyone with questions. Yes i got jacked in halcyona. In this case i had my boat sitting there for 20 minutes becuase i had some alts DC moving packs. I was warned by insomnia prior that a huge group of sad flutes was in the water sharking. I was offered help from freindly people to defend my ship wich i kindly took. I had 6 ppl and there were 3 clippers and 2 galleons that pushed me up into war. I am not jelly. i actualy ran 5 ships out that day so whats 1 ship :P. I also never joined sad flutes TS nor would i want to. Yes i am full of myself and i have every right to be. PS: you know what happens to people who dont jack my haulers? They get all kinds of cool stuff from me becuase i consider them my freinds. You may have got 40 gold for that hauler but they get a lifetime of being able to summon 12 haulers or 4 trade ships. Wich is better you decide.   11.Chigikogou i think your a cool person and if you want to purple on them to do meteor be my guest. having them at the nui simpifies finding them later. Also be prepaird for insta wanted 15x3-5 large bloodstains/ crime points :P  12.kakasusu this is not relevant to me at all and i really dont know why you posted it here. I guess perception is reality but to be fair you can not just say something and have it be true :P Very intresting video.  13.awkwardvlog i can understand how this can be upseting. If you look at it from the other side. I make all my gold from running silent forest packs. I am actualy doing more good for you then bad in my opinon. When you list something on the AH like potions or items from bossess. or ship regrade scrolls or anything really. I use the gold that came from the gold trader that trion has established using my labor to create more gold for people to sink into gear regrades. This is a glass half look at it and i choose to think this, not all will agree. Sorry if it upsets you, i will gladly help you set up vms.   TornadoPuppies/[–]tbakke/[–]rG_Grishnak/[–]atRouzeMeego/[–]tbakke - To be blunt i am not associated with any hacking or teleporting. I hate this just as much as you do. I have had to level my alts the hard way and spent many hours doing so. I wish you luck on your tickets to trion. I have accumulated over thousand's honor with bot kill reports, each time i see somthing like this i mark the suspected bot untill it has prime suspect so it cant get away from the debuff. This has been very succesfull for me as i get mail all the time from GMs giving me 50 LP back.   tbakke- I am not in violation of any of trions rules. As a matter of fact they started offline labor regen for patrons like all of my accounts, the reason they are afk is becuase i am not using them the entire time i am online and there is nothing wrong with being afk. Trion supports being afk due to low server loads and has been straighforward with this since day 1.  15.evo77 this is a great idea in theory but in the end it would kill the idea of a sandbox game. in my opinon you would be very surprised at how many players have more than 1 account. More often than not many people have extra accounts and its part of the gameply to be able to have more than the other guy that has not put as much effort or money into the game. In the end trion would loose business from people like me, I pay for 15 patrons a month at 15 bucks a pop. That is really good idea and if there were something like that for certain things i would be helping them implement.   I wrote this reply becuase just like you i do not like having my gameplay inturputed to be harrased, i dont think 100% of ppl will be supporting me but the more you learn regarding my gameply the better it will be for both of us. I want to be 100% transparent and will continue to look for posts like this so i can clear things up. Have fun gaming and see you on the open seas. I just got my cannons on my gally to divine today :P should be a good time."

archeage,3bo6vm,TornadoPuppies,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:33:44 2015 UTC,This is a video of a TP bot but what proof is there that Kuktar is running it or that its in any way associated with OP's screenshot.
archeage,3bo6vm,Krowez,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:43:12 2015 UTC,"TornadoPuppies Having spent a ton of time with kuktar literately almost every night we're on TS bullshitting around. He has also shown me how to run VM's I run 3-4 as I do not have the hardware that he does to run all his alts. He is a pretty kick ass guy and will bend over backwards for his friends. When I was building my Chalet in Hasla he dumped easily 10k in labor without a second thought on his needs. So I will say without a doubt he does not bot. You don't have to believe my word but considering he has been reviewed not once, not twice, More like three to four times by GM's he does not bot.   As for the SadFlutes TS If I remember right someone from Noirland hopped into their TS and asked you to stop attacking him.  if you want something funny about him check this I remember him going WTF as we the faction we're working on uniting.  Go Figure right. :P http://i.imgur.com/lcTwoZM   EDIT: Also That is not one of this characters unless he keeps a super secret guildess alt stash."

Something tells me this is another situation where the person behind these bots know someone in trion.. It's happened before..
archeage,3bo6vm,rG_Grishnak,2,Tue Jun 30 20:40:04 2015 UTC,its all multiboxxed legitimately from what i understand. guy runs his own server to run them all or whatever
archeage,3bo6vm,atRouze,0,Tue Jun 30 21:07:03 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but if they are teleporting then it's not a legitimate multiboxing.
archeage,3bo6vm,tbakke,-1,Wed Jul 1 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well, when the player in ""charge"" isn't even there to control them, he can be multiboxing all he wants.. He is still in violation of Trino's rules. It just sucks that Trino is too inept to act on all the info they've gotten."
archeage,3bo6vm,evo77,-2,Wed Jul 1 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"Against bots, like I said before:  Make a request to XL Games that when someone reports another as a BOT, to require that suspected bot to enter a Captcha to verify he's human. This shouldn't be a pop-up, but a bright, glowing exclamation mark in the top-right side of the screen, with a 15 minute timer to respond. (shouldn't interfere with any pvp since you surely die in 15 min and have 3 seconds to spare to enter it)  You should only be able to report users that don't have the <AWAY> status or if it's do-able, able to report only MOVING targets or ""performing an action"" targets, meaning that even if you don't have the away status (yet) you couldn't be reported.  If you fail to respond in that time or fail to enter the right captcha 5 times, you're teleported (along with your despawned ship/cart/wagon/hauler/vehicle fully loaded with whatever) to prison.  You have another 15 minutes to enter the right captcha (how many tries you want), after which you're added on a GM's list of suspected bot, and you WILL be investigated, even if you manage to enter the right captcha after those 15 minutes have passed and you can roam around freely again.  When you enter the right captcha after being teleported to prison, you're teleported back to where you were and you can summon your hauler/ship/vehicle with all your packs in it just like you would when the server would shut-down every time there's a maintenance or patch.  Hey, captcha works for Google, why wouldn't it work for bots? And change the captcha images every new build or every maintenance if needed. It should make their life hell or next to impossible; well at least not worth the trouble anymore.  Economy SAVED!  Oh, and if that suspected bot doesn't respond in 15 minutes and ends up in jail, you get your 25 labor points used to report him, back.  For honest players, being reported is usually done to troll you and it's kind of annoying to waste time and gold (sometimes even 0.5g - hereafter) to travel to Marianople/Windshade (W) or Solis (E) and prove you're not a bot. This would actually make players life easier against being trolled and also Trion's staff life easier since it would narrow the bot suspects and eliminate the real players that just behave like one: endless hours of grinding mobs.  Please give your constructive feedback, but only after reading everything thoroughly guys."

When you return, you can't summon the vechile/ship in any other area than where it was unsummonend (20-50m radius I think), with all the packs it carried, when the server shut down. You haven't even explained that you would re-summon your hauler only when you arrive at freedich, good thing my excessively high IQ compensated for your low IQ."

It was completely irresponsible of him to make that bold faced lie, but hey. Anything to keep the sheep quiet.    the ""LOL WE CANT DO IT NOW SORRY IT WILL BREAK OTHER THINGS WINK WINK"" was just another lie to cover up the previous ones."
archeage,3bo9cn,Kaotikid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"Not all of that's true which is what angers me. I know the game records my exploration points. You know how I know? Going to the point a second time still doesn't give me exploration proficiency. If you have a Hauler, the game knows you have a hauler, and they know you had to have made first a cart, then a wagon to get it. If you have the Ultimate Glider, they should know you needed to have made the first two to get it. If you have maximum language proficiency, they should know you must have read a language book once (that one is literally locked to me forever since I maxed my proficiency before achievements).  I understand tha the game didn't record if I drank the quest potions at the start, and that I needed to drink them again to get the achievement. But there are ones that the game records, thus I expect them to give those. Although based on what they said about how they would fix the pirate one, I doubt they will now - they won't release a patch that just goes through logic to see if you deserve them, they just wanted to have your character in essence ""re-do"" the achievement, which is dumb."

I do believe however that any merit badges that would be obtained through questing, eating quest food/soup and potions, anything that would have been done from level 1 through 50, should be granted to everyone above level 50. There are so many achievements for just drinking 10 potions of a certain type that we would have gotten.  I want that glider skin soo bad..

archeage,3bo9cn,awkwardvlog,2,Tue Jun 30 22:36:05 2015 UTC,They said in the live stream its physically impossible to give some of the retro-active merit badges because it would trigger other unwanted effects so things like becoming a pirate and changing back won't be happening. The rest of the stuff is low priority so don't expect them to stop working on current big ticket issues for a badge or two. It's a system limitation issue.

I mean, the billy mays guide is one of the most popular guides so off ive seen it already. I have already looked at all the other guides but the more opinions, the better."
archeage,3bpdh5,StoryTime56,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:22:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is when it comes to a spellsinger there really isn't much change between the different types. Traplords compared to Billy mays is a good example the slightly differ but effectively this is what you always have as a spellsinger. You need at least 11 points in sorc and song craft obvious reasons being both ten point passives. So they key way of playing a spellsinger is insane damage output as fast as possible which leads into get many cast time reductions and instant casts. So that covers a decent amount of those skill points but the biggest weakness is you don't have many ccs so to remedy that the only ones you can easily get involve startling strain and critical discord along with stalkers mark overwhelm shadows smite. Honestly the rest of the build is really up to your play style if your really good with setting deep freeze then incorporate frigid tracks and freezing arrow if not maybe just gods whips and instant casts. Imo the key spells I always have are flame bolt, insulating lens, arc lightning, chain lightning, freezing earth and gods whip along with range passive and damage passive for sorc. For song craft I always get critical discord startling ditty cast time reduction passive and zeal. Shadowplay my primary must haves being back drop and stealth.The rest is up to your play style try rotating different things till you find a nice niche."

Cause in KR every ACC is Linked to 1 specific ID (have to use your KSSN -  „Korea Social Security Number“ ) wich can easy be traced back to the User. That's why we have a Clientbased Game, Clientbased means that the Client on your Computer do the calculating job and send the Infos (like your movement and movespeed for example) to the Game Server wich synchronize it with the Game. Clientbased Games are cheaper for the Puplisher because it save up Serverresources.  In KR they don't care really muchabout cheating cause bans are much more evective ! The HackShild is added by XLG, cause the Game is not disgned to run Serverbased, wich is the main used System in West Games.  Serverbased means your Cumputer send all actions you do, like press ""W"" for move forward, press 2,3,5 ... for ""XY"" ability, the Server calculate and synchronize them."

archeage,3bk4tk,Trion_Celestrata,38,Mon Jun 29 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"The previous Community Manager was an abject failure in clearly communicating the state and direction of the game, anticipating the desires of the community, understanding the stated community goals, delivering those goals back to the designers, and virtually every other facet of clear communications that his job entailed.  1) There is rampant cheating and botting, to which Scapes uniformly left unclear boundaries as to what was considered the former, and ignored the latter. How will you clearly communicate the state of what is and is not considered cheating to the player base, and how will you better improve the response to rampant botting?  2) Scapes often made incorrect statements as to the game state with regards to new features, their quantity or qualities, and misrepresented or concealed elements of game design that were predictably upsetting to the player base. How will you improve transparency in changes to features that may upset players, and how will you improve the accuracy of reporting new features and changes from XL?  3) Scapes often hid from heated subjects and refused to comment in public forums during periods of intense stress for Trion, such as the failures of Auroria day launch. How will you ensure that you professionally represent Trion and the players to each other during future periods of immense stress?"
archeage,3bk4tk,ClusterFSCK,11,Tue Jun 30 02:43:02 2015 UTC,Please answer.  Very good questions.
archeage,3bk4tk,meepo4l,11,Tue Jun 30 04:25:45 2015 UTC,"So, let me try to answer these questions as best as I can. Please note that it is still my first day, as I haven't gotten back into the office as of yet. (Sitting here right now, enjoying some morning breakfast.)   I can already see that the community has a variety of questions regarding what can or cannot be done in certain aspects of the game. Already I've run across threads regarding in-game gambling, or using vehicles to block specific objectives.   The best answer I can give to you right now regarding things like this as a whole is to make sure that these items are passed along to both customer service and the internal team here so we can define policy on how we want to handle it. After that, we will endeavor to make sure that such messages are spread to the community in affected threads and, if the issue is important enough to the community as a whole, placed somewhere where all can easily find it.  In regards to the botting, I will investigate how the current reports are being handled. I do not know enough of how that's working right now, but I would encourage you to make use of any reporting tools so that the team is made aware. I can tell you that one of the first things I saw after sitting down at my desk yesterday morning was that customer service was handling botting reports from players.  Action is absolutely being taken against them.   I think the answer to this is we need to continue to improve how features are reported to the community. I'm not saying that all mistakes are going to go away over night -- please understand this may be a process. But clear, consistent communication is something I very much want to strive for. (If that's not clear by the amount of me posting in this thread. :D) We want to communicate things as clearly as possible and, if a mistake is made, we will attempt to correct it ASAP and notify players of the change. First of all, for this, let me say that it is never my intent to disappear from the sight of players. Sometimes I may vanish for a while as I'm chasing something down for you guys, but I'll at least leave a post on the forms stating that we're looking into it or that action is being taken. In those cases, my not being present is usually a good sign, as it means I'm talking to the right people and we're working together as a company.   Secondly, I think I should point back to my prior title, Infinite Crisis.We still had our moments of stress or frustration from community members. In those cases, what we did was make sure we communicated our thoughts and that we were reading and seeing what was going on and that we were forming plans around it. When those plans were ready to be shared, we shared them with the community. That's the same level of communication I want to make sure we bring here to you guys.  I hope that answers your questions clearly, and if you have more, please let me know. :)"
archeage,3bk4tk,ClusterFSCK,9,Tue Jun 30 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"With regards to (1), I have a 50/50 chance of a bot reported via the in game tool resulting in a response. My experience in reporting bots has been that the highest chance of success in removing bots is with a direct and public post in the forums. With a casual search of the general forums, you can find that such posts by others are frequent -- people complain that they have used reporting tools to report common bot locations and bots, but continue to see them there for days or weeks. Only after a post is made in the forums do the bots disappear, leading to the impression that the system relies on public shaming and embarrassment to get Trion to act, rather than dutiful use of in game tools.  With regards to cheating, there are long running bugs in the game, such as glitches for GHA that enable effortless defeats for every boss, which are not actioned. Other examples of glitched and/or bypassed PVE mechanics are:  a) AOE damage (Hasla Rift Boss),   b) damage immunity (Hounds of Kyrios),   c) attack line of sight or range (Morpheus, Hanure), and   d) multi-boss fights (Serpentis room 1, Hounds of Kyrios)  These mechanics are routinely bypassed via elevation changes, application of siege weapons,  glitching through world geometry/walls, and aggro dropping, respectively.   In addition to PVE mechanics that are glitched or bypassed, there are similar issues in strategies employed in PVP. Some are common enough to receive repeated discussion in the community and explicit acknowledgement and acceptance from Trion:  a) blocking vehicles and line of sight via hauler and skateboard physics  b) attacking ships by spinning other ships rapidly (blendering)  Other PVP strategies such as using harpoons to elevate (skyhook/bootstrap), throw (slingshot), and drop ships on each other, and use of mount jump acceleration to move well in excess of intended speeds (fast enough to catch ships, high enough to bypass siege walls in Auroria) are also known.   The widespread knowledge of these strategies and their use leads to the acceptance of the community to varying degrees, but there is no clear cut boundary as to which of these may result in bans or not. For example, a new application of a previously mentioned PVP mechanic (elevating a ship with its own harpoon), combined with a PVE strategy (elevation change to avoid worldboss AOE damage) led to a new strategy against the Kraken in the past week. Public awareness of this new strategy led to an out-of-game furor when an opposing faction observed it, and immediately tried to publically shame Trion into banning the users of the strategy, just as threads decrying hauler blocking have demanded the banning of players using it.  The expectation that public shaming works, combined with the series of unclear policies, and tacit or explicit acceptance of behaviors in game have sent unclear messages to the community where this new Kraken strategy was employed. There are bitter threads in the official and reddit forums about it, and widespread fear that players may be banned now, despite the clear set precedent these behaviors were acceptable before.   As community manager, how will you ensure that the community has clearer expectations of what is acceptable and what is not, to prevent the hostility, furor and fear currently wracking the server in question?"
archeage,3bk4tk,Lampyrinae,6,Tue Jun 30 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"Please address this, Celestrata. This is the biggest issue facing AA, in my opinion. I hope you don't feel like you're being greeted with overwhelming negativity, because I actually feel pretty optimistic. I think you've been communicative so far, and I'm hopeful that you can do better and achieve more than this position has in the past.  This is exactly what we need a community manager for. We need there to be clear expectations and rules, we need them to be thoughtful, and we need them to be implemented in a systematic way that isn't reactionary or driven by public pressure. Good luck! You can do it!"
archeage,3bk4tk,mattymillhouse,3,Tue Jun 30 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"So I can answer the botting information in full detail right now, as I was pulled into a great meeting about it this morning and I want to pass some of the information along. As to the exploit stuff, I'll bring it up with the team to get a better idea of what's going on here, and then I'll come back and we shall discuss.  So let's talk botting. The meeting I was in this morning involved both our Business Intelligence team, and our Customer Service team. Botting is something that both teams are taking very seriously, and we have been deploying automated systems to take care of bots before you guys ever see them, or before they really get in to the game too far.  Right now, our processes are catching and banning well over 1,000 accounts per day. The number moves depending on the day, of course, but it's almost always over 1000. So action is being taken against bots, and it's being taken daily.  Now everyone in this meeting this morning wants to continue to increase the efficiency of these processes. We know there is work to be done, and the whole group wants to keep improving the system so that it catches bots earlier and removes them from the game without you guys worrying.  But, I do also want to encourage you guys to continue reporting bots via the report tool. Not only will you get your bonus labor for successfully reporting a bot that gets banned, but those reports help us look into the botting issue as a whole. Simply put, when you report, that information goes to the appropriate teams here for them to investigate and help our internal efforts. Posting to the forums means that the information can get lost and is getting to the team via a very roundabout, inefficient method. (I.E., me sending the info by hand to the right teams for them to include it in their reports and scans.)  So that's the current state on our efforts against bots. As we continue to make progress, I'll keep letting you guys know in more official capacities."

It actually costs labor to report a bot in-game.  I understand that's so people don't go around trolling other players by reporting them for botting when they're not.  But I have used my labor points to report bots on several occasions, and I have never, ever gotten reimbursed for the labor I've spent, let alone received the labor reward.  That may be because I'm on at night (when bots seem to be most active), and there are no GMs online to follow up on those reports.  As a result, I've stopped reporting bots in game.  It's not worth it when a) it costs me labor to report them; and b) nobody at Trion ever seems to follow up on those reports.  I never get my labor back (let alone a reward), and the same players are out there botting every night for weeks thereafter.  If something in the process is going to change, please let us know.  If the process is going to change, 'd be happy to start reporting again.  But as it stands, it's just not worth it."

The good news is that we will be turning what was a smaller post into much more of a full post regarding our policy with exploits vs. creative game play. We'd like for this post to become a one-stop-shop type of post that you can always refer to for what is and is not allowed in ArcheAge.  Now the downside to this is the post is going through a few rounds of approvals with various teams to make sure we're appropriately covering our bases and so we can make everyone aware that this post exists. I've gotten answers on the exploits you covered and one or two more as of yesterday, and I will be penning the post early next week. After that, once it's written, it will go through the approvals process and we will hopefully have it to you by mid week. Obviously we're writing up a few other things too, including a report regarding what we're doing about bots, and updating the Server Evo FAQ.  But, please rest assured that this is being tackled, and we can't wait to get it out to you!"

archeage,3bk4tk,Masked_Tondede,3,Tue Jun 30 05:56:56 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest concerns for the game is the state of healers. Mostly our poor itemization (almost no good gear besides crafted, leading to higher expenses than any other classes), our tendency to get the shaft in events (Red Dragon's Blood not increasing healing power, Rum Runner drink stating it increased healing power when it increased healing effectiveness) and several of our skills being useless or underpowered (SKEWER, Mend heals are wonky, Antithesis as an attack scales off magic attack instead of healing power).   You stated you play healers frequently in games and have tried Inquisitor. What's your opinion on the state of healers in ArcheAge and can you share any information on the future that's coming for healers (info on Serpentis healing gear, maybe)?"
archeage,3bk4tk,Hasbotted,3,Mon Jun 29 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"Hello Celestrata, it’s nice to see Trion bringing on a fresh face to manage the community, I hope you are settling in well.  I wanted to get your opinion on a few topics if you don’t mind.     What is your personal thoughts on the current state of open world PvE, with special regard to the ease of interruption to content progression?  This may be a little vague from your point of view but a couple examples would be:    Preventing completion of the Abyssal Kraken by repeatedly destroying the guard stones. Halting Kraken by ramming ships and interrupting damage during the regeneration phase. Causing Anthalon to teleport wildly by being within 300 meters of him, ideally with characters who are logged out within range that are simply logged in to force the teleport.      How do you feel about the use of multiple computers or in some cases “virtual machines” to gain an advantage?  We know that running AA multiple times on a single machine is against the ToS, but setting up multiple computers is acceptable.  Regardless of the ethical implications this can afford several advantages, I will list a few examples below, what are your thoughts on this?   Running multiple machines in order to move large amounts of trade packs. Farming your alt accounts in 1v1 arena for “free” honor. Allowing the secondary account to be a full time “Song Bot” to increase farming rate.      Looking at the current state of the economy many people are concerned with the rate of inflation, and how that will increase the power gap across the player-base.  Do you see this as a potential problem, and if so how would you recommend Trion/XL Games address it?     I have several more topics I would love to hear about from you, but I have to get ready for work.  I look forward to hearing from you, and later I can provide a few more topics that I am sure people would appreciate getting your thoughts on.  Thanks in advance, I hope you have an excellent morning."
archeage,3bk4tk,Hasbotted,3,Wed Jul 1 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"Hello there Devoire! Good to meet you!  So on the first set of questions, I don't have personal opinions yet because I haven't gotten that far to experience said activities. That said, I probably never will have personal opinions on them, because when it comes to being a community voice, my personal opinion is moot. What matters to me is how the community as a whole feels about it, and those are the recommendations and feedback that should be carried back to the staff for consideration and possible later implementation.  Now, as to the use of multiple computers/VMs, Trion's policy on it is as follows: We are comfortable with people using multiple computers or virtual machines to play multiple characters in ArcheAge so long as it isn't assisted by software. If you are running a bot program, for instance, then it is in violation of our rules. However, if you are running multiple VMs and are actively tabbing over to each of them and manually putting in commands, you are fine to do that.  As to your final question, that's most certainly a deep one. While I don't have an answer for it, I would very much like more information to how you perceive it may not be in favor of newer players. That is information I would be happy to take to the team for a larger discussion.  I look forward to your later questions!  ~Cele"

archeage,3bk4tk,dnastynice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the prompt replies Cele.     I appreciate you explaining your methodology.  I believe it is crucial to have a link between the community and the publisher.  I understand that it will take time for you to actually play the game and understand it so that you can properly assess and convey what the community is asking for in a clear and concise manner as opposed to simply providing the cliff notes of which ever thread has the highest views.     Thank you for a formal clarification on Trions stance about VMware, while it is unfortunate that someone with a good VM setup will be able to take advantage of events like the Divine Event or the Regrade Charm event, I have to imagine it is difficult to police this therefor Trion has limited options.     The economy is definitively a deep topic, but to clarify I was not speaking specifically about how it effects just new players, but each server as a whole.  As an example: prior to you playing on Ollo there was an alliance that operated for 31 days with 130 active participants that generated 733,501 gold.  That is ~23.6k a day, which as it is gained simply make the process of acquiring said sum easier.  I am sure you can see how this leads to a snowball effect.     I think I speak for the majority of the community when I say we are happy to see the addition to the AA Team, and we are excited to see our concerns relayed to the higher ups and look forward to the responses you bring from them.  The game as a whole has many interesting aspects and as you learn about the game and experience them yourself I hope you enjoy them as much as we have.     Thank you for your time, and welcome to the community."

I wanted to know what your favourite aspects of the job are, what I might not expect, and briefly how you got into the job in the first place?"
archeage,3bk4tk,UnrequitedApathy,4,Tue Jun 30 00:15:45 2015 UTC,"Hey there Kaiser. What a great question!  So, first of all, you're doing all of the right steps to really get into community work. The moderation knowledge is key, and I and many others in the CM business were veteran guild leaders before we were CMs. Heck, some of us still are guild leaders. (I actually run a guild on Final Fantasy XIV still. It's only for my friends, but it's still leadership. :D We're dungeon fiends. I also roll on Destiny still with some friends too. Bladedancer 4 Life.)  So, favorite aspects of the job: I really love meeting people, and learning how everyone plays games. We all find our fun in different places, and it's been fascinating to see how people interact with the product you work on. It's also really amazing to see people find these redic ways to do crazy stuff in the game. (You people and your boats on land! SO CRAZY!)  I think what people frequently don't realize about community managers is that we frequently share in your triumphs, your sorrows, and the emotions you guys feel when you play. I love watching streams where people pull come from behind wins, or  when people finally get that regrade to work and not shatter the heck out of their item. Usually when stuff like that happens, I'm screaming right along with the person. I love seeing that.  What may you not expect? You're always on-call. When a server goes down at night, your phone will ring and you are expected to be up, be coherent, and be ready to inform the community of what's going on. Sometimes you pull long hours, and you work frequent weekends. There have been times when I was awake for almost two days straight. (The Infinite Crisis 24 hour stream. The entire prior day was devoted to prepping to launch and run the stream, and then the night after was us running the stream for 24 hours straight.) There were times when I was working 6 PM to 6 AM due to servers being down for days straight due to an update glitch. These things happen.  Plus, every trade show known to man runs on weekends. That usually means you may be working all week, flying out to hit a trade show, doing the show and working 12 hours straight per day, talking constantly and standing on the show floor, and then flying back and doing work on Monday. That's the job. It's a rush, but it's SUPER tiring. You gotta be prepped for that.  As to how I got into the job in the first place? Well, I worked with Massively.com (Now Massively Overpowered: http://massivelyop.com/), where I rose from a columnist to their Senior Editor/Community Manager. While there, I ended up meeting a whole bunch of people in the industry (like you do) and really started learning about community management officially. Eventually, a position opened up at Turbine, and I was super interested. I talked with Meghan ""Patience"" Jenks about it, as we had met multiple times at that point, and ended up finding out that she was the hiring manager. She and the community team (including Andy ""Frelorn"" Cataldo, Rick ""Sapience"" Heaton, and Amanda ""Tolero"" Grow) and others in the company put me through a battery of interview questions and situations, and I was lucky enough to be chosen for the job along with Jerry ""Cordovan"" Snook from the DDO Cast podcast.  And, in short, that's how I got into being CM, what you can expect, and what's just so awesome and intoxicating about the job."

I am one of a shocking large group of players that have tried to create outside content for this game and eventually gotten forum banned for simply posting on the wrong thread. That first 3 times I let it go and just made another forum account (which as against TOS i know). After the fourth time i gave up, i also stopped updating my website. I must say those players that continue to try to support this game have my utmost respect.   Forum accounts RIP:  UserNameSix - Banned for ""Multiple Accounts"" after posting that trion is missing the mark by restoring duped items to a certain pirate guild. This one frustrated me the most, i a spent many hours trying to help other players and give good information. My constant posts lead me to making archeagesite.com since so many people did not understand the game.   UnknownStrawberry - Banned for posting that they felt Brasse did a better jobs on the forum than Scapes (ban reason - Attack on Forum moderation).   Concerned - Banned for posting that they were concerned about the games direction and the constant forum bans being handed out. (Banned Reason - """").   Rip - Archeagesite.com. The only searchable guide website for archeage. It's still up for now but i'm done updating it, i can't get any presence on the forums since i can't make a forum account for longer than a week without it getting banned. The site was add free and paid for by me.   edit it may seem like if my accounts keep getting banned i must be an angry person that rages all over the forums. Search usernamsix's history.

archeage,3bk4tk,Villentrenmerth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:28:42 2015 UTC,"Hexblade is fun. I just specced out of it last week for the castle siege I attended. Note that you dont really have to commit to a specific class. Many of us have all the skill trees up to level 50 on our mains, which allows us to spec all over the map.   Ollo was a brave choice for a starting server. Just be aware that not all servers are like (tr)Ollo. The mischievous (emergent?) gameplay that occurs there can sometimes spill onto other servers, but it's not what the entire player base thrives on. (disclaimer: I've never played on Ollo, this is pure speculation based on forum posts)"
archeage,3bk4tk,tehNaniK,2,Tue Jun 30 20:10:41 2015 UTC,Show us your serious. Start with fixing event timing and  red charms.

archeage,3bk4tk,DeadWreck,3,Mon Jun 29 22:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think he was referencing how scarce Red Charms have become, causing the price to hyper inflate across all servers.

archeage,3bk4tk,Oskeros,2,Mon Jun 29 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"Abysaal Attack, Halcyona, and Mistmerrow events are found to be unpleasant with their choice of timing for both EU and NA players.   For example, 9 to 5 workers, wouldn't be able to play the major events that lead to important things like warrior medals, and some gold that is found to be slightly inflating the market."
archeage,3bk4tk,Isketam,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:03:43 2015 UTC,The Sea of graves event is at 5pm est it needs to be later in the evening 6-7+pm est(or later) . That way the 9-5 ers can come out and play. Also the time of the events Sea of graves event over laps with mist marrow event if it goes on for a long time. As for the halcyona event there is morning times mid day and evening. I dont see  a problem with those. Red charms are a scam crams dont work believe in RNG pray hard it will work.

I only work till 4 and even if I were to teleport home, I still miss it. From EU players it sounds like for them its around Midnight to 1AM. Why this time? Even an East coaster would struggle making it if they worked till 5. Most places don't have school get out till 3 or 3:30. It makes no sense. It's also odd you guys do your Live stream around then. So it makes me feel this is connected...  Please change the Sea of Graves time. It's literally the reason I came back to this game and because I can't go, I don't see a point anymore to continue to give you my money."

archeage,3bk4tk,PRSolja,2,Mon Jun 29 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"Hello Celestrata!  One of the biggest concerns I have when a deep game like this gets new management is how much game knowledge is usually lost. So to put us at ease, what are you doing to become an expert on ArcheAge? Are you trying to play for a certain number of hours a day, or talking to guild leaders, or watching guides perhaps?  And a follow-up: Is there something WE can do to help you become more knowledgeable about this game? A ""suggestions box"" somewhere, where players can list content that really should be played through to fully understand it, or something like that?  Or heck, for all I know you've been playing since launch and none of this is needed! Just let us know! =)"
archeage,3bk4tk,Godisgr8usa4life,2,Mon Jun 29 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"That's a great question, WhySoKyrios.  So, I can say that I was here for ArcheAge's beta and launch, but, as I said earlier, I didn't have a lot of time to play because I was focusing in on Infinite Crisis pretty hard. Now that I'm here, it's absolutely my intention to become a game expert. Members of the IC community can tell you that I was a pretty good player over there, and it's my intent to become the same here.  Of course this means time grinding up and really experiencing all of the content the game has to offer and that's A LOT OF CONTENT. LIKE AN INTENSE AMOUNT OF CONTENT LIKE WOAH.  I've already cracked past 20 on one character (the Hexblade), but I have another at 10 and another at 8. I've also been watching ArcheAge youtube clips, reading the various wikis out there, and visiting people's streams on Twitch, and this was all before my start date today! (My girlfriend was kinda angry that I'd keep flipping on AA videos during dinner instead of watching Northernlion like we always do. :D)  But, I'd love your advice if there's something I should do as a new player. What's a fast way to level? What are solid places that I should visit? Should I do dungeons or just quest as hard as possible? Etc.  Let me flip this around on you -- how would you welcome a new player to ArcheAge? Because, after all, these are things we'll need to do together if we want our community to grow!"
archeage,3bk4tk,Dualstar1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"Haha well as a masochistic solo player, I guess my first piece of advice for most people would be ""PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!!""  Seriously. This game isn't made for solo play, and you can't even DO large portions of the content without a decent group of frends/guildies to work with. Even while you're leveling, you're gonna start hitting PvP zones at level 30. At which point you'll be fresh meat for any bored 55 who happens along while you're just trying to kill your 10 damn rats.  As for the leveling itself, I hear the fastest way is to do all the easy zone quests (they chain together and guide you along) as quickly as possible while just relying on the quest gear to keep you alive. Be sure to chop/harvest/gather everything in sight as you're doing this. Using labor is a fantastic source of experience. Once you finish those and ding 50, you'll be able to do the Crimson Watch and the Ayanad Library dailies pretty quickly each day, freeing up the rest of your playtime for exploring endgame content.  At this point, you'll be able to pursue any combination of Farming, Crafting, Trade, PvE, and/or PvP. (In most cases, these things tend to coincide.)  Farming/Crafting/Trade: Go to your faction's Blue Salt hub (in lilyut hills or tigerspine mountains) and start the farming quests. These will introduce you to growing crops and animals, basic crafting, creating and delivering trade packs, and eventual land ownership.  PvP: Until you're level 55, you're at a severe disadvantage in PvP because of the way Block, Parry, and Evasion work. While you're getting there, try grouping up with some friends to do dungeons and get yourself some decent starter gear. You'll eventually want that godly-lookin' stuff you see on the auction house, but getting THAT requires money, which you don't have yet.  Making Money: Oh god, here it is. I'm sure there's a bunch of theories on this, so I'll stick to the basics. If you own land, awesome. Check the auction house to see what's in demand, grow it, and cash in. Or see what your best local trade route is and start crafting/running trade packs to get yourself a farm cart, to get yourself a ship, to build yourself a badass fleet. In between that (if you enjoy the mindless zen of grinding) find the easiest group of mobs that you can kill that drop prince's coinpurses, and kill enough of them to use your remaining daily labor opening those sweet sweet moneybags.  Oof, we're gettin' pretty wordy here. Um.. any questions? Reddit, you wanna jump in and tell me I'm wrong about a bunch'a stuff?  EDIT: Oh yeah! If you're into PvP at all, I highly recommend you find some friendly people of different classes and duel them a bunch, and have them explain each time exactly how they wiped the floor with you. The learning curve for PvP in this game is pretty intense, and a LOT of it has to do with being able to quickly recognize which class combinations have which moves and knowing what you should do to avoid/counter them."

archeage,3bo69q,GoodGuyRomex,2,Tue Jun 30 20:03:49 2015 UTC,T1-T3 is more for melee.  The T4-V2 line (Evanescent pieces) are archer focused but at that level they will cost around the price of an ephirium set.  Auroria Wildborn gear is pretty good option as well. Its usually pretty cheap too.
archeage,3bo69q,WyzeThawt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:13:30 2015 UTC,You want to upgrade it to Evanescent tier(T4 Obsidian) then it starts giving range attack and other buffs for archery.

archeage,3bn06i,dadon89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"Farm coinpurses.  About an hour of farming level 50-51 mobs in Auroria should burn about 2k labor for you.   Just never cap, because ever 5m you're not gaining any labor, you're losing out on gold.  There are better ways than coinpurses to make gold, it's just the easiest and safest way because you can't get your coinpurse gold stolen from you like trade packs."

archeage,3bn06i,WhySoKyrios,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what ""arcane set"" you have, but you may want to look at obsidian gear and work your way at getting a full set. The mats you need to craft these come from mobs in Auroria, so you would be gaining XP while you work on this project.   As for crafting, there are 21? professions, so you'll need to decide what you want to do here. What I do when I have excess labor, is buy Tax Certificates. The tax certs can be obtained from any player scarecrow or farm. They may be useless to you now if you dont own land. If you eventually plan to own land, they will be used to pay your taxes."

archeage,3bn06i,StealthHeals92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:12:21 2015 UTC,I bought gold from a clannie ...
archeage,3bn06i,Masteraya,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"F'sho, had to be something like that or else you are a moneymaking prodigy lol.   My point is are you even interested in farming/trading/coinpurses, or are you gonna buy gold whenever you need it and should we just focus on recommending pvp/event type stuff? =)  EDIT: For example, one of my favorite activities in this game is finding secret farms up in the hills, noting when they're going to mature, and then showing up to duel people for their crops when they come back to harvest them. It's a nice mix of PvP and ""farming"" that lets me make a small amount of gold without feeling like i'm playing friggin' Farmville. You also occasionally find huge Thunderstruck Tree farms, which are a nice chunk of experience if you pop a labor XP pot and chop 'em all down.   Another non-farming option would be diving down to the Sea of Drowned Love and searching for sunken treasure. You can make 12-20 gold every 45 min (nothing crazy) if you know what you're doing, but you run the risk of meeting other treasure hunters down there and/or being stopped on your way back to port to turn in your haul. It also uses next to no labor, so it's good for those low-labor days."
archeage,3bn06i,greatnesspew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, don't sit at labor cap. Pick a proficiency or two and start spending that labor! Craft or farm, do whatever you want. Also grinding coin purses is a great way to waste labor if you can't decide on a profession right now. :) Farm prince's, they have the archeum trees and regrade braziers that will fetch you a nice profit.  If you haven't joined a guild, join a guild!!! The best end-game content is only accessible when you have people to play with. There are lots of friendly guilds out there."

They make you tons of gold and you need a lot of labor to move a lot of packs. You have to plant a ton of mats to harvest which costs labor. Then making and turning in packs cost 140 total labor per pack. Also on my server atleast starships ingots go for a decent price. If you really have nothing else to use the labor on mine as much as you want, turn into ingots and sell on AH. But my question to you is, in 2 weeks time how have you got to level 50+ and have a full arcane set of obsidian gear?"

archeage,3bmpo8,executive313,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"A club is fun in main hand but he might do better with an obsidian shortspear. Obsidian shortspear gives both melee attack and healing power. The equip effect is cast time reduction and the hidden proc passive is -2000 physical defense penetration on target.   Off hand is still his choice.. he can get a sword or a cold anguish (katana). The katana gives nice stat effects as a stat stick, since the DPS on an off hand weapon does not count towards overall damage. The katana hidden proc passive is 100% chance of crit on next hit with 45 second cooldown (also increases crit rate for a few seconds after the critical hits)."

He also has some heals/attack boosts to deal extra dmg. I personally think it would be easier to lvl with then then darkrunner.
archeage,3bmpo8,FlippehFishes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:56:56 2015 UTC,I would suggest using a Obsidiand short spear (high dps and has healing for your songcraft) and cold anguish offhand. I would also take out your first passive in shadowplay and trade it for healing hymn in song craft for some more heals that are great for small group pvp.

archeage,3bnemh,TheDuckExtremist,2,Tue Jun 30 16:49:36 2015 UTC,"You have to keep in mind that the stats STR accessories give are miniscule compared to a full set of equipment. The extra STR you'll get with some Flame accessories, in my opinion, does not outweigh some of the benefits other type of accessories give. I'll go through what I use compared to their Flame counterparts though to give you an idea.  Necklace: Halcyona Necklace vs. Flame Necklace   Halcyona Necklace gives Stamina + Received Damage Reduction. The Flame necklace will give you more HP than Rank 10 (max) Halcyona Necklace will give you, but I personally really like having Damage Reduction. Stacked with 7/7 Stone Cloth passive, Wave Earrings, and a Rank 7 Necklace, you can easily get at least 8-10%+ of damage reduction which to me is more worth than the little bit of STR a Flame necklace can give. If you get a Rank 7+ Necklace, it also has an active which gives you a 1000+ HP (Increases at higher ranks) shield for about 3 seconds.   Ring: Dream Ring+Flame Ring   Dream Ring is pretty much BiS ring. Not only does it give you Stamina, but it increases your overall skill damage as well. If you can manage to get the Celestial-grade Flawless Dream Ring, the passive effect will help you do even more damage. In the second slot, I think the attack speed from the Flame Ring would be good for a Paladin, and I know one of my Paladin friends uses one. This is one accessory spot where I think Flame would be a good fit as Paladin.   Earring: Wave Earring+Wave Earring vs. Flame Earring+Flame Earring   Flame Earring passive gives increased Evasion which might help clutch dodging enemy skills, but like I mentioned for the necklace, I really like the damage reduction which comes from Wave Earrings. Damage reduction for me takes precedence over STR and the benefits it might give (A little bit of extra melee attack, increased parry rate, melee accuracy, block rate) because it's something guaranteed vs. relying on parry rate, block rate, etc. to survive/sustain. Gleaming Ayanad Earring - If you have a good group to run library dungeons with, you'll want to aim for these in one of your earring slots. They give extra Focus to get past an enemy's parry, evasion, block, etc., a little bit of Stamina, and increased heal rate. Like Dream Ring, you must go through several quests to get and upgrade them."

archeage,3blwry,ThePansAnOldMan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"Gear is an important factor, but it's true that Occultism, for most people, is an auxiliary damage tree. The better gear you have (weapon especially), the less damage you actually need to full combo someone to death, which is why exceptionally geared players can play things like Skullknight or Dreambreaker or Druid and do exceptionally well, despite not necessarily being spec'ed well for damage.  Well, basically, you're both correct."
archeage,3bkkcw,dante411x,3,Mon Jun 29 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"To make a little sense of why I did this. Recently, I tried regrading a katana. It went celestial 3 times, failed down to arcane from celestial twice and from unique once. All with charms and with resplendent scrolls. So I figured I'd attempt again. Auction House only had weapon regrades in stacks of 2, so I bought it, attempted divine. As you can see, it went celestial. So... I saw that other scroll in the bag and rage clicked it."
archeage,3bkkcw,CoinTweak,3,Tue Jun 30 02:26:35 2015 UTC,The RNG is real inside of you. The chance of a celestial breaking is much bigger than it degrading and the success chance of celestial is without scroll only 10%.

archeage,3bm0d5,Adephx,3,Tue Jun 30 08:32:10 2015 UTC,"Cheaper regrade and less resource failed if this weapon breaks in celestial regrade. You lose less obsidiaan materials. If you  regrade to ""celestial only"" from unique you will lose less when you sell it."
archeage,3bm0d5,mikromanus,2,Tue Jun 30 10:51:46 2015 UTC,"Regrade cost is cheaper at T1 and, like you said, there's a chance to ""crit"" a regrade while upgrading, so people aim for a good base grade at T1, like divine, and just pray they get epic or better while upgrading all the way up to T6."
archeage,3bm0d5,Oultra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:36:23 2015 UTC,Chance to upgrade from celestial and up is ridiculously small. I've only seen one screenshot of it happening during the time we've had obsidians.

archeage,3blxl9,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:27:25 2015 UTC,"For an Inquisitor, I would go Leather over Stone cloth. As a Battlerage+Shadowplay class, you typically want to do as much damage as you can.  For Argent, I've seen some people say to go Leather, but I personally run my Argent in Stone cloth because my playstyle focuses on the heals and sustain Stone cloth gives. If your playstyle is more DPS-y, you'd probably want to go Leather."

At that point can we fully say how we view this particular situation.  We want to be careful with how we judge things, and we want to better cement to you guys what is an exploit and what is creative use of gameplay elements. An exploit, to us, is an unintended use of gameplay mechanics that severely warps the game design in order to obtain an advantage. Exploits are usually clearly things that go above and beyond what should be allowed in the design -- I.E. Raising a ship hundreds of feet in the air in order to avoid damage yet still deal damage is a pretty big one. Clearly the ship is not intended to do that. :)  However, we do realize that there are situations in the game where you can gain an advantage through clever tactics. We as a team want to better clarify to you guys what is and is not allowed in terms of tactics and strategy."

archeage,3bkckd,NSUNDU,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:17:46 2015 UTC,Probably the same as most other mmo's. The 50 takes the mobs to 1% or near it then leaves the party the mobs die and all exp goes to the people in party
archeage,3bkckd,Taiphoz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah my friends do it , you need the leveler , the person to be leveled and some random that doesn't mind being in the group (so the group stays when the leveler leaves).  Essentially as you say I think the leveler just does the DPS then drops group. I think there may be a little more to the trick like not sure if the low level has to pull the mobs. Most servers have someone selling this as a service (can cost a few hundred for their time)  You can get to 50 in a couple hours if the leveler has great gear."
archeage,3bkckd,GGtesla,2,Tue Jun 30 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"Yes :) you need 3 people. One not near the area being farmed, to keep the party intact. Dps pulls mobs, xp taker kicks dps, dps kills mobs :)"

archeage,3bl0na,zDecoy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned above, Absorb Lifeforce is indeed shitty in PvP. I like the idea and would like to preserve it, but it is by no means necessary to use that specific spell in the final build, because it's just not viable."

archeage,3bl0na,Sweeneyton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, hey Sweeney!  Cabalist does sound interesting, actually. I'll probably give it a go, it's definitely one of the classes that I see less of in this game. What armor would you recommend for it? And then Scepter / Shield, I assume?"
archeage,3bl0na,Neoxide,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:21 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I'm not a caster so I wouldn't know the best gear for a cabalist.  A scepter/katana + Shield definitely.  For gear I'd assume lake cloth maybe mixed in with some obsidian cloth pieces you like the look of. Plenty of stam and int which is exactly what you're looking for with this class.  Depending on how many Battlerage users you run into, you might prefer to go the plate route, although your shield and defence skills will almost always be more than enough protection from melee users.  All depends on what you prefer I guess!"
archeage,3bl0na,Negative_Mojo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:38 2015 UTC,Thaumaturge comes to mind. It tanks both physical and magic damage very well. It converts damage taken into a heal every 36 seconds(?). With proper gear the class is great at outlasting others and dealing decent damage.

It's not ""physics"", it's not ""intended"" (seriously, how could you even begin to think the developers would be ok with flying untouchable galleon.)  It has nothing to do with the enemy guild not being able to touch you. It has to do with KRAKEN being able to touch you.   You should not be allowed to do a world boss without letting it touch you.

I was responding to several nacl who where doing nothing but insulting with every comment  it's what they say when they can't come up with any valid points. they derailed my post from it's original topic cause of that statement. ""that krakken weapons are not bis""  what can I say they like to have milk and cookies but call fall play and whine whenever someone else has milk and cookies  there guild consists of east and west players, majority of the core west came from a guild called blank that original formed to take on JQ back in the day, and they did so by mass recruitments. blanks guild numbered 3 times the size of any other guild on the server. the core members of that group left and went pirate as a result of newcomers to the guild getting loot over some of them. at the same time their guild leader basically quit the game, he was tired of playing, maybe he was tired of playing. I don't know  what issenryu quit for but watching him on stream talk about how egotistical that core group was, was kinda funny.   the majority of easterners that joined nacl was a group called senpai who at the time was working with the core from blank as well as westerners to kill krakken leaving either jq or xtinction out of the mix on different occasions. A war insued. senpai got tired of the fighting so they went pirate to circumvent the fighting.   these two groups then joined forces and decided to start doing krakken late at night when the majority of the server was logged off. calling it their peak hours (laughable)  when they started doing krakken the senpai and clockwork members now called nacl got help from nite raid from the east and banzai from the west.   they did this so called uncontested (being no ones online) times for quite some time. It has been their goal and agenda to deny anyone on the server content, and get help wherever they can by mass recruiting.   If your at all familiar with pirate side you have two pools of sources to recruit from. They continued to recruit more and still do. with the mass amounts of people who have left the game their pretty big no where near the size of blank back in the day but 70 active members online at any given time. plus provided help from other guilds who they then back stab. For example mdig helping them get anthalon when they couldnt once it was contested (ironically now their complaining about mdig)  seems the mix of hatred from being denied content for so long as senpai and the zerg like mind set of blank combination has created a group of petty pirates who will forego fighting any way they see fit."

Another good option would be the attack speed cloak from haunted chest. However it may be a while before you see one of those. I've farmed 110k larceny and have not gotten a single haunted chest.  The bounty hunter cloak adds +7 to all stats so its good for any class in the game.  As far as jewelry goes, you should be looking to get the highest tier gale rings possible, they have ignore defense passives which will level the playing field against plate wearers and demolish cloth wearers. You do not need to go out and get a Magnificent gale ring because the difference in the ignore defense is not enough between the tiers for me to justify it from a ""price to performance"" point of view. A dream ring is also an option, if you're going to be farming Serpentis for the cloak. The rest is up to you you could go for Flame earrings if you wanted to stack evasion, etc. The thing about Archeage that I love is there is no set way to play.

archeage,3bide1,Kojakski,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:15:57 2015 UTC,I find lerman and carmilla hard with pubs. Carmilla specifically with pub healers. And lerman just due to random aggro table shenanigans/misunderstandings.

archeage,3bide1,80WillPower08,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:05:56 2015 UTC,I always felt Carmilla was the hardest. Fangbow would bug sometimes but it was mostly just a gear check. Same with Lerman. I haven't done Serp in months since pre-55 but I'll have to go back in for that dream ring and see what's changed.
archeage,3bide1,Neoxide,2,Tue Jun 30 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"Lerman is a joke now that he doesn't remove your mana. Just use the Witchcraft 55 pet to eat the death debuff he does and keep wings rotation.  Fangbow is easy too, God's Whip trivializes the snakes, you can have 1 person do both groups.  Carmilla is for sure the hardest of the three, and arguably the hardest boss in Serpentis."

archeage,3bi2h8,Aramarth,8,Mon Jun 29 12:00:51 2015 UTC,"I think there is a pretty fair amount of PvE.  I would consider myself primarly a PvE player, but I'm not going to pretend to be top tier.  However there are a few people in my guild that really know their stuff, so it is great to be in that.   *Dungeons starting at level 18. They also provide daily rewards for taking lower levels through the dungeons, to keep you coming back.   *Level 50+ Dungeon (The Library) gets a bad rap because it's literally a grid of square rooms and you grind mobs, however it has some redeeming qualities in a good variety of quests and hidden rooms containing some high level bosses.  *Open world bosses, There are a boat load of these bosses and they can be a lot of fun.  Some can be done in a small party, some need two full raids (100 people), Then there are two naval warfare open world bosses, which are very difficult.  4 of the bosses can be captured and turned into battlepets, which is kinda cool.  And of course the bigger open world bosses may be contested by the opposite faction.   *Open world PvP events, There are two different types of daily wars.  Even though they are PvP oriented, they are a lot of fun for PvE players, because they are basically game mechanics that you are trying to complete before the other faction.   *Open world PvE events, There are Four different Rifts that happen everyday, they can be completely daily for a reward.  The first is primarly for lower level, but because of the reward, some higher levels will wipe it in 30 seconds.  The vast majority of the server will complete the biggest two of them for the base reward. However if you are in a PvE oriented guild you could gather enough people to complete the whole thing. The 4th leads to the world boss that requires about 100 people.  (InB4 ""My guild does it with 30"")  *Elaborate Quests.  There are a few quests that literally take you all over the world and include beating several world bosses, these are pretty cool and get you immersed in the content.   I hope you give it a shot."
archeage,3bi2h8,4_jacks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"The questing zones that are for level 30+ are all ""contested"" zones. So PVP can happen whether you like it or not. Contested areas theoretically cycle to a ""peace time"", where PVP is turned off after there are so many pvp deaths in the zone. I say theoretically since some of these zones rarely see peace since they dont always have much PVP going on in them.   That being said, there is a great economic aspect of the game that you can enjoy without having to ever enter any of the contested areas. And if you dont PVP, you might still find there is a thrill to be had exploring the dangerous seas, or dangerous zones across enemy lines.  On Tahyang (the official RP server) I've even run into groups of RPers while solo exploring the enemy continent. I have no idea what they were saying (I dont speak Nuian), but I hope running into a Haranyan added a bit of flavor to their journey, as they hopped off their horses and walked over to see what I was up to."
archeage,3bi2h8,marcopico,3,Mon Jun 29 19:50:26 2015 UTC,"A definite yes. I know people, and several guilds that do.   You'll have issues avoiding ArcheAge's ""PVP"". It probably relies heavily on the server you're on, and its location (NA, EU, asia servers etc). If your goal is PVE, my advice is you'd probably want to join a not so populated server.  Assuming you mean casual by ""standard"", I'll go ahead and say that the game offers just about everything, but raid/group, and PVP content (if you care for it).  If you can log on for ~2hrs, then you'd be able to experience GHA/Serpentis runs, and maybe some daily faction events. Not saying that people cant quickly summon a group and knock them out in <1hr.  As far as the point of ArcheAge, last I checked it was: ""Craft, Claim, Conquer."""
archeage,3bi2h8,AANeubie,2,Mon Jun 29 13:32:07 2015 UTC,Mostly frustration. It's btter to come into the game expecting pvp and expecting to get griefed. Many former wow players in my guild have quit because they couldn't handle pvp.

That being said, I really don't enjoy PvP at all, especially not in Archeage. You can't do anything in contested zones without getting killed, and usually camped.  I've tried to get back into the game, but if you want to go fully PvE based, you're not going to enjoy it. If you can stand the constant ganks and losing your stuff, then you'll be fine. I just personally don't enjoy that."

archeage,3bi2h8,horrible_at_names,3,Tue Jun 30 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"PVP is the point of Archeage.   I've been playing MMOs for about 16 years and I was never interested in PVP in any game that I play. Archeage changed all that. My goals switched from ""beat this boss to get better gear"" to ""get better gear to beat other players"". Now I don't think I could go back to ""beat boss for gear to beat bigger boss to get better gear to beat bigger boss, etc..."". The game still caters to PVE players in that there are many PVE activities that you can do to get gold to upgrade your gear (to beat other players)."
archeage,3bi2h8,darkscion0,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:11:30 2015 UTC,"There's lot's of stuff to do aside from PvP, but as has been said, there's no avoiding PvP. It's not a standard MMO- it's a sandbox hybrid. In other words- they give you a world full of stuff to do and it's up to you to be entertained. Up to 50 there's a PvE quest line for each faction. It's free to play. Check it out."

archeage,3bi2h8,shirtandpantsguy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"PvE is not Archeage's strong suit. There are a handful of your run-of-the-mill dungeons(at least one of which is completely exploitable through glitches) you can grind on the daily, static monster spawns that are more or less sprinkled with or without cause throughout the world, or finally world bosses that require a group or raid to defeat but don't really amount to anything more than a regular encounter besides providing a combat pet or maybe a weapon as a reward. After playing for a while, you realize all that PvE is there to help justify a game world that is really defined through player interaction including PvP. Really though if you want to just PvE there maybe better games that cater to that feature better than Archeage."

(Not including the dungeon differences between the factions) However I would suggest you try the game anyway! Archeage is very easy to find your self immersed in. You could always play 3D farm ville, join a guild and have a relaxing experience. PVP is what causes all the fuss about AA being P2W anyways."
archeage,3bi2h8,jay2017,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"I play almost every day and I almost never pvp. As much as pvp'ers declare this a pvp game it's only one aspect of the game. But like the many other aspects it's not something you can easily avoid. Everything is connected. If you are going to farm you are going to have people trying to cash in on your hard work. I was doing leviathan today and ended up getting chased by a pirate. we ran in circles for about 20 minutes before I lost him. It was exciting but if they had caught me it would have cost me some time and a few gold to repair my boat. Not that big of a deal. Just annoying. Removing pvp from the game would be bad as that's what makes the RISK in the games risk/reward system. So even though i don't pvp I still have fun outsmarting (trying to) the bad guys. Regardless, yes it is possible to play archeage without killing a single thing and still level just as fast as everyone else. My eu alt is in the 40s and has never killed a single thing. Just mining and crafting. Helps to be a patron though."
archeage,3bi2h8,awkwardvlog,-4,Wed Jul 1 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"No. The game was built around PvP. The only end game PvE in this game is only either level or to get better gear to PvP in.  Since you like PvE, you might enjoy the questing, tho I found the story lines to be boring, but once you hit 55 there wont be anything else to drive you to log back in except for PvP or making money to better your charater for PvP."

archeage,3bi9uo,RtuDtu,4,Mon Jun 29 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"1) Does it matter which server I choose? Is one server better than the other? If so why?   Its up to you. Im on Ollo and Spectre Alliance pretty much runs it. Its an alliance of 1 West guild, 2 East guilds and 1 or 2 Pirate guilds. East is really strong on the server right now.  I don't play on it but I do hear Kyrious is one the of most balanced and healthiest PvP servers on NA.   2) Specifically leveling to 50 will it help if I am a Patron and why? So far I've only been using my labour to open the bags I get from looting.   Yea. Patron gives 20% xp. If you plan to play the game and have the $15 I would say do it. Level cap is 55 now btw.   3) Leveling wise should I put money into crafting or just grind out the levels through questing? Really any advice for leveling will be great. If it is recommend I goto Kyrios I plan on switching to Paladin because I really don't want to level a caster.   Yea crafting will help you level so much faster (especially with professional vocation tonic and xp boost tonic) and make you some money by selling/using what ever you make.   4) I'm also looking for a helpful guild (first I need to know which server to choose). This game is terribly confusing and looking for a guild that has some patience.   Thats up to you. Good luck."

archeage,3bi9uo,WyzeThawt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:59:46 2015 UTC,completly up to you and the way you want to play the game.  personally i hate farming so id only buy it for flipping purposes. a house fit my needs and goals better so thats what i ended up buying.  600g isnt bad depending on where its at.  i remember when 16x16 were going to 1200g+ in even bad locations. the good old days...
archeage,3bi9uo,marcopico,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"Kyrios & Ollo are two of the most populated servers, so the land will be a hot commodity. You don't need land to play the game, however if land is important to you, or if you're expecting to own land if you pay patron, you'll have easier time finding land on other servers."
archeage,3bi9uo,JuicyCardboard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"When you're buying land. It means two things. You're either buying just the land it is on and placing your own design once they remove it. Or your buying both the land its on and the design. If you want 8x8 and 16x16 lands you can get them from quest lines. Also the price of land depends on its location, the type of land and your server."

archeage,3bi9uo,awkwardvlog,2,Thu Jul 2 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"Patron will help you level both in that spending labor grants xp and the base xp boost that comes with it. If you end up on a low pop server you may be subject to eventual server mergers. I wouldn't recommend wasting labor on low level purses. Maybe burn it at the end of the day on mining and craft the stone only into hereafter stones. I made a patron alt for the events that all just happened. He's level 45 right now with a few days before the patron on that account runs out. Granted there were several free 1k labor potions given to him from the recent event but still If I can get a character to 45 in three weeks of doing nothing but mining, chopping trees, making lumber, and hereafter stones than you shouldn't have any trouble getting to 50. I'm on arenzeb east which is a high pop server so land is a bit expensive here but not hard to get."
archeage,3bi9uo,voodoona,2,Mon Jun 29 14:02:03 2015 UTC,"1) Since you've not gotten very far in terms of levels, you could also switch servers if you want to keep your options open. Ollo and Kyrios are extremely populated and you will have a difficult time finding land. But I don't know your play style and what exactly looking to get out of the game. :)  2) Patron is a godsend. Increased labor cap + regen (10 labor/10 mins on AND offline) plus you can own land etc, etc... What WyzeThawt said.  3) Questing vs crafting is really a matter of what you want to occupy your time with- crafting can be boring and expensive, and you have more options and goals while leveling. Also through questing you can get armor upgrades and salvage those armors for materials to craft with, so...  4) Also like WyzeThawt said, the level cap is now 55. SO much more ""end-game"" content to be had. New ways to level past 50 once you reach that point. That being said, if you switch skill trees once you hit 50-55, leveling your new tree will take relatively less time than before.  5) As for the guild question...many guilds are looking for players who have already hit 50-55, but there are some who take in ""new"" people. Call it out in faction chat whenever you pick a server, I'm sure someone will have an invite for you. :) Every server has their crappy guilds, and every server has their legitimately helpful and welcoming guilds. You'll find one no matter where you go.  Not that I'm trying to scare you off or anything, but you should also check out this thread on the official forums if you decide to re-roll on a lower pop server:  http://forums.archeagegame.com/showthread.php?200196-OFFICIAL-SERVER-EVOLUTION-amp-FEEDBACK-THREAD-%28Mark-II%29"
archeage,3bi9uo,andletlive,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"On the note of switching servers, I'm a returning player myself (took a hiatus when my founder's patron expired, just returned 2 weeks ago), and I came back to a medium-populated Tahyang. It's the official RP server now, but that only affects gameplay as much as you want it to, good or bad. Medium population is ideal for me as a farmer and fisher primarily, and you can find land without too much effort. Plenty of pvp action if that's your thing, but also fairly easy to avoid too.  If you're looking for any perspective or are thinking of swapping to Tahyang, feel free to shoot me a pm. I just joined a re-forming guild and I/we'd be happy to bring you up to speed! I spend about half my time helping out guildies since we have a lot of new players, and the incumbents are knowledgeable.  With a high-leveled friend's or guild help you could easily grind from 1-50 in a matter of hours, and that goes for leveling any skill tree as well. By yourself (questing or grinding) it will take much longer. Hope you enjoy your return experience! I'm mostly loving it so far."

But the question you want to ask yourself is, do you want to hit 50 and have jack shit? Or do you want to hit 50 with gold, gear that you crafted that can be easily upgraded at 50. (Illustrious to obsidian or w/e) and other things? If you want stuff then I'd say get patron while leveling, do trade runs, get yourself a clipper, farm cart, some property to grow mats. I personally think that is the better way to go. But if not then don't get patron and power level to 50 and then do it all ;)"

archeage,3bjd85,calamdor,3,Mon Jun 29 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"Professional turtle farmer here.   With the gear you have I would recommend Abolisher. Auramancy take meditate for mana and shrug it off to combo with Defense's revitalizing shout.   As the earlier person mentioned hop on a mount with arrow ability and tag some turtles, find out how many you can safely take at once. Then put battle focus and spam Sunder Earth into Whirlwind and Tiger Strike. Use Bondbreaker for damage reduction as you start engaging the group of turtles. Standing in the Sunder Earth area will help with damage reduction as well."
archeage,3bjd85,Yashimasta,3,Mon Jun 29 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"This person knows how it works. I farm very similar to this. Abolisher with shortspear +shrug it off + revitilizing cheer will heal for a lot. I average 8-10k but i'm at divine T4.   The way i do it is pull, teleport away, start sunder earth, hit tiger strike (it will go off at the same time sunder earth is done so both hit at the same time), then whirlwind slash. Next is battle focus + bondbreaker. Spam tiger strike and whirlwind slash.   If things get a little hairy use redoubt, keep attacking until either cheer + shrug it off comes back or tp again. You can kill a lot of stuff very quickly this way."

If you're having trouble finding a proper library raid, you can still do the daily quests in a group of 4 or so quite fast. There are probably others in your situation, you could try finding others who need the daily quests, even if it isn't at the usual reset time.  other than that, experias work well, but are expensive. sometimes you can find cheap ones for sale on the AH if you're lucky."

archeage,3bjd85,Berdache,2,Tue Jun 30 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"This is not about solo farming library but I think you would be interested.  I will pretend you have not done any part of the Crimson Watch questline that starts with a guy by the bridge outside the Library. Drillmaster Raysen is the questgiver. The first quest he gives you is called 'A Test of Strength.' You go across the bridge and kill mobs to the left.  This is the beginning of a questline taking you all over Auroria both killing and collecting drops. I promise I am going somewhere with this so hear me out. While doing this questline the rewards for 15 of them, almost all, are a choice of an archeum crystal of any color which as you might guess really means 15 Sunlight Archeum Crystals by the end.  I know at least one quest also has 50 gold as monetary reward on top of the crystal. The one little part that starts to turn some people off to finishing this is the fact that to finish this questline you are required to create an obsidian weapon after a few quests, after a few more upgrade it to T2 and the final quest you need to upgrade one to T3.  There are a number of ways to get around this. The obsidians are BoE when made meaning a number of people on the quests could all share the same weapon to complete the quest and not have to make a new T3 weapon just to do a quest. This method has been mentioned numerous times on this subreddit.  Okay now for the reason to go through all this.  When you finish the last quest and recieve the Crimson Watch title, you unlock 5 daily quests in Sungold Fields and the same in Exeloch, although in Exeloch there is a sixth quest that has 4 parts.  So in reality you open up 10 killing mob quests, 40k xp each, the 4 part quest in Exeloch gives 70k each. When because you are getting slightly above 1k xp per kill in Sungold, 120 kills is another 120k xp. In Exeloch the mobs range from 3k to 6k xp (these numbers I couldnt swear by but I think I'm underestimating) and you kill about 180 mobs maybe more if you do all the Exeloch ones.  My estimation is 750k xp adding it all together, everyday.  This is not the only reason though. I end up with 250 prince coinpurses, 10 to 20 prince stolen bags and 1 to 4 prince scratched safes.  Not only more xp opening those, all the archeum of all types, braziers, archeum trees, money that you also end up with.  Reminder, these are Daily quests, not a one shot deal.  Sorry for the wall of text but I think this would suit you for soloing better than library in xp and reward.  Also nothing stopping you from still joining the Library raid for those quick 80k to 200k xp quests, if you wanted.  Any questions feel free to ask.  Everyone I have turned onto these dailies, most dont know they exist even when they had done the initial questline, everyone has continued trying to do them every day.  It only took 2 days and I got random Auroria armor drops in Exeloch too from the sheer number of mobs being killed. I am on my phone apologies for typos.  At least give this a try."

You can also stack a tower as high as you want, do this for the top one, and then remove all the boxes underneath it to get a box floating at any elevation.

archeage,3bi2nh,sparkle_dick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:24:17 2015 UTC,i agree with charms. for a while i swore by them. and back in the day weapon and armor regrade scrolls were less than 8g it was cheaper to just attempt 3 more times. then to shell out for a 40g charm. and then when regrade scrolls went up charms stayed the same due to steam credit card fraud.  Little scenario for you. i have a unique weapon. scroll costs 15g and the regrade cost is lets say 50g. it makes sense not to pay 220g on a yellow charm or god forbid 600g on a red charm. even with failures and downgrades i would have lost a ton more gold had i used those charms at every failure. i know this because ive done it. 32g to double your chances is awesome. it adds up a lot when you tack on 32g per try going from arcane to heroic and you do it 10 times thats an extra 320g where as with that 320g i can buy another 24 scrolls and just yolo it. and the stats look better on a 25% chance 34 times (i include the original 10) http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=34+attempts+at+25%25+chance vs 10 attempts at 50% chance http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+attempts+at+50%25+chance  But then again this is RNG we are talking about   also i apologize for formatting

I think yellows are about 220 and reds about 650.  However Superior Yellow versus Superior Red is almost a different story, at the present time there is such a large shortage of superior red regrade charms that the price is RIDICULOUS!

But a Resplendent is never ""needed"", only defined by your definition of ""need"". I wanted it to proc Legendary, but now one is unhappy with an Epic proc.  And I know on my cluster (NA AH1) Standard yellows are about 170-185g. So a lot of it does rely on the individuals bankroll.    Congrats on your Epic.   Thanks btw :D"

Red isn't always required :D   I was just saying that red isn't always required in the sense that resplendent isn't always required.  Had you known that you wouldn't proc a Legendary, you wouldn't of spent the resplendent.  But we never know!   If you fail with a superior yellow, you may wish you used a superior red instead, but that may have also fail.  We just never know.  We have to look at the prices and make a choice.   I just paid 175 gold for a standard yellow yesterday and went unique-->divine.  Very happy with that.  At current prices, I honestly would never advise regarding a unique with no charm!  Too risky for my blood.  Even if you are swimming in unique T1 obsidian weapons, why not sell one to buy some charms for the others.   All that said, trion could continue to nerf even the regular charms, making them not worth the money. We just never know."

Are you saying that if I HAD used a resplendent I COULD have proc'd a Legendary?   I did use a resplendent, lol. Why wouldn't someone use a resplendent regrade scroll if they are regrading a Divine+?

Now I'm in all celestial with an epic main weapon, I honestly had possibly 2 downgrades on my gear but none of my weapons ever downgraded.  I do always use charms over arcane and I'm slowly learning how lucky I was, been regrading a short spear and its downgraded from unique and celestial 3 times.  The only tip I have for regrading is never spam regrade, if you fail wait a while and don't regrade shit over celestial without expecting it to destroy because chances are it will. Also I highly reccomend having the gold to regrade something if it does go arcane  I'd badly want to regrade my epic if I ever had a superior red (not that they exist) but I won't because I'd quit the game."

I was absolutely going mad.   Wasted a good 7-8k gold over the span of one week as I stopped regrading for the day if I was having to much fails, in the end I sold the sword as an Arcane T1, fuck that shit, never going to regrade ever again. Could've bought a Divine T1 instead. :/  It's frustrating, gold does not just pour in left and right like those that rather use their creditcards, I grind purses, I do little alchemy here and there, run some packs if I have the labor for it, time and effort goes into getting this kind of gold but in the end it was all for nothing, weeks of effort gone down the drain.

archeage,3bhmwv,NgArclite,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:06:45 2015 UTC,the only point to going over the soft cap is so that you can mitigate potential puncture procs and def pen items. any good DR will be running both of those things. you could potentially weapon swap and start off with dual wield and IF the get the sleep or stun on you first simply switch to your shield so your physical mitigation goes back up.
archeage,3bhmwv,kimchizzle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:11:43 2015 UTC,A cap with flame leather or a cap with the game? Because I have 63% phys unbuffed. That's at 8950 def. With buffs I can get it to around 12-13k.
archeage,3bhmwv,arcticfox4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:13:51 2015 UTC,"physical cap within the game. at around 5k your physical def percentage gets dramatically reduced for more physical def added above that. for example, just because you have 45% physical mitigation at 5k def doesnt mean your physical mitigation will be 90% with 10k def."

Library earring, hlacy neck if it's t7+ otherwise eph flame. Wave ring and dream ring of course.  As far as armor goes, you have 2 options. Full stone set (cheaper) or 5 earth 2 obsidian (helm + shirt). Stat wise you'd gain a lot more health and healing power, while losing some mits. You can counter that by having higher tier gems in your armor.  Also don't forget toughness!!

archeage,3bf7r1,Clout-,2,Sun Jun 28 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"Trion has been recommending changes to the security backend to XL, and clearly some of those changes have been implemented. Khrolan hinted in the last livecast that they are preparing for another major crackdown on bots and cheaters, and one of the most prolific enablers of new bots and hacks has been the cracked network encryption and associated proxy out of Russia. Trion's last bot crackdown in Jan/Feb was proceeded by a lot of monitoring and changes to server code and several client DLLs.   I guarantee you that Norton is flagging this DLL due to behaviors related to new monitoring implemented by XL running in the administrative domain. It might be messing with the network connections of other programs. I wouldn't be surprised if it was scanning OS memory for certain programs or attempting to access other programs to check for certain behaviors. In any event, this flagging is indictive both that AA's security is shit, because it shouldn't need to be in administrator mode, and heuristic security tools agree because Trion/XL are having to work around the shitty AA design with administrator level hacks.  You take a risk in letting Norton except these files from protection, because there is a chance that these files were in fact modified by the same Russians who broke AA's encryption (they could have injected malicious code into the patch system). Whether or not you want to risk letting a Russian own your box versus give XL's minion (Trion) more money for XL's shitty design is up to you."

I find abolisher is a much easier and more forgiving class for both group PVP and purse farming.  When playing abo I run essentially all of my DR gear (mag des) but switch my cold anguish out for a T1 obs shield and my jury cape out for the auroria block cape.  So the gear transition for DR>Abo is very easy.

Leather is the new hype imo, but plate can be good too if you have +50 or +100 mdef gems. I'd say maybe try and get at least mag (epherium if you can afford) and go desert or flame(tanky dps).

I will go for mag or epherium as soon as i have v2 or v3 shortspear and a v2 shield. I think thats the way to go since the weapons are always the most superior thing in this game.  Thanks for your help :))"
archeage,3bfstx,Rengarun,2,Sun Jun 28 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/321263 That's the build I use.  You can swap out revitalizing cheer for something like fortress or imprison. Toughen is borderline useless, Ollo's is unreliable and there are generally better skills to get since you don't have a way to confirm the trip like an abolisher would with leech, so I'd stay away from those. As for vitalism, I take mend but that could get replaced for lasso, the last passive in defense, or even Whirlwind's Blessing. It costs so much mana but in small scale pvp the aoe heal and short duration lens is great.  You didn't ask for gear help but you're gonna get it god damnit. You want desert or obsidian leather. Don't wear plate, it would probably be better to grab plate for only leveling, but in archeage plate is just utter shit in group pvp unless you invest thousands of gold into gemming it or are going against solely physicals. Mildly physically gemmed leather is better than magically defense gemmed plate. (Compared to my auroria plate set I use for tanking serp and whatnot and my obsidian leather, I lose 8% physical damage mitigation and gain 27% magical damage mitigation so that stats don't lie!) You can go stone cloth, but you'll do so little damage that you may as well spec templar. The lack of strength will kill your parry, blocking, and melee accuracy so I personally wouldn't recommend it. Even though you have vitalism you still play the melee tank role. You are not a primary healer you just assist with some off-heals for yourself and perhaps another if the situation entails (that's why I pick up mend, pop it during a small fight and go back to beating on someone).  As for weapon, you don't really have much of a choice, while leveling you'll need a one-hand club, but as soon as you hit 50 grab an obsidian shortspear and obviously offhand a shield."

archeage,3bfstx,RtuDtu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:16:40 2015 UTC,I'm only lvl26 but I am leveling Palidin atm. What is the Paladin game style for both PvE and PvP? Are they desired? Are they easy to level?   I'm just looking for an overall opinion.
archeage,3bfstx,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:42:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Paladins are quite good in 1v1 PvP. They are also quite easy to level since Battlerage damage, Defense surviveability, and Vitalism sustain will get you through quests without much difficulty (Mana will be a slight issue though).  However, I think they are lacking in group PvE (Dungeons) and slightly in group PvP compared to other classes.  In group PvE/dungeons, other tank classes (Ex. Abolisher) outclass you as a tank, other DPS classes will most likely have better DPS than your DPS because they'll have another skill tree besides Vitalism to help augment their damage (Ex. Shadowplay, Auramancy), and you don't have Vitalism+Auramancy to be a core healer. Don't get me wrong, you're not completely useless and some groups would welcome an extra body, but in my opinion, other classes do what you do better.   For example, let's say a Serpentis group is looking for a tank. A Paladin and an Abolisher with equal gear want the spot. They'll probably choose the Abolisher over Paladin. Now le'ts say instead of a tank, they're looking for DPS. They'll probably choose a Primeval over Paladin. Healer spot, they'll choose a Templar over Paladin.  As for group PvP, Paladins are slightly lacking for mostly the same reasons as group PvE, but not quite in the same degree. You will be desired because people aren't really choosy about what class you are. You want to PvP? Sure bud, join the raid and wreck face because most of the time, if you're in a huge group, it doesn't really matter what class you are when you're zerg-ing down the other side.  But as I said before in the group PvE section, other classes do what you do better.   As a tank, you'd be the one engaging into the enemy and trying to get their attention on you as your group moves in. You can pop Imprison to isolate certain parts of the group, but any class with Defense can do that. You don't have much follow-up to an engage compared to, for example, a Defiler who can also do the Imprison trick, but in addition, can CC the hell out of the enemy which forces the enemy to, in a way, have to pay attention to the tank.  As DPS, unless you're geared to the teeth, you won't be bursting key targets (Healers) like say, a Darkrunner can. You also don't have the mobility/utility of Shadowplay to be sneaky, stealth out, and move to assassinate the next target. Once you're in the fray, you're there to stay.  As a healer, you don't have Vitalism+Auramancy core. You can still heal, just not as effectively as someone who has Thwart+full Inspire stacks to reduce heal cooldowns and Conversion Shield+Antithesis instacast combo.  So I guess ultimately in my opinion, Paladins shine when they can utilize their jack-of-all-trades status effectively (Ex. 1v1 Arena, solo grinding mobs), but once you start rolling in larger groups, your effectiveness drops compared to other classes which are more focused in one area."
archeage,3bfstx,RtuDtu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:10:57 2015 UTC,Would it the best way to level then when I hit 50 respec to a tank or healer and while I grind the last 5 levels I will also grind the skill line?
archeage,3bfstx,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, you were the one asking about levelling Templar.   Yes, I would level to 50 first as Paladin. Then from 50-55 when you're doing library raid dailies, you can respec to Templar and level your other skill.  Another thing to keep in mind, when you're levelling using labor (Crafting things), you can also switch to Templar to get that exp for your other skill tree. Just switch back to Paladin when you go to kill mobs again."
archeage,3bfstx,RtuDtu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:25:57 2015 UTC,TBH what keeps me from really playing this game is there are too many options. I like the idea of healing but I also want to roam and PvP.
archeage,3bfstx,Elaeagnifolia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:23:11 2015 UTC,"The options are what keep me playing. The way I play is to play whatever I'm in the mood for. If I feel like playing burst mage, I switch into a burst mage spec. If I feel like being a tanky healer, I switch and run around as that. The ability to not be stuck in one class is one of the things I really like.  Granted, I've been playing since launch, so I've played long enough to make enough gold/do enough dungeons to be able to have gear to switch around. It's not a good idea to spread your funds thin across multiple classes at the start, but the fact you can switch around later down the road is something you should keep in mind.  For example, I switch between a lot of healing-based classes. Argent (Battlerage/Vitalism/Auramancy) is my main class I run around in. I like the idea of being a core healer with Vitalism+Auramancy while being able to DPS if I get jumped on.  Sometimes I switch to Paladin if I want more surviveability. Other times I go Soothsayer (Shadowplay/Vitalism/Auramancy) because I like being a sneaky healer with the mobility and utility from Backdrop, Freerunner, Shadowstep, and Stealth. I've also gone a more passive Cleric (Songcraft/Vitalism/Auramancy) for dungeons when people need me or Templar when I want to be pretty much unkillable.  I should probably mention at this point that I levelled from 1-50 as a Tomb Warden (Songcraft/Defense/Auramancy). I never levelled Vitalism when initially levelling up, yet now I'm pretty much always a healer. If you're willing to put forth the effort to level everything else and earn the gold to buy the gear, you can pretty much be any class you want all on one character which is what appeals to me.  So level whatever you want. If you end up not liking Templar, you still have the option to level another skill tree and try another class without having to restart a new character."
archeage,3bfstx,executive313,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:18:13 2015 UTC,I would probably switch out that vitalism passive for the 55 point skill in defense. It will give you way more group utility and can help in 1v1 if you need to get someone off you to get time to cast a heal.

archeage,3bfstx,GunnerMC95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"The passive heal is almost unnoticeable and you get mettle from damage take as well as casting redoubt so building it twice as fast isn't needed.

I have no idea of what that would be (I never had to buy it) So try asking someone who has bought land for a mansion. Add that to the 5050, And you have your price.

Rather than sailing the boat around searching for it, you might want to pick a spot on on the pathing area and wait for it. Sailing around searching can end up taking longer as you may leave the area it's coming and move into the area it just left and/or run into reds.  The most ideal spot is probably where his pathing crosses, but that's also where you'll find the most people and possible reds. With my under geared alt I just pick a spot on the bottom right near the blue arrows. 4 days in a row that I hardly had to wait at all and no reds to interrupt.

Make sure you are using archeum or frozen wave fishing poles when normal sport fishing. Also key bind your fishing actions clicking REALLY slows down your catch. You should also pre cast big reel right before a fish locks in its action if it isn't big reel you can swap to the correct action easily if it is big reel you get a lot of free damage.
archeage,3bc8tx,LTKnuckles,5,Sat Jun 27 22:11:35 2015 UTC,"A little thing I discovered and am working on proving is the combinations the fish get is pseudo random, if it gets a certain 2 actions you can know 100% what the 3rd one will be.

Darkrunner can be good at farming purses yes, you can switch aura to witchcraft for playdead  if you have low gold; do serpentis, good armor for darkrunner.  if you have alot of gold; Delphinad flame or eph flame, can do flame/squall/lightning, which ever you prefer.  Shadowblade can farm purses good. kill however many mobs you can before you get low and then playdead. good in pvp too."

archeage,3badqb,turtlelord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"Cold Anguish is considered by most to be BiS offhand due to the passives.  You can use anything for your main hand but you don't need the +magic damage from the new katanas, better going with a passive for melee damage like hungering blade or something... I think that one gives you bloodthirst stacks.  Also check the damage types, things like axes cause bleeds which can interrupt your stun locks."

archeage,3b9b32,ZaxyPoxy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"This ain't inflation. Inflation doesn't go from 250 to 580 in just 3-4 weeks when it's been stable at 250-300 for 2-3 months. This is botters buying apex for their bots with too easy to obtain and unearned gold. Dirty gold is flooding the market.   Then there's speculators thinking that for a mere 40-50 gold profit per apex it's worth crashing the market for everyone and themselves after all. The profit ain't worth the consequences but I guess It's like deforestation.   And to top that off there was this divine coin event which made many rich people willing to purchase 30-50 apex to make 15-25 accounts so that they have that many chances to upgrade their gear and weapons. Sure, what's 15-20k gold in upgrading a 15k weapon without risking losing it, TWICE (at least), eliminating a pretty expectable loss of 45k (you'd have to buy one after being destroyed 2 times).  And now everyone thinks 500g - 600g , hell even 700g is the new apex value. It's not. We're in a bubble inflated by what I just mentioned."

archeage,3b9b32,Leviellazarev,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"You've got a few big things pushing apex prices still.   First, the unbreakable regrade charm. Since people didn't need to have patron to collect the boxes, but need patron to buy the charm, many players had a bunch of f2p accounts going and will buy apex to get patron for the charm.   Second, not nearly as much as the first, is the new superior tempering burnish. As its only there for loyalty, it yet again makes sense to get an alt account patron as merely logging it in every day for a month gets 3 of those burnishes. Same logic can be applied for lucky sun points. The extra labor received from the account over that month more than offsets the initial 2 apex purchase price.   Third, as always, new RNG boxes push apex price up."

The tl;dr of that is everyone loses land and has to land rush again. It's a good community, the pirate faction is finally getting a sizable group of people and there's fairly good event participation. It might be worth looking into the other servers that aren't being merged to see if you'd prefer them. Nothing is guaranteed but the safest are probably Kyrios, Tahyang/Ollo and Aranzeb in that order. Salphira I believe is also on the ""no merge"" list but it's subject to change and of all the servers on the list in my opinion it's the most likely to get merged."

They are hard to move though because you are basically selling to a guild or land baron for their pack storage. Most normal people don't need to stage dozens of packs for overseas trading.

archeage,3b8lk4,SwordOfCheese,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you. I don't have Poison Arrow, Shadowstep and Shadowsmite yet, but I'll be sure to take them. So far, I use Deadeye>Stalker's Mark>Charged Bolt>Piercing Shot, followed by Endless Arrows until that does the kill, or the Stalker's Mark does its damage. If that doesn't work, or I'm forced to get into melee, I use  Overwhelm>Bull Rush> couple of Rapid Strikes to build up Bloodthirst> Wallop, after which I Drop Back and repeat the first one."
archeage,3b8lk4,SwordOfCheese,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:46:29 2015 UTC,i suggest getting rid of the melee attacks and picking up shield bash and redoubt. shield bash to bull rush will knock them down and then you can backdrop to piercing shot which couples with knockdown i think

archeage,3b96wt,ipvpcrops,0,Sat Jun 27 06:53:31 2015 UTC,"Come to kyrios, community is quite active, significant updates with customisable ships, abyssal kraken and new leviathan event which has just been introduced. There was also an event not long ago which caused many players to proc higher grade gear, there were even some mythics in the bunch.   As for the economy it is undergoing slight inflation, but trion has said that they will be adressing this with more ways for players to spend gold and remove it from the game. For example Apex went back down to ~200g each and now it is back up to ~450g each. I woundn't be too concerened about this though if your ways of making money were decent when you left (unless it was fishing, fishing has been nerfed to hell). If you and your mate buy patron for a month it should be enough for you guys to get back on your feet. This is assuming that you: join a medium - large guild, participate in daily events and guild events, aim for at least 1 set of serpentis armor (they are still a great 3 sets). But ultimately you will enjoy this game if you just pvp and enjoy it even if you die."

If you want cheap land you can be certain to buy some in Auroria, keep in mind that your land there isnt very safe due to castle sieges (your land wont be yours if your governing castle is destroyed, i may be wrong about this fact, idk for sure). Also obviously you cant do pack storage there unless it is larders to freedich or via sea voyage. However there are more things happening in auroria nowdays so its probably good to have land there.

Working on getting a toon to 15 so I can link this to the moderators on the official forums. Mayhaps if they can find the 39 (10.1 gig) messup by recreating the problem and allowing Steam to do it's thing to check the difference, Trion/Glyph can patch the game for those that don't catch these threads.  And as for downloading it through Glyph, that's where the problem started. I finally deleted the Glyph version and downloaded the Steam version about 4 am my time and still had the issue, so didn't matter where I got it from. And according to the official forums, about 1/4 to 1/3 (possibly near to 1/2) of the people that got the saturday patch is suffering this issue now.  This is just a Steam fix.

With that being said, the easiest way to get gold requires patronage. Honestly, $15 dollar up front is very worth it in my opinion.  then you'll earn labors offline at 2880/24 hrs on BOTH NA server group and EU group. That's 5760 labors in total a day!  You also get loyalty tokens for just logging in. At the rate that we're paying for Lucky Sunpoints now (500g/100 loyal tokens), you basically get 2 free Apexes by just logging in NA and EU per day. What you do with your free labor is up to you.  Long term investments are good. I find planting Radiant Archeum trees in Auroria to be quite profitable and it doesn't require much time. Grinding prince's coinpurse, open them for trees, plant, profit. Don't even really need a hauler for that.  So i'd get a piece of land in heedmar or somewhere with mineral water and farm those archeum trees."
archeage,3b7ck2,paixism,3,Fri Jun 26 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"listen to this man. if you want patron, buy the first month, cancel reoccurring payment and buy next months with apex.  its 20 times easier to have patron and keep it vs. grinding to buy those first 2 apex at this point in the game.

archeage,3b7ck2,WyzeThawt,3,Fri Jun 26 16:36:44 2015 UTC,lol dont add more challanges to the game. its easy enough to fall behind the people who pay anyway.  fishing is harder now to return with your catch. its not as reliable as before 1.7a.  mining is good but doesnt directly have too many options to make money. you can sell the stone straight up (probably your best bet until patron) or make them into hereafter stones and make a bit more money it takes about 7k LP to turn 1k raw stone into 333 hereafter stones.  id recommend spending all 5k labor mining then in 2 days (if you had patron) you can start the process to crafting and finish the next day. i wouldnt buy workers comps for this unless straight from marketplace.

On the other hand, the letter was mailed to me at 1 AM CDT along with a message in Chat telling me that a Whale Hunt letter had been delivered to me. Whether or not this differs from person to person, I do not know.  But like you said, official word from Trion themselves would be best if we want to be completely clear."

archeage,3b3lfb,Novezz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:38:57 2015 UTC,It seems to be very low chance.

archeage,3b3lfb,mauledbypandas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:41:48 2015 UTC,Considering how much obsidian gets regraded at t1 (full set's etc) I'd say this is the lowest RNG in the game

Personally its not all that often I'd use the cloak on the mount, if one person is after me I generally fight , if its a group even if you did stealth dash for a few seconds and loose los, then stand still and stealth chances are they will find you and you're screwed.   Note: I generally play shadow play classes , if I was a healer or class with no stealth the horse stealth would be more appealing , but as a shadow play class if I can dash out of sight I can get off my horse stealth then actually continue moving   It sure does look sweet though"

The reason is the P2W marketplace and the gambler's rng boxes. As I understand it, loads of people have quit for exactly those reasons, so I am not alone in thinking this system is bullshit. I am against the principle that an otherwise awesome game should be funded exclusively by pay-2-win whales and people with obvious gambling issues. I (and a lot of other players) would be ready to pour our money into this game through subscriptions and cosmetic items...  So yeah, to get back to my original point, the only reason this game is so screwed is that when the game's company offers shit like RNG boxes, there are people who actually buy that crap. Don't worry, if you didn't buy them they'd still have decent ways to make money like so many rpgs have done before them and will do after them. (subs, cosmetic items shops etc)"

I keep giving this advice but everyone says I'm wrong.   Pick one proficiency and stick with it, get it to 180k for that 26% Discount.    Too many people I know (especially those playing 4+ hours everyday) grow every material they need, harvest it all, craft all their packs, run there trade runs, craft all their gear, grow mats for pots, craft all their pots.  It's ridiculous they are popping labour pots on 4 accounts to keep up with it all, and even when they have a high proficiency in one profession, they are sitting at 30-50k in 6 or 7 other professions that they are actively using everyday.    Granted they will be OP in a year, if they eat enough snowflakes, but you literally have to play 4+ hours a day to support that.   I have one proficiency I use for income.  Any mat that isn't in that proficiency, I purchase from guildies or from the AH.  When prices are low, I can afford to sell, because 26% discount.  When prices are good, I make that much more than all the other sellers.   That's just a rant and a general guideline, not a golden rule written in stone.  I have a secondary proficiency I mess around with, hoping to get it to 180k soon.  And I have an alt account who is almost 180k in a proficiency to support my main account.  I also got larcency up to 80k farming up my cape, cause well, I'm not throwing away coin purses.  But you see my point hopefully."

archeage,3b52jx,Guccicakes,2,Fri Jun 26 02:14:30 2015 UTC,"4k is the price of an epherium right now, on Kyrios at least, which as I'm sure you are aware is required to make a T4. Added to that are quite an extensive list of untradeable materials, 1 salvaged mag valued at 300-400g, and 2 salvaged illustrious at 200-300g, and you're looking at 4700-5k bare minimum green T4, if you're lucky. For a divine, you're probably looking at around 8k. Delph is better than T4 (equivalent to T5 in terms of dps) but can be hard to find, especially desert or flame, and will likely cost you 8-10k, for a celestial.  TLDR: T4 8k, Delph 8-10k. If you are sure you'll stick with the T4, and plan to get it to T5, it is the better choice for the passives it gives, but is significantly more expensive than a delph at T5."

However, the weapon procs for katanas, swords, and shortspears are generally more desirable than the bleed effect from axes. If you can get the axes significantly cheaper, though, go for it, any weapon will be viable at delph level or higher."

archeage,3b52jx,Faddler,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:46:49 2015 UTC,I consider value of obi weapons as:  T1 value + cumulative value of salvaged weapons put in since.   Ofcourse when going divine+ that value increases dramatically and can only be identified by looking for similar items on the AH.  In the end though its all supply and demand so the value of the item might be significantly lower than what it costs to make purely for lack of people buying it. Also ephirium and delph values appear to have risen  (when I made my T4 only had to pay 1.5k for ephirium sword).

archeage,3b5ali,ElDooby,3,Fri Jun 26 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"First, get your Patron back. Find a decent guild, which can help you to reach your goals. Then, make more gold, by playing with ah price, coinpurses (that you can take while doing library), selling fidelity items, fishing, packs (you can try the abyssal one), selling APEX or w/e. While you're earning golds, do library raids for dailies or and also look for a group to grind to 55. Use your gold to buy new gear. Atm, you can get correct gear by crafting obsidian.  For amor, check the Obsidian Amor, make it, and upgrade it at t4/t3. You can get only 5 parts (Breeches - fist - torso - boots - helm), so try to take Belt and guard in epherium, auroria (cheap) or loot them in Serpentis for example, especialy if you're an archer, Serpentis is not bad for you.  For the weap, try to get obsidian t4 too, will not cost you so much if you found the epherium version for your weap for cheap. Start with bow if you playing archer, then make the dagger for example, or just the weap you fill ok with your gameplay/spec. Also do events (Halcyona/Mistmerrow) to get Warrior's Medal, will be useful for your instrument that you can craft with 500 medals.  For Jewelry, try to take Illustrious one, not that expensive. Take 2 earing, a necklace and rings. But i recommand you to take the Serpentis ring, will save you some money, and if you want, you can also make the Halcyona necklace or Library earing (forgot the name, ayanad something).  I'm not a pro, also gearing myself atm cause i stopped the game for a moment, but i gave you most of my advices. Good luck."
archeage,3b5ali,Maiqbestplayerworld,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:29:15 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this post:  Armor: to craft obsidian you need either salvaged illustrious/mag and some materials that can be looted from mobs in Sungold fields. As an archer you want the T4 cap.  Weapons: to craft obsidian you need either salvaged illustrious/mag and some materials that can be looted from mobs in Auroria. As an archer you want the obs dagger or short spear (I been told)  T4 and upwards need material from Serpentis (which is easier to complete now) and world bosses.   I think its easier to buy jewellery than it is to make it yourself. Get the heroic dream ring, get T6 Halc necklace.   Archeum sapplings will drop from the purses you farm, so you can try and find land in Auroria (or rent) to grow them or sell them.  Join a raid and do the Leviathan daily - who knows, you might get an Eph Volcano bow. As /u/Maiqbestplayerworld  has mentioned, do Halc, Mist, CR, GR. All these help with gearing.  You'll probably here people say that archers are not effective any more. That's up to you to decide. But if you even for once think that you might roll a mage - get the 7 set cloth from Serp. There is something coming the near future that allows you to combine all those pieces into one wrist piece and it becomes BIS for casters.  Can't think of anything more to write about at this point. Good luck."

archeage,3b5ali,Black_Sheep_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:36:30 2015 UTC,"My personal advice is - research how active your server is - and if you are on a not so active server I would advice you to reroll on a mother server ( esp as you are not that invested in yours) use the money you got to either buy patron or buy workers ( I would buy 1 month patron ( 2 apex and spend the rest on WC ). As soon as you got patron create an alt on the other realm ( na / EU ) as these don't share the same labor pool, but safe the same credit pool you can buy you apex there. For classes - melees are the easiest to gear to be decent effective followed by mages ( as they benefit from the t1 to t3obs armor) followed by archers / healers ( need t4 to be effective)"

Lots of xp; it will make your journey to 55 a little less painful.  There are also experia patches (check your folio under husbandry, gathering, logging, and farming) that reward you with a large amount of xp upon harvest. Those cost gold to craft though, and you obviously need land to plant them, so library bosses will suit you better for now. :)"

But no, $150 and it's yours.   Even if I had $150 to spare on a video game, i wouldn't get this new pack. It feels like cheating.   Trion has been removing or replacing in-game content with marketplace items, patch after patch after patch. Where is the effort? What are our goals in this game if we can just pay our way through it?  I love this game, there's nothing out there that comes close to it, XL games really found the right formula, but it seems that Trion is just taking advantage of this. Content is not being aimed at players anymore, at least not to those who care about the game.   Trion, if you're reading; do you want to kill ArcheAge? Because this is how you kill ArcheAge.  /rant"

That is when it hit me... I am not investing in anything. If anything, I'd need it just to keep up with whales. I am at a point in my life where I could easily drop $150 on this, but I am also saving up for a house. Didn't the last big pack only come out 3 months ago?  When does it end? Will there be a new pack in three months with another tempting overpowered stat item? Big box games only charge $40-50 for actual content expansion packs. I almost freaking bought the thing when I realized that anytime I see someone wearing that costume or see that pet I'd say ""Oh, I see you also once had one hundred and fifty dollars"" and people will see me and just assume I am a whale. I think this is lose-lose for everyone but Trion. Maybe if people throw a stink they'll put it in the game somehow. Actual content would be cool..."

But my main thought is Trion should bring other battlepets up to this level, instead of nerfing this pet down.  Right now, you really don't see a lot of people USING their battlepets.  In fact, go to the library and see a lot of battlepets standing in a corner, even at level 40+.  Mainly because normal battlepets don't offer that much of a benefit.  They do a little extra DPS or trip, but they are extremely squishy when attacked, and you have to deal with always  tripping over them."

O.o  The pet buff is such a minuscule thing compared to how big the buffs from the costume would have been (like they are in KR & RU).   I actually really like the pet. Has some nice abilities. The +1200 HP and MP is a bit but you have to remember having that pet out sacrifices being able to ride a mount or anything and it has to be within 15 meters of the player to get the buff.

For multiple boxes now they have either nerfed the drop rate or COMPLETELY REMOVED them contrary to what they said they would do.  Now we have a system in place where they're simply trying to slow the rate of legit regrades to higher tiers, yet they introduce events like the unbreakable charm that has caused more of my friends to quit ArcheAge than anything before it -including the disastrous Auroria launch.

This gives incentive for people to exploit and honestly I see no reason at all for superior reds to be ultra rare. Honestly superior red's are part of the economy money sink. I have 2 epic weapons, some day I'd consider regrading them if superior reds were cheap and chances are my gamble would result in a destroyed weapon thus removing a valuable weapon from the market.  I may also mention XL designed the game intending those charms to be in the market place as they are in Korea, people would still buy them making money for the company, at current drop rates I'd rather buy gold from a gold seller to purchase a superior red than try and get one from a RNG box."

Id personally stick with darkrunner as archery didnt get as much added fluff as melee and magic with lvl 55 cap rasie. aslo darkrunner arent as armor reliant as other classes. you just need really good weapons which will save some money on your build (at least for now) and you can still be relevant in pvp.  also this game is highly pvp focused at 50+. if you dont like PvP you just cut out 75% of the activities to do. even with trying to do PvE things, i can guarentee that spontanious PvP will happen all the time in war zones, on the water and in auroria."

archeage,3b26tb,Riliify,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely get to 55. The best place (And most boring unfortunately) is the library, found in Diamond Shores, you can get there via either Cinderstone or Ynystere. You can typically find a raid to run it at least once a day, though. However, there are also Crimson Watch quests that run you through building an Obsidian weapon and the net rewards for those quests is something like 250g and 5-6 archeum crystals of your choice (I recommend sunlight).  Darkrunner is a good class, but rather than a dagger you should look into obsidian weapons that have bonuses you like. If you take the mats set aside for your dagger and use it to build an obsidian weapon instead (requires a salvaged illustrious weapon of that type) you can save out on having to grind Hasla for weapons and get a weapon that you can continue to upgrade. If you do make an obsidian weapon, try and get it to at least unique before upgrading it to further tiers. Most darkrunners either go dual wield for higher sustained damage, or 2 handed for more ""burst"" damage, depends on your playstyle. I recommend a weapon because that will have a much larger effect on how you perform in both pvp and pve than a full suit of armor will.  I don't recommend getting the cutter right now. Boats are a massive gold sink and until you have a steady income you can use to upgrade them they simply aren't worth using. Speaking of income, find a good way to get gold. Look at trade packs and find out which ones are cheap to make and easy to run, or you can try fishing. If you don't have patron, I highly, highly recommend using that money you have saved to get 2 Apex and purchase patron status with the credits you get from using them."

If you start from scratch ... well ... then you have to make compromises.  Just one thing in advance. templars are healers. they are not doing good dps ... well at least i couldn't imagine how they would do any dps. maybe s/o can help with that?  Imho you need to level step by step. I am speaking from experience since templar is my main class. As a new player, finding groups might be difficult so a solo level build is required. Furthermore tanks are always needed, so sth tanky would be good. And the last thing: your most important lvl 55 skill is the vita aura. def is also good but not as needed and auramancy is crap for a viable templar. so vita skilltree has to be in at all times.  my suggestion:   paladin (vita, def, battle) from lvl 1-50 focus on plate gear with str in it. templar (vita, def, aura) from 51-55 focus on cloth gear and a good shield / 1h club (obsidian weapons e.g.)   you will quickly catch up with the aura tree in the library because exp is stupidly good in there. here are the builds i came up with:   to 50: paladin build 55: templar build   hope it helps"

archeage,3b2g59,Elaeagnifolia,3,Fri Jun 26 09:53:22 2015 UTC,"What would be the best way to level and when would be a good time to respec to a templar?   Personally, I would recommend Argent (Battlerage / Vitalism / Auramancy). Battlerage is a solid DPS class to level and since it sounds like you're looking to heal in the end-game, I would keep Vitalism + Auramancy to level. When you hit library to level to 55, you can easily switch out Battlerage for other classes you might want to level (Ex. Defense, Shadowplay, Songcraft) while maintaining your core healer role.   When you're levelling, I would spec mainly into Battlerage for DPS while grabbing helpful things in Vitalism/Auramancy on the way. For example, this build is what I would have at Level 25. You have all the damaging moves you can get so far in Battlerage+good passive, a few healing skills to help keep you alive against mobs, and the benefits of Auramancy (Thwart Inspire stacks + Inspire passive increase your attack speed = more DPS and also lower healing CDs, Conversion Shield + Antithesis for emergency heals, Teleport for mobility, and Health Lift is there just so you can get the Inspire passive. Extra HP doesn't hurt either.).  /u/ayumuuu's suggestion of an Abolisher is pretty good as well, just you won't be healing others as much once you hit 50 since you'll still be levelling Vitalism.      Also what gear should I level in? Plate, Leather??    Plate Armor will provide you the most protection fighting against mobs as you level. However, when you hit end-game, I know most healers in general work towards a Stone Cloth set.   The stats the set gives are Spirit (Increases healing power) and Stamina (Increases HP) while also giving good passives (4 Piece Passive - Increases Physical Defense, something Cloth usually lacks. 7 Piece Passive - Decreases All Received Damage by X%). Here's the Magnificent Stone Set as an example: http://archeagedatabase.net/us/itemset/14/      What weps should I use?   When you're levelling, this depends on what you level as. If you're going Abolisher, you want 1H Sword+Shield so you can utilize both Battlerage and Defense skills. If you choose Argent, I would go for the Greatclub since, in my opinion, it has sufficient DPS to smack mobs while also having healing power for sustain against them.  End-game, you want to aim for an Obsidian Shortspear or some type of 1H Club + Shield. Obsidian Shortspear if you want to do slightly more DPS at the cost of slightly stronger heals vs. 1H clubs which usually have more healing power for the same cost but not as much DPS.  On that note, I should mention that a Templar's strong point is in the sustain/surviveability and not the DPS. You do not have the DPS of a Darkrunner or burst mage, and quite frankly, outside of maybe 3-4 Defense skills, you don't really have any damaging moves. Once those are on cooldown, you are a sitting duck with almost 0 DPS (excluding auto attacks). An unkillable sititng duck for the most part, but still a duck. <(  o )      I also found this build for templar, http://2p.com/8980530_1/Popular-Class-Guide-ArcheAge-LV50-Templar-Heal--Tank-Build-by-Duly.htm is that a decent build?   One thing you should keep in mind is that that guide was written before the level cap was raised to 55, so it is slightly outdated in the sense that it uses a smaller amount of skill points than what is currently available at max level.     That being said, the builds are decent for 50, but here's a compilation of Level 55 Templar builds I've used off the top of my head.   Main ""Well-Rounded"" Build - http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/320376    This is my ""well-rounded"" build I usually use. It's tanky, has the benefits of Auramancy, and the core healing skills. One thing I want to mention, I see most builds/people take the 2nd Passive in Vitalism, but to be honest, I'm not a fan. It procs at the wildest times, rarely when I need it, and I find the skill point better spent elsewhere (In this case, an extra point in Auramancy). It all depends on personal preference though, so feel free to try it out when you're finding a build you like.    PvE Healer (Ex. Dungeons) - http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/320380    When you're not the tank where all damage is focused on you, you can afford to be a little more support-y by grabbing buffs to buff your party. This is what this build aims for. Protective Wings in Auramancy is also dependent on where you're healing. For example, in Serpentis, Wings is pretty much a requirement whereas in some other PvE instances, it's not needed as much if at all. Meditate to keep your mana up.    PvE Tank - http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/320382 or http://archeagedatabase.net/us/calc/320383    This is when you're the one that dungeon boss is giving an ugly look at. Yeah, he sees you and wants to take you down. This build hopefully will make sure that doesn't happen. I've linked two different builds which I've seen used before. The difference in the two builds is Vicious Implosion + Revitalizing Cheer vs. Thwart + Inspire Passive. The first one adds in Vicious Implosion (Skill which can help maintain aggro) and another self-heal in Revitalizing Cheer for surviveability. Second one makes all your healing skills have lower CD increasing sustain/surviveability as long as you maintain your Inspire stacks.      This...became a little more lengthier than I intended, but hopefully it helps. If you have any other questions for anything I've written or in general, feel free to ask."
archeage,3b2g59,ayumuuu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Abolisher is a good pick.  Then when you hit 50 and can get in a library group, switch Battlerage to Vitalism.    I've seen Templars in Plate and Cloth.  Leveling in Plate is easiest because 90% of the mobs deal physical damage and Auramancy can make up for your lack of magic resist a bit.  When you start getting PvP gear I would suggest cloth, although some templars still opt for plate.  It just depends on how you want to build it.    As for builds, not sure, I'm not one myself."
archeage,3b2g59,DHTs,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"You can level moderately fast as a templar with the right set up, but it'll be faster if you go abolisher. Questing is a very fast way to level, especially if you are grouped. You do not do great sustained dps, but a templar can burst down a monster pretty quick with the following chain: Antithesis -> Conversion shield -> Shield slam -> Bull rush -> Antithesis -> kick a few times (You probably won't have anything else to attack with anyway) -> Boastful roar. This will be enough to kill most mobs flat out, and anything that it doesn't will be very low on health afterwords.  Weapons, you will want a one handed club while leveling if you are a templar because you don't heal for shit without the healing bonuses. Once you are 50+, look into getting obsidian shortspears and their upgrades. For armor, you will eventually want stone cloth gemmed out with physical defense gems, but for leveling up you can grab plate for the quest rewards. You have conversion shield and silence on bull rush for the few times you need to take care of magic damage mobs.  Both of those builds you linked are amazingly terrible.  For a level 55 tanky templar, I would use this build, replacing agro gen with boastful roar for pvp. This gets you all the important heals and healing related skills and all the important agro gen and tanking skills.   Go for something like this if you want to be a pure support type."
archeage,3b2g59,mauledbypandas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:58 2015 UTC,I leveled up as Boneweaver (Sorcery/Auramancy/Vitalism) with cloth using staff from quest rewards.  I like being a caster.  You can also use Shaman (Sorcery/Witchcraft/Vitalism) but it really depends on  how you want to play. Shaman has a self heal but can get a little mana hungry.  Boneweaver you can swap to a greatclub to heal yourself and use Meditate from Auramancy to keep your mana up.  Once you get 50 you can switch to Cabalist to level up defense in the library if you want or just get a group as a healer.
archeage,3b2g59,Frostbiteftw,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:59:58 2015 UTC,Honestly I went from like 23 to 50 in like 4 days of normal playing best thing I figured out was crafting hereafters from 35 to 45 then do hasla to 50 currently working on Crimson.    With Templar u can tank and kill mobs although slowly 7-10 Lvls above u also boastful roar plus shrug it off not bad damage

We're finalizing the hard limit but it will be much faster than anything else on the road and will be uniform among the three cars. This change will likely arrive in the next build we receive but may take a little time to test and apply.  Thanks for keeping your feedback civil and on-point, really helped us convey that a change was warranted!"

archeage,3b14yo,buttreynolds,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"As /u/buttreynolds pointed out, it's likely that this is the effect of the new speed cap when it interacts with water physics. Increasing the speed cap should have the inverse effect."
archeage,3b14yo,_Scapes_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"previously it was set to 0 cap, so depending on how its programmed, it may still have a net slowing effect when in water after all of the changes are said and done  lets say it reduces its max speed by 75% while submerged,  .25 * 0 would result in no slowdown (old version), but even with a cap of 30, you'd be slowed down to .25*30 = 7.5 max speed which might be what people are experiencing and will continue to experience  i dont know i cant see the code im just doom and glooming"
archeage,3b1twh,Spaclos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:50:19 2015 UTC,"It would be good to know what class you are playing, but ill try anyway. If you are very low on money try starting with Greater Howling Abyss to get basic gear. Then you should start working on obsidian weapons and armor. If you are a mage you might wanna go for the Serpentis cloth since it is epherium level and basicly free."
archeage,3b1twh,Cosmic_Accident,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:34:17 2015 UTC,"Now you can buy some Auroria set pieces. They are very cheap (50-60g per piece) and provide great value for the money. You can also run GHA and get gear from there.  After that you have Magnificent/Epherium/Delphinad/Ayanad gear. Ayanad being the best craftable gear in the game. There is also Obsidian gear which has 6 Tiers, which is quite convenient since you just buy one piece and upgrade it as you go. T4 Obsidian for example is Epherium+ level. T5 is Delphinad-ish and T6 is slightly below Ayanad.  If you are sure you will be playing your class for a long time, it would be a wise choice to buy T1 Obsidian gear (Each piece should cost you about 300g, but you can farm Auroria and craft it yourself for slightly cheaper - it doesn't require any professional mastery). If you choose to do this, keep in mind that your gear is untradeable UNLESS you upgrade it to the next level and don't equip it.  There's also Serpentis gear, but I'm not sure where that fits in. The problem with Serpentis is you'd need to find a guild that runs it and hope you get the drops you need which can be annoying.  That's pretty much it.  For example I am lvl 51 in Hasla & Karkasse & Auroria atm. For the past 2 weeks I wasn't sure what I wanted to play so I didn't commit to any gear. I have now decided to play Blighter. So I'm saving up for a Delphinad weapon. Preferably a Celestial/Divine one. That will probably cost me around 10k gold."
archeage,3b1twh,Spaclos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:37:00 2015 UTC,"Divine will probably be more than 10k but depending on server cluster and ofc typ of weapon you should get a celestial for 8-9k. As a melee though you might wanna consider going for a Divine katana. It gives you great flexibilty for burst classes, mage and you can even tank with it, though if you want to go pure tank then a sword would be best for the parry rate."
archeage,3b1twh,Cosmic_Accident,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:39:24 2015 UTC,I was considering a Flame or Desert Katana. I want the hidden passive. Wouldn't the magic damage be stupid though? This is assuming you are talking about the Obsidian Katana.
archeage,3b1twh,Spaclos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:24:13 2015 UTC,the magic damage and cast time reduction is basicly free. If you get a T5 Katana its basicly a Delphinad earth katana which can be easily divine and earth gives more tankyness than flame or desert + if you ever decide to reroll you have a really good caster weapon. A t4 divine kata costs only a little bit more than a celestial delphi katana and has the same dps with potential to upgrade it agian.
archeage,3b1twh,Cosmic_Accident,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:36:32 2015 UTC,"But with the new tempers, wouldn't the STR on say a flame katana make it better? Plus can't I resell the Delphinad if I decide to reroll? I kinda wanna do damage as a blighter. Kill things. Not be someone who just sits there soaking damage and nothing else."
archeage,3b1twh,Spaclos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:53:59 2015 UTC,"the tempering burnishes only increase the dps not the stats on the items, also the stats on weapons are rather irrelevant, if you get more stamina on a weapon you can go for more dmg on other item slots and vice versa. Yes a Delphinad is resellable but delphinads are not as desireable anymore than they used to be because you can easily get a divine t4 or t5. A t4 divine will have the same dps as a celestial delphinad meaning you do same damage and you have the chance to upgrade it to t5 meaning you get even more damage than with a celestial delphinad"

archeage,3b1twh,WyzeThawt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"your class and  any other info would be helpful for us be more specific.  Weapon is generally a better 1st focus as a fresh 50, unless you stickly tank and damage/healing power isnt a goal. obviously dont know your class so no specific recommendations.  In general, auroria gear is rather cheap and quickest way to become relevant in PvP as a fresh 50 without too much money.  If you have no money, then GHA set is good start but you will want to regrade it to at least heroic before going to serpentis and getting that set.  Crafted armor is good but you need to aim for at least Magnificent at i higher regrade. ideally obsidian t3 and above or Ephirium are better options but they start getting expensive.  Instrament is next, it is typically a stat item so whatever you need to add to is good tho obsidian lute and flute provide extra magic and physical damgage protections, respectively.  next worry about jewlery. dont be scared to get tiers lower than illustious. if you check their stats an bouses arent too far off as long as they are higher regrades. just do your research and math out the benifit per gold spent."

This business about doing hasla and GHA is silly, you will get one shot as easily in GHA as you would in quest gear, it is simply a waste of time. To be competitive, you will need at least unique+ epherium+ gear (or T3+ obsidian if the stats work for your class) and a celestial+ delphinad+ weapon (or t4/t5+ if obsidian works for you).

Ignoring inflation, we can say that the charms are going up from lack of Supply, without much change to demand. But as far as apexes, they've been pushed up by a number of things. Shatingon's Sand being one of them, for a long time, and up to this patch apexes had a base value of 400g (400 sands in 1 apex), that is what initially pushed apexes this high, in combination with inflation. However the continual increase now that it is gone could be for several reasons, mostly because we haven't given it enough time to observe how the supply and demand is effected by the lack of breaking ships being worth while.   A sadistic part of me would think that players are simply supplying less and less of these RL $$-> Credit/In-game item and thus it's the supply portion of the equation falling short due to a displeased / quitting player base."
archeage,3b1amz,Evensin,4,Thu Jun 25 04:54:59 2015 UTC,"You forgot one of the most important reasons why APEX is priced at what it is right now. The Divine Blessings event which led to many people using APEX to patron up their alt accounts to have more chances to upgrade their weapons. It increased from 270g almost 3 weeks ago, up to 400-450g last week. And It's fluctuation again right now due to lack of supply because of the new packs. ""Whales"" as you call them, are buying the $149 packs instead of APEX because of the overpowered pet and the costume. The red hauler ticket is equivalent to 2 APEX already which they can keep or sell. Their budget has been used and we will have to wait until that refreshes.  As for charms, it is what Evensin said. The lack of supply mixed with the constant demand. Red regrade charms were drops from these RNG boxes, however the supply was still not good enough."

archeage,3b0wsd,MiWickham,5,Thu Jun 25 02:04:46 2015 UTC,"At its most fundamental level, it's an MMORPG. A roleplaying game online with other people. What separates ArcheAge from other MMORPGs that are available right now is that its boundaries are less strict and it leaves a lot to the player.     There are few invisible walls in the game and its seamless world allows you to explore pretty much anything you can see. The beginner quests give you a run-down of various activities you can get into, like crafting, trading, PvP, PvE, sailing the seas, etc, but then it stops holding your hand and sets you free.       I believe ArcheAge hearkens back to a time when roleplaying games were really about having the player interact with the world and making it their own. There are people that call it more of a themepark than a sandbox game, which is true to an extent. But compared to something like FFXIV, ArcheAge gives you far more tools and opportunities to do what you want in the game rather than do what the game wants.     When I see water, I think ""sweet, let's go swimming"" and the game allows me to do that. It lets me dive down and fight monsters underneath or search for treasure on the ocean floor. If I see a mountain, I think ""I'm going to climb that"" and when I reach the top, there's a mysterious object up there that turns out to be part of an elaborate quest chain. If I see a group of people ready to ship off to another continent across the ocean, I ask if I can hitch a ride and off we go.      Granted, some features are not as fully fleshed out as I wish they were, but the fact that they're there widens possibilities far more than in other MMOs I've played. Other games feel almost claustrophobic in comparison. And even after playing for nearly a year, I still find new things on ArcheAge. Just recently, I found a Steve Jobs memorial on a beach with a half-eaten apple.      You waste a lot of time on ArcheAge, especially if you're playing F2P. But I've yet to not find a way to waste more time in this game when I actually play."

It made me imagine a massive intricate world with flourishing overseas trade.    Imagine if there was a huge population, not limited to 3 continents.  Imagine if the outer boundaries of the 3 continents we have were not landlocked.  This game has the potential to be incredible.  Sadly, I am just not sure if it will ever get to that point."
archeage,3b0wsd,bubbler_,3,Thu Jun 25 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"To me it's like a second job. But even when I call it my second job, it's just because this game is addictive. I never understood people who were so addicted to WoW, that they completely forgot real life. Now I'm kind of experiencing the same, I think.  What I currently do in the game then?  For money: I have a farm land in Windscour (Haranya), I grow larders in there. Larders are a type of tradepacks that you can turn in for gold in certain locations of the continent. The amount of gold depends on how many maps/areas you have to cross from your land to the gold trader. So when I take my Windscour larders (aged packs) to Ynystere, I get 25g per pack (that's 7 area's in total). If I took a normal tradepack from Ynystere to Falcorth, it would give me only 12g (6 area's). The latter route is shorter, but still larders give you more money. Here's a spreadsheet that I use to compare tradepack prices. I have a farm hauler that I use to transfer packs, I can carry 7 packs at a time.  The other money source would be pirating/stealing, which I really don't do that much anymore. You can steal packs from reds from your own continent harbor, kill your own faction people in PVP zones, pirate on the sea and what else. Sometimes you can even find a tradepack from the bottom of the ocean when someone unlucky had died for seabugs or other players.  Getting geared. If you don't have real life money to drop in the game by buying APEX's with rl money and selling them for gold, then tradepacks are your best friends (and enemies at the same time). Finish the story questline and you get pretty decent gear. Currently the cheapest gear that you can get after hitting 50 is to craft obsidian armor and weapons. They give you nice equip effect, that normal crafted armor/weapon pieces might not give. All obsidian gear is bind on equip though.  If questing is boring, go explore the map. There are tons of achievements that you can get, even hidden ones (tick the first option to see all the hidden achievements on the map). You might find Clubhead Fungus bush's that are worth quite a decent amount of gold.  When you have geared up (even to illustrious), you can try arena's for honor points or then PVP'ing in PVP zones, even at the sea! If you're more a PVE'er, then find yourself a group for Serpentis or other dungeons for awesome loot! Even better if you're already part of a guild that does the same kind of stuff that you like to do.  Get new titles (silly texts infront of your name), level up your proficiencies for better change for rare drops related to the proficiency, farm coinpurses for money, farm Auroria mobs for super rare cloak drops, go fishing with a raid, do silly things with your guild or random people, check out all the dungeons, participate on world boss killing raids, craft things to make money, go on a traderun for more money, chat with other awesome people in the faction chat or then go help a new player with their quests. Only the sky is the limit in this game.  There's just so much to do in this game, that's why I call it my second job. I spend most of my free time in this game, doing all kinds of things with my guild. Sometimes there are days when you just can't find anything interesting to do, but then it just means that you need to go do something in real life.  Also, anyone who tells you this game is pay to win, don't listen to them. It is pay to win if you decide so. Some people rather spend their real life money in the game to get more gold, instead of doing traderuns and other things that gets you gold eventually. Those people are usually people who work most of the day and only have few hours to play, but still want to get geared to PVP. There's a cash shop that really only gives you cosmetics; mounts, costumes, dye's for costumes and sometimes upgrade tickets that are mostly cosmetic changes on things.  Best of luck with everything in this awesome game! Hopefully you find a way to fall in love with it."
archeage,3b0wsd,GrowlingMoose,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, it's a huge help. Everyone's said some really awesome stuff here that's given me good perspective. I'm having a much easier time enjoying myself now!"
archeage,3b0wsd,DHTs,2,Thu Jun 25 19:39:08 2015 UTC,"Lore while questing is extensive. Lore afterwords is virtually non-existent. I have no idea why any of the dungeons are in the game, or who 90% of the NPCs are or why I should give a shit about them. Areas where lore is obviously intended to be, like the bookstands in Hadir farm or GHA, have a single page that is repeated for each one. Failure of translation or what, I don't know, but supposedly if you actually want to know anything you need to read the books the game is based on.  Raids and world bosses are pretty weak compared to virtually every other MMO in existence. Not only do you typically need more people for them, they drop 1-2 items at most for your group of 25+ people, and most of those people are going to be sitting there doing very little but holding down their one skill which gives them reliable dps.  I guess most people play for the pvp and the risk / reward of getting gold, but I feel there are much better games. I played because my friends invited me, and continue to play because this is where they are. I have enjoyed basically every other MMO I've ever played far more than this game, and I honestly don't understand how it got off the ground in the first place."
archeage,3b0wsd,Vyntares,2,Thu Jun 25 06:54:20 2015 UTC,"Things I love about Archeage   Knowledge = Power.  The game sets you up to discover information, and people keep it to themselves to gain economic leverage.  e.g. When do the trade pack prices go up?  What second does the traders drop prices? (leverage to max pack margins).  Where are those rare spores/shells (fill in blank) and what time are they ready to harvest (there is an in game tooltip timer on each)?  Where is that 1000gp trade pack from the ocean floor headed to? Freedom of movement - The landscape is both large and beautiful, and you can explore all of it. Mountains, underwater, over seas. It is all connected, no loading/transition screens (except when going in a dungeon).  If you can see it - you can reach it.  (1) Large enough that there are many routes to go from point ""A"" to point ""B"" to avoid an enemy, or to get to a place faster.  (2) Large enough that you can actually have hidden farms in open world, and not have it be discovered for days or weeks. Variety/unpredictability - The world changes because of player interactions.  The housing zones are always changing.  The open world has both game generated, and player generated items on it (this includes annoying blockades).  If you travel the land, it will not look ""exactly"" the same every time - this keeps things fresh. .Total Class/skillpoint freedom.  Want to try out a new build, or you see something your opponent is using that you think is OP?  Try it yourself. ""Mini/mind-games"" within the game.  Example:  A friend found a hidden tree farm in enemy territory with some very expensive items on it.  He picked it every day on the minute it fruited at some weird time of day (making tons of gp), leaving the original planter no chance to pick it.  The original planter then spent resources to destroy his own farm one day, under the premise of ""if I can't have it, no one else can"".  PvP via fruit gathering, where the opponents never saw each other!  Trade pack runs for money are a mini racing game, with both landscape and PVP challenges.  There are blockades for economic gain, pirating/raiding/stealing (or playing defense against same), etc. Incentive for PvP - many of the most valuable items can only be obtained in or through a PvP zone.  There is a fairly balanced and strong economic incentive to be both a hunter and the chased target, and there is a thrill in being both, sometimes in the same trade run/event/incidence!.  (Too many games tilt too much in favor of either the hunter or the target, killing the entire environment)"
archeage,3b0wsd,Instakilla8,6,Thu Jun 25 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"Archeage is focused around large scale PVP, naval combat, a unique trade system, land ownership, among other things.   You can go out and quest if you want ( I highly recommend you finish at least the storyline quest, if you're into reading it's alright but main drawing point is the amount of Gilda Stars(A rare curreny) you make from doing it), but overall the game is focused around the quest. It shows, too, as most every level 49 or below quest is go kill x of these, collect y of this, go talk to this person, rinse and repeat. Lvl 50+ quests are usually fun, though most are dailies.  I haven't really gone into the lore too much, but I understand it's substantial. Not great by any means, and if you don't like reading, don't expect to be too immersed in the games lore.  While some guilds roleplay, there are no dedicated servers for roleplaying like in Tera. Not much roleplaying goes on here.  The game is about a lot of things, especially crafting and owning land. Crafting is huge in this game and it's how you acquire the best gear. Owning a house can be fun, and farming is enjoyable for some. Exploration, while not overly important or rewarding, is fun. Especially with the right skill trees and a glider, you can go just about anywhere.  Game is special to me because of the Naval Combat and trade system. Going into the ocean is the best part of the game for me. Make sure you find a guild that will go to war with you! Trading is also cool, I love sneaking around everywhere and getting packs over to dangerous places.   Hope the game is able to grab you. Really you have to bear with it for the first while, since the questing is quite bad. Give it time, it becomes super fun."
archeage,3b0wsd,awkwardvlog,0,Thu Jun 25 02:48:53 2015 UTC,It's a lot like modded minecraft. You can buy land grow crops deliver goods and what ever. But you can also go out and steal those goods that are being delivered. You get to decide what you enjoy without being forced a long a path. For a lot of people who are used to mmorpgs they can't get into it because there is no hamster wheel nudging them along. Most of us find a way to earn money (secret) and then we invest that money into good gear. Me I just buy dumb things but I have fun. You can play the game entirely in the safe zones but more and more you'll find yourself compelled to go out in to the wide world. Usually for financial reasons but sometimes just for fun. If you've ever played minecraft its not that open. but its similar in that you kind of have to find your own way to have fun. This could be a giant financial simulator or realtor simulator or you could just go out and fight other players all day. It's your choice nobody is going to hold your hand though. The game can get down right brutal at times.

So i decide to uninstall everything related to glyph and Archeage and clear out all temp files and then uninstall avast. After restarting my computer and then reinstalling Archeage i am only met with failure and tears. After about 5-10 minutes of gameplay i get disconnected followed by the ""disconnected by the gods"" message. This happens every single time without fail even with numerous restarts and reinstalls. I would put it down to my connection but it seems extremely unlikely that this would happen to 4 different people at the exact same time with similar circumstances.  I then try a system restore too last week and then work from there making sure that avast would never have a part in the installation and updating process. This didn't work. I then get rid of all my antivirus programs and then turned off my firewall and opened every single one of my routers ports, inbound and outbound TCP and UDP. Doesn't work.   So quite frankly i have no idea what the problem is and i am hoping that it is a problem serverside. I've not tried reinstalling windows and starting from scratch and i would rather not as it is a massive hassle.  Hope this gets attention."

P.Ss plz close all your ports (that you don't need open) and turn your firewall back on 0_o

I'm using MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials) and have Archeage allowed incoming and outbound through my Firewall.  I even tried turning on Game Booster and still getting disconnected every ten minutes of play time, so I'm not going to play anymore tonight.  I'm hoping it's a Hackshield error in which there may be some fix somewhere.  It seems right now that it isn't just because Game Booster didn't help at all, but we'll see.  Hang in there brother!  I'd love for us to be able to play here soon."

I even went to the extreme of formatting my PC and switching out HDD's just in case it was back sectors fucking with my terrible RNG.   I did everything that i was asked on the support chat. And now this morning I installed ArcheAge straight through Glyph. And its working absolutely fine.

Please help me send a message to XL Games and Trion that exorbitent prices like this, and blatant pay-to-win architecture will not be endorsed by the majority of the player base. I know it can be difficult, especially since these items are actually cool, even more so since you'll be at a disadvantage by not buying it. But just know this: every time someone pays these rediculous prices, the makers of Archeage get another reason to make the next pack just as rediculous."
archeage,3ayz3e,I_Never_Lie_II,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"to play devils advocate a bit...  It could be argued that playing the game at all endorses others spending their money. You might not pay with cash, but patron through apex actually means someone spent $20 for your subscription (its only $15 month to month if you paid in cash). How many Apex get sold daily? Have you ever purchased a worker's comp, a regrade charm, a wagon upgrade, or anything else from the AH that originated from the marketplace? The item demand of people who dont pay cash for anything are also a big reason for so much cash being pumped into the the dev and publishers pockets. They make more from daily gem and apex purchases they they make from these item packages, as most don't buy them.  If you want to send them a message that you don't like what they are doing, you have to realize they wont change as long as you keep playing and making an envirnment where people who will spend money want to continue doing so.  They won't change their methods and it will be this way until the game dies..."
archeage,3ayz3e,WyzeThawt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"You certainly bring up a good point, and one that I hadn't fully considered. It's difficult to imagine what my characters might be like if I'd never bought a labor potion, apex, or regrade gem. I might not even still be playing if not for Patron status. Even so, I have a hard time believing that if they were making so much money on gems, labor potions, and such-and-such from the marketplace that these packs would be so expensive. It seems to me that if they were making 99% of their income from the marketplace alone, then they wouldn't need to introduce packs for $150. It's better to sell 3 $50 packs than 1 $150 pack. You get more circulation, more chances for people to tell their friends how awesome the pack is, and more people are willing to spend $50 than $150.  As to the marketplace, I don't think it's a bad idea. I think it's a good idea, actually. I just think it has been implemented in a poor fashion. The prices are often prohibitive, and the items contained within it feel like they should be obtainable within the base game."

Not as huge as currently but please don't equalize them too much. After all we did spend $150 for this pet and to make it to equal to something obtained in the game would not be fair to us.

Yes people pay indirectly but currently this pet allows you to directly convert money into in game strength which is totally out of line.  As long as there isn't at least one pet in the game that can be earned through in game means of equal power to this one, then the power has to be nerfed. It's just unacceptable to allow it to be more powerful than any other pet and have the only means of obtaining it be a $150 investment."

Dreambreaker was nerfed hard with the Intervate mudhand combo nerfed. Top classes right now are potato classes like Abolisher, Darkrunner, and the occasional Daggerspell (This is all based for 1v1s).

The thing about Obsidian is you can continues to upgrade it with more salvaged weapons. So take a T1 Obsidian sword, it takes one salvaged illustrious sword and its basically its illustrious (you want to regrade it to AT LEAST celestial, Divine Is becoming the new standard since they made regarding easier, and when you upgrade these weapons to the next teir they have a chance to proc up, so like Cele<Divine<Epic etc.. very small chance thou). So basically you keep upgrading this with more Salavaged weapons, a Divine T4 Obsidian sword has the same DPS as a Cele Delph sword. https://www.reddit.com/r/archeage/comments/2vfkxe/obsidian_weapon_shopping_list/ here the thread about Obsidian and a google Docs is in there with all the different obsidian weapons and their mats."

The problem that i see with empty or low pop servers is the huge amount of gold made by a few players that have no contest for world events like abyssal attack or delphi ghost ships, but i imagine is the same even on high populated servers. Once the evo servers come out, it'll come down to who managed to amass the most gold.  -Yes, ArcheAge right now feels like: Somewhat OK content surrounded by pay to win aspects and ridiculous amount of gilda star designs. Gilda star trade runs are the most annoying and boring thing in this game in my opinion.

archeage,3ayz23,WyzeThawt,3,Wed Jun 24 17:35:17 2015 UTC,the character on your account that used the most labor gets the notification to gain the loyalty points account region wide. i assume in mail. if you have eu toons too on the same account they work off of a separate labor and loyalty pool and you would get a separate mail for them.

archeage,3ay2j8,Xetic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:15:08 2015 UTC,but there is a difference between weapons of the same tier  and grade (ex. an epherium grand dagger costs less than an epherium grand sword).
archeage,3ay2j8,80WillPower08,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"Each item type has an associated cost multiplier.  So it does differ if it's a bow, sword, katana etc."

archeage,3ay2j8,joans34,2,Wed Jun 24 13:32:53 2015 UTC,"http://archeagedatabase.net/us/item/34637/  The item level is a hidden value in game, the database here shows it, right under ""Tempering Available""  Lower level items cost less (obviously)  I've spent hours digging through the database, I haven't been able to determine the exact formula. Closest I got from the 'formulas' table in the DB:  (((item_level/3)5)(item_grade3 /50000 )+(item_levelx5000)+(item_gradex5000))x(equip_slot_enchant_cost/10)  But as far as I've seen, the value produced by this doesn't come close to the actual cost."
archeage,3ay2j8,joans34,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:24:41 2015 UTC,"Oh gesh,   So Basically the cost to regrade is based on a hidden value that differs for each item.  So two different swords could cost different amounts to regrade.  I guess that makes sense, I understand paying more to regrade a grand delph sword than a grand T1 Hasla Sword.   The end result is that I can't input the cost into my spreadsheet :-\"
archeage,3ay2j8,joans34,2,Wed Jun 24 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"Yep yep. Higher end swords are more expensive to regrade.  That's why it's so cost effective to regrade Obsidian stuff at T1. I don't have exact figures on the differences, but it's clearly shown in that formula.  Alternatively, you can give this a read: http://forums.archeagegame.com/showthread.php?104216-Expected-Cost-of-Regrading-In-depth-Calculations  It's a pretty good estimation of regrade costs, only downside is you have to input the base attempt cost manually."
archeage,3ay2j8,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:36:10 2015 UTC,"I have seen/looked over oddbot's in-depth calculations previously, but that is not an easy read.   I was going to put in a much more simplified approach.  Something along the lines of: If a re-grade has 10% chance of success then you need to attempt it 7 times to have a greater than 50% chance of obtaining one successful regrade. 7 x Cost of regrade = Expected Cost  If the next tier has a 7.5% chance of success then you need to attempt it 9 times to have a greater than 50% chance of obtaining at least one successful regrade. 9 x Cost of regrade = Expected cost.  Then add them together. Going up.   Makes perfect sense, till you can start down-grading.  Then you have to add in the average number of downgrades you will likely see.   Makes no sense after items start getting destroy.  Have to add the spot to just input the value of the item, as if you are starting over from grand.   I dunno, I'll probably just give up on this little side project.   Thanks for the Answer!"

The Crimson Watch quest line will get you most mats for your weapon(s) for free.   Once you hit 51, start here and follow to the end: http://archeagedatabase.net/us/quest/6577/  The obsidian shield at grand is better than the Hasla T3 shield at heroic because of the equip effect. The T1 obsidian dagger is better for archers than the Hasla T3 sword because of the ranged crit and agility. Instead of grinding Hasla, make gold to get these."
archeage,3aywwy,r00000t,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:18:56 2015 UTC,^ i agree with this guy  if hasla weapons were still relevant in end game id say yea but its not. T3 hasla (max upgrade) isnt bad but  T1 obsidan regraded can match it and for just bow it will only cost you about 250g for salvage or illustious weapon to salvate yourself  and 20 mins of mob farming for other mats
archeage,3aywwy,WyzeThawt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:23:02 2015 UTC,How long is this quest line? It doesn't take me to 55 right?
archeage,3aywwy,r00000t,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"It's pretty long and takes you to a few Auroria zones, but it's just easy mob kill quests and if you have trouble killing them, a friend can kill for you in your party and you still get progression. It's nowhere near enough XP for 55, but it gives a lot.   You also have to have a certain tier of obsidian weapon in your inventory to progress, but you can borrow someone else's. Just don't equip it."
archeage,3aywwy,r00000t,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:37:11 2015 UTC,Any idea how long it takes for 55 grinding the library?

archeage,3aywwy,campoanywhere,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:19:09 2015 UTC,You get the Obsidian Bow at grand and making it celestial to match the T3 Hasla will cost a lot. I'd just get the Hasla one and go from there.

The handling at higher speeds like 40m/s is quite unpleasant if you spin off or hit something. But it adds an extra element of fun and risk to the game.  That being said, I am concerned that with the changes comes acceleration changes as well. Being capped at 25m/s makes me think the acceleration is going to be fiddled with as well - This could potentially cause more of an issue for climbing rising terrain.  At the end of the day I just want to know that my time/gold invested into this large goal is worth it."
archeage,3aw2x9,malabella,2,Wed Jun 24 13:10:55 2015 UTC,"acceleration has changed, Went to try out my car straight after the servers went up   Acceleration isn't what it used to be Going downhill doesn't gain you as much speed anymore Turning feels weird, Slower. Like there's some heavy object sitting in the back of the car"
archeage,3aw2x9,IamSkudd,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"I finished up my coupe today, and indeed the acceleration has been smashed.  It's like they gave the cars more of a slide to compensate for the lower speeds."
archeage,3aw2x9,Frumpy_Playtools,2,Thu Jun 25 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"Theres just no sense to it. I know people could sit mounts on the trunks and make the cars go extremely fast, but there was just no practical use to that 99.9% of the time.  My small friend & family guild all has cars, and racing them is an almost nightly event. The only time we reach high speeds anyways are when we are doing something like going down the Perinoor hill into Windscour, and seeing who wipes out is half the fun.  We pride ourselves on being car owners in the game, and it would seem to me like you all should be doing what you can to keep people IN the game. People looking at the car drivers aren't likely to stop playing because of this, and weren't likely to stop playing because of Car speeds before the nerf, but Car owners are likely to stop now. It's just senseless."
archeage,3aw2x9,Nick-Danger,2,Wed Jun 24 13:32:47 2015 UTC,Thanks Scapes!. I definitely think somewhere in the 32-35 m/s range as a cap is much more practical. I did some testing yesterday without Eco-Fuel and was attaining these speeds going down some of the steepest hills in Rookborne and Vilanelle.

archeage,3aw2x9,nilloc_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"reading about the posted changes to hardcap the speed made me sad, but I figured it could possibly be justified.  When I tested out the changes for myself today, I found that acceleration had completely changed and was so bad that if I had tested the car as it is now, I may never have gone through the effort to make it.  I really sincerely hope that even if it is determined that the new speed caps are justified, that the acceleration is reviewed and hopefully given a boost.   As well, there is another unlisted change in which the car will instantly slow to 5.6m/s as soon as the driver's head is underwater.  I think this is acceptable, but that it should have been communicated."

It's the modern version of dangling successive carrots in front of the mule to get the mule to move forward, except it's dangling temporary over-powered goodies in front of players to get them to spend cash -- a very cynical business model, and very disrespectful to your players."

Super hard to progress without it as ur labor cap is higher and labor regen is very fast.

Its pretty balanced at the moment. But there will always be classes that counter other classes making them hard to win if they are your counter.      i'm not going to pay for the game, do i stand any chance in pvp? i'm a pretty patient grinder xD is it hard to earn enough gold for apex?

It's not a level playing field and it's not supposed to be.  Whether or not you can PVP is based on the zone you're in. You can go anywhere at any level, so you can PVP at any level.  There are FOTM classes and patches change the balance regularly. Question is too general.  It's going to be difficult to get two APEX for the first time, but it's easy after that because you have your NA labor and loyalty to use. I suggest paying $15 once and earning it in-game after that.

archeage,3az3w8,r00000t,0,Wed Jun 24 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"is the combat skillbased or will the one with better gear always win?   Both.  It does require skill but if you have skill and no gear it won't matter.  It's largely based on skillsets.  One skillset won't beat another skillset unless the gear/skill divide is very wide.   is there low level pvp or does it start at max level?   Generally you don't start REALLY pvping until 50.  55 is preferable but you can before then.   How is the balance in PVP   Not too out of whack.  There are compositions that cannot beat other comps (A darkrunner vs an abolisher in plate with equivalent gear generally can't win unless they're geared toward Pdef penetration).  But in open world there are so many variables that you can beat anyone with equivalent gear with enough skill and planning.   i'm not going to pay for the game, do i stand any chance in pvp?   You need gear, and baseline gear is Greater Howling Abyss which is mag-level.  Hasla weapons which are Epherium level.  You can be somewhat competitive but most GOOD people are running around in Epherium and delph.  The problem with being non-patron is that you make gold so much slower than everyone else, so gear is far out of reach.   basically is this game worth playing for some open world pvp fun?   The main focus is on open world pvp, so I would hope so.  It is a cash grab to an extent and some do P2W, but it's not that bad."

But that 4k gear score tank could lose to a 3k gs mage.  The baseline gear for quality PvP is celestial Epherium IMO, you want to have at least Unique Epherium gear.  Dont waste your time with Mag....Obsidian Gear and Auroria gear is also good.  For certain classes you can get away with full Auroria and Serpentis gear."

I have a Celest T5 Staff, mad prophet, and got lucky on my T1 katana going to Epic.  I brought that up to T2 and grabbed a Faust dagger of the AH for an off-hand stat stick.  The katana + the dagger should out DPS my staff, but it just doesn't.  With the staff I can one-shot the 1st and 3rd bosses in Sharpwind Mines 100% of the time.  With the Katana+Dagger, they have never been one-shotted.   Obviously I'm going to have to get this katana to T5 to do any real damage.. other than that, I'm not sure what the moral of the story is."

The Katana wont out DPS the Staff unless your are using a T4 v2 obsidian dagger for an offhand, using Faust with a obsidian katana is nerfing your self and you may as well be using a shield.

Bow and flute can be magic attack or better yet, magic defense pen if you have the money.

AH is sale and there is a shop price allocated - not so sure, i'll check if it can be listed.  as for a screen shot: didnt think of that.  just thought that with the description i could get an idea of the value if the piece can indeed be sold.  would be nice for a lvl 20-50.  just happy i got a unique.  wonder if that decreases my chances of actual crafted gear getting there (if i regrade any crafted stuff).  its deffinately better than the hasla quest armor.  thanks for the responses guys."
archeage,3axngz,iRengar,3,Wed Jun 24 11:16:23 2015 UTC,Untradable means you can't trade or sell it.  It's worthless either way.  Scrap it for archeum and sell the archeum.

archeage,3axglv,SuperShitlerXS,5,Wed Jun 24 07:42:37 2015 UTC,"Well here is my 2cents for the topic:   One of the main questions you need to ask yourself daily is: Why would my members stay in the guild? If the only reason you can come up with is stuff like ""We provide a good community"" or ""we are a big happy family"" then you are not doing your job as a guildmaster, Since Archeage is a sandbox game and it doesn't really have a clear EndGame, then it's your job as a guildmaster to create this endgame content for your members. Always create plans for your guild members that can keep them busy and have a reason to login daily, doesn't have to be something big, but as simple as a group for managing the hellswamp plots, traders group ..etc.   Fair warning: you need to keep a very close eye and have a very good communication with your members, initially they might be super happy doing their daily activities but you need to keep a good eye and ear to make sure that these daily activities didn't change for them to become daily chores.   As a guildmaster it's your job and duty to have a healthy communication with as many guilds as possible, even try to have a deal with some of the bigger guilds to join their events such as world boss hunting or simple PVP runs."
archeage,3axglv,ItsSimonz,2,Wed Jun 24 08:00:16 2015 UTC,"To add to point number 2  , make sure they aren't doing things that aren't acceptable to your guild. ie sfpk if you want to remain neutral"
archeage,3axglv,collectadot,2,Wed Jun 24 08:44:58 2015 UTC,"This is what happens to all small guilds, the guild leader fails to create an end-game atmosphere for the guild. That or turn the game in to a chore. Just worry about leveling your members now, help them get gear. If you want a strong tight community then you gotta be super involved.   Tips for endgame:   Pvp  pvp  pvp  pvp  pvp  pvp"
archeage,3axglv,Mouthz,2,Wed Jun 24 13:06:52 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by 'hitting a lot of bumps'?   My advice, take it for what it's worth; Ask yourself why you have the guild and what you get out of it.  If the real answer (the answer you don't tell anyone) is that you just want to be seen as a leader and have people look up to you, then just disband the guild.    If the answer is, you want to be a leader, then understand that being a leader is a role of severing others, not being served by others.  The thing about this type of leader, is you have to be a top level player.  You have to know something and have experience doing something in order to lead someone through it.  Whatever aspect of the game is that you want to lead in, you have to STUDY that and be proficient at it.  If you want to be a leader in Farmville growing tending selling, you need to know your stuff and should be able to prove it by raking in gold.  If you want to be a leader in PvP, you better know all the gosh darn classes and combo and be a good PvPer.  If you want to lead PvE, you better know all the dungeons, all the bosses, how to tank them, etc.    The other acceptable (and more common) answer to why do you want to be a leader is: I have this group of friends and we want to play the game together.  Perfectly acceptable answer. You're allowed to have a casual guild, do things at your own pace.  In this case, you're not so much a leader, but rather a peer who happens to front the cost of teamspeak, or have the most land in-game, or be the most experienced.  But these types of guilds don't really recruit well.  You don't find good peers by sending out mass messages to join.  You only find them by building new relationships, finding people with the same interests/goals.   The last answer is: I have tons of money, and want minions to support my Whaleyness.  Pretty easy answer here too, just swipe more.  Hand out more goodies to keep your minion mildy satisfied."
archeage,3axglv,4_jacks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:27:03 2015 UTC,"Played on Ezi. Was fairly reputable player. Led Blackwater Trading Co. 50 members, second best trade guild before LC albeit took over both factions.  Left Ezi when guild disbanded from LC's antics. Took break.  Joined Kyrios hoping to create a small but strong guild. We're like that ""small casual guild"" except we don't intend to be casuals. Think that tiny little group of people absolutely nobody wants to fuck with due to fear of dying. Problem is, I'm waaaay at the bottom of the totem poll this time. A bunch of close friends joined up, and I'm sitting here like hummanahummanahummanahummanahummana when they all hit fifty... we'll just hit a plateau. There's no free land, or new game trickery that I can do to get an edge like I did on ezi. I can't own a whole chunk of rookborne, or forge alliances with newborne whales like I did last time. Last time, I used whales and friends as stepping stones to the top, and then helped pull them along as I ascended. This time, I need someone near the top to help give me that edge, so I can start dragging my friends along with me in an upward direction.  I quite frankly don't care how I do it, but I have to make something of myself and do it quick, and I know I can't do that myself, as I am not a whale.

So it's not like they are getting lucky so much as they are just doing regrades all day everyday. Others are running vmware so they have like 30 alts. Of the thousands of players trying to get regrades we are only seeing the successes so it skews our perceptions of the success rates.

Most people don't risk past a certain point but when they get a free chance they want to hop over celes. How do you not see that? More people regrading = more mythics.

Even a few mythics in a big guild can make a huge difference on the field and that's exactly what's happening here. It's not exactly equal either.   As far as the p2w argument of this.. It's really not necessary. Anyone with enough gold could have made extra accounts and then bought apex for them. In fact, anyone with the ability to multibox could have made many f2p accounts and clicked the coins and got patron for those accounts later to buy the charms as necessary"

archeage,3auarp,Myrmiron,3,Tue Jun 23 15:51:50 2015 UTC,Price are easier to farm...thus more lucrative. If you are able to pull more than 1 lib mob solo and burn it in 5 secs then lib would be nice.
archeage,3auarp,NgArclite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"But Dean's drop a lot more money per labor, without considering the archeum (I usually get better archeum drops there). Also, with good gear you can AoE farm Deans (yes I saw some people doing it) while to farm prince you have a maximum per minute considering the CDs of skills since mobs drop down so fast.  In my spreadsheet of Prince farm the total silver per labor is very close to the pure money I get from Dean, without the archeums and other drops. And I have almost 2k samples thanks to the labor event this weekend.  What I am consideing is that Deans farm is better the more geared you are and Prince is a starting point. Maybe I am wrong and thats why I am asking for experienced pov."
archeage,3auarp,iRengar,5,Tue Jun 23 16:43:52 2015 UTC,Doesnt matter. The archeum saplings are worth more by a long shot. You dont farm coinpurses to get archeum. U farm coinpurses to get saplings to farm archeum. I made 300gold this morning by having two sunlight crystal procc and two sunlight shard procc.
archeage,3auarp,iRengar,-1,Tue Jun 23 17:17:55 2015 UTC,But you are considering that every coinpurse farmer has land in Auroria with mineral water nearby. Thats not my case. Although I agree that if you have that kind of land than princes are better.
archeage,3auarp,NgArclite,2,Tue Jun 23 17:25:46 2015 UTC,Very good point. However just selling the sapling is still worth it aswell. Sometimes when you get a dust procc it wont go near worth the price of the tree.
archeage,3auarp,BrotherFisties,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:29:21 2015 UTC,I've done both. For lib you still have to pop buffs. I've never ran into skill cd problems with turtles but I run br for resets so...
archeage,3auarp,Hasbotted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"Why farm turtles when you can farm lvl 51 mobs. They hit for less and die faster.  Also the CD I am talking about is Battle Focus from battlerage (38 sec with passive). I farm as an abolisher or hexblade and I need Battle Focus up for each pull, but I kill mobs in less than 10 sec. Mages have almost the same CD. Considering the fact that mobs are not clustered enough for me to pull 8+ of them, I think theres a point where Deans might be better.  Maybe I should buy some auroria land and gamble with sapplings. =D"
archeage,3auarp,luniz420,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"Turtles dies reaaallly easy. And I farm them because I'm not lvl 55 yet and they give good exp vs the lower lvl auroria mobs. Also, the general rule of thumb is. Whatever mob you can kill the fastest is the one you should be farming."
archeage,3auarp,Hasbotted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:26:13 2015 UTC,You have to be careful before you do this. The people that act like farming archeum by growing trees must either be on low pop servers. My friend and i have 4 gazebos between us and we have noticed that getting the water is almost impossible. Even with a timer set there is fierce competition for the water. Check the watering spots before you purchase any land.
archeage,3auarp,NgArclite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"Well the 4 gazebos is the problem, try having 1-2 for both trees and braziers and save the labor."

archeage,3auarp,NgArclite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:17:30 2015 UTC,I dunno why I farm turtles tbh. .I went for the obs mats and I guess just go there out if habit.

archeage,3auarp,Hasbotted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:23:48 2015 UTC,My problem with auroria is I can not find a spot to consistently pull more than 4-5 mobs at a time which really kills my farming rates. Anyone know of a spot with 6-8 mobs constantly clustered that don't trip or stun?

For purse farming I do turtles...but there might be a better place still in GR that can be farmed. As far as being camped I guess it depends on time and server. Ollo is decent but most of the time that I'm there it's all west and not too many that I don't have almost an entire area to myself for multiple pulls.

From princes I get aprox. 7 silver per labor spend. That number is not bad but its also far from what I can get doing trade runs or alchemy, for exemple.  And since we are here discussing coinpurses, my friends and I noticed a decrease in archeum trees drops from the princes. We usually farm 500-700 a day and our sample might not be big enough, so thats why I am asking here for you guys. In my experience right now I am getting just 1 tree from every 250 purses. Yesterday was terrible, like 1 tree in 500 purses, lol.  Anyone experiencing the same issue? Or is it just bad RNG for the 3 of us?"

archeage,3auarp,Artekka,2,Tue Jun 23 16:13:21 2015 UTC,"Nice catchphrase there, but fact is that Prince's coinpurses are always far more lucrative than Librarian's by a large margin.

archeage,3aukwe,Maiqbestplayerworld,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"Starting out with a farm cart I believe your highest priority is time efficiency. Make packs in northern white arden and take the shortcut over the mountain to reach the gweonid gold trader in less than 15 minutes for 8G a pack. Can't remember what the time was in the basic cart, maybe 12-13 minutes? I mean yeah you can make a little more gold taking a longer route or you can do this one twice in the same amount of time. It's not as labor efficient of course but that's not your concern yet. Also this will build up your Commerce much faster."

Not the best payout imaginable, but the mats are relatively easy to get, and the % tends to be higher than Gweonid-->TC. Even the apple pies tended to be 120% or lower on bad days, whereas unless I was very unlucky getting in right after a merchant ship, the Solz packs never went below 125 in TC.  And as a tip from an ex-pack runner--if you do go south out of Solzreed, instead of taking the road out of Solzreed through Lilyut then Dewstone, make your packs at the southern specialty bench, then drive it along the coast right into Dewstone. It takes a while to get your cart through the water, but if you're patient and keep an eye on your air, it can cut a lot of time off the delivery."

B) Pay (with real money) for 2 APEX, they give 1250 credits each.  C) Gather in-game gold to buy the 2 APEX from the Auction House/other players. That could take a while. In my server they are 450g+.  Patron isn't required to get a boat.  For the other questions: No you can't buy labor points straight from the website.

If you have a little cash, auroria plate is usually rather cheap and provides move specific bonuses but its stuck at just around magnificent gear stats.  obsidian is a good and proves stat based bonuses per peice but expensive in the long run option. t1 is rather cheap and at about auroria gear stats. it has an upgrade path but past t3 it gets really expensive. t4-t5 starts getting near delphinad quality. its like a layaway plan for good gear that you can wear now and keep working on. most have a mix of obsidian gear and auroria.  magnificent, and all gear below have 4-set and 7-set bonuses, is ok at higher regrade levels  ehperium is awesome but expensive upfront. in the long run its cheaper than obsidian of relative quality but will you have all the cash now?  delpinad is too expensive imo but if you have the gold, or more likely a credit card with a nice limit, then do for it."

Anything in ArcheAge that is untradeable (gear/regrade charms/tokens) shouldn't be trusted, unless the people you are depositing items to are your real life friends (and I've seen scams happening between RL ""friends""), that's when Trion's Customer Support has to deal with ""Q: someone hacked my account"" ""A: We see no signs of breaching security on your account.""

It is not the real world.   The person did not get ripped off by another person. Their character got ripped off by another character. It's a hard concept to grasp for a lot of people because most other mmorpgs do not make this distinction. The social interaction in this game is supposed to mirror the real dangers of that world with pirates, brigands, con-men, and plain ol' assholes. It's a real part of the game and a legit one.

Throughout that first month you will be able to save up an earn money for a farm cart to run trade packs, farm materials for them and start progressing to your end goals.

I've recently re-rolled to a higher population server from a dead server, Calleil to Kyrios, and on my old toon I did the whole trade pack thing and I hated it. My two biggest methods of making money on this toon are coin purses and running single packs across the ocean, which is exciting and fun. One thing I've come to realize, and I'm sure many will agree, that the greater the risk, the more enjoyable it is.  Second piece of advice. If you see a gold seller spamming in chat, right click on their name, and instead of just blocking, hit 'report spam'. You will block them automatically."

archeage,3awdvp,Ernost,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"The point isn't that you need to participate in that to enjoy it.  The fact that there's 0 risk for your reward means you might as well play Cookie Clicker. It would be mind numbingly boring.  Without pvp you don't have to worry about gear. I don't even know what you craft.  But that means now that a good chunk of materials become useless. Because if you don't need gear, noone else does either.  As Joojitsoo said, you'd be able to do the most profitable trade runs with ease. All it takes is getting a big merchant ship and you're maximizing your income.  Labor DOES limit you but there's no reason that every player on a PvE server wouldn't have a car and mansion in just a few months."
archeage,3awdvp,Michael_Cassio,0,Wed Jun 24 08:20:49 2015 UTC,Why would you not need gear? That doesn't quite make sense.  There's still a good chunk of PvE content in the game. I doubt you're going to go kill the Kraken in quest gear.

Also what makes killing Kraken fun is that it's a combination of PvP and PvE.  Additionally, from what I've been told, you could theoretically kill Kraken in starter gear. It's your boat that matters not your character's weapons.   I'm not saying it'd be TOTALLY irrelevant. But if you run GHA until you have heroic/unique and get Hasla weapons, you're pretty much set for life.

archeage,3awdvp,PRSolja,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:51:37 2015 UTC,"You'll get a lot of ""LEL CAREBARE HUEHUEHUE"" kind of responses, so I'll lead off with something well-reasoned and considered. PvE servers in a PvP game are a terrible idea, but I'm going to take the time to explain why.  Would anyone play it? I'm sure there are many people who would. However, it would be bad for everyone.  First, the most obvious consequence would be spreading out the player base in more servers. Trion is trying to shrink the number of servers, not increase them, and for good reason: lower population servers are sometimes good, but we are approaching ""dead"" on some of the servers with how low the population is. At the present time, it would be best to roll on a low population server if you want more PvE and less PvP.  Second, a PvE-only server would have to be locked into its own AH cluster in order to protect the rest of the servers, and the economy on the PvE server would be absolute trash. Need gilda stars? Run fleets of full merchant ships to Freedich without any risk whatsoever. Resources? Let's get our 20 merchant ships, take them to Two Crowns, and get 400 packs worth of charcoal in one haul. Gear would be exceedingly cheap, and everyone would have whatever gear they wanted in relatively short order.  And, of course, this server would have to be isolated just because it would be so easy to farm anything and transfer it over to other servers, thus ruining their markets, too. The amount of gold and resources in the economy would balloon so much that gold would have no value and resources would be too plentiful to make a profit.  Third, the PvE server would eventually dry up. PvE games tend to lose their appeal in a much shorter period of time than PvP games because there's very little change. The top guild remains the top guild regardless of what happens and is only broken by losing too many members, which is very unlikely because they're the Top Guild (tm). And what does the top guild do when they have everything and cannot be challenged? It's not like someone can come and steal their castle, after all: PvP is disabled.  Fourth, castle sieges would no longer exist. Granted, they're stupid in the present form because the guild owning the castle creates a shadow guild to buy the siege rights, thus almost always resulting in a fake siege, but without the possibility of change, nothing can change. Without siege mechanics, it's whoever gets the castle first will hold it until they no longer want to anymore, even if the guild drops down to just one guy. (One guy.. owning a castle.. by himself, no army, nothing.)  Fifth, bot central. You think bots are bad now? Wait until they can't be killed in open pvp areas. You'll have bot armies running merchant convoys.  You mentioned in the comments   The reason I think it would be nice to have a PvE server is that there's a lot of stuff AA does really well that other games don't even touch.   And those three things were   fishing, sailing around, cross-continent trade runs   1) Sailing around can be done without any real risk. Just keep your mouse pointer over the ship despawn button if you see another ship. (But it's not like it is horribly expensive to fix a ship anymore, either.)  2) Fishing and intercontinental runs: these are meant to be difficult and risky because the rewards are higher than other activities. Running a trade pack across the water brings a premium return on trade packs, especially with the new updates (making stabilizers much more in demand than they once were). Fishing always was a good way to make gold, and it still is (even though the difficulty went way, way, way too high on catching fish).  Also, you said in a later comment   And I agree, I'm a casual and definitely what you'd call a ""carebear"". But some of us don't have the time or money to get insane gear to be viable in PvP.   I would argue here that you need rather good gear for any serious PvE or PvP content, to be honest.  But in conclusion, there are only a few options that exist in ArcheAge. You must either be good enough (gear-wise and skill-wise) to fight other equally-matched or better enemies, or you have to gather together with numerous others to be able to do the same (""zerg""). Most people who consider themselves/are considered by others to be ""carebears"" tend to lean toward the second option.  Also, I'd like to introduce you to the Shadowplay skill tree. Whether it's part of your main spec or not, it's good to have in open world for its utility. An enemy who cannot see you cannot kill you."

Yes it handles well, but not being the overall fastest, and having a speed that is comparable to a cogwheel board? I'm just lost. How is the cost being justified in this case? The extra handling could be 100 gilda, a noticeable difference but still reasonable. I'd even swallow 200 gilda.

archeage,3awpbg,Evensin,9,Wed Jun 24 02:49:21 2015 UTC,"If I correctly outlined the message behind your forum post, I'd say that your logic is flawed. Simply put, test servers can only do so much about bugs and exploits. In all online games, the overwhelming majority of exploits are always discovered first on the live servers. No developer could ever expect to put out a completely bug free game, even after endless testing with countless amounts of people.  Fact is, in the end, the very best way to eradicate game-breaking bugs and illegitimate players is to listen to the actual players. That's what the report feature is for, and you should be grateful that such a thing exists, not spit on it.  Now, things would have gone far better with the forum mods if you weren't so aggressive and short-fused in your post (like seriously, ""#unbreakablegate""? It literally had almost no side effects except for the few unlucky people who bought the weapons), because many people in the end won't deem it constructive."
archeage,3awpbg,TenDesires,-6,Wed Jun 24 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"There are ENORMOUS implications with the unbreakablegate (whatever we want to call it). I'm in a fair size guild in Kyrios and of the players I'm familiar with there are three that had their weapons taken away and gold refunded, the inconvenience the mess, all of it.  Now once you apply exactly your own sentiment that no company is perfect. You understand that it's near impossible that the GMs of Archeage could have tracked 1. A majority of the accounts that exploited 2. A majority of the gold that was laundered away. Their mistakes for updating the game with well-known bugged up patches are consistently ruining the game. It's not like these things are brand new concepts and exploits. They've been around since Alpha, and were shown to be possible in more recent times through Korea or RU region's versions. This means there is inevitable magical gold made from thin air and injected into the game, effecting everyone from the first time player to most veteran of players. Inflation means unless you're consistently generating gold/items your overall value in your account is diminishing. Which is okay, but when it's artificial and as widespread as this recent exploit?  Besides just because I don't mention their other checkpoints they should have for ensuring that a patch is at least Live-Ready doesn't mean I was focusing on a Test Server being their only one. Like I said, none of these exploits are true surprises.  Edit: Anyways this isn't the point I'm hoping to bring up, lets focus on the irony that they're, for once, and in memorable past, actually postponing a major update for the betterment of the game."

Now, on a more serious note...   Id love to get my hands on something that could hold its own in the current meta but isn't something everyone's playing   This is the question I don't fully comprehend. So basically you are looking for unique classes or that someone will reveal their secret-weapon builds? Those things (builds and unique playstyles) are not traded from player to player. They are theorycrafted.   You need to get your ass to work, level up at least all 10 skillsets to 50, and start spending your hard earned money on changing your specs at least 10 times per hour and grinding arenas until you are sick of it. This is not a joke, I could tell you that I'm playing Argent (Battlerage/Auramancy/Vitalism), but to expand why I'm a disabled melee with healing would take more than a day. Every piece of my gear would also make you wonder: ""Why the fuck is this guy using Wave armor on a class with 0 magic attack?"" or ""What? You have MIXED cloth and plate? WHY?!"". Good discoveries come out of hard work, and if you really need inspiration, then I would like to mention that anything that needs to fight 1v2 will require at least 11 Skillpoints in Witchcraft (them CCs) or at least 11 Skillpoints in Vitalism (them heals). But if you overdo and put 11 in Witchcraft and 11 in Vitalism you will basically tickle enemies to death (they will die of laughter over your damage output).   top 20 1vs1 Classes?   There is no such ranking and will never be because there is also no preview of the armor enemy is wearing. You can only guess if the enemy cloth wearer has Stone, Life, Wave, Lake or Earth. If enemy has <10K MP it probably is not Lake nor Wave. If enemy has <15K HP it probably is not Earth nor Stone nor Lake. If enemy has around 12K MP and 16K HP it might be Lake, Auroria, Anthalon's or Serpentis set.  I mention those details, how to recognize the armor sets, because it will definitely require different response from you: you would generally want to kill the guy in full Wave before moving onto the guy in full Earth.  Lots of builds will be adapted to the gear you have. Did you manage to regrade your Bow to Divine? Then you should rather play with Archery. There are also some insane combinations that work only if you have the Top gear, like [Tuckazor] who can play whatever class he wants.  Do you see what I mean now?"
archeage,3at0f4,Villentrenmerth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think i'm following most of what you're saying :) You can probably tell im not very experienced at the game as a whole and im using, http://archeage.gamepedia.com/Classes and http://forums.archeagegame.com/showthread.php?179480-Arena-Class-Tiers, as a sort of guild line by comparing the numbers as that's all the information i have to work with. But i understand now that you're saying this game is a bit more involved with classwise than say WoW (which im used to). I've hit archemaster a few days ago so, like you're suggesting, its just about finding a class combination that works for me in conjunction with a variety of gear ill need to craft and put some hours in to find a combination that works? At the moment i have a divine katana, celestial scepter/shortspear/club/bow and unique obs cloth. i did start putting together a set of arcane obs leather last night as well. So its just a matter of putting time/money in now i suppose. Thanks for the detailed reply, i really appreciate it! :)"

I was coming from WoW as well, where I played Paladin and Druid for the hybrid abilities so I don't have to level up 10 fucking characters to lvl 90 (>.<) . But ArcheAge... the class design is flawless, I remember since early Alpha people were claiming that ""Hybrids are useless"", which I honestly read as ""we don't know how to use Hybrids"", so I made a challenge to learn them. I can guarantee that all 120 classes are viable, but they require so much time spent on changing specs it's insane and preparing items. The only thing I'm crying about AA is that there are no Dual Specializations, or Build Presets that you can load without clicking too much, but I guess that manual clicking gives you better understanding what skills and why you are selecting for the particular build.  I would like to mention, that changing your builds and playstyles not only improves understanding of your character but also ""opens your eyes"" on the enemy's actions. Most useful thing I learned when playing multiple classes is to recognize projectile type, hint: if you will be able to differentiate Toxic Shot from Stalker's Mark then you know all the time you spent respecing was worth.  Good luck and have fun"

archeage,3at0f4,WyzeThawt,2,Tue Jun 23 12:57:18 2015 UTC,"would have to disagree that ""all 120 classes are viable"" though i do think breaking the meta is awesome.  most hybrid classes that work only work becasue they still focus and gear towards a main damage type tree but use the other trees for the movement, cc, healing, and utility skills as well as the passives that they offer.  once you start mixing multiple damage sources it is possible but will cost you a shitload in specific-type, high grade gear to really bring relevance to the class compared to more 1 type damage classes.  and a destroyer (battlerage, archey, sorcery) IS a horible idea. id love to see you prove me wrong but good luck lol."
archeage,3at0f4,Villentrenmerth,4,Tue Jun 23 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, you gave a bad example. And I will tell you how those 3 will work.  It might look like terrible plan, but let's bite this setup step by step.  Archery + Sorcery, opens up some extremely powerful combos. If you are not aware, check out insane video from Dremlock about Stormchaser (Sorcery/Archery/Auramancy).    https://youtu.be/9jphNfPTRg0   Most of the time majority of his damage comes from Leech+Meteor combo, but I would like to point most impressive moment at [3:50] where he combines best of Archery+Sorcery synergy:   Boneyard -> Frigid Tracks -> Float -> Instant Cast Freezing Arrow -> Charged Bolt -> Stun   Now, to discuss the unique combination of Sorcery+Battlerage I would like to give example of my buddy playing Crusader (Sorcery/Battlerage/Defense) where he discovered that Frigid Tracks -> Tiger Strike applies the Freeze debuff much more efficiently than anything (freezing pools are being left in a trial when you fly with TS).  Destroyer seems squishy, but defensive cooldowns are coming here from Battlerage, namely: Bondbreaker (vs multiple debuffs), Frenzy (vs Magic, which gives you ability to move away from Full Cloth Armor), Battle Focus giving unmatched parry chance, and finally Behind Enemy Lines as escape ability that can be reset every Triple Slash or every 3 seconds from Deflect and Retaliate.  I don't have gear to pull this off (because I was focusing on hybrids with Vitalism), but I always wanted to play Destroyer, same way I was looking up to Outrider class.  Gear for Destroyer is variable, but weapons leave very little choice: Obsidian Katana V1 + Obsidian Dagger V2 (it even has STR/AGI/INT stats on it) for damage or Obsidian Axe. Obsidian Sword in off-hand if you feel too squishy.  I hope you can see the potential in this."
archeage,3at0f4,WyzeThawt,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"lol i said 2 main damge types can work, its harder but can work. its more expensive too since, in this case, you need a good bow and staff.  theory crafting is fun but in action, destroyer would get destroyed in an equal fight... no if, ands, or buts about it"
archeage,3at0f4,Ljungen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:04:15 2015 UTC,"Really? i assumed because i have only cloth gear and magic weapons im pretty much stuck choosing between mages? I have been to serpentis twice with my guild but i got the staff and plate gloves on a offspec roll and the ring quest but im forced to sort of play songcraft so i cant main roll for leather gear with all the archers that make up most of our dps. I would very much like to work in a songcraft build which is why exorcist/nightwitch/dirgeweaver and nightbearer jump out at me the most but id also like to play a dreadnaught/nightcloak, sort of a tanky stealth hybrid damage user.

archeage,3at0f4,NgArclite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:31:53 2015 UTC,Meta right now are high burst classes like Darkrunner. Battlerage is a very good skill tree atm and can be combined with pretty much anything.  On my server 7/10 are running Darkrunner in arena. Then we have the off healing classes that usually runs fully buffed.

archeage,3at0f4,ThePansAnOldMan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing, but i dont think the basics have changed since. You spend most of your points on 2skill trees and you only get few utiliy points from the 3rd. For example battlerage and shadowplay is a must for a melee assasin. But the 3rd tree is not that important. You want high risk high reward class? Take archery then. You will get a slow and a bleed (1more trip and 30%dmg). You want cc? Take witchraft (shadowplay is a top tier combination, or at least it was). Its the same with archery and sorcery. I think the gear is more important than your 3rd tree."

archeage,3aqxpm,KinoNaima,3,Mon Jun 22 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"That is a lot of Westeners, the issue with naima is that the majority of the eastern players are OCE players but all the events are timed really poorly for them, gold trader on Friedrich is something like 4am, Castle sieges are 8am monday everything is timed poorly."
archeage,3aqxpm,Trymantha,2,Mon Jun 22 21:55:58 2015 UTC,The biggest issue is the west doesnt like to be contested. They always say they welcome the challenge but the second you get a little bit of pvp there are 40 portals opening up and the Latinfist comes in to shit on everyone and Nui camp. They dont want resistance if they did they wouldnt call the army out for every little bar fight. Seriously I had a clipper with 3 friends we were fighting and chasing 3 latinus around one of the islands when 2 galleons roll up armed for bear. We just laughed at how boring it must be to be on the west its like a  private server you have infinite gold and resources you have whole guilds in unique or better even your non patrons. All you can do is chase down 3 reds with no packs for sport.
archeage,3aqxpm,executive313,3,Mon Jun 22 22:15:29 2015 UTC,QFT. I don't understand how it can be fun to play West. Every morning in MM we as East get taste of what it feels like to be the 'zerg' and vastly outnumber the opponent... and it's boring as hell. The most fun I've had all week was when Kino stole a fishing boat and me and a guildmate went to FD to fight 2 v 3 against the Pirates.
archeage,3aqxpm,volta_naima,2,Tue Jun 23 01:10:58 2015 UTC,Honestly the most fun is when the East fights itself because we don't call out full raids to take a single farm hauler its usually just 5v5s sometimes we bump up the numbers for some big conflicts but its always more interesting.
archeage,3aqxpm,executive313,2,Tue Jun 23 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"No, Naima west is absolute trash. I used to play daily for 8 months~ then stopped once it got even worse. If server transfers become a thing I'll for sure try it out again! But currently Ironfist and Latinus are killing the server."
archeage,3aqxpm,GeneralMilky,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:29:25 2015 UTC,Pls. Your heals were op and when you came to freedich in a galleon. I was expecting the whole east zerg inc but it was actually fun lol
archeage,3aqxpm,Mouthz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"I know, it sucks. :( im so bored."
archeage,3aqxpm,executive313,0,Tue Jun 23 02:12:29 2015 UTC,Pick fights with Dragonfury or Blueberries they always good for a fight and they dont call out the entire army for every little thing.
archeage,3aqxpm,Mouthz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:57:57 2015 UTC,<3 BB
archeage,3aqxpm,executive313,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:02:57 2015 UTC,I wouldnt say <3 but they do add some spice to things.
archeage,3aqxpm,nilloc_,2,Tue Jun 23 17:07:10 2015 UTC,East contested the gold trader the other day. 40ish WTF
archeage,3aqxpm,volta_naima,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"we were only 23, but yeah that was fun. Good fights until you guys called in the zerg of IF/Lat/DGD to overwhelm us with numbers... and the server crashed :/"
archeage,3aqxpm,Neoxide,3,Tue Jun 23 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"Freedich gold trader isn't about having a good fight, it's about shutting the enemy down, securing the island and turning in packs for tons of gold. East does this at the morning gold trader and West does this at the evening gold trader.  PvP is always fun and makes things interesting but when people have hundreds of gold on the line they suddenly stop caring about equal numbers and fair fights."
archeage,3aqxpm,KXive,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:46:47 2015 UTC,man so  many Latinus -_-
archeage,3aqxpm,Ninhydrinal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:43:51 2015 UTC,From what I've heard the pirates are about to get a boost in numbers. Not enough to lock down the gold trader but enough to get some packs.
archeage,3aqxpm,Kunfite,-4,Tue Jun 23 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Please, we would love to contest the island more :D"
archeage,3aqxpm,noxturno,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:38:37 2015 UTC,I am on that picture! So popular
archeage,3asqm9,Olearie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:16:24 2015 UTC,Bow: Divine Obsidian T4/T5 V2 or Divine Delphinad Weapon: Either 2 x Obsidian Daggers or 1x Obsidian Dagger/1x Obsidian Short Speav V2 Armor: Hat: Obsidian T4 (+Range ATK) Chest: Obsidian T4 Guards: Auroria Wildborn (+5s Intensity) Hands: Obsidian T4 or if you have low budget Auroria Wildborn Belt: Auroria Beldame (+5s Freerunner) Breeches: Obsidian T4 Feet: Obsidian T4 or Auroria Wildborn  If you dont like the bound gear for some reasons go with Epherium Squall
archeage,3asqm9,Xetic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:13:03 2015 UTC,How much would all this cost
archeage,3asqm9,Deathcore64,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on your server but for AH1 Cluster   Bow - 8500g Dagger - 500g Shortspear - 500g T4v2 Fist - 2650g T4v2 Boot - 2650g T4v2 Cap - 2650g T4v2 Breech - 2900g T4v2 Jerkin - 3100g   assuming you never regrade, so ya it's expensive."
archeage,3asqm9,Xetic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:58:32 2015 UTC,Well you need Atleast T4 Shortspear so this would be 3k+ otherwise go 2 Dagger = 1k for both
archeage,3asqm9,JuicyCardboard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:19:28 2015 UTC,Except two of the same Obsidian weapons don't stack effects.
archeage,3asqm9,Xetic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:19:42 2015 UTC,they do stack :) one in my guild has it
archeage,3asqm9,Xetic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:27:45 2015 UTC,Does celestial obsidian work?
archeage,3asqm9,Xetic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:52:55 2015 UTC,yes
archeage,3asqm9,eazkill,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:18:55 2015 UTC,How easy is it to get the sealed salvaged bow? Kinda costy on AH
archeage,3asqm9,eazkill,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:38:10 2015 UTC,you craft the tier (illustrious/Magnificent/Epherium) and then salvage it
archeage,3asqm9,Artekka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:59:49 2015 UTC,Magnificent squall is fine if you cant afford obsidian t4.
archeage,3asqm9,eazkill,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:44:18 2015 UTC,Also for primeval double obsidian dagger is the way to go. I have short spear t4 v2 at celestial and it is honestly not worth the gold. And if you are mind set to go primeval you get more damage from the daggers as they give more range crit damage.
archeage,3asqm9,executive313,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:49:49 2015 UTC,Have you ever done the math on the effective DPS increase from running dual daggers? It's not as amazing as you think.    +1 for V2 Shortspear so that you can play other classes too.
archeage,3asqm9,malabella,2,Tue Jun 23 15:53:53 2015 UTC,That is the reason I went for the short spear. But in the end I only played prime and I could have saved a lot of gold by going double dagger. On my cluster epherium short spears go for 3.8k-4.4k and a dagger would be around 3k. Amazing or not it is cheaper and improves ranged dps.
