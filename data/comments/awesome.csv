awesome,3e2gf9,KevlarYarmulke,31,Tue Jul 21 13:13:05 2015 UTC,Wait. They are still movie rental places?
awesome,3e2gf9,dmbcuse,10,Tue Jul 21 13:14:18 2015 UTC,And they're hiring?!
awesome,3e2gf9,dem89,5,Tue Jul 21 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Worked at a Family video store up until recently to help pay for school. When someone asks if we're hiring we were told to say ""we're always hiring for all positions."" I think the only reason that this is possible is because Family video is just one venture of the company. They also deal in a lot of real estate renting, renting to food places that compliment their business (next to mine was a different pizza place). The introduction of Marco's & family video combo is new, they had just bought Marco's when I was hired about a year ago."
awesome,3e2gf9,CelebrantJoker,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:31 2015 UTC,Came here to ask this
awesome,3e2gf9,inBTWNurLEGS,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:18 2015 UTC,"I think this may be from my town.  the next door video place is a ""family video""  actually it turns out these two businesses are really one and its like this everywhere."
awesome,3e2gf9,Aerik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"That's the incredible part, IMO."
awesome,3e2gf9,the_dude_imbibes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:02 2015 UTC,Literally my first thought.
awesome,3e2gf9,azriel777,12,Tue Jul 21 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"Family Video is, atleast in my area, the only remaining chain video store.  I miss going to video stores and not knowing much about the movie I'll be picking out to watch.  The internet has made them more or less obsolete, but I still like the idea of them.  And the fact that you can order pizza in this one is cool."
awesome,3e2gf9,DiscoDev,8,Tue Jul 21 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"I think Family Video learned a lot from the failures of other rental stores. I was an employee and, for the most part, we were allowed to make decisions as we see fit. If someone has a late fee and is upset, we were allowed to remove it (excluding extreme cases like hundreds of dollars).   They are very aware that the only leg they have to stand on is customer service. Treat your customers poorly with hefty late fees, bad deals, etc., and they will leave you for redbox. But red box can't provide the same level of service FamVid employees can."
awesome,3e2gf9,CelebrantJoker,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:49 2015 UTC,You're right on with all of that.  And I also think that people (mostly over 45) don't want to use Redbox or any similar type of drop box.  They would rather go to the video store because that's the experience they're comfortable and familiar with.  And people certainly do appreciate the customer service.  When I used to go to Family Video the employee would usually wipe out the late fee if there was one.
awesome,3e2gf9,DiscoDev,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of sad that video rental places are becoming obselete. The children of this generation will think they're incredibly old fashioned. ""We had to actually go to a store to pay for movies to take home and watch. They came on physical discs that you placed in a special player. Most of the time they were so badly scratched that you couldn't watch the whole movie"".   VHS is going to seem like a gramophone."

awesome,3dzzen,lVlINTY,8,Tue Jul 21 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"I am just guessing because I haven't searched for the source, but my guess is that it was designed as a 3D model, printed and assembled. Then, a servo motor was installed and a simple integrated circuit like a small form factor Arduino or attiny85 was set up to toggle the servo and run the lights. The trigger toggles the open/close state and there is likely an on/off switch as well."
awesome,3dzzen,UsernameOmitted,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:38 2015 UTC,That would do it. Thanks man. Man.. How would you 3d print such a perfect replica though?
awesome,3dzzen,lVlINTY,3,Tue Jul 21 04:46:31 2015 UTC,"First stage is designing it (dimentions) of the whole concept then break piece by piece (done by using original art then designing it in paper then software). After that is basically a long time of waiting and praying and cursing and patience and doing it all over again (I'm still working on my 3D printing skills) for the parts to come out right. Assembly is made easy with prior planning or hard with general fuckwittery. This would be the basic steps to building a replica but for this gun, extra planning must be made such as planning for moving parts and extra room (maybe) for wiring and lights."
awesome,3dzzen,Enix71,2,Tue Jul 21 10:06:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  It takes a ton of art skill and knowledge to put something like that together.  It usually begins with a manual sketch, then the sketch is transferred to a rough polygonal shape in a 3D modeller and then it's refined.  Fortunately a lot of 3D design applications now have sophisticated systems for creating joints to animate creatures and vehicles, so you could likely ""test"" the model's movement before it's printed."

Then a little kid/toddler walked past and I got to see a look of the most intense concentration at what i can only imagine they wanted to devour.  Was quite scary but amazing to see.

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.  The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

If you're against one opponent, you'll probably still be looking for ways escape the situation. If there's multiple and they surround you that way, there's no question whether or not you're gonna flight or fight. It feels like your body kicks into second gear and you just start fighting like a madperson. That's why he's able to shrug off all those blows and just keeps on swinging. He's literally not noticing the hits.   Good on you kid."

awesome,3chkfr,reggaetonfreak,6,Wed Jul 8 04:44:50 2015 UTC,How much skill does it take to do jumps like those?  Are they laid out so well that you generally have enough momentum to land it or does it take some years of experience to know how to pace yourself?  Would cycling behind a lead help your chances of making it?  I have never done this so I'm curious.
awesome,3chkfr,I_dont_want_karma_,3,Wed Jul 8 12:38:05 2015 UTC,"When you jump anything for the first time, go faster than you think you should.  It's better to go huge and land flat on the other side than it is to come up short and hit the back side of the jump.  Plus, if you're going too slow by a little, you get fucked up a lot.  If you're going just a little too fast, you'll likely still land on the slope of the landing and you may just land harder than you thought.   You also get good at calculating how much speed you need because you clearly don't go from jumping nothing to jumping these.  You start small and work your way up, increasing your speed as you increase the size of the jump.  Eventually it becomes second nature to know what you need to do.  Cycling behind a lead isn't a big deal once you get good.  Early on it sketches you out because you're worried about what happens if they crash in front of you."
awesome,3chkfr,road_to_nowhere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:34 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for the answer.   Do you think an amateur could pull off some of those jumps whilst following a lead?  Similar to how someone can fly a plane with a pilot next to them.  Obviously I'm not gonna try it but I'd be curious if that kinda speed reference would help enough.
awesome,3chkfr,I_dont_want_karma_,3,Wed Jul 8 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"That's a bad metaphor.  When you're flying a plane if you fuck up the other person takes over.  When you're riding a bike if you fuck up there's nothing anyone can do for you.  The only real thing you need to be able to do this is confidence in your skill and instinct.  Both of those are developed over time and with lots of riding.  A lead does nothing for that.    The number one thing people do that causes things to go wrong is to speed check, e.g. tap the brakes because they think the jump doesn't require as much speed as they have or because they don't have the confidence to carry their speed through the take off to the landing.  The jumps are typically designed to ""catch"" you with the slope of the landing if you go a little too big so rule number one is basically ""never speed check"".  You'll also notice that these guys aren't pedaling.  That's because the course is designed to help them carry the speed they need through the jumps.  If you tap the brakes and lose that momentum that's when things start to go wrong.    Starting out on smaller courses will teach you to feel the flow and speed of the run.  Once you get that feel for it you'll have a much easier time gauging the speed you need to carry through runs with bigger jumps.  As for whether an amateur can do this, of course.  Most people riding like this are amateurs, but they still have years under your belt.  The only people who go pro in sports like this are people who have a little extra something that lets them take bigger risks than normal people would generally ever be comfortable taking (like these guys).  Either that or people who have unbelievable reaction times like this guy."

Because you might just end up staying at the Natura Vive Skylodge, a hotel that boasts accommodation pods that dangle 400 feet above the ground on the side of a cliff.  The skylodge has three capsules that can sleep up to eight guests, with each one offering 300-degree views of the beautiful valley below. To get to these pods, guests must hike their way up the cliff. After your stay, you make your way down via a zip line. Sounds exhilarating and terrifying all at the same time.  Scaring yourself silly doesn’t come cheap, though. Nights spent here – with dinner and breakfast included – cost around AU$400.""   More info"

awesome,3ce0u3,bdimenbort,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:29:43 2015 UTC,I always thought it was a weird experiment. You have a poison that you know kills cats when exposed. Put a cat in a box with said poison and break the vial. Doesn't matter that you can't see it you know without a doubt the cat is dead.  I guess it might work if its a poison that requires the cat to ingest it to have an effect.
awesome,3ce0u3,claytonpara,2,Tue Jul 7 07:00:47 2015 UTC,"Except you don't place him in with active poison.   It works on the uncertainty principal.   The vial only breaks open when there's atomic decay of the atoms.  Which could happen in hours, days, years, or never.  So if the poison vial breaks the cat will die.   But you never know that it broken, when it broke, or if it broke.  Which means at any given time, you never know if the cat is alive or dead without viewing the results."

The tug of war is an enrichment activity for the tigers, I assume. Just something to keep them entertained..  Also, I took several awesome pictures there shortly after the exhibit was opened up 2008. Album here http://imgur.com/a/AbyB9"
awesome,3bv5te,jakerz85,5,Fri Jul 3 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"Habitat enrichment for Tigers is a tricky thing. Toys generally encourage Tigers to be playful, If you have ever been scratched by your cat just imagine your cat being 600lbs.   Every time this happens and a cat is injured the expenses are extreme, a specialized vet with anesthesia and monitoring after has to take place. Some big cat sanctuaries pay upwards of +$200,000 a year JUST for the situation I described.   The obvious answer would be to declaw the cats, you would be able to save that money and use it toward enrichment, better diets and rescuing more cats.  While it can be argued that declawing decreases a cat's quality of life, the advantages are huge.   Unfortunately It is illegal in the US to declaw Tigers. Legal to have them all euthanized in a day, but illegal to declaw them.   I have no point to make, I just speak with a lot of zoo directors and the ethics around this issue fascinate me"
awesome,3bv5te,gir6543,3,Fri Jul 3 06:34:52 2015 UTC,Is it playing with the tiger or could this possibly make the tiger more aggressive? I know that might sound dumb
awesome,3bv5te,Footballpotato,4,Thu Jul 2 22:44:23 2015 UTC,Possibly slightly. Or possibly just more playful.
