askseddit,3e4p98,Hkyokoa,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:51:38 2015 UTC,"Totally doable. I was hooking up with 19 year olds at 26 no problem. Hit the gym hard, work out as much as you can, and approach constantly. I would just throw myself into sets for numbers. My school had 4 girls for every 1 guy, so by meeting one girl I ended up meeting a bunch of her friends. Worked out amazingly.   But I worked out and gamed constantly. Went to parties when I could and chilled. I tried to be popular, by the time I graduated a majority of people knew my name, and I had many friends as a result.   Just keep talking to girls. You may bomb 100 sets, but improving your techniques while gaming girls is solid.   You can't do the kid approach. You're a man. Do you smoke? Ask for a cigarette and talk like you would with friends. Be serious, but most of all be confident. My win was being super easy to move directly into kino, and often I'd walk away with a light kiss on the lips and a number. Girls just loved the older vibe, especially since they're all so mature apparently and need an older man to handle them. Yeah right.   Anyway, you're going at it for pussy,  not dates. Don't date a 22 year old, by the time they're 26 their entire world view changes just like yours did.   Good luck."
askseddit,3e4p98,that-freakin-guy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some of it has to do with my degree and what classes I have been taking, however, despite gaining more confidence in myself I still haven't recieved much attention from women.   As you say, if you're not around a decent pool of girls, it doesn't matter how confident you are....  it won't make girls appear.  ;)   This summer I grew a beard and began taking hot yoga classes again.  I'm taking a solo camping trip the week before school starts.  I even bought some shoes that will make me look taller in addition to updating my clothes.  I look about 25.   Hot yoga is one thing, but growing a beard, taking a SOLO camping trip, shoes that make you look taller.....  those things really aren't even relevant to any of this.  In fact the beard and solo camping trip will arguably make it harder for you.     If you must have a beard, realize that you're definitely going to polarize the girls.  Some will like it and some really won't.  Also, don't forget that ""neckbeards"" is a meme for a reason.  Trim the beard off of your neck.) How is getting away from everyone for a solo trip in the middle of nowhere, relevant to meeting girls?   Height enhancing shoes are irrelevant because height is not relevant.  You're not Prince.  You don't need to raise your heels up.   Updating your clothes is fine; did you get any female input on that, though?  Taking a girl with you who has good fashion sense, and or getting a store girl's opinion, is rather key to keep you in check from buying something......  ill advised.   I know I need to focus on my education, but is pulling girls 10+ years my junior even realistic?     It is.  But I'd focus more on compatibility rather than a specific age.  Maybe you meet someone compatible at that age, maybe you don't.  This applies whether or not you're looking for flings or something serious.   What do I need to do?     Well, there's no magic list, really.  No shortcuts.  But you probably could do worse than to adopt some hobbies that actually allow you to meet women.  Hot yoga is fine and all, but you can do better.  A partner dance, for example.  (Lindy hop, West coast swing, Salsa, Argentine tango, etc.)   It's weird because I'm closer in age to more of the teachers.   It's only going to be weird because you think it is."
askseddit,3e5wn0,whaska,2,Wed Jul 22 05:04:25 2015 UTC,"""There's this one girl""  ""I really like her""  It is possible that your problem lies within those two sentences. Bottom line is, if you don't man up and talk to her, risk rejection basically, you will never find out if she likes you back. So my advice is to talk to her, but also talk to Mindy and Susan and Rachel and that girl who's name you don't even know, talk to the hot 21 year chick you always see at the mall, talk to everyone. But more importantly, talk to her, today."

Here is one I use it won't lower your value much  ""Hey I met this cute girls at X, think I should talk to here?"" Try to get a back and forth with her then calibrate on if you think you should ask her out.   If she seems low interest hit her up a few days later, with another text that is more a statement.  ""One of those Bloody Mary laying in the hammock kinda days"" see if she bites again if she's texting you she interested in some level. Match her level of output or slightly higher keep the frame be humorous. My 2 cents"

It's a different animal entirely to get them to meet you again, let alone fuck them. There are so many things you do that can go wrong and so many things that you don't have any control over that can cause her to flake.  That's why it's important to:   Remain non-needy at all times Keep the texting to a minimum, no need to be a robot though Cultivate abundance so you simply don't have time to care, there's always another chick Let go of trying to control everything and reach a certain outcome, intent can be there, but just don't try too hard"
askseddit,3e2ef4,FabulousAsianGuyII,3,Tue Jul 21 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult one. You have to know its hit or miss, some girls won't be interested and some will. I've found if you go out there and are dancing with your friends and having a blast, it's very natural to kind of ""mesh dance circles"" if you do it in a fun manner. Like challenge one to a dance off. It's hard when you can't say anything because the music is so loud.   Just remember, if you're having more fun than the girl is on the dance floor, she'll want to be a part of what you've got going on.   Also, I've had a few occasions where I've literally just made the ""come here"" motion to a girl on the dance floor while standing by the bar and she's come over to talk."

askseddit,3e2ef4,crazymusicman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, you don't even mean like go-go dancers? Thems are hard because they get hit on (non verbally) by all the guys and usually have bfs.   But girls out with their friends? work on your non verbal and certainly DO NOT start with grinding. It is all about escalation.   The opener only matters if it gets her attention and opens an avenue for further communication (which can be non verbal).  Aparently you don't neeed to worry about approaching if you already got into the situation you described. Then, be ballsy and grab her by the waist after you started dancing together. Make subtle moves towards kissing by bringing your face close but then speak into her ear. If you can get your leg inbetween her legs and one of her legs in between yours, grind face to face emphasizing your thigh on her crotch. Again, ballsy is the name of the game - you are risking losing the girl but you don't care because then its on to the next one. After this, either go in for the kiss or say you should go outside, lead her, briefly talk to her and grab her face and kiss her. Then it is further escalation..."

Or maybe that you don't want the drama that would come from hooking up with a coworker who is in a relationship.  Are any of those things true?

First off, quit this business of dealing with gossipy ""he said, she said"" crap.  You should be dealing with people directly and with your own observations.  You should not need someone telling you to act, before you act.  You should just be taking action.   I recently went to a bar and talked to her for a while there we ended up hitting it up off, kissed a bit, it seemed like it was all good.    Sounds good!   Texting her she seems very uninterested and my attempt to go on a date had been cancelled by her.    You haven't mentioned any details here so we can't know what's going on.  Just knowing the outcome is not enough.  We're not magicians here.  We need information.   What exactly did you text about?  What did you guys say, exactly? What exactly happened when you ""attempted to go on a date"" with her?  Did you ask her out?  What exactly did you SAY? How exactly did it end up being canceled?  What was said and done?    She is very unsure she wants a relationship because of a recent rough breakup.    What?  How did ""relationships"" come up at all?  What EXACTLY were you talking about with her?   I'm beginning to give up on pursuing her as she doesnt seem to be into it.    Tough to say.  You've said almost nothing about your approach.  If she was kissing you, she was into you enough.  But it sounds like something in your approach killed it for you.  I'll need you to answer my questions above in as much detail as you can manage, before I could say for sure.   Do I try and try again to go on a date and assure her I'm not like the other assholes she has dealt with (I'm actually genuinely into her) or do I call it quits?    First off, don't use the word, ""date.""  It's unnecessary to call it a ""date"" when the point is to hang out and escalate, and the word puts unnecessary pressure on things early on.  Secondly, you're not going to get anywhere by trying to debate with her.  Thirdly, answer my questions above and I can say if there's a decent course of action here."

In this case you can't really agree to any of the things she said but you can infact answer those and handle them with a more masculine vibe one which may not promote her shit testing you anymore this way or so often.   Okay so this is just and example I can give you on two of the situations you mentioned.   ""Let's go down that path""-No, you go search there and i'll wait for you. - So here I can give you my advice to just not say ""Let's go down that path"". It can be replaced with ""Come with me down this path"" while you lead her holding her hand. This is just more commanding and shows a high level of leadership and masculinity. With these actions and attitude you basically don't leave her an option in which she can say ""No, you go search there and i'll wait for you."" ""Let's do this""- I don't want to. - This is going to be a bit situational but instead of saying ""Let's do xyz"" you can say ""I'm going to do xyz"". This basically means that you are in no way doing  whatever xyz is because she is there or because you think she may like it you are doing it beacuse you want to. It's up to her to join you if she wants. For example you are outside with her and you deside to grab something to eat. You can say ""Let's go grab something to eat"" to which she can just as easy say ""I'm not hungry"" or ""I don't want to do that"". But if you look at your other option and just say as you two are walking ""I'm going to go get something to eat"" she will probably come with you even if she isn't hungry at all just because you took lead of the situation and you are showing you are going to do that regardless if she likes it or not because you are not going to just starve because she isn't hungry. You are putting your self at #1 and her at second. She will follow you if you show great leadership."

Most of the things that guys think of as ""shit tests,"" aren't.  Most ""shit tests"" are just people showing who they are.  And overall, if you don't take yourself too seriously, and are confident, then you will respond in the best way possible.    Seduction isn't some series of tests or a competition.  People hang out.  Sometimes they have mutual chemistry.  Sometimes they don't.  Seduction is finding this out.  Seduction is not ""creating chemistry.""   How do i answer/behave?   You'd have to supply MUCH more context before we could begin to make a better guess at this or at what was going on when she was ""shit-testing you"", as you put it.  Next time submit a full report that gives the whole situation from when you meet her, until you get to the point that you were confused about.

askseddit,3dxbf3,LiftBodyUpThenDown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:24:02 2015 UTC,"Moved to Japan from Australia to teach English. I did this as part of my quest to shake up my life. So far it has worked! I've learnt a ton of new things and experienced a different way of life. I'm very glad for a chance to do this.   I have a fair amount of experience with this.....   One of the difficulties when you are in another country and can barely speak the language is making friends. When I came over I was paired with an Aussie girl. We live in the same area, did training together and often catch up for drinks. I like her company though we have vastly different values. Let's just say we wouldn't be friends in Australia.   Unfortunately, Western girls have it rough when they go to Asia.  They often stack up poorly against Asian girls, who are generally slimmer and take better care of their bodies.  Asian girls also tend to spoil Western guys compared to how they are used to being put through the motions by Western girls.  It's kind of apples and oranges, but the net effect is that they usually get left out in the cold and guys have a great time, while girls get bitter because Western guys are ignoring them and they usually can't abide the insecurity and controlling mentality of Asian guys.  Not that this is any excuse, but I'm mentioning this to highlight the difference between your experience and hers.   Over the last year, thanks to 'Models', I have been practicing openness and truthfulness. With this girl there is no exception. I talk and say things and don't hold back. I see no harm in this and find it cleansing.  The issue is that this girl will use that information to devalue me later on. I don't see why she needs to do this but I think it's to make her look better by bringing me down.   Oh hell no.  I second Throwaway PUA.  86 that girl and don't give her access anymore.  Don't hang with her outside of work and keep it strictly professional.  You might even keep it down to your basic, ""Hi, hello, good morning...."" stuff.  Really don't give her anything she could use against you; she might bring drama to work.   So far I've done a few things to alleviate the situation. I've confronted her about it. I've taken charge of the situation and told the story myself and owned up to the things I've done.    NO no no.....  Don't even cater to her social terrorism.  Don't even accept her bullshit as reasonable behavior.  You don't need to tell such stories to everyone or retread things all the freaking time.  You don't need to ""own up to the things you've done.""  Don't accept her frame.   Due to logistics it's hard not to invite her to events. I'm studying Japanese everyday and meeting more people all the time and so expanding my social circle. I could be not so open with her but I don't want to change myself for her.   Cut. her. out.  Even if you have to leave your social circle behind.  Get a new hobby if you have to.    But honestly, it sounds like the group is tired of her bullshit too.  Just invite smaller numbers of the group and actively say that you've given her chances but you're tired of her treatment.  They'll probably go along with it.  When you're organizing outings, just make sure that your stance is clear: you want to have a good time, and it's difficult when you're being harassed.  Anyone who can't get with the program, cut them loose."
askseddit,3dxbf3,recyclablebantha,2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"This morning she confronted me about it in front of a group of other co-workers. I said nothing and looked away. She was met with silence from the group.  Didn't see her much throughout the day. When we were in the same room I was able to talk to other co-workers. It didn't affect my job but I can sense that most people know something is up.   Ignoring her is weird. I would politely act like she's being crazy and awkward, because she is. ""Um, okay"", ""You're being kinda weird right now"".    The sabotage me more she stuck close to the Filipino girl all day. Possibly to turn me on her or get at me more. I can't control what she says but the Filipino girl did say to me ""I don't like your attitude"".   At the end of the day I went to talk to the Filipino girl to explain. Again the other girl was there and confronted me again. I said that I didn't want to talk about it.   You can just grab the girl you want, tell the other that you're going to talk to/hit on/flirt with who you've chosen, and walk off somewhere else.   Just then I sent a long message to the Filipino girl to explain my actions. Hopefully she can see what is going on now.  Didn't see her much throughout the day. When we were in the same room I was able to talk to other co-workers. It didn't affect my job but I can sense that most people know something is up.   Never explain yourself. Explaining is what you do when you're wrong, insecure, and afraid. It shows you over-analyze insignificant things. It looks very bad. All you need to do is say ""She's being weird"". You don't really know why, and it really shouldn't bother you."

I feel like the whole day she created a terrible image of you in front of the Filipino girl in order to get her out of picture. This girl clearly wants you. Her saying stupid things about you in front of a crowd is her attempt of claiming you and saying ""he's mine, he tells me everything, we're extremely close.""

When you're telling her something or answering a question she asked, look her in the eyes, but not too intense to make it awkward.   2) Touch is important. When you meet her, give her a hug/kiss depending on how far you've gone. If you're walking her across the street, you can take her hand and lead her across. Play with her. If conversation isn't there you can try tickling her (dont if she doesn't like it). Brush her hair gently or pet her (if shes okay with you touching her hair), take her hand and compare it with yours, mix it up.   3) Flirt. Compliments, Light sexual jokes. Any joke that she'd entertain. Smile, stay happy. If she looks at you randomly, you can raise your eyebrows in a flirty way/wink and then flash a smile. Be creative, relax and try to have fun."
askseddit,3du3ic,Ajpennster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:10 2015 UTC,Words do not make a girl wet.  Getting physical does.  So kino & escalate. It's that simple. Start from a touch on the shoulder when you make her laugh. A hug every now and then. Being close when sitting next to one another.  Just notice how naturals do it next time you're out in the world. How he or her just naturally have their hands in one another's laps.  So to create sexual tension = kino & escalate.  There are some guides in the sidebar of /r/seduction on Kino. Read those.

Find an excuse to kiss her on the neck e.g. ""I'm a Lion, you wanna hear me roar?"" Then proceed to roar on her neck and kiss it. OR ""I want to tell you a secret"" then lean in, brush her hair away, lean further with your head and talk close to her neck and then kiss it. Make up some bullshit secret beforehand so you can always use the same. Take the pressure away from the kiss: ""I'm really shy, I could never go for a kiss."" Then just lean in and kiss her. (Prepare to fail a couple of times at first I'm sure).   So this is a ladder which you execute in this order, just in case."

Why didn't you ever make a move before this?   Anyways, it would all be great and I would totally go for it if she wasn't currently getting with this guy a lot. I think he is a pretty solid dude and wouldn't try and fuck with what they have going on......   Uh, move on.....  The fact that you haven't made a move before now already makes things difficult.  But the fact that she's seeing some dude, increases the difficulty to where you really should come to terms with the fact that moves need to be made sooner.  And move on."
askseddit,3dwlrt,thenameismike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:58 2015 UTC,".....We immediately hit it off, we laughed together, talked about random things, etc. At that point though I didn't really think about asking her out at all. As the trip went on, we gradually got closer, we started walking arm and arm, conversation subjects got more and more personal, etc. And I started thinking perhaps this could go somewhere.    This was good.  A lot of guys here struggle to connect with people but you have it down, it seems.     But I made one big(ish) mistake, I found that a bunch of the girls on the trip started talking to me, showing interest, etc, and because I am not the kind of person who often gets that much attention, I also ended spending a lot of time speaking to the other girls, also sometimes walking together alone, arm in arm, etc.    Yeah, doing this was actually just a BIG mistake.  Nothing ""big-ish"" about it.  People (guys included) usually don't like feeling like they're in a queue.  You're young so consider it a lesson.  If you must play the field, do so in such a way that your Girls of Interest will not see it or hear about it.    But there's nothing to do about it.  Live and learn, man.   And because I had no emotional attraction to the others, I found it much easier to just relax around them and be myself, which seemed to work very well.   So.......  you're saying that you ditched out on the other girl because you felt an emotional connection?    After the trip, I occasionally texted her but not regularly at all.   ....after speaking to a few of her close friends, I learnt that she was apparently into me.....   Are you sure that you were actually into her?  If so, why did you only text her occasionally.  This almost makes it come off like you got spooked during the trip, ditched out on her because of fear, then talked yourself out of liking her because you were convinced she didn't like you to begin with.  Then you flipped again when her friends said she was into you.   .....I can't see her in person for more than a month, my only real option is texting.    That's fine.  You already established something of a foundation in person.     Is it likely that she would have fully moved on in a few weeks?   Irrelevant.  Stop theorizing.  You either want to see about her or you don't.  That's when you find out the answer to this.  You don't find out beforehand.   If so, is there a way for me to salvage the situation, to get her interested in me again, or to show her that I do in fact care about her and to make her feel like perhaps I do see her as more than a friend?    Stop worrying this far in advance.  You just ask her to hang out and SHOW her that you care with your actions.  You show her by asking her to hang out.  By reserving stronger flirtation for her instead of spreading yourself around with other girls while she is there.   I basically know that she USED to like me, but because I didn't make a move at the right time I'm scared that she will just have moved on by now.    If she has really moved on, then it wasn't meant to be and you will also need to move on.   Also if your answer is ""ask her out"", please be specific, how exactly? What message, word for word, do I send her? Thanks for taking the time to read this.    Don't fall into this trap of thinking that you need some script.  If you try to follow a script, you'll be more likely to fail.  Instead, think of goals. Like ask her to join you for a movie.  Or ask her to join you for ice cream and a walk in the park.  I honestly wouldn't know what to suggest. YOU would though.  You're the one who knows her more personally.  You should know a good idea."
askseddit,3dwlrt,recyclablebantha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, first to clear up a few things: When I said I had ""no emotional attraction"" I meant that I wasn't thinking that I would go anywhere further with the girls, which led to me being completely at ease with them, which meant I enjoyed spending time with them, so I DID spend time with them, I'm not sure how to phrase it, but it was ""easier"" to be around them as I wasn't ""stressed"" (though that isn't really the right word in this situation). Not that I ""ditched"" her, she was still the one I spent the most time with. After reading through my post I remembered a detail I forgot to include, not sure how relevant this is, but it turned out one of the other girls I spent time with, who is very good friends with Jenny, had a ""crush"" on me during the trip, Jenny was aware of this, and so was I, she slightly hinted towards whilst we talked, I explained I wasn't into her, that was that. Anyway sorry for going slightly off topic, not sure if that was important.   In response to your final points, I have two approaches in mind:  a) ""Hey, guess what!""     ""What?""     ""Remember when we were walking back together from (that place we went to) talking about how sad it was that we were probs not gonna get to see each other again when the trip ended?""    ""Yeah :/ why?""    ""Wanna grab a coffee together at (coffee place) after school when get back?""    ""Insert answer here""  b) is basically the same but skipping the mention of the trip, I'm not sure if mentioning it is a good idea, it reminds her of the ""great time"" we were having, but it may also seem ""weak"", or too ""needy"" or ""romantic"", if you see what mean, it makes it less casual/spontaneous.   Anyway please let me know what option sounds better to you, or give me your own version if you have something better, of course."

She just really enjoys your company. If she did, she would love to be alone with you. Then again I could be wrong. Women are complicated. Best thing I'd suggest you do was be open with your feelings. Give her signs of your intentions. Try being a bit more sexual with her. Make it seem as though you're not her friend anymore, but a guy who wants to take her to bed. Go slow and escalate. Try talking about more sexual things. See how she reacts. Try a more sexual approach for kino. Don't let her lead the Kino, you do. See how she reacts to that. If she allows you to escalate, then take it up a notch, until you can probably try for a kiss. If you cant escalate at all, she probably doesn't want you that way."

Your mentioned idea of  ""come back to mine so I can show you x"" also works. Maybe a combination of both. Point out the attraction there, say why the venue isn't great for rn, give an excuse besides sex.  You need her to feel comfortable, turned on, positive. So the three of the best things you can do when trying to get her home is   Humor: (there's infinite examples, they'll come in the moment, just joke around about what's going on. ) Escalation: (Kiss her, smack her ass, etc.) ""You look so cute tonight..."" Reassuring words ""Nothing is gonna happen we don't want to happen""   When your met with resistance, just calmly apply one of those. A lot of times it's apparent which one she needs in particular."

If she's not giving you enough to work with, your options are limited.  You can't ""seduce"" her into being more into you.  Period.   But she's agreeing to hang out and things   Agreeing to hang out doesn't mean much.   and I make her laugh a lot,    This is fine, but just don't get caught up in the idea that you need to be ""entertaining.""   we also do some heavy text flirting and it even gets sexual.    Text conversations are rather pointless.  There's no need to ""flirt"" through text.  Just use it to set up real world meets and stop spending as much time on your phone.  The real opportunities here around you in the real people around you in the real world.   And this whole getting ""sexual"" thing might be shooting you in the foot.  If you start getting ""sexual"" before you've actually had sex, you're actually making it less likely that real sex will happen.  I'd recommend that you stop trying to make things sexual over text.  Avoid overt sexual talking also and focus on simply planning your meets so that you both feel more comfortable about things physically escalating.  One more thing, if you weren't already, make sure that you're physically escalating in places that you could actually go all the way to sex.  So you're not going to be pulling out the stops if you're at a coffee shop."

Next thing I'll try is go for cooking dinner at her place (I live with my parents).

askseddit,3dqglx,Abibas,3,Sat Jul 18 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"Stop reading the tea leaves and have an actual conversation about this with her. There's nothing wrong with that at this stage of your connection.   You've established a bond, there should be a level of trust there. You've missed the boat on presenting yourself sexually up front. You are definitely friends, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're ""friendzoned.""   Now, it sounds like you've got a pretty good thing going. Friendship is great, don't dismiss it. Also, if you guys really are genuine friends, you should be able to discuss the romantic elephant in the room (which will always be there when a guy and girl are close).   Simply tell her that you value your friendship, but you also would be open to exploring a relationship with her. Ask her what she wants. Then it's up to you to decide if you want the same things or can find a middle ground that works moving forward.   If she only wants friendship, then great, you get to focus on other girls, which you should start doing immediately, and work on showing more sexual intent up-front."
askseddit,3dqglx,barnun,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"So I've known this girl for over 5 years. We went to the same high school and became friends instantly. Over the past 2 years we've gotten even closer and she calls me her ""best friend"".    You've probably answered your own question here.....  If you want to date someone, two aspects must be present.  Connection and physical attraction/escalation.   If you only have connection, which is what you describe in your post, then you have a friend.   If you only have physical attraction/escalation, you have a fuck buddy, a fling, or maybe an FWB.   If you want too long to escalate with her, but build up connection, that is the classic path to the ""friend-zone.""     Now it sounds like she's friendzoned me, and that's what I thought for a while too.    Incorrect.  You did it to yourself by not taking initiative.   So I guess what I'm asking is: Am I friendzoned or not? I've liked her for a while now and want to ask her out, but I don't know if she sees me as more than a best friend or another platonic buddy.    Look, if there's any doubt, you could always try physically escalating when you're with her one on one, and see how she responds.  Just take it slow.  Get in closer.  Get more familiar with your touch but not necessarily sexual right off.  And always calibrate according to her responses.  If she back off or flinches, for example, then match her, don't keep pushing forward without consideration for what she wants.  Don't have some conversation with her about it unless you want to sink any slim chance you might have.  Confessions and the like, are one of the biggest factors in pushing a guy firmly into the friend-zone.  Think about it.  How many times have you heard girls say that they fell for the guy because he said he'd wanted to ""explore a relationship?""  Those stories always start with the guy making some move....kissing her or whatever, and then the girl realized what she FELT.  I've never heard of such a thing working.  I've only heard of such a thing firmly consigning a guy to the friend-zone.  Conversation won't work for you because it involves logic and people don't make dating decisions based on logic, but rather, based on passion and feelings.  You will need escalation to really test those waters."

If you're okay with that, then go to town. Whatever you want. Take charge and move her around how you want. If she doesn't like something she'll let you know. Sex is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. So enjoy yourself and give her something to enjoy. Don't worry about finishing early, if she isn't done use your mouth or fingers(or, for real Crack cocaine status, both). You're still young enough you'll be up for round two soon and if you gave her a good time already she will be too.   E: more tips  Sex isn't like porn. It's messy and gross, there's weird sounds and all kinds of bodily fluids that get everywhere. Turning down the lighting, turning up some mood music, and having a towel and tissues near your bed to help clean up are good ideas. You want to generate a good experience.   Also, you're going to want to rail her like a machine gun. Don't. Make her beg for it. Kiss her leading down town, then stop and work your way back up. Kiss the inside of her thigh from the knee up, then stop just before you get there and go to the other leg. Tease her. Give her a little then take it away. Give her a little more then back off. Rub your cock on her clit, let her feel how hard and long you are, but don't give it to her just yet.   You want to drive her crazy with anticipation. Keep building and building. This will help you last, too.   Don't turn down post costal cuddles without good reason but as always, make her want to have you, she should never have enough of you. Give her the gift of yearning to see you again."

Well, one night, she went ahead and jumped on his dick and they fucked like filthy filthy animals.  Afterwards, my friend told her that she was his first.  She was mortified, almost sickened.

Like you said it's really popular, and it's also really popular for people to do just to pass boredom. Few people take it too seriously.  I'd say stick to just one selfie. Definitely use the picture of you playing guitar. It does't matter if they can see your face or not. The point is to show that you have hobbies and are interesting.  As for the picture with a girl and social proof; It's just showing your potential matches that you are a person that attractive women are comfortable and enjoy spending time with, causing them to assume that they too with be comfortable and enjoy spending time with you.  And if you don't think you have any bad flaws then don't worry about it. Just don't use unflattering pictures. It is unavoidable that you will appear slightly different in person than in pictures. It's impossible get an exact idea of what a person looks like all the time just from six pictures. Just don't use unflattering pictures.  Finally, Have fun with it.

Good picture ideas:   A candid photo of you  at a show. One where your laughing or smiling if you can find one.  A simple smiling, eye contact with camera selfie One of you with friends (female friends in the pic is nice) Showing off your body. On the beach, at the gym, a straight selfie.

If they like what they see, and you look the same in person, you're fine.

First let's sort a couple things out before I explain why this question is one that you need to answer, we can't answer it for you.   There is an HB 1-10 scale was to measure what the GIRL thinks of herself within the context of her social environment.  So the most popular girl in school would be an HB10.  And so on.  This was important to measure because taking into account how much the girl values herself, is important when thinking about how you might approach the situation. Before the HB 1-10 scale, people would often rate girls on a 1-10 scale that simply meant how hot that girl was to them.  Meaning it is subjective.  Individual to each guy.  While there are some girls that get high ratings from many guys, overall, each guy has their own thing they like.  (And it's the same with every girl.)   But no matter which scale we're talking about here, it doesn't matter how often WE run into 8s, 9s or 10s.  Because we'd ONLY be talking about either the social environment where we are (which is irrelevant to you because we all most likely live in different places), or talking about what we consider hot (which is irrelevant to you because your taste will be different).   97% of the girls I would rank as unattractive but people say I have some pretty high standards.   However, you have marginalized the real issue, which is this: your standards.  And you've told us absolutely NOTHING about those standards.  So how could we judge whether they're ""pretty high"" or even ""too high?""  What are your standards?  Can you describe what you want/need in a girl, not just physically, but emotionally and mentally, separated into two categories?   Must haves.  Things that would be deal-breakers if you don't get them. Icing on the cake.  Things that would be nice to have but not necessary."

I am looking for a girl with a pretty face, nice hair, nice smile, in shape, and a nice overall body. I find a lot of girls in my school just to look out of shape, overweight, or really skinny to the point where I can see her bones. I am not being judgmental of skinny girls. I have recently wrote a paper on how I think it is horrible how society and fashion industry is putting in the minds of girls that to be beautiful they must starve themselves. The funny thing is that I took my time on the paper, put all I had in that paper cause the topic I choose really interested me then when I handed it in some really skinny girl commented ""Oh, finally"". LMAO. I have practiced with the girls lower in the scale and have had success but these girls towards the top I have had trouble with. I think it is because they feel like the queens of the school or something. I failed with the 10 girl because she had a girl friend along with some other girl I like that I would rank as a 9....  Must haves. Things that would be deal-breakers if you don't get them.  I would say a girl that is nice, has a sense of humor, in shape, takes care of herself in hygiene, a really nice smile, and nice shiny flowing hair. A girl that would not have me go on a bunch of expensive dates and make me spend a bunch of money on her or would at least pay a portion some of the time. I don't have that kind of money to go on a bunch of expensive dates. Has a beautiful face that I would like to kiss. I think an Asian girl, Japanese or Chinese generally, would be a good idea of the must haves in a girl I seek. Some of the ones I have seen have really pretty faces, seem to be pretty nice people, caring overall, and funny. They don't generally have the icing on the cake like nice boobs and a nice butt. Don't have many of them at my school. Only two. One I blew it with, had a nice butt, and the other I found out was a lesbian. I mentioned her above. The one I blew it with I posted about in a previous article that I first came across you in.    Icing on the cake. Things that would be nice to have but not necessary.  Nice boobs and a nice butt.

It's a waste of time to try to quantify where the girl places herself in relation to her social environment.

I find a lot of girls in my school just to look out of shape, overweight, or really skinny to the point where I can see her bones.    So..... toned, athletic bodies.  Reality is harsh if you're implying that so many girls from your school are some combination of out of shape or unattractive.    Is this in the US?  It also makes me pretty sad that a lot of girls where I grew up in the States, really do have a skewed view about health.  They either eat a crappy diet and too much of it, or they starve themselves as if heroin chic looks good.  And they're afraid to pick up a weight at the gym because they think they'll magically look like the Incredible Hulk after a day.  Health education in the US is sad and has been for awhile.     I am not being judgmental of skinny girls. I have recently wrote a paper on how I think it is horrible how society and fashion industry is putting in the minds of girls that to be beautiful they must starve themselves.    I didn't think you are being judgemental.  It's just being real.  Unfortunately, more and more (most?) of the general populace is out of shape so it's hard to have that conversation without someone taking it personally and once emotions are on the table, logical conversation is usually out the window.  What bugs me is how things over the years have shifted from any kind of accountability towards fitness to finding excuses to think it's okay to let your body go.  Like all this ""dad bod"" nonsense and the general idea that somehow looking like a ""real woman"" means that she has muffin tops.  It's a sad load of crap.  Okay.  /rant.  Point is that I get you.......  I think.  You don't have to explain having such standards.  I also went through a lot of shit with my friends for not being attracted to girls who were overweight or obese.  They said my standards were unrealistic, while they all settled.   I would say a girl that is nice, has a sense of humor, in shape, takes care of herself in hygiene, a really nice smile, and nice shiny flowing hair. A girl that would not have me go on a bunch of expensive dates and make me spend a bunch of money on her or would at least pay a portion some of the time. I don't have that kind of money to go on a bunch of expensive dates. Has a beautiful face that I would like to kiss. I think an Asian girl, Japanese or Chinese generally, would be a good idea of the must haves in a girl I seek. Some of the ones I have seen have really pretty faces, seem to be pretty nice people, caring overall, and funny.   Your standards don't seem to be out of line.  Though if you are holding out for models like the one you dropped that Instagram link for on the thread, you might be a little too demanding.  Otherwise, my next question would be: how big is your school?  How many kids?   They don't generally have the icing on the cake like nice boobs and a nice butt. Don't have many of them at my school. Only two. One I blew it with, had a nice butt, and the other I found out was a lesbian. I mentioned her above. The one I blew it with I posted about in a previous article that I first came across you in.     Remind me then, how did you blow it with that girl?   Nice boobs and a nice butt. I wouldn't really want a girl too clingy. I'm probably gonna be pretty busy my Senior year with going to School, having a job, and making sure to go to the gym early in the morning. I would want her to understand I am doing my best to cut time out for her.      lol.  You may find that having a girl who's not clingy, will become a higher priority as you date more.  Almost guaranteed.  I think overall, it may suck, but you may have to wait until college to get access to a new pool of girls.  Or take up a hobby in your metro area, like partner dancing, if you want to meet new girls.  (Something like Lindy hop, would have younger girls.  Also, dancers tend to take better care of themselves, than the general populace.)"

askseddit,3domel,Nincrox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:56:31 2015 UTC,I mean it's a strange thing to be insecure about... why would you be? Take it off when you're talking to people.

askseddit,3domel,SkankingDevil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:59:35 2015 UTC,"Well, first: identify WHY you feel insecure with the bag.  Is it because you feel out of place?  Is it because you feel unfashionable?  Is it because turtles shouldn't be able to talk?  In time, the strength of your character will overcome the unease of the bag.  There are probably things in your life right now, that if you had worn 5 years ago, you would have died from embarrassment.  And now you can wear those things without eve thinking about it.  Some solutions. A) Affirm the need for the backpack.  Obviously if you can't ditch the backpack, then you just have to take it as it is.  ""I use my backpack to carry my _____ and that's OK!""  (School books, medicine, what have you.  If you're carrying around an XBOX controller and a winter coat in July, you may need to re-evaluate your priorities.)  At the end of the day, people will only judge you for carrying a backpack if you let them.  It should be a non-issue.  I have two eyes, one nose, and a backpack.  What of it?  B) Upgrade the bag!  Still rocking the multi-color Jansport of your childhood?  Upgrade that shit, man!  A leather satchel, a rugged back country day pack- just make sure it matches your personality."
askseddit,3dn1zl,thowaay,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"Just tell her you're going to get some lunch/coffee/dinner after class and see if she wants to come with you.  Do it fairly casually.  It gets her out of the class environment without asking her out directly and you can continue to build chemistry with her.  If things go well you can ask her to a more official date, or you can grab lunch again next week until you build enough interest in her.  This worked for me for a couple of weeks until the girl let me know she had a boyfriend.  But since I'd never ""really"" asked her out we kept sitting together and talking all semester and it wasn't awkward at all.    She married that lucky son of a bitch."
askseddit,3dn1zl,Chilling_Music,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:24:43 2015 UTC,"Next time you have lab, continue the small talk, get to know her, build a solid connection, sexualize the interaction, use innuendo and touch and frame it as romantic rather than platonic. Then when you two seem to be vibing, ask when she's free for a drink next and get the date scheduled.  Anything other than her giving you days she's free I'd personally next her, I've asked enough girls out to know if a girl does anything there other than give out days and agree to a day, it's not worth any more investment. Three week class, who cares if she rejects you? At least it's not 16 weeks like the semester classes."
askseddit,3dn1zl,alex0919,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Why would it be awkward if she rejected you?  You expressed interest, and she says no thanks.  ""Ok, that's cool.  Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me!  Gestures to classroom""  Asking someone on a date is NOT a big deal.  An emotionally healthy person sees a date as ""You seem like someone I'd like to get to know better, and maybe connect with on a deeper level.""  That being said, three weeks without making a move is a pretty damn long time.  At this stage, the window of opportunity might be closed.  You're on the right track asking her out to food after class.  If she makes an excuse, (She won't say no) try another attempt at the close. (""That's cool, no big.  How about tomorrow afternoon, want to grab some coffee?)  If she declines a second time, then sorry dude- you're probably out of luck.  If she says ""Yes."" then excellent!  Keep in mind, this ISN'T a date.  It's just food.  Or coffee.  You probably get food and drink coffee sometimes with people you can't even stand- it's just a fun, polite thing to do.  Read the vibes of the conversation.  Towards the end, if things are going well and there's a mutual air of attraction, ask her out.  (""Hey, I had a great time talking with you, this was pretty fun!  We should do it again sometime, could even call it a date ;)  What are you up to Wednesday?"")  End it on a question.  Not a statement.  This lets her have an easy out if she's not that into you, so she won't feel awkward as hell thinking of what to say in response to ""We could call it a date.""  Basically, do everything Chilling_Music said.  If it seems to daunting for you, then you shouldn't be asking her out.  You should be working on your inner game and becoming the greatest version of yourself.  If you ""suck at reading people"" I'd suggest reading ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Barbara and Allan Pease, or checking out r/ObservationSkills .  Best of luck dude.  And if you REALLY like this girl- stay away form the alcohol.  At least for now ;)"

It was ""How to I ask her out without making it awkward if I am rejected.""  If he follows your advice and just starts mercilessly flirting and cramming sexualization into their conversations he is going to come off like a creep. Especially since that isn't how he has treated her the whole semester so far, you're suggesting a complete 180 personality change for him which is going to set off alarm bells in her head.  Your advice that ""who cares if she rejects you"" is good, but again, it's not what thowaay was asking.  Any rejection will lead to awkwardness. The easiest way to avoid that is to not get rejected. Since she has already demonstrated that she doesn't want to hang out with him outside of class then he is going to have to play a long game."

What did she say when she agreed to go out? Just an 'ok' or a more elaborate message?

But here's how I beat it.  I have a filter imposed. It's what I call the Stagefright Trumpcard. You know that rush of adrenaline that you get when you see that pretty girl you wanna approach? Most falter when they feel it. They think it's ""nervousness"". Scientifically, they are  wrong. It's your body using adrenaline to rush blood from your stomach to your limbs so you can act quicker.  Your body is literally telling you to go get it. Most, however, don't.  I have trained myself to act whenever I feel this surge of adrenaline, rather than run. Some call it confidence. I call it logic."

Let me show you something that I've kept secret, this is an outing I had from awhile ago, I have about 100 more of these.   http://pastebin.com/eDjqmDSe  I made it a point to recall girls I saw and I wanted to approach and didn't, after 50-100 girls you start to make AA visceral, you start to feel it so deep that you never want to feel it again.   Quit synthesizing barriers and deluding yourself to avoid rejection, just jump in and say ""Hi""."
askseddit,3dlvc2,kzoli,2,Fri Jul 17 09:18:23 2015 UTC,"Don't place so much validation on something so visceral as human approval.  Pick up hobbies, passions you have, no matter how much people don't ""like"" you, they can never take away your progress in skill sets or passions.  Don't feel entitled, the world owes you nothing. If you don't provide any value, don't count on receiving any.   Personally when I was like this after high school, I made it a point to deliberately practice socializing, analyze it, pick out sticking points - methodically, week after week, rejection after rejection, mistake after mistake, I got better. I definitely think you need to start staying off all this fucking technology and start talking to people in person - this may be an assumption, but I'm talking from personal experience that college students spend way too much time on technology.  I walk through campus seeing so many people on their phones, it's disgusting - no wonder they're all depressed, objectively they're zombies not looking ahead of themselves! College isn't about cliques (thank god for that) and it's about meeting people, you're more individualistic.  Don't even lie to me and say you aren't part of the community, I live 10 minutes off campus. Chill on the campus for 30m-1h after your last class, look at all the people you can meet.  Here's what I want you to do:   Make a it a goal to meet three people a week; pick a guy that seems cool in class that sits near you, or that guy who always waits outside class with you but stares at his phone and is mutually alone with you. Figure out what he likes to do for fun, what he dreams about doing after college with his degree he's working so hard for. If you think you have chemistry with him, get his number and study, it might lead to parties! Have an outing on campus at least twice a week after your last class of the day, chill there for an hour or so, don't stare at your phone. Take a walk, say ""Hi"" to people who seem friendly - you aren't the only one ""alone"". Give a pretty girl you see a compliment on her stunning dress; she might think you're bold and be curious about meeting you! Start a habit a month; e.g. weight lifting, meditation, eating healthy, etc. And last but not least, make yourself presentable; make sure you look great, take showers, shave, brush your teeth, dress the best you can."

askseddit,3dmbo5,BardCollege_Dropout,2,Fri Jul 17 12:54:33 2015 UTC,"My best philosophy on escalation to sex is quit over thinking; there's never really an end destination with a savvy move, just use what's in front of you.  After fully reading this conversation, it looks like you need some actual advice ""shove her face toward my dick"" sigh.  Okay, you're alone with her, that's the hard part, that means she wants you make a move, for Christ's sake she thinks about fucking you... Here's my process for when I take a girl home.  Get her shoes off at the door, get her somewhere you can sit right next to her, thankfully my room only has the bed to sit and a TV, turn on the news or some other filler (DON'T LOOK FOR INTERESTING SHOWS/MOVIES, girls are very easily distracted). Have a laid back conversation, slow it down, get closer, pull her in - make it a rule to kiss her within 10 minutes, I try 5 or else I psyche myself out. Sometimes I'll even head to the bathroom real quick, and kiss her right when I get back out after I say ""Hi"" in the sexiest way possible.  If she pushes you away, just thread weave back to the topic you were just talking about, act like it didn't happen. Go back in, with passion, until you're making out. Chances are if you initiate a make out, she'll reciprocate, this girl's in the bag. At this point I think she likes you enough for you to do anything, but I'll let you know how I'd go about it with a new girl anyway.  Move your hands all over her body, place hers on your body too, let her escalate with you, too. Start kissing her neck relatively soon, I personally like doing this more than mouth first because there's still tons of sexual tension to play with when you don't kiss her mouth. Start taking off clothes, prioritize pants over shirt, get some incidental vaginal stimulation going, press your knee up against it while you start pulling down her shirt, then slowly move your hand down there.   Finger her some, but try to get to vaginal penetration ASAP, sometimes I don't bother to take her bra off until after. And voila, give her a few orgasms and she's in la la land."

Texting me for no reason, etc)... but I've never acted on those things.   Why was it odd?  Just to have it pointed out to you?  You already sunk your chances with her   One night, I did text her, in a very beta way: ""Hey, random question, but am I the kind of guy you could ever see dating?"" and she replied with the whole ""Not ready for a relationship"" spheel.    Yeah, FYI, don't ask this kind of question.  You're basically displaying so much uncertainty and lack of confidence that you'd be pushing yourself into the friend-zone if you weren't there already.    If you had REALLY wanted to know if you guys could date, what you needed to do was escalate with her.  In the future, some things to keep in mind   Basically.. What can I do to slowly introduce sexual tension into the friendship? It has to be gradual, because, imo, if you've known each other for so long with no sexual tension, placing it in later can be really weird.   First off, you have already trashed your chances with the girl you've described in this post.   But in the future, what you need is:  Opportunity:  You need to be in a time and place with her that you can be around her and comfortably in her space touching her.     Maybe you're in a cozy booth at a low-lit coffee shop, bar or club. Maybe you're on a dance floor, dancing close. Maybe you're at your home or hers, on the couch, watching a movie with her.  (Note: NOT your home if you live with your grandparents.) Maybe you're sitting in a park, chatting. Maybe you're star-gazing.   Point is that you create an opportunity that allows both of you to be comfortable with escalation.  Intention:  You need to have the balls to get in there like you belong, like she wants you there.  And more importantly, if you don't want to be creepy, you PAY ATTENTION as you do this.  If she doesn't want you there, she'll flinch and you can back off and try again later.  (Or back off for good if her reaction is really clear in not wanting you near her.)"

It looks almost like you're trying to pawn all the responsibility off onto her.  This doesn't help you.  Of course it's a two way street but if you want to expect girls to make all the moves, you're going to wait awhile.  Like it or not, that's not how Western culture typically works.    So she distanced herself from you or a short time.  Look at what you did:    You treat them like friends.  Self-proclaimed king of the friend-zone     Okay, so I've always been the king of the friendzone.....I've always been afraid of being seen as creepy, so I always just treat women like guy friends......I never do anything, so I just walk right into their friendzone.     So you treated her like a friend for a YEAR.  You basically REJECTED her for a year as she tried to encourage you to flirt with her.    You friend-zoned yourself for good with this awkward display of lacking self-confidence.     One night, I did text her, in a very beta way: ""Hey, random question, but am I the kind of guy you could ever see dating?"" and she replied with the whole ""Not ready for a relationship"" spheel.      And this, I've already discussed.   Then she started sending little cute texts messages saying that she hopes she enjoys my weekend with a blushy emoji.    This is a friendly gesture.     How will escalating risk the friendship?   She already told you that you're in the friend-zone.  If you escalate now, then it would be more creepy than if you had escalated way back when she was flirting with you.  Back then, she wanted you to respond.  Then everything got so awkward that she just shut it down and then rejected you when you meekly asked if she would want to date you.  If you escalate now, you're attempting to go somewhere that the girl has apparently told you she doesn't want you.  That's a risk to the friendship.    I'm really not trying to be mean here, just realistic.  This girl might seem like a comfortable girl to try, but in gaining that comfort, you have sacrificed the chance you had with her.  You have to try with someone else."

But if she were your soul mate, she wouldn't have rejected you.  Period.  At some point you have to accept what SHE wants.  She has told you.  She is not a blow-up doll.  She's a person with her own desires and thoughts.  And she already told you where she stands.   Since I met her, I had an awkward hookup at a festival. We did not even click nearly as much as me and her did. It was just mindless making out and fooling around.    So?  It's going to be impossible for you to connect with anyone else while you are busy worshiping an image of this girl that's not even real.  Until you accept reality and move on, of course you won't be able to see other possibilities.    Last thing: you won't meet anyone that you connect with like her but there are others out there that you'll connect with in differently awesome ways.

If you only have connection, that is platonic friendship.  If you only have the physical side, you have a f-ck buddy or FWB maybe.  You need BOTH of these things before you can safely say that love is there.  SO you have connection, that's great.  Now go see about the physical side, or move on.  Those are your choices and you seem to think that you can sit there analyzing and something will happen.  Clearly, after a year, this is not correct.

However, there is platonic friendships and deep friendships. I have quite a few friends that I'm close with. I haven't had a close friend like her in a while. We have a deep metaphysical connection. Is it physical? Not really. However, there are some kind of feelings there. And if the physical side gets involved, I can see us having an awesome romantic relationships.   Now go see about the physical side, or move on.   That's what I'm asking. I want to introduce physical, but not make it weird. If I never really was physical with her before (aside from the long drunk hugs, and quickish sober hugs goodbye), it might seem creepy to just jump right into physical.

askseddit,3dkgb7,predalienmack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"That ship may have already sailed, depending on how long she has been interested in you with you not acting on it. A girl looking over her shoulder at you on a dance floor repeatedly is a clear sign of interest unless you're being really creepy and staring at her or something. The thing with being creepy is that if you have to ask if you are being creepy, you probably are, and if you're constantly second guessing yourself and having to ask yourself those sorts of questions, you should change your approach and mindset to a more confident and positive one. It'll make a world of difference. Just be yourself, and with that, be the best, most desirable person you can be without compromising your values and true personality.   When it comes to the prospect of whether you should make moves on your friend, it's a tough call. I pretty much have a rule that I don't go for girls that I've been close friends with for an extended period of time, simply because of the fact that if something were going to happen in the dating/sex department with her, it already would have before we became so close. But, considering you openly admit to not making moves when you should, you might have a shot that you don't have the self awareness to detect.   The only thing you can do is choose whether or not to go for it and commit to that route, knowing that whenever you try to initiate sex with a girl, there will be the risk that she won't feel comfortable talking to you anymore if she isn't interested. There's nothing that quite puts the mood on like casual physical contact in conversation, like a hand on an arm, leg, or shoulder (depending on the context of the conversation). If she's comfortable with that or perhaps with an arm around her while you watch Netflix or even better, if she responds with physical contact of her own (like a hand on your leg), you're golden."

Instead of telling her you already have plans to go a restaurant and inviting her to tag along, you should say ""do you want to get pizza with me at [restaurant] at [time] on [day]?"" If she says she's busy, offer another specific time/day. If still busy, it's time to drop it. If she asks to bring a friend, that's a good sign she's not interested in you romantically.

Why reject me you ask? because I kinda feel that she had feelings for me in the beginning but since the last summer it kinda went away and I started developing feelings for her from there on.    But you weren't available so this isn't a dealbreaker.  If you had been available but didn't take action, that would be a different matter.

Just ask her out on date , pay for the dinner and see what happens like he said?   Hmmm.  Pay for the dinner if you want.  Personal taste varies.  I generally refuse to do anything but go dutch on early dates.  The handful of times that I've paid for everything, the girl was just using me to get free shit.    Hanging out with her AND casually escalating is the only way to sort out what's possible.     Or say I'm going out to eat at this restaurant that evening and if she want , she can tag along (which is more casual way of asking her out) this way if she can't,    This is kind of an impersonal way to phrase it.

Stop planning for every eventuality.  You're worrying about a ton of things that might not happen.  Don't worry about bringing a friend if she does.  You don't need a wingman.  Her bringing a friend just provides you with another source of information about her.     Problem is I can't choose what to do, so many possibilities but  I just got  one chance. What do you think?

Fuck what other people say.  I don't care about ""rules"" and your friend's ideas are just what they think.  What matters is not what anyone else says, but what works for you.  For me, I have found that I like to evaluate how the interaction works without throwing money into the equation.  So I choose not to flaunt cash by offering to pay for everything.  I pretty much go dutch.  But that's just me.   (And the few times that a girl pushed the issue of me paying or wussed out on paying their share, they turned out to be users.)"

You're putting way too much pressure on yourself.  Next time, don't get all psyched up when you see an attractive girl. In the situation on you described on the bus, you could have just made a casual comment to the girl. When she was looking around, you could have offered a friendly, ""Looking for something?"" Her initial response will tell you everything. If she just smiles politely and answers matter-of-factly, then she probably wasn't trying to show interest. But if her answer shows a willingness to engage in further conversation, then you just roll with it. This is how you avoid feeling/being creepy. You're just making conversation with people."

askseddit,3dk1xh,awalt_cupcake,3,Thu Jul 16 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"No, not demanding: ""if you'd reply to your texts, maybe you would have something to do this weekend lol""  That's clingy as shit.  When she was saying ""So Maybe"" she was being nice to you but she was basically saying No.  Also this   ""Saturday night, netflix, dinner, and chill?""   Way too standard and basically comes down to you saying ""Lets have sex"" without making it interesting."
askseddit,3dk1xh,Nincrox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"That's clingy as shit.   I saw it as giving her shit-tease. I can see where clingy came across.   Way too standard and basically comes down to you saying ""Lets have sex"" without making it interesting.    What would you suggest?"
askseddit,3dk1xh,CSseduction,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:35:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that response was clingy. You also left out what she actually texted you in response (you just said ""she texts me"").   If you were wanting to keep it low key, you could've asked if she wanted to get dinner with you, but also proposed something like, ""I've got a bottle of wine. Why don't you come over here first and we can talk about what we want to get for dinner."" The fact that she's been to your place means there's a good chance she'll feel comfortable going back there later. The downside to this approach is that some girls might be creeped out by the idea of meeting a stranger at his house. It would depend partly on what kind of rapport you had established already over text... which doesn't sound like it was too great if you're saying things like ""if you'd reply to your texts..."""

I'd say your best bet is to contact her when you get back from vacation and ask her about her schedule. Timing is everything and she probably understands that you're as busy (or nearly) as she is.    With regard to the 14 day wait for a response, that may very well have been a soft-RJ but if the date went positively and she showed some IOI's, your best bet is to..... You guessed it. Assume attraction, and escalate.  Worst case scenario: mutual respect, rejection, but at the very least a solid answer as to her actual interest.  Best of luck m8!  EDIT:  let us know how it goes!"

Besides, 'cute' is pretty harmless, and what girl wouldn't take it as a compliment?   Whatever the reason for her delay, I'm positive that it's neither of those things.

You've told us next to nothing about this woman.  Simply having mutual friends doesn't equal friendly.  How long have you known her?    I suggested we meet on a particular day, inferring evening (I thought), and she said how about afternoon drinks?  What do you think? Bad sign?    You have the wrong idea here.  It's not WHAT someone says that constitutes whether it's a ""bad"" or ""good"" sign.  It's HOW they say it.  Afternoon drinks.....  no inherent problem there.  The potential issue here is all the information you left out.  You left out pretty much all the information we'd actually need to know in order to get a read on this.

BUT it would be my own reflex to find the silver lining in most situations, so the way I read this is (note I'm totally making most of this up) that she's in to you, and the fact that she came back with a plan means she's really into you: she's building an appealing picture/scenario in her mind that includes you. That's good.  Perhaps ""afternoon drinks"" sounds super romantic to her - it does to me, a little; there's a certain classiness to it, yet a nice casual getting-to-know about it. You lucky dog you :-D  So if it were me (normally very casual) I'd dress up just a little - indicate willingness to do what's right (girls like this btw).  Re timing (I'm still making shit up), you have the afternoon. Plenty of time to lean back, relax, enjoy the view. You can bask in the glow - create a space where she's invited to bask with you. No need to go into Mr Seduction mode - lead her into your comfortable space, no need to chase her. You have the afternoon."

Also you don't really want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't communicate well. It will lead to more issues than it's worth down to road.

Do you have a favorite spot? Katrina  Do you think she gets that it is a date?    I don't understand your fixation on whether or not you can attach this particular label to your meet with Katrina.  The label doesn't matter.  You don't need to confirm that it's a date.  What matters is whether you can connect with her in conversation, and get comfortable in her space and at least start off with some light kino.  (Maybe she gives you an opening for more, maybe not.  You'll have to wait and see.)  What matters is that you asked her to hang out, one on one, and she said yes.  All you'll accomplish in confirming it's a ""date"" will be to put more pressure on the whole affair.   What's a good line or way to get a kiss in?    Don't bother with lines and drop your agenda.  Consider the meet to be a discovery process.  Go in with no assumptions.  You may find, actually that you find her to be boring.  You never know. For a moment, drop this idea that you have to do everything to get in there, and go find out if she's worth the trouble.  Pay attention to her.  ACTIVELY listen.  Conversation thread.  And realize that the first meet, especially if it's in public at some ice cream place, may not allow an opportunity for you to kiss her.    If you want her to be comfortable with kissing, you'll probably have to plan to go somewhere a little more low-lit and/or private than an ice cream place.  Perhaps you plan this on the same day/night as the ice cream.  Perhaps not.  Up to you.  Maybe if you know a good park or something near there, you could go for a walk?    It depends.  I have no idea what's near the ice cream place or what time of day/night you're meeting her."

As if people just sit around trying to have these GOTCHA moments with people.  As if girls are ""testing"" guys all the time.  Seduction isn't adversarial.  It's not a fight.  It's not a contest to win.  Not inherently.    But it's true that people don't always find attraction with each other.  That's what people are talking about with shit tests: when someone reveals something about themselves that another person finds unattractive.  You should do everything possible to take care of your confidence.  But even if you do that, sometimes it's just not going to be in the cards.  My point: stop worrying about ""passing"" shit tests or worrying about shit tests altogether.  Work on your confidence.   When a girl asks you ""Why do you do ___"" or  ""Why did you do _ "" would a good response be ""Because I can/want to.""    This question doesn't make any sense.  There is no stock answer for this question.  However, if you feel confident in yourself, you'll probably just say some good answer.  Again, there is rarely just one good answer for a situation.  You will need to give more detail if you want an opinion about what a confident answer to this sort of thing would be.

She's just kind of nodding her head and mumbling ""ok"" and ""yes"" over and over again.    lol.  There you were, in your head.  And then......   That's when she tells me how she works from home and spends most of the day alone. She told me how her husband is working all day and the kids don't get back home until 3. The way she was telling it to me almost made me think she wanted me to feel sorry for her. I didn't know how to respond to this, so I just stayed quiet.    Oh man.  It does almost seem like she was handing your her available time.  Letting you know that she has all that time......   That's when you ask for a tour of the house or maybe of her office or whatever.  :P   The next day however, I get a call from the wife. She tells me one of the pickets cracked and wants to know I could go out there to replace it.....Again, she brings up how nobody is ever home and that it's nice to have some company. We talk some more then I leave.    OMG.  ""Nice to have some company.""  Watch your step there, man.  Your friend is right.  This does sound like the beginning to every porno.     Damn... now he's got me thinking that I might have missed a golden opportunity. And even if she did want me to make a move how would I go about it? I might see her again because she wants the neighbor's side of her fence done after they come to an agreement on how they're going to split the cost.    Sounds like you're going to see her again.   So if you make a move, it's going to be inside.  That's why she keeps calling you inside. Privacy.   This is work related so CAUTION is key.  Ask her for a tour of the house, perhaps.  Under the guise of how she has to spend all day there alone.  (""Show me your favorite place in the house....""  Or, ""What's your office like?"")   But definitely don't make any hard moves.  She'll keep making opportunities.  And she'll probably even get in close to you.  If so, accidentally brush up against her and see what happens.  Or a friendly touch on the arm.  Etc.  Think of friendly ways to touch that are NOT overtly sexual.  And if she wants more, she'll respond in a positive way, after which, you SLOWLY escalate.  And if she's not up for it, she'll reinforce the professional distance and you don't have job drama.   And as someone else said, you could call her and double check that the fence is alright.    All this said, take care that you have a good read on what kind of situation you're walking into.  Like what's the husband like? What's the wife like?  Etc.

It's a little awkward trying to escalate in a situation where it's been formally agreed to ""have sex"" before you even meet.

Provided you understand sexting which it sounds like you do.   The moral of the story is to hold back a microstep from how far you can go. That game and tends to be better for people you're already physical with. I'm not saying it's impossible to fuck a girl you've sexted that intensely, but I'm saying holding back a tiny bit helps your chances.   I once matched on tinder with this girl, and I had video of her getting off in a tub an hour later. Plans flaked. I've had another situation where I just teased ideas of sexual things, simply got her intrigued, and been laid off of that. So again, it is absolutely possible to get her when being balls to the wall filthy... but your chances are better if you hold back a tad.   ...  Hang out again, build tension, escalate. Have a moment or two where you steal her thunder and slow things down a bit. ""Nah let's chill not here."" ""this movie is actually decent let's see this part."", etc. It's generally a really comforting thing to do."
askseddit,3dbvyh,killaswagyolo420,2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"I'd also suggest that in any conversation where she stipulates feeling guilty or otherwise disinterested in anything more than dinner that you don't respond to those comments.. Don't apologize for what you did,  but don't defend it either. Just continue the conversation as if she didn't mention it."
askseddit,3dbvyh,sh0nuff,3,Wed Jul 15 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"First off, Poly here also.  Congrats!  Second, you didn't say whether SHE is Open/Poly, just that she's in a LTR.  If she's not, and she's cheating, then you could be inviting more drama than it's worth, especially since she works with you.  If she is, then realize the ""that's all we're doing"" comment may be a part of their ruleset.  When approaching a Poly woman, you're not always trying to seduce an individual.  If she ends up violating their established boundaries, again, you could be in for trouble.  I'm not trying to be a total downer, but you're dealing with two cultures here, both of which I respect.  They can absolutely compliment each other though, when folks play by the rules.  As for specific advice, I agree with the first poster.  Tone the sexting down.  I almost blew it with one of my girlfriends because we became SO hot n' heavy via text that there ended up being a ton of pressure on both sides to deliver.  Also, kudos on keeping your own Poly card against your chest so far.  'Outing' yourself is always an amazing way to throw a woman off guard.  By my own experience, the more casually you drop it into conversation, the better.  After a good amount of escalation of course.  Some of the ravenously hungry looks I've got after dropping the bomb, I will remember until the day I die.  Good luck!!"

All I have to say is for the love of God, girls are emotional, and girls cover their emotions up with logic. What a girl wants now may not be what she wants when she's at your place, flirting with you.  It's a problem many guys who're low intermediate and down have, they take everything girls say as set in stone."

Tone it down, and learn that this is a part of sex and hookups. You will meet other girls that you can date and will be great too. Be cool with her but if she ices up after sex assume she isnt interested in a relationship or hooking up more. One time things can be nice if you dont get emotionally attached so easy. Trust me ive been there. Just use this to boost you and motivate you further dude! Get back to working on you and your life and enjoy the experience. Logistically, give her tons of space. If you start adding her nervously and this and that, more texts etc and shes not responding, you need to move on asap. For your sake. Keep girls that you hook up with at a distance til you know them better, know what they want and can offer you, and dont forget to explore your options. Keep up the good work!"

It doesn't take long to get pretty good at it - all you really need is one or two partners to play with for awhile and you will be fine. However, general rules for when you're just starting out:    No tongue.  Just lips...  ...Thennnnn, if she starts kissing you with a little tongue, you can give a little back - BUT - make it very light and gentle and not too far. You're not trying to put your tongue into her mouth.  No jabbing, poking, flicking, or licking. None of that shit.  Light, gentle, short touches.   Make sure your breath is good.  Don't have garlic bread and a cup of coffee before you meet her.  lol.    Have fun.  If she's into you, it won't bother her that you're inexperienced.

I can't remember the science off by heart, but it's something like men who lift weights consistently see an increase in their self confidence as opposed to other competitive sports. Go to r/fitness, find a simple program you can get into and start.   Attraction is a funny thing, it's when your no longer bothering / trying that you start to see results. Why?

Don't listen to what people post on the internet about how some girls were eye-fucking them so hard and they just went right over, grabbed that girl, and fucked her right there in the club.  Get outta here with that.  Think about why anyone would even post that online.  To brag to a bunch of strangers in the form of a ""field report""?  These are the types of dudes that want to fuck girls so other guys will be impressed.    Workout, eat well, dress well, get a good haircut (shave if off if you have to - it looks good on most black dudes anyways), smell good, etc.  Develop your style.   That shit's the easy part.    Start approaching women.  Work on those skills. Practice over and over.  Every day.  It will start paying off and it won't take long.  For instance:  I approach at least 4 girls a day.  Some days I get 3-4 numbers/insta-dates, some days I get 0.  Who cares.  If I average 1.5 numbers per day and over half of those flake, I'm still locking down 3 dates a week with new girls.    I can tell you this, almost none of the girls that I've hooked up with (definitely not the really hot ones) happened because I first saw them making sex eyes at me.  After you approach, you will start to pick up on cues that show if she is interested in you.  If she's not showing any indication, you still don't stop.  You keep at it until you build that attraction.  You want to skip all that uncomfortable work and go right to the part where the two of you want to tear each other's clothes off - it doesn't work like that."

askseddit,3db97r,Psychocist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"..and/or I've presented a level of neediness?  I've been dating a girl the last 4 weeks. We went out on 2 dates in the first weekend, she was in my bed the week after. I.. err.. failed to perform on that night (inexperience), but spent the night enjoying each other's bodies.   The main reason I didn't perform was because of last minute resistance. It completely turned me off. Maybe that's another topic?    No, that's the first topic here.  What exactly happened?  If you have actual LMR, then you're saying that you broke through it to the point where you had a chance to experience the awkwardness of erectile dysfunction?  Is that what happened?     How exactly did she express ""LMR?""  What did she say and do?  How did that turn you off? What did you do to break through it? What exactly happened when you had the failure to launch?    So, with the anti-climax and this feeling of unfinished business hanging over my head, I attempted to get her out the weekend after. No game.    So you asked her out and she said no?   Tried again the week after and succeeded (went out in the day), but suddenly she wanted to take things slow......my intuition is now telling me her anti-slut defence has kicked in because I kept trying to get her back to my house. She complained that it seemed like I didn't try to get to know her personally, etc, etc.   Hmmmm.  It sounds like she wants an actual relationship.  What do you want?   She said she enjoyed seeing me and we had a great time, but that she doesn't think we should see each other every weekend and that I shouldn't be so eager to get her back to mine (I was a bit pissy when she didn't want to come around to my house again so soon).    This is weird.  Almost like she's dating around.  But all this talk about you not trying to get to know her....  it comes off manipulative.    This shit wouldn't fly with me.  If it's a relationship, you'd see each other at LEAST once a week.  And if it weren't a relationship, she wouldn't be carrying on about you failing to get to know her because it'd be about sex.  Sounds like she either doesn't know what she wants, or is playing games.  Next her.   But, can something like this be reframed? We've only known each other for a month. I got way too carried away (inexperience, again), but was thinking I could do something to make her feel comfortable about giving herself to me again? I want to lighten the emotions and have some real fun with her.   You can't game her into becoming a different person.  Which is what you're talking about here.  Sounds like you missed your opportunity for a fling."
askseddit,3db97r,recyclablebantha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:47:50 2015 UTC,"What exactly happened?   We were in bed and she was saying how it was too fast. We did a lot of foreplay and she eventually jumped on me and was ready. Problem is, by then I was tired and not really feeling it. We chilled out, went to sleep.. woke up in middle of night and had more foreplay but she was then showing resistance again. That turned me off and I gave up.  She was affectionate the day after when we went out, but I feel it was just a disappointing experience for both of us.   So you asked her out and she said no?   Pretty much. But I asked her out in a way that implied we'd end up back at my place. That's likely when this idea kicked in that I was only looking for sex. -- I'm not, but that's my main focus at the minute because of sheer lack of experience.   It sounds like she wants an actual relationship. What do you want?   I want a fling.  So we skipped a week when she wasn't free and agreed to go out week after on the saturday.. we were going out in the day and going back to mine later to chill. She was no longer texting me first, and we didn't text that much throughout the week. On friday night she sent me a text and said we could still go out but she couldn't stay over as friends were coming over early sunday.   That's when I got frustrated because I'd be looking forward to picking up where we left off AND, more importantly, she backed out of our plans the night before when I could have made plans with other people. I basically said there's no point in going out if our plans mean nothing.   She was apologetic and we still arrange to go out the day after and I said there's no need to make plans for later on, we'll just go out and have fun. Went out... I didn't kino because I was now questioning myself. She'd brought her laptop and was actually planning to come back later but I guess my lack of kino/seduction turned her off and she said maybe next time.   I tried to assure her I wasn't just after one thing and we had a bit of kiss. She lingered before saying goodbyes and we left it there.  Messaged her two days after to see if she wanted to go out the next week and she said ""hmm maybe not sorry"". That's when I essentially said goodbye and asked why the sudden turnaround. She said it wasn't that she didn't want to see me, that she enjoyed spending time with me and I'd always treated her well, but that I asked everything too fast.  I just said I appreciate where she's coming from and I'm happy to slow down and to get in touch when she's ready to go out again. She said ""yeah will do. Thanks again for understanding"".   But all this crap has happened over text and it's so frustrating. We've spent a good 20-30 hours together, and I'm not satisfied to say goodbye over text. I feel like we both deserve at least a face to face conversation and then part ways.   If it's a relationship, you'd see each other at LEAST once a week   Thing is, we've only known each other for a month, so it's definitely too soon to call it that. How soon do you usually start seeing someone every week? I don't really have any past experiences to reference.  Thanks for you feedback. It's helping me think through the situation with a clearer head."

That turned me off and I gave up.   Going to be blunt here and point out that this kind of sexual disconnect SHOULD be a turn off for you.  You played it correctly by not pushing her too much when she was concerned by the speed of things.  But then it turned out that you were not turned out by her foreplay.  And then you guys were just not lining up.  So why then, is it a huge priority of yours to get in there?  I think at this point it doesn't seem to be.  But I'm going to throw this idea out there in addition to that: It wasn't your fault that things went the way they did.  Sometimes it's just not in the cards.  Sometimes things don't line up right.     That's likely when this idea kicked in that I was only looking for sex. -- I'm not, but that's my main focus at the minute because of sheer lack of experience.   To be fair to yourself, you should be after sex because you enjoy it, not simply to ""remedy"" a lack of experience.  And part of a ""healthy"" pursuit of sex is knowing when things don't line up and moving on to the next.  There's nothing personal about nexting a girl in this situation, though she may take it personally.  People just want different things sometimes and sometimes they don't fit.   I want a fling.   Yeah..... get out.  No need to look back.  Friend-zone her if you get along with her.

She was apologetic and we still arrange to go out the day after and I said there's no need to make plans for later on, we'll just go out and have fun.   While it's completely understandable for you to feel frustrated in this situation (We've all been there!)........  consider that you need to weigh whether or not it's worth it to bother expressing such frustration to a girl.  Sometimes it's not worth it, if the point is trying to coerce them into being what you want.  You have to judge whether or not you're dealing with something that can be fixed or something that's just how she's going to be with you.   I tried to assure her I wasn't just after one thing and we had a bit of kiss. She lingered before saying goodbyes and we left it there.   I wouldn't have gone to the trouble of trying to assure her of that.  You want a fling and for most girls, ""flings"" = only after one thing.  Nexting her would seem the best course.   But all this crap has happened over text and it's so frustrating. We've spent a good 20-30 hours together, and I'm not satisfied to say goodbye over text. I feel like we both deserve at least a face to face conversation and then part ways.   Sometimes we don't get the resolutions we want.  Sometimes we have to make our own personal resolutions.  Try not to get too wrapped up in the kinds of resolutions that require the cooperation of another person.  Because sometimes those people won't cooperate.

How soon do you usually start seeing someone every week? I don't really have any past experiences to reference.   Relationships can start immediately.  If she saw it that way for real, she'd be pushing for once a week and probably open to more.  The overall point is, you're not getting what you want, no matter which way she's viewing it.  If it's casual, she's a little too sexless.  If she's about a relationship, well how the hell are you supposed to be building something when you never see each other?  It just makes me think that she's either so confused that it's turning into drama, or she's seeing other guys and trying to keep you on the back burner.  Good luck, man.

I know I've personally caused these problems, and all I can do is learn from my mistakes and move on. One of the biggest problems was kino. I'd had her in my bed, yet I didn't even hold her hand or kiss her or anything throughout the day when we went out a couple weeks later UNTIL the end of the date.   How's she supposed to feel aroused when I haven't even got the confidence to touch her properly when we're not in bed?   Anyway, I'm trying my best to forget about her and get on with things. She did say it isn't that she doesn't want to see me any more, so I'll just step back and leave it in her court. Maybe that willingness to drop her will entice her to get back in touch when she is ready for some proper fun.  Either way, I can't keep going round in circles about it. If I was seeing other women I wouldn't be bothered at all about this situation."

I've lost quite a few opportunities by not escalating fast enough.   Accept it. You spent time with her but didn't touch her or kiss her. She got bored waiting for something to happen. If you do somehow manage to get her out again, you'll have to step it up a notch.. but you see that will now be weird because you've already set the tone."

I stopped reading, you fucked up. She was attracted, she wanted you to make a move, and you didn't, you're the man, you're supposed to initiated.  Attraction is visceral, it's not a static figure, it ""expires"" so to speak, I've heard from girlfriends, friends that're hot girls that after awhile of a guy not doing anything they lose interest.  Moral of the story, if you have a date, do everything in your power to move it to intimacy, there is no such thing for sure as ""next time"". I had to learn that the hard way, a few times, in fact. If she's receptive to escalation, you'll likely have another date and maybe develop a relationship with her. If she ultimately rejects your advances, at least she'll respect you for being a man and not hiding his masculinity. A rule I have, unless a girl leaves (and trust me, they will leave) she's interested, so keep going in with bursts of passion until she's horny enough to let down her walls of resistance. And yes, 99% of girls will have some sort of resistance, even if she's your girlfriend the first few times there will be resistance."

The attraction obviously has diminished but hopefully I get another chance to escalate. I think I will but who fucking knows.   In the meantime for the next week or two before I can see her is there anything I can do? Or am I pretty much fucked. I wish I could just tell her I couldn't make a move but I want to fuck her haha.

askseddit,3d9re7,Rebalanced_man,0,Tue Jul 14 21:57:53 2015 UTC,Tell her that you'd like to hang just with her alone in the beginning and you can meet her sister afterwards. Simple as that.
askseddit,3d9re7,yokhai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:52:00 2015 UTC,I think you got the timeline wrong. She is going to the movie with her sister first. Then they are doing their photography date.
askseddit,3d817j,jairod8000,2,Tue Jul 14 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"To answer your question quickly, no.  That's a generalization and you will always have hotter girls that are terrible people and ones that are saints, and then the distribution will even out so that it heavily favors the average by about 95% (on average).  Hotter women however are approached less frequently, and by approaching them you are doing something not a lot of guys will do, and by doing that they may be more willing to invest a bit of time into their conversation with you.  In a bar, usually the hottest girls are approached by the most confident males, thus limiting their number of choices, even though they technically can have almost any person they want if they just tried.  However, how many times do you approach the hottest girls in the room?  I'm talking the 10s just for arguments sake, the girls that could very easily be models if they wanted to.  Not as often as the average girls you just see around all the time I would bet.  That said, it's all relative.  If they're in a bad mood, if they're having a bad day, if they're tired and so on will add to your perceived notions of her, but no, hotter girls are not generally going to be nicer.  Honestly, if you only approach the most beautiful girls some of the time, your smaller sample size will make you think they're generally nicer, but if you only approach only the hottest girls you'll start to realize that it's just as normative as every other girl out there."

What would you think if I came on here after my girlfriend broke up with me and cried to you guys - you guys made me a terrible person and too insecure, wah wah wah? Instead I cried and reflected a lot, accepted that I turned into a shell of my former self, and the relationship at that point was toxic anyways, and manned the fuck up and started approaching again, yeah, I'm rusty, yeah I haven't been on a date yet, but do you think I'm going to blame you guys? HELL NO.   You probably feel better blaming your failure on this ideology and the techniques, but the problem is, you can get some of the best women of your life to fall in love with you and want relationships with you through this. One day you'll learn to build an amazing connection with a girl and have a mutually beneficial relationship with her and surprise yourself.  No one is ever going to want to even talk to you with this kind of fatalistic, victimized mindset. Here's some tough love, I don't care if you think I'm the biggest asshole you've ever met.  Recommendations:   Quit being a vegetable eating all day, go to the gym - if you're actually obese, start taking walks around the block and work your way up to the gym. Take showers, shave, get a haircut Every time you say ""I can't do this/This won't work because x"" recognize that those thought loops are poison. Replace them with ""How can I do this/Maybe I need to try x instead of y..."" Get a job, wake up early, meditate   Then after you've finished that, start looking for girls to talk to, overcome the nerves, and say ""Hi"", chances are they'll at least be friendly, especially after you tell them how stunning they look in those shoes."

askseddit,3d5r78,recyclablebantha,2,Mon Jul 13 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"I always knew I was somehow deficient with girls. Not totally inexperienced, but shy and bad in bed.    You're kind of lumping a lot of things together here.  You realize that this isn't /r/sex, right?  We're more about helping you get them into bed, not about what happens after.  Granted, real ""seduction"" skills do help you in bed......   I had a chaotic childhood with crazy parents, and I absorbed a lot of false ideas about attraction and sex.    Going to be thorough here.  What ""false ideas"" did you have?   But I was terrible in bed, because I was so sexually repressed that I never asked girls how it felt, never watched porn, never read anything about how to have good sex. That stuff, I felt, was for other people.    How do you know you were ""terrible?"" Sexually repressed how? Also, asking girls how sex felt is not really how you get better.  It's a mindset that helps with that, not asking individual girls what they personally liked or didn't like.    And because I was too scared to flirt sober, I was invariably wasted (with accompanying impotence) by the time I got to bed anyone.    Well shit....  you were not terrible in bed, per se, then.  Sounds like you just needed to quit drinking, for starters.   I went on a couple of dates, and watched as some of this stuff really worked, whether I got laid at the end of the night or not.     What do you mean ""some of this stuff?""   You do realize that real ""seduction"" isn't in the short cut or fancy marketed tricks you read about?  Real seduction, at its core, is simply being social.  That's it.  You use the same skills to make friends, that you use to start a relationship or have a fling.   I went straight back to thinking that I was unattractive, that I had nothing to say, that there was no point in trying, that my childhood habits of shyness, fear, and embarrassment had been hard-baked so deep into my brain that there was no point in trying to fix them; and that doing so would just lead me to destroy my reputation and become known as a sleazeball.    Sounds like you have the wrong idea about ""pick up.""  At least somewhere in your head.  Or else there's no way that the thought you'd become a sleazeball, would even pass the laugh test.  Picking up on girls does not make you a sleazeball.  Unless you are being a dick.  Simply being involved with girls doesn't make one good or bad.  It's how you treat people.  Simply driving a car does not make you a murderer.  Driving your car into pedestrians on purpose does.   I withdrew. I turned my phone off, and didn't leave my house for three weeks. I stopped exercising and ate pizza all day. I glared at all of my roommate's Tinder dates.    Sounds like you were a dick to yourself and others.  You don't deserve that.  You deserve to be happy. Why do you think you don't?  How do you feel about having a part of yourself that doesn't want you to be happy?   I'm a little better today. I understand intellectually that my fears are largely bullshit.    No, they're not largely bullshit.  They're completely bullshit.    But they still shouldn't be dismissed so easily; you can't ignore the problem away.  Your fears may be bullshit but you are making them into a real problem by failing to deal with them correctly.  You have to do some work here to fact check your own thoughts.  Of course you may find a valid self-criticism floating around in your head.  But you're allowing a lot of garbage too circulate in your head without bothering to fact check it against reality.  Nothing should be floating around in your head unless it can pass a fact check.   Seddit totally gave me hope, and I'm grateful for that. But it also stripped away any illusions of just how bad I was, and that shit fucking killed me.    You seem to have some mythical ideas about what all this is.  If you can hold down a job, make friends EVER, hold conversations with people, etc., then you ALREADY have the pieces that any successful ""pick up artist"" has."
askseddit,3d5r78,BringItDownToTheWire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:10:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for an in-depth response. Seriously.  I'll clarify a couple points: 1. As far as my upbringing, the short version is that I was raised by idealistic, leftist parents in a 'staying together for the kids' dead marriage, in a rural area. Did I mention I was home-schooled? The only advice or 'rules' I ever got from an adult about dealing with the opposite sex was 'people have sex when they're attracted to each other.' Basically, grew up assuming that if I walked up to a girl and asked her to a dance, she would say yes if she was attracted to me, and no if she wasn't. Enough rejections and I convinced myself I was ugly and weird. I never understood how to flirt or build attraction.    Sexually repressed how? No R-rated movies, no books that talked about sex, my mom's oft-stated opinions that 'charming men are sleazy misogynists' (that's a verbatim quote). In 6th grade I was forbidden to play with my neighbor because he brought over some magazine with pictures of semi-nude women.  I knew I was bad in bed because I heard girls I had slept with gossiping about it with each other, and because in several cases they flat-out told me. ""Cute guy, but no idea what he's doing"" would sum it up. By 'some of this stuff', I mean things like: Posture, body language, conversation threading, avoiding boring/interrogative questions, not showing neediness relative to her approval, not showing jealousy in the presence of an AMOG, asking her opinion on a subject rather than just rambling on, demonstrating high value, not trying to show off wealth. All of this stuff was immensely helpful.  I get what you mean about the same skills being needed for making friends and pickup. I have probably an average number of friends, some of them very close. Most are male, some are female and platonic, a couple are ex-girlfriends. I'm definitely a weirdo, but I'm an intelligent and hard-working weirdo, so, yeah, I have friends. I guess I'm just not sure that the qualities that make me able to have friends are applicable to attracting potential romantic partners. I worry that I've let myself get too weird to date.  I have real problems maintaining conversations. Not always. Not ever, with some people. But I judge myself way too harshly on timing and the banality of what I'm saying. Alcohol relaxes the internal critical voice, which is a big reason I used to drink so much.  I realize that it's insane to think I'm a sleazeball for talking to girls with the intention of picking them up. But that's what my upbringing and my surroundings tell me. Or, at least, through my very tilted perspective, it seems to me.    ""But they still shouldn't be dismissed so easily; you can't ignore the problem away. Your fears may be bullshit but you are making them into a real problem by failing to deal with them correctly. You have to do some work here to fact check your own thoughts. Of course you may find a valid self-criticism floating around in your head. But you're allowing a lot of garbage too circulate in your head without bothering to fact check it against reality.

askseddit,3d7bqv,mynameisseduce,2,Tue Jul 14 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"I asked her out for dinner and she said that she couldn't in the next few days, so I told her to text me when she'd be available. She did and we made plans for a date. I figured since she was the one who'd taken the initiative, it meant that she was interested.   Sometimes people think they're interested but they come up with excuses not to meet up because on some level, they aren't interested and haven't figured it out yet.  And overall, people don't prioritize people when they aren't truly feeling it.   Then, a few hours before the date, she canceled. I figured, fuck it, she flaked and she's just not into me, but then she texted me back ""I'll text you as soon as I'm available"", probably to make sure that I knew she wasn't a flake.   Naw, she did it because her rational mind wasn't sure why she's not feeling it, but she wasn't.  Or else she would have found a way.  Her actions were honest, her words were inconsistent with her actual values.  This should have been getting unattractive to you by now.   But then she didn't text me for a week, so I texted her that I was really into her, but if she wasn't interested I'd rather just know right away.   .......I told her that I was also working full time, so I didn't understand how that would prevent her from seeing me.    Your first mistake was responding to her uncertainty by texting her that you were ""really into her"" and hitting her with an ultimatum.  In all the posts I've seen on Seddit and AskSeddit, ultimatums are the ploy of a desperate man, and they never work.  You can't coerce someone into feeling it.  But coercion certainly CAN hasten the end of something.  You are frustrated because she isn't feeling it or she isn't coming at you the way you'd like, but you didn't stop to think about how expressing such doubt and insecurity would pretty much start nailing the final nails into the coffin.    Then you followed that up with the final final nails in the coffin, more logical debate and putting pressure on her.  You don't bring logical debate to an emotional situation.  She made her decisions based on emotions.  What you did was respond with more insecurity and frustration.  Which only reinforced to her, that she made the right decision in cancelling and further, in cutting off communication.    Not what you intended, but that's what the result was, regardless."

I'm actually pretty sure she was initially into me but yeah, I think you're right that asking her how working 40 hours a week was preventing her from seeing me was what turned her off completely.

My personal response for a girl like this:  Girl texts me saying she can't make it, and even qualifies herself (a giant bonus, doesn't happen often) that she'll let me know when she's available.  Me: ""No big deal, I actually had my friend pestering me to hang out tonight! Maybe sometime next week :)""  Ask her next week how her schedule looks, if it's anything other than I'm free Wednesday evening, and all weekend, for example, I'd just ignore it because like /u/recyclablebantha said, people will prioritize you if they like you, don't fall into the bullshit lies ""Ehhh, I'm tired, I'm busy, I don't know..."" If she tells me when she's free:  Me: Cool, I'm not free this weekend because my Dad wants me to come over and help him out with something, but Wednesday evening sounds perfect, how about 7PM we grab a coffee @X?  Her: Okay, sounds great, see you there!  If she flakes again, I'll repeat, but after the second flake it's usually close to a lost cause. If she flakes a third time, I usually tell her something like:  Me: Hey, no worries. Well, I know you're super busy and I'm not good at the chasing you down thing. So you're in charge of planning the next meet, whenever your schedule permits - just let me know ahead of time and I'll get back to you.  Ideally, I'd do that after the second meet, just because I don't have forever to wait for one girl to meet with me, but if I really like the girl I'll give her another chance.  And keep in mind, during all of this, I'm not twiddling my thumbs waiting around for her, I'm actively approaching, meeting, and setting meets with other girls, I'm in abundance, and not whining in scarcity and getting pissy with her."

The ball was in her court, it was up to her to make the next move.  As for salvaging it, I think it's a bit unlikely at this point, but just stop texting her.

You might argue differently, you might think differently, you might want kids and she won't, etc.  Go hit the gym, if you already do keep hitting the gym, focus on making yourself better, study hard, and go out looking to make friends and meet people.  Eventually, someone will come along.  Hell, I met my girlfriend at work while she was a customer, she didn't even think the date would go well as she likes country and cowboy boots, and I like electronic music/rap/hip hop/metal/etc. and wear skinny jeans.

Now that I'm ready to go again, most girls my age are working summer jobs and the ones I see aren't my type.   Where and when are you seeing these girls.

I wouldn't worry so much about trying to trigger this or that ""effect.""  Just talking to people in general, is building up your social skills.  And don't assume that you're starting off strange.  There's nothing strange about asking for directions if you are truly trying to get somewhere.  Just be honest with yourself and with others about why you're talking to them.    It often goes well to start conversations off with an observation about the current situation.  You can often jump right into someone's head by mentioning something they are or have been thinking about.   It was all go well I went where she told me for like 5 minutes, went back to where she was and she wasn't there anymore.   It happens.  Can't tell, but it could be that she just had to move on.

I suggest you begin with the basic guides on this subreddit and /r/seduction.   hint and nudge at interest towards a girl?   You shouldn't be 'hinting' and 'nudging'  Your problems seem to stem from not following two basic rules   State your intent. Be a man who knows what he wants, if you think a girl is hot tell her that.  Always escalate. If the girl is still there taking what your throwing at her than she CLEARLY wants you to progress in a logical way, if she didn't she would move somewhere else. Remember there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with flirting or hitting on a girl its a basic human interaction that our cultures has successfully made taboo."

And don't hint or nudge either.  You gotta be clear about it.  But how?  SHOW, don't tell.  Ask her to hang out.....  and escalate.  Make moves.  Ease in slowly but surely and confidently.  Pay attention to her responses as you do so.  Why should you show your intent with actions?  Look at all the posts here on Seddit and AskSeddit.  So many of the guys who dwell in the friend-zone have one thing in common.  They all thought about what to do, too long and ended up doing nothing.  Or they made some big confession to the girl they were interested in.  But they hadn't made any moves before that.  You don't need to get sexual with your talk.  You don't need to tell her she's hot.  Unless your game is tight, it's too easy to mess up the delivery.

askseddit,3d168d,Link119,2,Sun Jul 12 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"What's the name of this app?? Most girls want to be dominated and this girl is on this site to meet someone who will do that. You did fuck up by asking her to dom you imo. Now she thinks you're a fuckboy who is not really about that bdsm life. My advice, don't chase her on fb trying to get some. You'll come off as needy. A guy who could get pussy when he wanted to has no time for that shit. Wait a couple days and msg her something like ""doesn't mean i don't wanna tie you up and fuck you till your leg is shaking ; )"" If she wanted to date you she would've responded back already. SHE WANTS TO GET DOMINATED. Good luck. Update when you get some I'm intrigued."
askseddit,3d168d,Udanokor,2,Sun Jul 12 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"The app is called Whiplr. I guess I didnt really ask her to dominate me but I was more or less asking if shes also interested in dominating. I guess I could have phrased it better because even in the context of the conversation I probably came off wrong. She also said that she never really tried any of this and neither have I but should I perhaps try to introduce her to it? And the other thing is that I deleted the app so should I then message her on facebook after a few days?  When I do message her again, I am also not sure that she will remember the context of me asking if shes interested in domming."
askseddit,3d168d,Psychedelic_Leg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"You got to test her indirectly to see if she likes being dominated, you'll see a difference in the way she acts towards you. If you really want to try, just wait a few days, and just try getting her to hang out with you. Rapport building over text sucks"
askseddit,3d168d,recyclablebantha,2,Sun Jul 12 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"I ended up deleting the app because I found it to be stupid and I told her about this.    Then I just messaged her in the app telling her I was going to delete my account because the app sucks and that she could message me on facebook if she wanted to talk.   After deleting the app I realized that the conversation was probably deleted so on facebook I sent this, ""I don't know if you would get my message on the app but I deleted it and my account. You can message me here if you want to talk.""   Already you are giving WAY too much thought to this.  Seduction isn't predicated upon doing the ""right"" thing, so much as it is upon two people having a mutual attraction. It's teamwork.    How did you get her FB account anyway?  Did she give it to you?  She'd still get the message even if you deleted your account on that app, I think.  She just wouldn't be able to respond to you on that app.     I realized that I should have just asked her out on the app but is there a reasonable chance that I can save this? What should I do?   You should ask yourself why you are so fixated on this one girl.  Your overall approach makes it seem like you should have backed off long ago."
askseddit,3d2p9b,zintigg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:21:50 2015 UTC,What time is the particular question at?   Usually when someone does that (While rare in person) you either ignore or throw away with humor or exaggeration.
askseddit,3d2p9b,Nincrox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:34:53 2015 UTC,Just the whole video in general. The chat is doing their best to make things as awkward as possible. I've been a part of a lot of situations like this but the jokes might not have been quite as crude.
askseddit,3d2p9b,Nincrox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:07:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly try to not be in situations where this happens, and if it does just try to be the better man, the other guy is being jealous and acting like an immature twat."
askseddit,3d2p9b,recyclablebantha,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already completely won over the girl how do you stop getting cock blocked by people asking awkward questions like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlvhQTUxjTs   First off, there isn't really such a thing as ""completely won over the girl.""  Technically, you can be in a state where you match up with a girl and it's on, but this is a process, a journey..... not some destination you get to and then it's done.  Secondly, you've cherry-picked a rather unusual situation where people are basically trolling the guy and he's kind of opening himself up to it.  Whoever made the video didn't quite understand the situation, either.     The guy was actually playing it rather well, considering.  Whoever edited the video together was making it look like they didn't understand the situation at all. That the guy answering, ""I'm not going to kiss her, I'm gay,"" is actually a really good answer for a stupid question like, ""Do you want to kiss her?""   Putting pressure on the girl by asking a dumb question like, ""Are you guys in a relationship?"" is going to lead to answers like, ""I'm just visiting.""   So thirdly, that guy wasn't really getting cock-blocked, not at first.  They were doing the equivalent of repeatedly saying, ""No comment,"" to a series of stupid questions.  You were actually getting the answer to your question IN that video.  That sort of thing is how you could respond.  Where he went wrong, apparently, was in letting them goad him, over time, to acting like he had something to prove.  (Unless that was a show for the subscribers.)   But in any case, a situation like this isn't something you should have to deal with.  If your friends would do something like this to you, they aren't your friends.  And strangers aren't going to do something like this.  Some acquaintances might pull out awkward questions like, ""Are you guys in a relationship?"" or ""Is this your girlfriend?"" so you just avoid places where your acquaintances gather and things will be simpler."

They'll even have you vulnerable sometimes. Don't be afraid to show a vulnerability. To show that you're not 100% happy about life at this second. That's ok. Tell her secrets.

If you want some actual advice you need to get over your oneitis first, because seduction isn't about getting a particular girl to like you, it's about being the best version of yourself possible. Sure we could throw a bunch of good first date ideas at you and you could come back and we would give you some basic text and conversation tips but it won't hold up. The fact that you're asking this question means that you aren't ready and mature enough for her or any type of relationship.   I'm not saying this to be a dick, I help people on this subreddit all the time, but my impression from this is that you have the entire mindset wrong. It's a trap that many people who begin seduction began in.   Just try to listen to what your asking here, you were fawning over a girl just waiting for her to break up with her boyfriend so you could have a chance to get it in, do you sound like a man in this situation?"
askseddit,3d26qm,Nincrox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:51:31 2015 UTC,"do you sound like a man in this situation?   holy shit you're totally right. but can I ask, how do I come off as selfish here? Have you ever had oneitis?"
askseddit,3d26qm,Nincrox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"how do I come off as selfish here?   Maybe it wasn't the exact word I was looking for but it was the first I thought of, you're trying to learn techniques to make one girl fall for you, the idea is to be a man that people want to be and be with.    Have you ever had oneitis?   Oh YES, Multiple times. For many people it's what pushes them into seduction. It's an awful feeling that is only awful when viewed from the outside."

askseddit,3d26qm,Nincrox,2,Mon Jul 13 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"but at the same time I wonder what if? You know?    Every single person who has had oneitis has had this thought because it's what Oneitis is based off of.   there's something good for me in there.   You need to realize that this girl isn't the only source of that 'goodness' there are 3.5 billion girls in the world, you can't really think that this one girl that you happened to meet is the only one that will give you the feelings you have right now.  I betting this isn't the first time you've felt about a girl this way, just think about how you thought that all those other girls were 'the one'."

askseddit,3czo76,bigboss2014,7,Sun Jul 12 10:00:26 2015 UTC,"After she flaked the first time you should have given her a firm warning as such that its not ok.

askseddit,3czo76,riffdex,8,Mon Jul 13 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"She's just not that interested to start with. You can see that you are initiating all the texts, plans, and contact. She will agree to plans but they are not prioritized by her. She's just stringing you along (possibly as a backup date when her plans fall through at the last minute) imo. It would be one thing if you guys had a date planned and she called and told you she was very sick and she couldn't make it and that she's really sorry and hope to reschedule. It is another thing completely when you have plans (even loosely determined) and you don't get a text from her the entire day until after midnight."
askseddit,3czo76,riffdex,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:04:40 2015 UTC,Fair point. What do you think I should have done and when?
askseddit,3czo76,riffdex,3,Sun Jul 12 10:00:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, after she pulled that sh*t when y'all discussed swimming (even though the plans were loosely defined) I would have just pulled back completely. If she then really really made an effort to hang out with and prioritize you after that, that's great. It's up to her at that point. Most likely, if you stop texting her, she would forget about you completely (good, why do you want somebody in your life who doesn't prioritize you and breaks plans?). It's possible she will realize she messed up and will try to go the extra mile to fix things and show she is interested (if she really IS interested), but at this point it's up to her. By allowing her to disrespect you without consequences, you are not seen as having value to her. Show her you are too important to allow somebody to be in your life who doesn't recognize your value. This route may not end with you getting the girl, but at least she will respect you. I see this route as really the only option."
askseddit,3czo76,that-freakin-guy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"I can see the flower exchange as being really awkward. He stated there wasn't much attraction going on and one awkward exchange can make a women re-think things. The flowers alone did not do that imo, but it set the situation that lowered her perceived value of the OP. I agree that OP made progress, and good for him for getting laid. If his goal was just to fuck her, he was successful. But I can kind of tell that his goal was more to be involved with her and that wasn't going to happen from the start, he was displaying a very needy attitude from the start."
askseddit,3czo76,that-freakin-guy,3,Sun Jul 12 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'm glancing through the texts really quick, so I didn't read all of them.  Stop beating yourself up. What's with this self depreciation bullshit? You're a man, step the fuck up and act like it.   You're going to fuck up. Who cares? Start aiming for 10s only and then you'll fuck up maybe 8/10 times, but at least those 2 times you succeed you'll have succeeded with HB10s.  Edit.  She sounds like she liked you, don't be so needy. Don't be afraid not to text back. Go text other girls and practice gaming them. You might strike out with randoms but at least you're striking out with the ones that suck.   If she texts, wait a bit. Obviously she can fall asleep and flake, why don't you distance yourself from your phone? Every time she texts you go do something. Go read a chapter in a book or write a song, wrap a coil if you vape, go work on your car, whatever. This will prevent you from texting her right away.   Otherwise she liked you and you kind of pushed her away."
askseddit,3czo76,sb95500,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:23 2015 UTC,thanks man. do you think there's any way to recover from this? e.g. texting her a week from now?
askseddit,3czo76,Sveske,3,Sun Jul 12 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"Text her in a few weeks. Tell her you got busy with work and that you're free, then adjust your game and seem more distant. She'll do all the work. She sent the last text so the ball is in your court at this point. You can throw it, hold it, whatever, it's your call."
askseddit,3czo76,Skiigga,2,Sun Jul 12 07:31:50 2015 UTC,I'm far from good at game but at some points that you marked out in the texts i'd have to agree that you came off as a bit needy. She seemed into you for the like the first 1/2 of the texts. Just leave her alone and move on and maybe she'll get a hold of you again.
askseddit,3czo76,Skiigga,2,Sun Jul 12 07:37:15 2015 UTC,"I have a few pointers that i think could help you out.     Text game is shit. I only use text to set up dates or little funny things. I'd cut out all the ""hows your day?"", ""what are you up to?"", ""hey you"", all that stuff. My biggest rule for texting is, 'are you only sending it to get an answer and thereby get validation, then it's counterproductive'. All those kinds of texts are for when you are actually dating or in a relationship.   Make your plans ahead of time. If you're going swimming and that's the date, then give her options: ""Hey, if we're going swimming this week i'm free wednesday and thursday"". This works far better than hitting her up on the day and then waiting for her to answer you. If she's free one of the days and wants to go then you don't text her untill the day before the date with something like, ""Hey, are we still on for tomorrow?"""
askseddit,3czo76,g4casting,2,Sun Jul 12 06:40:14 2015 UTC,"Who the fuck ""passes out"" as much as she does? She's not interested or else she would make you a priority over doing nothing."
askseddit,3czo76,Clemburger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:31:47 2015 UTC,"yes, and yet i still had sex with her. is flakeyness = automatic disqualification of the girl? i don't think it needs to be but maybe i am wrong."
askseddit,3czo76,g4casting,2,Sun Jul 12 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means good at game and I could easily see myself having this conversation with a girl, but from my unbiased objective point of view I would say she is interested to the extent that she'll text you enough to keep you around in case she needs something to do, but you are not a top priority.   That is fine, but don't let your mind develop an over attachment to someone who doesn't feel the same. Don't text as much and be more assertive when you do. Don't let her forget about you if you still want a shot, but texting things like ""hey"" and then following up 3 times makes it seem like you have nothing else going on and she'll know that if she ever wants to see you she will."
askseddit,3czo76,pucat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"Ahem, do you know what field she works in?  Because honestly from those texts she might be doing escort services, which would explain a lot of things. The flakes, her being constantly sick/tired and falling ""asleep"" at random times. Also the massage thing. She just might have been an escort and was actually busy/too tired to have sex.  On the substance of the texts, you did come off as very needy. You don't give her any space, she tells you she's sick and she will contact you but you wait ""a few days"" which was actually less than 24h before bombarding her with texts again. One text is enough, if she doesn't answer, you can send another one then stop. She had all the control in the interaction.  You really wanna text a lot less, if she's interested one text or two is enough and she'll answer when she wants. Leaving her in the dark creates a lot more attraction than showing her that all you think about is her"

As long as you don't come off as needy ,but just as a friend with some light flirtyness it could open up opportunity to join her social circle. You guys become great friends ( assuming that she doesn't try to use you or whatever ) she invites you to a party. You meet her friends.

If you can't manage that, decline the friendship offer and cut contact.   P.S. Lose the dinner date idea. It's a bad first date idea to begin with and it's doubly bad when the date isn't even a date.

Is this a possible shit test? How do I handle this? I'm considered doing what John is telling me, but I would really like some other opinions on this. Thanks!   Hmmmm.  Take her at face value.     If she wants to lie about having a BF, then friend-zone her and network through her: she might have cute friends.   If she's telling the truth, you don't want to get into the messy business of dealing with a girl who'd cheat on her BF.     I mean, you could......  but that's some higher level stuff there.  It's hard enough keeping yourself straight when you have experience.  It might be more difficult if your first experiences being with a woman are with a cheater.

You aren't really pursuing her if she has a boyfriend.  Unless you are trying to be an awkward 3rd wheel or you're really just waiting around in the wings hoping that her BF makes a mistake.     We have become good friends and make each other laugh and have a good time.    So you're in the friend-zone.   She told me to follow her on IG and was talking to me about her personal life recently and that was it for that day. Here I am a day later following her in IG and I found pictures of her and her boyfriend.    She likes the validation.  And you're offering it freely.  Ironically, the thing that makes your validation sweeter to her, though she may not realize it, is that you have feelings for her.  She feeds off of that, and tells herself that you guys are just buddies.  It's not healthy for either of you.    And she should have girlfriends to talk to about her personal life.  You should be keeping a distance from her so that you can heal from this.  If you stay around her, you won't be able to move on as quickly.   Has anyone who started out like this have tips on not being so attached to someone. Like I know I shouldn't feel this way just because of that so why am I still feeling like it? Does anyone have any tips on how to stop feeling this? Thanks.    You just have to do the work yourself, reminding yourself about why she doesn't deserve you.  Really.  You have this backward, thinking of this girl as if she were the shit and you aren't worthy of her or maybe that you'd be so grateful to get in there.    Back up the train and look at the situation.  You are devoted to her.  And what does she offer?  She sleeps with another guy and doesn't recognize your value.  So what's the draw here?  YOU have to remind yourself of this.  You are into this girl, and she's into another guy, who she enjoys a physical and emotional relationship with.    You have to stomp out your thought patterns that reinforce the idea that this girl is worth your affection.  She isn't."

Personally, I say do what you want.  But as far as having to focus on more than one girl.....  That's not necessary.  A lot of guys use this as an attempt to play the Shell Game with their emotions.  They still get too attached to the girls, but think they're making it easier by spreading themselves out among more girls.  Problem is, when things come to an end with one girl, they tend to lose all the girls at once and it's brutal.  So it's better to master yourself.  Try to avoid thought patterns that build the girl up WAY too early.  You don't need to keep from having emotions.  You don't need to focus on more than one girl."

How long have you known this girl?   and you know that both of you like each other and want to be more than friends, how do you make that transition as smoothly as possible?     How do you know she likes you too?   How do you know that she wants to be more than friends?   How long did it take for you to kiss her?   Have you guys slept together?    I know that you should absolutely avoid becoming friends in the first place, but if it's too late to change that, how do you show the girl you're interested in becoming more than friends?    You really don't, basically.  If you wait longer than maybe 2-4 weeks, you become established with her as a guy who lacks confidence and as a non-sexual friend.  This is not a logical thing you can argue out of; it's emotional.    And even though it's possible to have a fling with such girls, a relationship pretty much won't be in the cards because it'd be too weird for one or both parties.  And the fling option is basically not available to you if you had such bad game that you ended up in this spot in the first place."

I know she likes me as: she gave multiple IOIs during the week we were together for, we were very close, walked together alone, arm in arm, etc. Since then in our texts she has mentioned how she misses me, and how she doesn't get to see much as much as she would want to, etc. I also heard from a close friend of hers that she was into me.

When I drop her off, everything seems normal, a lingering hug and goodbye.    This was a good start, but unfortunately......   Then the other guy I was doubling with asked on the way home if we were together, but I wasn't entirely sure. So I text her and outright ask, ""are we like, a thing now?""    ..... you made the mistake of listening to that dude.  He might be a cool enough guy but he basically monkey-wrenched you in the brain and led you to screw up your own chances.  In the future, don't even entertain this kind of pointless dialogue with 3rd parties.  No good can come from it.  He had you doubting a good thing and then you ended up sending her an awkward, needy and insecure message that probably sunk things.   And she says that she'd still like to date around, saying that after her old boyfriend, (I knew him. He. Was. An. ASSHOLE.) She's not really ready for a relationship at this age. (She's 16, I'm 17. Yeah we're kinda young.)    And she responded by being instantly turned off.  What she said was code for, ""I'm not interested anymore; you took things to a non-fun-place and I'm over it.""   I respect her for that, but I would really like some way to convince her that her old boyfriend is an awful example of what it should be, and hopefully become more serious together. How can I go about this without seeming too desperate?   No, dude.  You're talking about logically debating with emotions.  This doesn't work.  Look at yourself!  There you were, just enjoying the ride and so was she.  And then that misguided dork made one comment and suddenly you stopped enjoying yourself and started killing the fun with pressure.  Now, if you can find it in yourself to DROP this whole mission to turn it into something specific, then maybe, maybe you can get back to enjoying yourself, because that's when she was open to you.  Or you can keep on as you are, and you might as well consider this over now."

askseddit,3cy0q6,recyclablebantha,2,Sat Jul 11 23:41:32 2015 UTC,"she was straight forward, telling me she is sex crazy etc... and even sent me pictures of her in undies (not nude tho)   Look, there's a problem here.....  once sex talk becomes overt, it actually makes it less likely for sex to actually happen.  So it, by default, tends to shift that whole interaction into one based on the girl getting validation from you.  Why?  Because all that sex talk, makes it feel contrived and forced when you're actually around each other.  So keeping the actual talk/texting nonsexual, will make things easier for you.  Focus on setting up the logistics to be easier for sex to happen.   later she told me that  i m always trying to take advantage of her (touching her), but not in a mad way, but rather in a semi fun tone... but still i got the feeling that she kinda dislikes it?   This girl sounds annoying.  It complicates the whole picture that this girl keeps talking about sex.  She seems to want to feel like she's a bad girl, without actually being bad.  Talkers often don't walk the walk.    You don't need to next her, necessarily.  But she belongs on the back-burner.  Forget about her as your main focus, for now and if she continues communicating, shift the subject if she keeps bring up sex.  Build tension and flip the script on her by teasing her, asking why that's all she seems to want to text about.  And change the subject.  Don't let her keep it on sex because that keeps you further away from actual sex, the more she talks and texts about it.    And as you shift the conversation away from dirty talk, set up the circumstances to that dirty things can happen.  What you want to do is invite her over to your place or some place that you could escalate more easily with her."

Not thinking about game at all ( except maybe touching your girl a bit). If it's her friend and you, mention you like her and why. ex:  ""Sara's pretty nice isn't she.

askseddit,3cwugd,killaswagyolo420,2,Sat Jul 11 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"I have a big mental sticking point. When I go out I usually roll solo. It's very hard for me to imagine that I can pull a girl away from her friends, especially if its a mixed group of girls and guys, and fuck her. Most girls seem to be ok with taking to the point of flirting, giving their number and maybe making out, but not any further.  Why am I thinking this way?   Not every girl will want to go home with you the first night.  Many more will be open to a 2nd or 3rd night close, though.   My other question is how do you know a girl is a tease? I waste a lot of time pursuing girls who are in relationships and seemingly only interested in getting attention and nothing more.    Hmmm.  What do you mean by ""waste a lot of time pursuing girls in relationships,"" etc.?  You still talking about girls in clubs?    In any case, you always find out which ones are up for it, by trying to push things.  The girls how are just kicking tires but not looking to ""buy,"" will chicken out when it comes down to it.  So you should be slowly heating things up, respectfully, but clearly.  If not, they'll milk you for attention all night.    But if you are asking if they want to go get some food (at a place that just happens to be near your place), they'll go for it if they're down.  And if they're not down, they'll reveal who they really are at that point, and not one second before.  You could accomplish this by easing in for a k-close also."

And where are you on this?  This is more important than the girl, to be honest.  Sort your life out and the women will come.   Also, how do you expect to stand eye to eye with a girl who's got her shit together, if you don't?  And remember, it's not where you are, in the long run, but that you have a direction and you're making progress.   So yeah, she doesn't know about the backstory I reckon, and therefore send out a ton of signals,    Dude.  You're assuming defeat if she finds out more about you.  If you cannot lose this limiting belief, you will kill your chances.   even though I am not the best looking MF in the world.    Another limiting belief.  YOUR opinion of what a good looking guy looks like, is nothing to do with what her personal tastes are.   We had some decent conversations, and she probably sees me like a person who don't take stuff too seriously and like having fun.   You seem to think that this is about you proving yourself to her.  It's not.  It's about the discovery process.  You spend time with someone and find out if you BOTH like each other or not.   So the signals are during two weeks: Long eye contact, preening, tossing hair, often around even though nothing to do there, exaggerated swaying of hips, counted our age difference while she was counting something else, tries to start conversations, points knee/feet towards me, stealing glances, and the shoe dangle.   Dude.  You're going to drive yourself crazy if you get into this idea that you have to ""analyze signs"" before you take action.   Could someone help me out? I would rather get with this girl than keep my job afterwards. Should I start taking her to lunch? Grab a beer after work? What doyou think is the right way to go?   People will say ""don't shit where you eat.""  This is bullshit.  Really, it's ""Don't date at work, if you can't date without leaving a mess behind afterwards.""

And I really haven't tried to prove myself at all towards her, just hung around with my friend at the office having a good time when she comes around. Thing is I do not take a lot of shit seriously, but while talking with someone I like to be pretty serious, talk about how/why they got there, about their dreams and passions and other fun stuff that is meaningful to them and therefore to me.   I do not really analyze the signs per se, I catch them while they are happening, know why they are happening but not really sure how I should proceed because I would like to know that she isnt just being friendly cause Im the new guy and yada yada.

askseddit,3cw9ul,jairod8000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:37:50 2015 UTC,"I asked her if she knew where the place I was looking for was.     People think this is indirect.  Not necessarily.  If you really wanted to know where the place was, then asking was no problem.  If you were making up stuff to talk, that's less optimal.     She pointed me in the direction and then I asked for her name and said she was really pretty.  She laughed, thanked me and then preceded to continue walking.   It's not what you said, it's how you said it.  And it's tough to know how you said it because we weren't there.  Though from her response, it sounds as if the way you said it was weaker than you'd like.  In this case, it wouldn't have mattered what you said, because your confidence isn't quite there yet.   Should I been been more direct from the beginning or should have been more assertive and asked her to stay a bit longer to chat?  Thoughts?   There's a misconception that being ""direct"" requires you to say things like, ""HEY, YOU'RE PRETTY.""  This is incorrect.  Saying such things is just being superficial and random.  Which is fine if you have the confidence/inner game to compensate for the inherent disadvantage in this.    And asking her to stay long and chat would not necessarily be assertive, so much as invasive and creepy.  Pushy, even.  Though confidence is good, the point is not to come at her like charging bull.  Instead you want to be able to balance the ability to display your desires confidently, while showing that you are paying attention and aware of her state and her desires."

No plan.  ;)    Ultimatums are pointless.  If they don't have that the motivation in themselves to meet up, you're not going to create that motivation in her through coercion.

It talks about something similar. when he ""nexted"" the girl it showed that he did not care (abundance mentality/ non-needy). He often was able to get with the girl by saying that he was not interested.   That said you sound needy and awkward: ""must have scared you away"" sounds negative; like she is the prize.   Just invite her along with some thing that you want to do any ways. if she flakes, still go, alone. send her a cool picture and tell her she missed out. Or just tell her that if she is not excited to spend time with you, than you don't want to waste your time with her, good luck (this is from models).   convey that you are non-needy. I can have fun without you. or I am not desperate to get with you, I have options.  ""says she didn't get back to me because she knew I wanted to meet up soon"" ---> sounds like code for ""you seemed needy, but now I am not sure"" or ""now I have some free time"".  or ""the other guy dropped me, you will have to do"".    You are on thin ice. You need to do something to project that you are really non-needy.    remember ""the medium is the message"". If she is talking/ not talking to you that is the message. The time delay between the message is not  chance (if it is she will make it up and blast you with more messages) it is the message. Stop reading what she writes, and just look at how much and how fast she responds (look for deltas, more/less messages or time between them).   you will never know whats going on. mom in hospital? friend was raped? Chad was in town and she wanted his cock. school?  she thinks you are needy?   maybe she sees you as needy and can be a good BB listener/ orbiter.   I can sit and guess all day long.

I told them I thought I could get her number.    Don't do this kind of thing.  Posturing for your friends.....  it's a waste of time.  You need to get your strength from things other than friends opinions.     They called my bluff,    Just to be clear, peer pressure should never be your motivation for doing this kind of thing.   so during breakfast I sat next to her for a minute and at the end of a very brief conversation got her number.    So what exactly did you talk about with her?     How did you open?  How did she respond to that? What did you talk about with her?  What exactly did you say?  What kind of response were you getting from her? What was your cue to number close?  How did you decide when to ask?  How did she respond exactly, besides giving you the number?   These things are important and you've glossed over them.  It's difficult to say what the best angle is unless you can fill in these gaps.   Now it is 10 p.m. and I haven't called or texted her yet. I am only there til 12:00 pm tomorrow and then I am back Monday-Friday. I can't drive and I am in a camp in a different state than my home.  She is also older than me by at least a few years. What should I do?   Opening texts doesn't have to be fancy.  You should have texted before that afternoon.  Nothing to be done about it now.

As you are in high school and if this girl is not, she could face statutory rape charges if the difference is big enough and things go that far.  Which means that some girls wouldn't even bother considering it to begin with.  Also, she may see a 16 year old as immature, depending on the age gap.  You don't even have a ballpark figure for how much older?  Like is she still high school or in college?   Talked about what it was like being a counselor. I basically number closed because I wanted her number and ran out of things to say.   Tough to say based on what you supplied, but you might have conducted yourself well enough to make an impression.  You just condensed the conversation into two sentences though.

In what situations and contexts are you trying to get your game on?   Now let my tell you my initial reaction to what you wrote. It seems you think that women will just... fall into your lap if you're a charming, charismatic guy. Wrong, wrong, wrong.   Many souls have been tossed down that Pit of Bones. The point you need to realise is that you can be the most confident, good looking, charming guy in the world but you need to INITIATE. You need to go up to these ladies and make them laugh, make them think, make them cry. Traditionally (And I hate the way that men are seen as the 'hunters' in the western tradition of seduction, but that's life) it is the men who show interest in the women and they respond accordingly. And THAT is the art of seduction.  Seduction is not moulding yourself into some sort of walking Lynx advert. It is making yourself into a man that talks and charms a woman, making her interested in him from his actions towards her.  But I could be getting this completely wrong. It's hard to judge what you mean when you haven't given me a context. So tell me boy, when and where are you talking to these ladies? What sort of ladies are they? Friends, strangers, work buddies?

I feel as a young adult at university i talk to enough girls and have recently been trying to somewhat make my intentions clear. But i still find that difficult. Any tips on that?  Most of the situations i talk to women would be at nights out, house parties or gatherings with friends. Having just finished university there was never no oppurtunities to meet young, like minded people.

And the problem is that there isn't a set formula. This isn't welding, riveting or algebra. Every woman is different, has had a a different life and a different chain of events has lead her to talking to you. I can't give you a 'killer' one liner that works every time cause guess what?

Suppose you're getting the vibes of attraction. What then?  Well you've got to move the conversation to something sexual. Make it obvious that you find her attractive. Reach out and touch her shoulder when you tell a joke or are making a point.  Then you slowly get closer. Not in a creepy way. Don't persist if she moves back. But I've found this is actually the best way to escalate. Every minute or so, subtly move a bit closer then before you know it your nearly brushing noses as you talk. From there it is simple to slip forward for the kiss.   But this is not a formula and I can't tell you how to escalate cause every situation requires something different.   Now. To point you made. How do you say 'I'm here talking to you with the ultimate goal of sex'. WHAT?! Don't try and say that. You're trying to show them the opposite. You're trying to show them that you're a cultured, funny human being that likes them as a person. Having sex with them would be a amazing bonus. That is what you're meant to be saying.

Approach with the intent of getting shot down enough times until you no longer care what the girl you're approaching thinks, this will breed confidence within you.

That's the trip about being creepy it lies in your perception of the situation.   Rather than you're beautiful try getting more specific. ""I like that dress, you're hair too.""

Maybe you're not ready to date, so you're attracted to girls with a really low probability of success.     I'm inexperienced when dealing with girls I already have known for a fair few years, even though we have got to know each other a lot better recently   The point is moot because you don't ""seduce"" girls you're in the friend-zone with.  If you're advanced, you MIGHT have a fling with one, but that's usually the limit.  And if you're inexperienced....  you're better off turning your energy towards girls you don't know yet."
askseddit,3cmv0f,recyclablebantha,5,Thu Jul 9 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"I just got out of a long term relationship (4 years) a few months ago.   You do realize that a 4 year relationship could take a while to FULLY recover from, right?  Before we even start, realize how much improvement you're looking at by even hooking up with a girl this soon.   I've been trying out some new materials and things are working out fairly well.   Just out of curiosity, a couple of questions.   How and why exactly, did the 4 year relationship end?  Yes it's relevant. What are you really looking for here?  Like if you could have something right NOW, what would it be?  A relationship?  Something casual?  Something else?  Be honest.  If its something like ""I want my old relationship back or something like it,"" then that's something you need to process and deal with. What ""new materials"" are you trying out? What's your overall approach/pick-up style?    Then I hooked up with this chick, and somehow,  I can't convince myself to put her in my FwB list. I'm having a hard time not being emotionally invested in her.   Why is it so important to not be emotionally invested?  If you have a feeling, then ill things come when you suppress it.  Like that feeling tends to find another outlet and it messes with something else in your life.  It's like you're talking about going to a deli when you really like meat and having a hard time not eating meat.  Why are you expending so much energy to suppress this natural reaction you're having?  That's what seems to be wrong.   That and I am always not interested when my FwBs want to get it on with me. I find myself making excuses not to come around (which actually be a good way of invoking the principle of scarcity). But really, I'm just not into it any more idk why.   This indicates that you've gamed some girls, just for the sake of gaming them and getting in there, with little to no regard for what YOU actually want.  Why would you sleep with women that you don't want to be around?"
askseddit,3cmv0f,elgskred,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:57:40 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has that sweet spot for emotional attachment or trust that they need to at least reach if not surpass, before sex is taken to a new level of enjoyment. I can do friends with benefits, but personally get nothing from a drunken one night stand. I don't know the girl yet, so i give zero fucks about her enjoyment of the act, she's more of a tool or means for me to do what I need. Obviously, as a result the sex is usually bad, so i don't do it anymore, and also stopped first or second date sex mostly unless I feel confident it's gonna last many more dates.   If we're kind of dating so there's some tension and we kinda know eachother or we've been like friends for a some months and we both have reasons for not wanting to date that doesn't relate to our personality, sex has usually been pretty great, from my pov because I cate about the girl and her enjoyment too. I actually like the girl, in some way, so if course I do. So I'll happily go the extra mile just to make her happy.   Your threshold may be different from mine, but I assume you have one too. And maybe it's high since you were in a ltr and that's the kind of attachment you're used to lately."

askseddit,3cmv0f,cmiovino,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: It takes about half the time of the relationship to get fully out of it once a breakup occurs. Yours was 4 years, it'll take a solid 2 years for you to be ok again and ready for a relationship or feel ok with FWB relations. Trust me, I've had three that lasted for 3-4 years each since early high school. It took about 1 year to feel comfortable again, but another to be totally detached from the other person.  With that said, there is nothing wrong with you. I like relationships more. I find it's easier to focus on one girl rather than juggle multiple. Also, I actually like having a real connection with a girl.  I've learned this though. Girls move on way quicker than guys. Also, when you're in a relationship, many times we aren't moving forward as men on our purpose. We neglect hobbies, our passions, etc.. we don't lift as hard, develop ourselves, and neglect friends and other social gatherings. When it ends, we wake up and go ""What did I do for the last 4 years?""  Because of this, a solid a few months of lifting and doing you is needed. Whatever you're good at and enjoy, go do it. I've tried many times to just come right out of a relationship and start the seduction thing again and it just doesn't work... it's like hitting a brick wall."
askseddit,3cmv0f,lilhurt38,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:06 2015 UTC,It's pretty much expected that you'd be wanting emotional attachment after being in relationship for 4 years. Being emotionally attached to someone was your norm for the past 4 years. I don't think that it's a great idea to jump into another relationship just to fulfill that need for emotional attachment though. Do it when you're ready. Continue to meet girls and you'll have options for that when you're ready.  There's probably going to be a bit of a hole in your heart for the next few months and that's fine.

Did I kinda ""trick"" her to get her number?   You should have included this in your prior post on the matter instead of being so indirect.  That indirectness is part of the problem.    You did ""trick"" the number out of her by getting it under the pretense of this borrowed item, instead of why you apparently wanted it.  This kind of indirectness is creepy or unattractive, depending on the situation.   Should I just try and meet with her after class and ask her for a coffee thing?    Chat with her naturally when you have an opening.  Don't try to plan it or it will go terribly.   Should I just try to engage in small talk....   Sure!   and she if she's giving any signals?    Uh....  it depends on what you mean.  You should always be paying attention.  But you shouldn't be in your head comparing every little thing she is doing, against some list in your head.     Should I try to apologize for the book thing and turn it into a little hangout - ""Oh sorry for taking your book, to make it up to you, can I take you out for some coffee?"" or something else?   NO.  Don't apologize.  This is getting indirect again.  YOU are good enough.  If this girl finds you attractive, you don't need these excuses, anymore than she needs to trick you into hanging out.

askseddit,3cls9p,recyclablebantha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:42:49 2015 UTC,"Others have responded and are saying pretty much what I'm thinking, but I'll leave mine too.  Decent opener actually, I mean, it got you talking and that's all openers are really needed for. You had her number, so you should have been texting fun, short messages, noting super related to studying or work. You should have turned something in the conversion sarcastic and/or funny.  The good news is, all is not lost. You gave back the book, but still have the number. Since you see her in class, I would chat her up there. It's not weird because you have something in common now.  And if this all fails, she's not interested, or whatever, understand that everything like this is a learning situation. I've done a lot of daygame type stuff, approaching girls on the street. Anytime I'd be indirect and ask for directions, the time, or comment on something really indirect and not related to her, I'd bomb out. The girl would be creeped out.  When I changed to being direct, things massively changed. Rejects weren't weird, they were more like, chat for 5 minutes, have genuine fun, then when I ask for coffee, she might say ""Sorry, I do actually have a boyfriend, but if I didn't I'd be totally in.""... and that's it, that's the harshest rejections. Even if it's true or not. MOST of the time though, if it's all going well, being direct works. It shows confidence, it's to the point so you're not wasting time, and is attractive to women.  Next time, if you see a girl in class, especially summer class, just go up to her after class with a smile and say something like ""Hey, excuse me, you just caught my eye back there and seemed interesting. Who are you?"" If she's attracted, she'll smile back and chat. If not, then oh well, you tried, you don't think about it and rack your brain about if she likes you or not. It either is or isn't and you know in the first 2 minutes. Its not crrepy. I she denies you, you smile and just say ""Nah, that's cool. Have a great rest of your day."""
askseddit,3cllff,contra_nap,0,Wed Jul 8 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"I was texting this girl across the country.....   Ask yourself what the point of turning some girl on, who is across the country, when there are girls NEAR you that you could be having actual sex with, rather than looking at text on a screen while you masturbate.    I get that it's exciting, but this whole thing is counter-productive to actual sex.  The very moment you start overtly talking about sex with someone before you've actually had sex, you are making it increasingly unlikely that you'll get to have real sex with them.  Of course, if text is enough....  then knock yourself out.  Just know what you're getting into."
askseddit,3cllff,recyclablebantha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"I understand the appeal that OP sees. Having this sort of arrangement with someone you may never meet carries significant benefits. Not having to spend any money or effort to connect with someone sexually is a good ace in the hole,  a way to practice sexting / texting, and doesn't detract from any other efforts to land girls locally.  I run a few businesses and rarely have time to land partners near me. Having someone to talk to that's always available is a substitute I'm totally down with.   As far as OP goes,  there's Braddock's text guide,  but I'd suggest that he read some erotica.. And real stuff,  not shit like 50 Shades. Stuff that women have written will allow him to emulate their style and use vocabulary and images that they will respond favorably to."

She seemed annoyed by him and kept trying to talk to me but I'm a nice guy and didn't want to exclude the guy (Yes I know I f'd up LOL XD) eventually she said she was going to sleep and left me to talk with the guy. (any advice for this?)   You already know the answer.  You needed to respond by isolating while simultaneously dismissing him.  Like you could suggest stepping out to some venue or walking to some picturesque location that's still accessible and/or open and simultaneously tell the guy that it was nice meeting him and see you later, etc.  The girl was on your side so she would have supported your actions.  (Hint: in the future, be on the lookout for these kinds of places.  Know where the late-night spots are.  The little mom and pop joints that stay open late.  The dance places.  The places with a good view at night.   Anyways, Hostels have a lot of awesome people and I was wondering if any of you had any cool hostel pick up game advice.   You seem to have a good feel for it.....  Just have fun and share your observations with the people around you, to start conversations and relate to them   Sounds like he was going for the classic amog neutralizer where he tries to win you over, so that he can isolate the hb for later   Hmmm.

BUT.. on the other hand, some dates are way easier than others. THere's no reason to set up an obstacle that doesn't need to be there. In this case that obstacle would be, how do I isolate (making it feel like it's just you in her optimizes a great time with a girl) but be part of that group sometimes too. A whole new thing you've gotta deal with.   It is very much possible to deal with that element  and have a great date... but if you don't want to deal with it and you just wanna get to know her, just go out with her for the ice cream or coffee or park."

Alternatively an easy way to plan a date proposal is to just plan to do something FUN and interesting for you.  Then invite her to join you.

These are indirect approaches and it feels really weird going from that to ""Oh by the way, you're kinda cute, who are you?"" or even just ""Who are you?""  Advice: Be direct, but not overly direct and creepy. Basically like ""Hey, excuse me. Pause Your shirt really caught my eye. Who are you?"" or even just ""Hey excuse me. Who are you?""... they answer, shake hands, ec.. ""Yeah, I know it's odd, but you just seemed interesting. I wanted to see what you're all about"".  I find being overly directly like ""Hey, you're gorgeous. Who are you?"".. can be creepy at times. This usually works for guys who are overly attractive themselves.

askseddit,3cl2cf,cmiovino,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"some good advice here. I was trying to think of something a little different. Here's a scenario while at a bar: Sitting at the bar or standing near a couple girls waiting to order a drink for myself. Then you can naturally start up a convo about their drinks, what their wearing or whatever. Its natural since you're sharing the same space. And it doesn't come off as your're trying to pick them up.   Being at the mall is a little different because you have to be more direct and can come off as creepy (sometimes). Its hard to explain but I don't want it to seem like im actively trying to hit on them or pick them up (at first)."
askseddit,3cl2cf,recyclablebantha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to walk up to girls with the intention of picking them up. I want it to seem like we bumped into each other on accident to make it seem more natural. That way the women will be more open to talking to me. If she seems interested then I can escalate from there. So any ideas on creating natural social interactions at the mall?   Some ideas:  Be at the mall for a reason that ISN'T girls.  Like you have something to buy or something you're looking for.  A mission of some sort.  Plus you might get some food after you complete your mission.  You shouldn't be shooting to hang at the mall all afternoon anyway unless you have an involved mission.  Be present to the moment and relate to people, not just girls, based on that.  What does that mean?     Interact with PEOPLE.  Don't just scan for girls and jump from girl to girl.  Be a part of the social tapestry.  Not a predator. Pay attention.  Your awareness should be focused on the world around you and the people in it.  Then you comment or ask questions based on what you observe.   All this allows you to have material you can open with, that isn't some random stuff like telling her she's cute or asking who she is.  People have something on their mind when you walk up.  If you walk up with random bullshit, you're probably going to increase the difficulty curve, versus if you walk up and say something that instantly relates to her based on what is going on right THEN.    ""Direct"" vs ""Indirect""  Some people think it's a gimmick to say something like, ""Hey, excuse me, what time is it?"" or ""Hey, excuse me, do you know where XYZ is?""  This isn't entirely correct.  It's not indirect if you really want to know what you're asking about.  The point is that you shouldn't be making up bullshit when you open.  If you really want to know something, just f--king ask something.    But don't ask something just for the sake of opening.  I've opened with, ""Hey, do you know what they're serving at the end of this line.""  Because I wanted to know.  I ended up talking with those girls too and going out with one of them.  It's not indirect to open with some question you actually want the answer to.  And it's not ""direct"" to walk up and tell her she's cute or ask who she is..... it's inattentive and requires good game to compensate for the inherent awkwardness and the fact that those openers don't leave you anywhere to go unless you break out your ""real"" opener."

Talk to her for long enough and she'll drop it if she wants you to know.  You chat, make conversation, connect, make her laugh, etc. If you can do this, getting a number is a non issue. Even if she has a boyfriend, you can get the number and figure it out later.   Picking up a girl who is working (at a store or something?) is difficult. You have to take the time to build up something generally, and it's not the easiest thing to do if you're shy/inexperienced/etc. Hard to do in only a few visits unless she really likes you.

It was a small workplace and her boss was always in sight/earshot. I was passing the place/ in the place a few times over the few days, and she always spoke to me/smiled at me/waved at me. And I basically did nothing.  I'm a shy person, not very self confident and definitely not experienced with women. I'm trying to work on all of that. I'm not too long out of a very long relationship, so I'm very off whatever game I had. I didn't get her name/number/way to contact her again.

askseddit,3ck0cy,ineedtwodollars,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"That sounds promising, sounds like you at least had a shot at chatting her up and asking for a number.  Yeah, asking for a number is easy if you've got a connection. What you want to do is get to a point in conversation where it's flowing well, she's smiling, or at least curious by you, you can say hey - it was nice to meet you, what's your number, we could hang out some time, or whatever feels natural to you. Usually works best at the end, so you can say, hey I gotta go, but I'd like to chat again soon, whats your number, etc etc.  If you judge the tone, you'll very rarely get rejected for a number. The absolute worst thing you'll get is 'sorry I have a boyfriend' or 'I don't give my number out to strangers', etc.   But you can't build it up. You want the number right? So what's stopping you from being honest and doing what you feel like doing. If you met a cool guy, and you wanted to meet up again, you'd just say dude, whats your number. It's not too different with women. You just have to stop mindfucking yourself and slowly realize that these things aren't big deals. It's just life, man. You can do whatever, you can be how you want to be. Don't be timid. Be somebody.   You're a shy guy now, but you don't have to be. Work on yourself dude. Day by day. Start with the small stuff you can change right away - clothes, hair, posture. Then start talking to people. Say hi to random people in the shops you pass by, or on the street. Ask the people who work in the stores you frequent how their day was. Just chat away. People respond well to it and it gives you practice."

You stuck around her pretending to be a friend when you actually had feelings for her. Even if she initially had attraction for you, you have since grown too familiar and too comfortable. So you became more a 'brotherly figure', for obvious reasons, the 'brother vibe' turns girls off sexually. Thus cementing your place in the friend zone.   So it really doesn't matter what you say or do at this point, she'll still feel like you a brother to her and one she doesn't ever want to hook up with. So its a waste of your time to continue trying.  Next girl, make it clear you are attracted to her and act accordingly.

askseddit,3cj0vd,Xumas300,4,Wed Jul 8 08:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yup. Say you want to hang out with her alone. A girl who is interested in you won't suggest bringing a friend, but then, this situation is a bit different, by the sounds of it, you've been friends with this girl for a while? Either way, not an ideal position to be in. This is why you escalate early. Leaving it this long makes it difficult.  If your intentions are more than friends, you need to do something about that. It may be too late, depending on what your 'besties4eva' level currently is, but yeah. There are some threads around here on this, I saw a few recently."

You're correct though, it isn't true 100% of the time.  OP's situation is a bit different, it sounds like he's already pretty good friends with this girl so it may be difficult to change that relationship."

askseddit,3cj0vd,forseti_,2,Wed Jul 8 09:50:13 2015 UTC,PS: I know them both very well. Both her and her friend.   What are you after?  How long have you known her?  What is the hangout actually?  Who suggested it?  What exactly was said and done when this was proposed?

LTR  2) 3 years, but we got connected this year (2015)  3) I suggested that i took her out for bowling and kicked her ass, she begged me not to lol and wanted to take it on wii. I said aight. And then she told me that they had constriuction work so they couldn't do it on wii and she proposed that we go,  walking or bicycling and then she asked if its okay if she could bring her friend.  She has later apologized for that though."
askseddit,3cj0vd,recyclablebantha,0,Wed Jul 8 11:43:04 2015 UTC,"2) 3 years, but we got connected this year (2015)   Well, if you knew her but didn't really interact with her much....  and if it was almost like you were meeting her for the first time, then this can still work.   3) I suggested that i took her out for bowling and kicked her ass, she begged me not to lol and wanted to take it on wii. I said aight.

She has later apologized for that though.   So you're going bowling or something social like that, then her bringing a friend isn't that bad.  When something like this happens, it's not the end of the world.  Having a friend of hers around can help you in a number or ways.  Watching their interactions can be quite instructive.

That should be when you're out doing stuff. She has friends and stuff to do too. Even if you don't, it makes it seem that you do. Don't go over the top for the first meetup. Personally.. I don't like any type of food dates initially. Coffee is great.. quick, cheap, and you're not waiting for food staring at each other with long pauses. Coffee is casual.. food is more in depth. You don't even know this girl, so your investment in her should reflect that... even if you're head over heels."

Personally I'd do something low key first to scope her out in case she's a complete psychopath, but assuming she's cool....I always prefer dessert over dinner, it's more casual, you can get like a hot chocolate and go for a walk, etc.  But anyway, she's not 6, go and see Ted if you're more into that. I think it'd be more entertaining and a better move overall. Definitely have a hot drink or do something before the movie so you can warm up, movies aren't ideal first dates. But they can be OK if the girl is super chill."

askseddit,3chynf,sneakatdatavibe,2,Wed Jul 8 03:38:28 2015 UTC,Please get her to do anything at all other than dinner and a movie. That is the king of terrible first dates. Do something interactive where you can actually get to know each other and have fun
askseddit,3chynf,bjlmag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Just matched with a girl on Tinder and she suggested to catch a movie (at a theater) and have dinner. She seems pretty down.    First off, as everyone is saying, dinner and a movie always sounds like a good idea when people are inexperienced.  Until they find out that a movie is basically two people sitting in the dark and not interacting.  And the fact that it's a first date AND in public at a theater, means that you're most likely not going to be escalating either.  Dinner is fine though.....   We're both 19. I feel like dinner would be a little awkward because sitting across from each other, I would not have a lot of opportunities to escalate kino. I want to get comfortable with her before heading into the movie.    Well, it's a first date, so again, it's not like you're on some timer to heat things up right away during dinner.  You HAVE too play things by ear.  Which requires paying attention to her.  So you don't need to force kino during dinner.  You can connect with her through conversation.     As for the movie itself, would something raunchy like Ted 2 be a good choice or something more innocent and playful like Minions?    Don't ask us.  Collaborate with her.  She's the one you're going with.   And if dinner isn't a good idea, what else should be done?   Dinner was fine.  The movie wasn't.  Some sort of activity would have been better.  Playing pool.  Bowling.  Partner dancing.  Hiking.  Really it depends on what you guys are into."

Anyways, She lost her pet rat today and made a sad post on FB. Should I text consoling her? or will it come off as creepy/Clingy guy?   She's an FWB.  So you don't need to do anything.  If you did, it wouldn't be creepy but it might inject too much emotion into things and turn her off.   I dont know how to handle a women when they are sad.   Dude.  It's a FB post.  About a pet rat.  Have some perspective.  It's not like someone in her family died.  She'll be fine.  She's not desperate for a shoulder to cry on over this.  Perhaps you should be honest with yourself about how emotionally invested you are in this FWB situation.  It seems like you are almost looking for some way to stand out above those other 2 guys.  It seems like you are looking for ways to be more emotionally connected with her.  Which is apparently not what she wants.     I personally like to be left alone when I am sad.Help please.     So?  You're not her and she's not that sad."
askseddit,3cgkag,jimmiereese3327,2,Tue Jul 7 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"We then talked about her problems with a guy she thinks she likes, this was very hard for me because I didn't want the two getting with each other, but I decided that it was best to give honest advice because I just want her to be happy.    Listen to yourself.  You need to find a better way to channel your energy.  You're getting wrapped up in something that is out of your hands.  You don't want them hooking up, but you lost your chance almost 3 years ago.  And this business of just wanting her to be happy.....  I'm sure it's true but it's obscuring the fact that you are submerging your own desire for happiness and entering martyrdom.  What about YOUR happiness?  Your lack of initiative in pursuing that is why you're in this situation now, watching as the girl you are interested in is shopping around for other dudes to be with.   She openly talks about the people she thinks are handsome/cute when she's with me. That left me worrying that the odds of her liking me (more than just friends) were very low.    Let's not bullshit here.  If you are only just now thinking of the odds of her liking you being low, you have been lying to yourself for YEARS.  Not only that, but you're even now still not facing it.  The phrase you're looking for is, ""The odds of her liking you as more than friends is zero.""  I'm not trying to be mean here.  But you are screwing yourself over by failing to acknowledge the truth and sticking to this girl.  In three years, you have most certainly been passing up all kinds of opportunities for dating happiness with other girls.   .....out of nowhere I felt the urge to honestly tell her that I had feelings for her......it felt like a huge weight disappeared from my shoulders......   This relief is misplaced; you should be going with the urge to make moves within a short time of knowing them.  And the best move is never going to be opening with some declaration of feelings, anyway.   She then told me she never thought I had feelings for her and that I was very good at hiding them.    Ouch.  It's not good when someone says you've been ""very good at hiding"" your intentions with them.  Don't do this to yourself anymore.  You have to take action when you meet someone cool, within 1-3 weeks at the most.  Or history will repeat itself.   .....she's the first girl that I told I had feelings for.    Again, this isn't the way to go, at least not like this.  It's not the same in every case, but as a basic rule of thumb:     You meet a girl.  If you think she's interested, ask her out.   You hang out and make moves.  Then after something like kissing and/or sex happens,  THEN you might start talking about where it's going.....  And generally, the L word or anything close to that, won't come up until well after that.    I know she likes guys who are kind and that's confusing me because I'm very shy but people always tell me that I'm one of the kindest people they ever met. They say that I'm different than most guys because I have this warm-love thing about me that makes them feel good around me.    Dude.  Girls often talk about what looks good ""on paper"" as far as relationships go, but that often doesn't speak at all to what actually puts fire in their engine."

Just tell a girl that you're going to do X and she should join you or she can join you.  Bonus points for inferring or outright stating that you're doing X because it's fun and/or interesting.

No.  Example:  I'm going to Bar Blue to get some drinks because there's this really cool jazz band playing,  You should join me!  This way helps create the mindset that you're going to do something fun and it happens with or without her.  So it's helpful when you schedule dates, that you are creating an event that you actually want to do, with or without her.  So your attitude will be better when you present it to her.

""Alright, I don't want to twist your arm."" ""It won't kill me if you don't really want to hang out with me."" ""Ah I see."" "" Well that sucks"" ""Sorry."" ""That's not what I want.""   The moment she said ""If you want to interpret this as bad, go ahead"" she's effectively saying ""walk away, I dare you""  That's what you should be saying to her. Here's how it should have gone down instead:  Let's pretend that she just sent ""Pork messes with my system""  ""Hey I hope you feel better. Let's raincheck after your Swine Flu clears."" (You're optimistic, you're telling (not asking), and somewhat edgy/funny)  You might even add ""Make sure you write down that I get your toaster oven if you don't make it"" (depends on her disposition on jokes).  Let's pretend she just sent me ""go right ahead""  I would respond with: ""Whoa there tiger. We both know that you want to see me. I'm just worried about your plague spreading.""  Or if i was genuinely offended: ""Whoa there tiger. I gatta stop you right there. I only prioritize spending time with people who prioritize the same. Perhaps when you've decided you're more invested, we could try again.""    You have the power in this society. Use it."
askseddit,3cdpu0,michael98118,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:22:24 2015 UTC,"....having gotten in later than expected I didn't contact her right away. ....Around 2 pm that Friday, she texts me saying she was expecting me to contact her earlier.  I kind of brush that off and immediately ask her out to dinner.  She takes hours to respond and then says ""I wish you had asked sooner, I'm hanging out with my folks tonight.""  I tell her that's cool and to have fun.   This......reeks of bullshit.  She knew you'd be back on Friday and you were already tentatively talking about hanging that evening.  So it's a deliberate move on her part to schedule something over that timeslot.  I would question whether it was really dinner with the folks.  Also, ""hanging with her folks tonight?""  Like the whole night?  That really comes off like an excuse she pulled out of her a--.     I tried to make plans for the rest of the weekend, but she doesn't have time.     All weekend?  This stinks more and more, the more I read.  If she wanted to see you, as you wanted to see her, she could have made something happen at some point.   So about a week goes by and I'm free again on Friday.  I hit her up again, and its the same situation.  She takes forever to respond and then essentially says she's too busy Friday and Saturday, but ""maybe Sunday then!""   This girl sounds like she's dating again.  She's busy on the prime dating days/nights of the weekend and she maybe has time on Sunday, after the dust has settled, maybe not if she's still with her date from the prior night.   Sunday comes along, same behavior...... When ( the details ) are almost completely set she bails and says: ""I appreciate you wanting to take me out to lunch, but I'm not feeling that well today.""   Sounds like she really doesn't want to see you again.  Two weeks and she can't find time?  Implausible.   Me: Ah I see.  Well that sucks, I'm sorry you feel crummy.  Hope you feel better soon. / Her: Thanks.  And hey, if you'd rather interpret me feeling gross, grumpy, and depressed as me not wanting to see you, go right ahead.   Wow.  She sounds like a piece of work.  Trying to pass it off as you ruining things is a stroke of manipulative geniu-  Actually it's a trick older than dirt.  Sounds like she doesn't have the balls to say that she doesn't want to see you anymore and wants to set it up so that you can be the one who ""ruins it"" and gets the blame so she can feel better about it.   She has mentioned how pork messes with her before, and she has had a lot of shit going on in her life (laid off, family issues), so I'm a bit worried I was insensitive with the way I treated her.     Look, when you're seeing someone, you WANT to see them when you have shit going on in your life.  We like connection and we like to have it with people when things are difficult.  What she is doing is grasping for excuses.     When bad things happen, we reach out to the ones who matter.  When bad things happen, we tend to push away people and things that don't matter to us.  Period.   I guess I have two questions:  should I apologize to her for being insensitive?     Uh, no.    There are two possibilities here and both suck:   She's trying to pass the blame onto you for her inability to break things off in a healthy way.  She either wants you to break up with her or she wants it to be ""your fault."" This is how she deals with the normal ups and downs of life and she'll always push you away at regular intervals like this.    And, should I continue to pursue this girl or just let her go?   Honestly, I'd already have started dating around if I were you.  :P   Especially if you guys weren't even up to the titles of BF and GF."
