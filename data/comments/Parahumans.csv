Both entities get murdered by beings who really shouldn't have been a threat, and Contessa frequently fails. In the end, she didn't do much in the Zion fight.

Parahumans,3e3qv5,starshadowx2,10,Tue Jul 21 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"The detail about Parian's power that interested me was how it dispersed and expanded:   ""But her control of larger things was an entirely different beast. Her telekinesis fell apart when she tried to move anything heavier than a half-pound or so, her dexterity and speed in moving those objects that much slower. Worse, her telekinesis exploded, and not even in a constructive manner. It got more and more unstable as she tried to move larger things, until it simply… expanded, dissipated over an area in an attempt to extend control to a multitude of tiny, lightweight objects. [...] She’d experimented, after getting her power. Found that she could contain the telekinesis and keep it from dissipating. It hadn’t been constructive until she started working with more flexible materials. Porous materials worked best, because her telekinesis could soak into them, through them, and allow her to move the fabric rather than just the material within. The gaps in the fabric allowed her to feed power into the ‘shell’ without it building to critical mass and collapsing. Cloth worked best. Torn or ripped seams could be mended, any other damage proved easily fixable, compared to the issues sturdier material posed. It was plentiful, cheap, and effective. Cloth was her ideal material.""  Perhaps Parian's telekinesis not only has the effect of, on its own, trying to extend over a larger area by trying to effect small things, but also to disperse any energy in the area she is manipulating into affecting a large area instead of the small point at which it was directed. This could potentially stifle the effectiveness of Behemoth, as wildbow stated that Parian's power would be effective against him  I'm a bit shaky on this idea though, as wildbow stated that Parian's did not involve containing the effects of a power, although is this technically containment?

Parahumans,3e5ov6,19283123,3,Wed Jul 22 03:49:30 2015 UTC,"From a writing perspective Wildbow has opened himself to way to much ""but time travel"" which is why so many of the time powers in Worm are so restricted.  It still leaves glaring plot holes with the entities: Why doesn't Scion resurrect Eden? Why doesn't Eden have an ' if Eden == dead{rewind time}' shard? Why doesn't Scion freeze time on a macro scale at any point? Wouldn't Scion and Eden keep some time shards to ensure the success of the cycle since they are so blatantly insta-success? ... and on and on and on.  For the most part it works, but you can see how quickly it devolved into contradiction. This is the main reason why I think time powers are faux time manipulation and not true time based powers. The world just works better under those terms, but that is just my head canon.  Wildbow probably keeps the whole time powers and shard stuff so loose to avoid these inconsistencies."
Parahumans,3e5ov6,Rillet,2,Wed Jul 22 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"To quote my flatmate - ""time travel ruins sci-fi"". He complains that whenever time travel (inevitably) gets introduced to a sci-fi series, it ruins the plot because everything gets complicated.  You can't make a series with time travel as a side mechanic. Either it's small things (like we see in Worm), it dominates the plot (which can be fine - like Back to the Future), or it breaks the plot - people coming back to life makes death trivial, people not coming back to life breaks immersion because that seems like a good thing to do (and Worm is known for have characters that don't act stupidly and artificially handicap themselves), etc.  In story, it's probably something entities haven't figured out how to do. They might be able to do time-speed manipulation and have ""back ups"", but can't actually turn back the clock. Any effect that looks like time travel (ie Cody) is actually a bunch of different effects (like the shard using precog to know what Cody is going to travel back, making a backup in another universe, then swapping the two when Cody ""uses"" his power). After all, actual time travel would probably enable them to reverse entropy and they wouldn't need to do this whole conflict thing.  Another explanation is that the cost is simply too high - much like the PtV shard."
Parahumans,3e5ov6,pendia,2,Wed Jul 22 04:31:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think timetravel exists in worm. I think the entities and powers just simulate it.  Greyboys time fuckery fields are just biokinesis fields that physically alter whatever was in there to a previous state, and repeatedly biokinesis what's in there. This would also explain continuity of consciousness in the brain.  Phir Se has portals, maybe with some level of precog that he's unaware of, and a similar matter/energy generation field. He opens portal A and his power precogs what is going to go into portal B later on, and creates it for portal A. The thing that goes into portal B is quietly destroyed. So; Phir Se creates A. His power precogs that in 1 minute, a grenade will travel through portal B. It creates and throws a grenade out of portal A. The grenade enters portal B. The power deconstructs the grenade.  The reason I have this headcanon is that yeh, time travel kind of breaks the setting, but also, the powers build themselves upon context and shit. If they attach to a human who really really really needs some time power fuckery, the shards will build a rough approximation.  With precog and sufficient creativity with other powers, you can easily simulate time travel to the point that noone would know, and this doesn't break the setting."

My experience with the genre is not vast, but I've only encountered maybe one or two works that incorporated serious time travel in a coherent and mostly airtight manner.

If you go down to nitty-gritty physics, one potential method of time travel of going faster than the speed of light would take infinite energy.

Hatchet face can stop a Blaster from firing his LAZORS!!! but if LAZORS!!! are coming to him he won't lolnope them. The blast still hits. Still, the question is hard to answer.

What happens is that Coil gets a precognitive vision of two possible realities and can choose which one of those to follow.

Parahumans,3e2wru,wiikipedia,6,Tue Jul 21 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'm explaining this well. There is no alternate self for Coil to sense.  Coil decides he wants to use his power. He then immediately gets visions of two potential futures like any other precog, although he erroneously believes those visions are memories. No time has passed at this point, and neither future has actually happened in any timeline.  Coil then chooses which vision he wants to become real. Now Coil's shard takes over his body and walks through exactly what the vision Coil chose showed, just like how Contessa uses her power to follow the exact ""path to victory"" (although Contessa could at least abort her plan if she wished, whereas Coil is locked into his course as soon as he chooses a reality)."
Parahumans,3e2wru,ZeroNihilist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"I see. So what you're saying is that if he encounters Hatchet face he either defaults to the other timeline or both timelines fall? I not, what do you think would happen?"
Parahumans,3e2wru,sheikheddy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:50 2015 UTC,sounds like he thinks it'd work as normal until coil was in physical proximity and then he'd slip the prediction's chain and from coil's perspective suddenly be jumped to a bonus third timeline with both memories extending beyond that point? in which case does he go back on the rails if he gets out of range(unable to act on it until the simulation hits its end or another nullifier and very much feeling the way his power really works for the first time)?  ...because that doesn't sound right
Parahumans,3e2wru,pseudonarne,5,Tue Jul 21 18:09:32 2015 UTC,"Coil's power is precognition that after he chooses a timeline his power runs on ""automatic"" until the point in time reached. Unless the power decides to say ""fuck it"" whenever it sees a future situation in which the power would be nullified the timelines would work regularly for Coil with no effects from Hatchet Face. He would also be able to choose which timeline to go to as it happens in the past.

Parahumans,3e2wru,AsamiWithPrep,7,Tue Jul 21 20:15:51 2015 UTC,"When Coil ""splits the timeline"", his shard simulates two branching realities. Both simulations halt when one finds a situation that would cause Coil to want to collapse that timeline, or presumably when he's killed. With all of that data pre-calculated, the shard pushes him into the path that didn't collapse and feeds him the simulation data from the one that did as time passes.  So if Hatchet Face is in the area, Coil can't run a simulation and thus can't split the timeline - that part's obvious. What also might happen is that the power nullification might interrupt the shard feeding him the data from the simulation that collapsed. That seems pretty likely to me, and Coil would probably see that as one of his timelines being forced to collapse without his consent.  Alternatively, his shard might be able to predict that it will be interrupted by Hatchet Face and respond in one of a couple different ways. It might see the failure coming from the first split and immediately dump both (or neither) timeline into his head as soon as he makes the decision. It might subtly push him onto a path where he doesn't end up in that situation to begin with. Like with Skitter's bugs working while she's unconscious, we can't always predict how a shard's going to act in unusual circumstances."
Parahumans,3e2wru,Versac,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:38 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive that Coil noticing Hatchet face in the area would collapse the timeline of his own volition before he pisses himself.

Sy/Jamie I could see going either way, but I suspect they're probably just best buds.  I wonder... I remember hearing that male-male affection (of a heterosexual nature) used to be much more freely expressed, until around the time when Oscar Wilde was jailed and everyone became much more concerned about asserting how very not gay they were (an attitude that then persisted despite the progress of the rights movement), which isn't that far from the time period the story is set, and now I'm curious whether Wildbow has read the same thing and chosen to incorporate it."

And in close proximity to stuff like ""I looked at her legs, but I didn’t see the magic that had others so enchanted."" But it's really a toss-up because a) if he feels attraction yet, he's not totally conscious of it b) the stuff between him and Jamie is also fully consistent with the 'best buds' interpretation c) other times he talks about girls d) bisexuality is also a thing  There's definitely also plenty we don't know about all of the Lambs totally unrelated to them hitting puberty."

It's possible that there are other things than just the Wyvern formula going on with Sy, that he isn't aware of.  But yeah, I'm feeling that it's probably a side effect of the poisons, or some combination of them stopping his growth. The scaling up on Twig looks like its going to be fantastic.  There almost has to be a full scale revolution against the academies at some point.  We know there's some secret group with former (or maybe current) academy people with long term plans to work against them, which may or may not be involved with most of our surviving antagonists.  There still seem to be a few secrets lurking in what exactly was done to each of the lambs and what their full capabilities will be, especially Helen.  There's some sort of giant superweapon buried under Radham.  We still know nothing about the Hangman.  Also there have been very few deaths yet, and I don't think Wildbow is likely to keep characters safe just for sentimental reasons once things really start to hit the fan.  At some point I'm hoping this (already excellent) story is going to go into overdrive with some Leviathan/The Drains style event that really ramps up the action and the seriousness of the stakes.   I'm still wondering if we're going to see a team swap, if the Lambs end up working with Mauer and the other anti-academy groups, if they stick with the morally-grayish-to-black academy or end up somehow on their own side in the upcoming conflict(s).

So she grows up with her power being a constant reminder that she comes from an evil so grand that he was only taken down because he refused to fight half of New Wave and was protecting her.  That alone isn't enough to make her totally reject her power like she did, but add to that the fact that the one thing she really wants to do with her power is make her sister fall in love with her. Which she's sane enough to realize is evil as fuck. Add to that the fact that she's constantly sleep deprived and stressed as fuck, not to mention the fact that she never fights with her powers so her Shard has got to be even more pissed with her than Leet's is with him, and it's not surprising that she never gets creative with her power.  Also she doesn't have control over what her creations do once they leave her Striker range of influence, so if she makes a hyper infectious virus to, say, cure everyone ever of HIV and then that virus reproduces and becomes a plague or whatever then all the deaths that would happen before she could release a virus to cure that one would be on her head etc.  Tl;dr: She doesn't do anything with her powers cause she was brought up to fear her power, and the only thing she actually wants to do with her power (other than healing family and friends) is super evil."

Marquis created a shield of bone to protect himself, expanding its dimensions until it was taller and wider than he was.  He’s going to burrow, Brandish thought.  He’d done it often enough in the past, disappearing underground the second he’d dropped out of sight, then attacking through the ground, floor or rooftop.  “Careful!” she shouted.  Lady Photon spent the rest of the energy she’d gathered in her hands, spraying another spray of lasers at Marquis’ shield.  Then, as they’d practiced, she prepared to use her forcefield to shield Flashbang, Fleur and Lightstar.  Brandish and Manpower could defend themselves.  A barrier of bone plates erupted around one corner of the room, rising just in time to keep some of Lady Photon’s salvo from striking a closet door.

Parahumans,3e3bgd,Archmage9885,11,Wed Jul 22 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"It could be a vicious cycle of sorts.  Panacea is worried about turning evil all of a sudden and kicking puppies. So she sticks to just healing people.  Her shard gets really mad about this and makes her miserable about it, trying to coax her into fighting more. (See; Leet.)  Panacea feels her misery at healing people and concludes she is a bad person, and needs to work off her karma meter by healing more people.  Her shard piles on more misery to try and push her to her breaking point where she'll go out and fight folks, or at least commit suicide or something so it can go and party with some psychopathic host. Rinse repeat.  Because the shard doesn't understand humans properly, it can't see that it's making the problem it hates even worse, and thinks classical conditioning should do the trick, (""When you use me for non-conflict, I will make you miserable."") when really it's a fairly deep rooted psychological problem causing panacea to act this way.  So basically, my headcanon from that would be, she's useless because she's actively trying to work off ""Bad Karma"" (kind of) or force herself to ""Be a good person"" by sticking to healing over and over, and part of the reason she just gets worse and worse is her shard being mad about this. (With leet as a precedent to lead me to this conclusion.) The worse she feels about this, the more desperate she becomes, and so the less likely she'll use her power for other things or even consider it, she's gotta spend all day every day healing, and that's before you get into a possible self-flagellation streak where she's forcing herself to do something she hates because she's a bad person (Because she hates doing that thing.). You could even interperate her little moment with the kid with the heart problem as the shard influencing her, telling her to fuck up the healing process and kill him, whispering sweet nothings about how they'll let her stop healing then. (Man, Worm superpowers are pretty fucking dark.)  Supporting this idea, is that she gets vastly better after he little psychotic episode, though that could also be due to Marquis and time to think/grow up in the Birdcage. But yeh. Headcanons.  This also runs into the usual shenanigans of where does Amy end and Panacea begin?  Panacea and Leets ridiculous OP abilities could, maybe, be a result of their shard giving them an easy mode in order to coax them into actually doing something, and getting really mad when they fuck it up. But that's getting a lot more into unsupported headcanons rather than plausible ones."

Skitter isn't terribly powerful in any immediately apparent way, but she applies enough thought to innovative and unorthodox ways to use insects that she's rather effective despite that. Panacea has every potential to be desperately OP if she munchkined her power even slightly (give Skitter that power and she'd probably solo Scion), but she's a glorified medic because with rare exception it doesn't occur to her to do very much else.  Come to that, most of the innovations I remember from her (disruptor bugs, relay bugs, Atlas) were actually inspired by Skitter. Although I suppose that could be a result of protagonist focus bias."

Parahumans,3e2cbg,pseudonarne,7,Tue Jul 21 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"1) Wilbow once stated that if you are treating a second trigger as a straight power up, you're doing it wrong.  A second trigger for a Tinker would likely do one of two things: 1: Broaden the specialty but decrease impressiveness.  2: Narrow the specialty but increase impressiveness.  Which one happens would depend on the specifics of the trigger.  Let's say Armsmaster second triggered during the Leviathan fight.  He specializes in miniaturization.  The nanothorns were doing damage to Leviathan.  He would likely end up with a focus on nanoweaponry, finding himself far less able to work on other things.  Sphere quite possibly second triggered.  His specialty changed from general ecosystems for all to a very specific application of ecosystems for himself.  Just a personality or application change?  Well that's really all Tinkering is. The shard inspiring you to build something and giving you the capability.  If it changes how and what it supplies you, that pretty much is a change in the power. 2) Tattletale knew Circus's sex, but not their gender."
Parahumans,3e2cbg,SpareLiver,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"'not a straight power up' doesn't mean 'not an upgrade', at least that's how it seems in the context. A second trigger is less about adding more power and more about removing limits, allowing the power to do more things.  Look at Taylor - her second trigger, admittedly not exactly a 'normal case' second trigger, didn't do anything to her bug control power, positively or negatively. It did, however, give her near-infinite multitasking, drastically improving the use of her bugs.  If a Blaster had a second trigger, it wouldn't be so simple as MOAR LAZORS - it all depends on situation but the power may end up with Trump elements, or morphing into a Shaker-esque power.  That said, Tinkers are an interesting case because they operate slightly differently to other shards. I imagine a Tinker would gain access to a wider technology tree, likely related in some way to both their original theme and whatever caused them to second trigger.  In your Armsmaster example, the addition of nanoweapon technology would certainly apply, or the addition of water based tech - improved water craft, etcetera, but I doubt it would damage his ability to access anything else on his tech tree."

But body dysphoria is a medical condition that affects some people where they believe they aren't what they physically are, like trans people believing they are the opposite sex trapped in their body.   I didnt say anything about it not justifying transition, I have trans friends who have undergone transitions, and I support them and love them as my friends, even if I don't agree with their decision.  My disagreement with their decision, for what it's worth, is due to body dysphoria, and studies showing that people who go through with body transitioning often experience regret, or don't achieve satisfaction or happiness after going through with the transition. Something like 80% of children who say (or rather, their parents say) are trans end up changing their mind entirely by the age of 20, and people push for child transitions nowadays too.  Although this whole talk about trans people is off topic, I do believe trans people can do whatever they like when they're of age (18), and support them, however I disagree with their choices due to it being emotional and having severely negative repercussions from them, not from society, but going through with the surgery can lead to severe complications and even depression. This has been readily documented and honestly I don't think it's worth it, I believe they should be offered treatment (not praying the gay away, as in the ability to talk through it with psychiatrists to come to terms with their feelings, without undergoing traumatic experiences).  Again, sorry if I've come across as bigoted or close minded, some of you may continue to say or think I am, I'm not, I just think that in general this new wave of thousands of gender types and saying tumblr SJW stuff is harmful, and undermines the very real problems concerning people actually suffering from body dysphoria, who I sympathise and empathise with, and make up a bunch of my close friend and family group :)"

Furthermore, to say gender is fluid is ridiculous, it's a new notion, and it's not supported by any science. If anything, it hinders the plight of trans people due to the fact it raises the idea they can just change back, because gender isn't set in stone, why should we allow them to change theirs in such an 'aggressive' way?

Parahumans,3e2cbg,FireHawkDelta,3,Tue Jul 21 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"Most second triggers fix a flaw in the power by adding another feature of the shard that was dropped in the trigger event. I would guess a tinker's second trigger would help with their frustration after failing to do something with their power, like a thinker power making the tech easier to use or fixing holes in their design process by adjusting their method. It would take some extreme mental trauma to cause a second trigger in a tinker to give another out of combat ability, more realistically they would get a thinker power that helps them out of danger."
Parahumans,3e2cbg,idannadi,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"1) We really don't know, we haven't seen evidence to anything like that. There are a couple of theories like tinker specialty changing into something more broad like Armsmaster (minimizing all tech) or due to how second triggers work, an additional power similar to one of the capes that were nearby to the tinker while he second triggered (like getting a minor breaker power due to having a breaker next to you when you second trigger). Wildbow has been somewhat vague about second triggers before so we can't really be sure.   2) As for what can cause a second trigger for a tinker, it depends on the first trigger, tinker powers usually come from inability to do an impossible goal. For example, Dragon originally triggered due to not having the ability and the tools to fight Saint so she got the power to make herself more tools and more tinker things (reverse engineering power). By putting her in a similar situation again with  a lot of stress over a long period of time, it is possible that she will second trigger, but we don't really know what her power would become.  3) I'm pretty sure she just doesn't want to stick Circus a sex label, is he a man pretending to be a woman or is she a woman pretending to be a man, Circus also has the even worse thing of having 2 identities with different sexes so I'm pretty sure Tattletale just didn't want to stick Circus a label."

Parahumans,3e2cbg,palparepa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"I have a question about the shards granting extra abilities for their host to survive. For example, pyrokinetics are immune at least to their own fire. Of course, that makes them immune to the heat produced by it. But does it immunize them against oxygen deprivation? After all, their flames would rapidly consume all the nearby oxygen and they'd suffocate.  Or maybe fire doesn't consume all oxygen as fast as I think it does."
Parahumans,3e2cbg,palparepa,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yep they get requisite secondary powers that let them breathe through fire, not just neutralize the heat around them (many don't even have their costumes burn off from my memory) The way I understand it is when the shard brings in the energy/fuel for the flame effect it also brings in some oxygen for them to breathe.  For instance when Sundancer has to fight off the plague Bonesaw made she stands inside her sun for an extended peroid of time, without some Breaker (or maybe it'd be a shaker?) power theres no way she could breathe in there."
Parahumans,3e2cbg,Rein_Aurre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"You are right. I forgot about those.  Although what I had in mind was more complex. It's about an OC of mine, that can absorb blood through his skin, granting extra mass and a plethora of things that are not relevant to the point. The point is that mixing blood types is a bad idea, so of course the shard takes care of it. The thing is: how? My idea is that the shard removes ""everything bad"" from his bloodstream. If he is blood type A, on absorbing blood type B, it becomes type O. It removes the ""B"", but doesn't add the ""A"", so it's compatible.  As a side effect, it makes him immune to anything pernicious that travels through the blood. For example, got hit by a tranquilizer dart in the arm? Only the arm would be affected, he would remain conscious (unless the tranquilizer uses the lymphatic system, I guess)  This would have an interesting effect when it comes to breathing, though: with so much blood inside his body, he can hold his breath for a long time. However, since the shard would remove the carbon dioxide, it would not add oxygen, so he'll need to hyperventilate afterwards to compensate. Also, the way our bodies work, we do not feel suffocated from the lack of oxygen, but from too much carbon dioxide. That means he would lose consciousness without realizing he needs to breathe, until he learns this little fact.  Aaand I guess I'm talking too much."
Parahumans,3e2cbg,Rein_Aurre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"Generally the secondary powers are put in place to protect the user of the shard, that said I think the problem breathing is subtle enough that it could slip though, assuming that the Breaker power cleans out all harmful matter found in his blood, which frankly would be needed if he was ever going to soak up blood that'd been spilled on the ground, if there's one thing you really don't want in your blood stream it's dirt.  Also you could consider giving him an extremely minor Changer power which is that he has a truly universal blood type, once he absorbs blood it plays nice with all other blood regardless of types.

Actually, she asks Taylor if there are any people nearby when they're fighting the Nine/trying to snipe Cherish.

Taylor describes her trigger in 4.3, but we don't learn about second trigger events and how they can follow soon after the initial event until much later in the story.  We don't get confirmation (or even suggestions) that Taylor triggered twice in the locker until (iirc) one of the last few arcs when she asks Bonesaw to try to give her a second trigger."
Parahumans,3e0na0,dougcosine,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:54:01 2015 UTC,"Spoilers:  The fact that second triggers can happen right after the first is a piece of information you can figure out pretty easily as soon as you learn about them. They're just like having a trigger again, and there's not really a reason you couldn't have one, even just after getting powers. In fact, for some people, I would imagine that the act of getting powers would push them close to a mental break.   And it's really not tough to imagine that Taylor could have triggered twice in the hours she was sitting in that locker, even discouting the idea that her power is what made it happen.   Saying who she talked to is a huge spoiler. I didn't say who, and it's only a spoiler worth mentioning if you already know the context. The reasons off the top of my head someone could ""know what they're talking about"": they've studied second triggers, they've had a second trigger and know what it feels like, they understand how powers work, they know how Taylor triggered and figured it out."
Parahumans,3e0na0,tybo555,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:51 2015 UTC,Spoilers  Just because someone could conceivably guess that Taylor had a second trigger in the locker doesn't mean that you aren't spoiling the story by telling them it's canon before they've read enough to know for certain that it is.   That's like saying that after hearing Dinah's prophecy it's ok to reveal that Scion is the big bad since one could surmise that Scion is probably what's going to kill most of humanity because he's the strongest being in the story so far.

If you find a security guard, you can bath him in darkness, take him out (possibly disguising yourself if it is appropriate). If you ever get discovered, you can bath everything with darkness and escape pretty easily.  I mean, it's not Imp. But it is very useful in a passing unnoticed if you actually want to pass unnoticed.

Route can turn a tube of space in front of her intangible, which wears off after a minute or so, though she can sustain the effect by touching it. Phased matter interacts with light normally. If there's a conflict between phased and unphased matter, unphased matter wins. It's limited to non-living matter.  If Route uses this to sneak through walls or set ambushes, she's a Stranger.

Parahumans,3dwphh,ApathyAce,9,Mon Jul 20 05:33:58 2015 UTC,"This sorta thing is one of the reasons I don't like how often PRT classifications are used by fans. What do you classify them based on? Grue's power on paper certainly seems like a shaker power, creating a battlefield which is more advantageous for Grue than others. But two different personalities could use his power completely differently. Grue 1 could immerse an opponent and wail on them while they are defenseless, while Grue 2 could distract opponents while he sneaks in and does whatever he wants to do, then walks away without anyone even knowing what he was there for.  Then there are problems with the PRT not actually knowing what powers are. Genesis spoiler might seem like a changer, but actually she is a master.  And then there are second triggers, or just people figuring out their power more. As Skitter figure her power out more and more, her power became a better thinker power.  Also, some powers are technically one thing, but often need to treated as something else. Uber would probably be a thinker, but in practice you would often treat him like a brute or striker because of his CQC abilities.  They are a quick run down for what to look for when fighting them. They are far from the end-all of power analysis.  /rant  Edit: completed the sentence at the start."
Parahumans,3dwphh,pendia,16,Mon Jul 20 05:16:24 2015 UTC,"You rate them based on the threat they pose. Grue would be a stranger shaker as that is what he uses his power for. If he started using it to, say, get copies of other people's powers, he also gets a trump rating.   People seem to think the prt ratings should tell you about the power, but they're there to help the prt fight parahumans. They tell the prt what to expect, not exactly what the power does. It's why armsmaster would have a brute rating, because his suit lets him tank hits like a minor brute, despite not actually being stronger than a normal person."
Parahumans,3dwphh,Sarks,9,Mon Jul 20 08:17:40 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue with the PRT rating, and then I stumbled across Wildbow's list of how the PRT responds to each type of threat. If you understand how the PRT responds (focused fire to brutes, take cover for blasters, spread out for shakers), suddenly everything makes a lot more sense.  In Grue's case, shaker protocol would tell you to spread out while stranger protocol would tell you to assume that secure areas are compromised and keep eyes on each other at all time. The first makes a lot of sense given his power, the second not so much."

Parahumans,3du6bd,palparepa,8,Sun Jul 19 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they wouldn't focus on one, but would still be more advanced in one. So laser aliens would have also have gravity manipulation, but didn't find constructive uses for it (or didn't have the necessary resources for it) so didn't develop advanced gravity manipulation technology."
Parahumans,3du6bd,pendia,5,Mon Jul 20 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"Well, let's look at human technology. We can do some interesting things with electricity (computers) and magnetic things (like particle accelerators) but in terms of advanced alloies and nano materials? We are kinda shit. We know for example how strong nanotubes can be if made correctly however we can't make long nanotubes and at best we can make a goo of the stuff. Making metal foams which block radiation? Barely scratching the surface. We simply haven't reached the point of actually using nano materials but we know of a lot of really good ones that we can't make (another example would be carbon chips instead of silicon chips) so ""our"" technology would mostly involve electricity and magnets because that's what we do and what we know how to do but entire tech trees that we somewhat started at are simply much behind their true potential that we know about."
Parahumans,3du6bd,idannadi,5,Mon Jul 20 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, but see how many modern technology relies on old technology all over the place. If we focus all our efforts on nanomaterials, sure we will find out lot of nifty new materials, but will hit an unsurmountable wall because even better nanomaterials require superlasers or whatever.  Having said that, there could be completely different civilizations that focus their efforts elsewhere. For example, our technology is primarily ""physical"", while others may focus on ""biological"", having pills that can regrow entire limbs. There is a scifi tale about that: humanity finds and rescues the remnants of a ""chemical/biological"" alien civilization much more advanced than ours, but that couldn't escape their doomed planets because their ""physics"" science couldn't make rockets.  I think that tinker shards aren't based on civilizations, but on a mixture of all civilizations, restricted to a topic. For the same reason all other shards are limited: ""game"" balance.   ""our"" technology would mostly involve electricity and magnets because that's what we do   Or maybe we are better at optics. Who knows the ""state of the art"" on the rest of the universe.  There is another scifi tale about space pirates invading Earth, in the present era. We easily defeat them because their weapons are simple cannons, and their armor simple wood. It turns out interstellar travel is extremely easy, but we somehow missed it."
Parahumans,3du6bd,palparepa,19,Mon Jul 20 07:30:53 2015 UTC,"They're trying to become more and more powerful, and eventually become strong enough to defeat thermodynamics and survive after the universe is nothing but them. For that, they need knowledge.  An unlimited Tinker shard would probably just give you whatever information you needed without hassles. Tinkers are being given small fragments of what their shard has stored, but the entities undoubtedly get the whole package."
Parahumans,3du6bd,sanctaphrax,12,Sun Jul 19 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"Well, we know that Tinker Tech gave them the ability to manipulate space and gravity after meeting their first Civilization, which lead to Vista's powers and maybe some other gravity users.  Which means they incorporate the tech into their advanced biologies. So it can be used to grant them new abilities and most likely boost their other abilities as well.  Like, say... Bakuda. Her power is making super-bombs. By studying the effects of several other powers + basing her bombs effects off of what she considers interesting theories and principles, she now has: Time Stop Grenades, Black Hole Bombs, Spatial Warping Tech, Flash Freezing Mines, Hologram Mines, and a Vibration Grenade (capable of turning a man and his weapon into tang).   Now, theoritically, when an Entity takes this Shard back it'll have information as to how these principles work and use them solitarily or as support for other abilities. Maybe they can vibrate space over a distance to defend themselves from"

Image an entity has one of it's 'knowledge' shards (with plenty of backups for itself and other tinkers), imposes a limit like ""can only work on projectiles"" and casts it off to bond with a host. Now they watch. Maybe the teleportation missile reacts with someone's invulnerability and tears a hole in dimensions. ""Huh"" the Entity thinks when harvesting all the data again, ""That's a neat trick, we could already do that but this is in a novel way. Better encode that in a new shard for the next cycle""."
Parahumans,3du6bd,pseudonarne,3,Sun Jul 19 21:17:11 2015 UTC,one possible use:      iirc they almost got burned by a race of tinkers once(we saw that in an interlude somewhere)...tinker shard info says its not happening again.   they learn how to creatively deal with/counter some of the powers in a way that doesn't require powers.
Parahumans,3du6bd,Hypermeme,3,Mon Jul 20 03:39:33 2015 UTC,"Tinker shards are likely generalized concepts and design styles. Heuristics, models of how the universe works, and so on. That is what technology is after all. Technology isn't the microchip, technology is the understanding of how semi-conductors, logic gates, and circuits work and why. It's straight up knowledge in well defined, applicable to reality forms. For instance Defiant's Tinker Shard seems to specialize in miniaturization and integration which is a general technology concept that can be applied with the help of other, more specific technologies."
Parahumans,3du6bd,pendia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:44 2015 UTC,"Another thing about tinker shards is that its flexible. If a tinker is preparing to fight a new hero, the shards get a lot of information in what sort of thing the tinker tries to make. Do they try to make a new weapon? New armor? A way to move around? Do they make a direct weapon like a laser or an AoE weapon like a flamethrower? etc etc.  This also shows weaknesses in other shards, which forces innovation: If Skitter is facing someone who's fully encased themselves in a full set of tinker armor spoiler, she's going to need to find a new way of fighting spoiler."

In real life, being known as a truthful person is a kind of power, and you can spend that power to tell lies that people are more likely to believe.  Likewise, people do tend to believe a lot of storybook things (like the rule of three, karma, prophecy) that are given a kind of weight by that belief.  It felt like a magical version of ""what if our superstitions were real?"".  Of course, I've been almost exclusively telling the truth for two decades now.

Parahumans,3drr1x,idannadi,23,Sat Jul 18 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"I told part of this story before, but I skirted the details that applies here.  My best friend has mental health issues, and he does better when he can safely get out of his own head for a little bit.  The longer the better.  I'm always looking for things for him to read to help keep him focused on something other than his own private thoughts.  I came across Worm via TV Tropes and thought, ""This is huge, I'll see if it can keep him occupied for more than a day!""  It did, and he started begging me to read it so we could talk about it.  Since he was showing a marked improvement, I saw genuine excitement in his eyes, I humored him.  When I finally got genuinely into it, he improved even more -- when we'd go out to eat, he wouldn't be so obsessively concerned with everyone around him and would be focused more on talking to me about it.  Our regular waitress even started reading just because she so rarely gets to see him so animated.  Since then, she's taken to sitting down with us and discussing it when she has the time.  He's cooled down a bit now, going back into the darker places in his head a bit, but it's still a safe topic to approach to distract him for a little bit.  At least for a couple of months, I was able to let the real him shine through.  That alone means the world to me.    Plus, I'm met some pretty cool people, usernames that I recognize, folks I'd like to meet, and have apparently done something right in interacting with you lot.  I worry about you all for that.  Seriously, one of these days I'm going to get one of you arrested or deported or something on accident, and then I'm going to feel bad and eat a can of frosting.

I can't stop thinking about how characters like Ant-Man or Green Lantern use their powers ineffectively, and planning out how my characters can use theirs to their fullest potential.   My headline character is a telekinetic woman named Kinesis, but Worm has me thinking about how many ways she could handle any conceivable situation. When fighting normal people or EvDevs, she could just make tiny telekinetic barriers in the blood vessels in their brains and knock them out in seconds. When fighting gunmen or robots she can just crush the circuitry or make the mechanical components immobile with her mind. Hell, I can't even think of a convincing restriction or weakness other than ""her powers don't work on human biology""- which would mean I'm just ripping off the Manton Effect.

So if she can actually get her hands on something she can do a lot to them but things farther away are much harder to affect.

Parahumans,3drr1x,darklooshkin,4,Sun Jul 19 07:11:46 2015 UTC,"How about inefficiencies? In short, when you use powers, it negatively affects the environment in some way. Radiation, Gravity fluctuations etcetera render the area untenable after prolonged use of powers. The more of a rookie you are, the more you 'pollute' the environment with adverse side-effects.  There's also the limitation of visualisation-sure you can make telekinetic mini-barriers in a person's vascular system, but the problem is that doing so could easily kill the person if done the wrong way.  So unless there's a Thinker power thrown in to do the work for you, you are stuck trying to figure out how to get your idea working without causing unintended catastrophic damage to your target like, say, trying to stop them by creating a forcefield at waist height only to misjudge the field's position, which ends up kneecapping the perp instead.   Those could be believeable limitations to any power-negative environmental effects and the need to actually know that what you are doing isn't going to backfire and bisect someone (probably even the character) in the process.  And the more creativity the powers involve (including being able to make tools that use said powers as a power supply, augment them or apply them to different problems where the powers in question would normally be a hindrance being a near universal trait rather than a Tinker subclassification, which would definitely add to the fun), the more dangerous they could be in untrained and/or malicious hands. For example, your bad guys could use said adverse environmental effects to help them get the upper hand in a fight while the good guys strive to avoid leaving traces behind."

Combine that with a ""stronger actions persist longer"", and she's pushed to fight with big, flashy effects, while still retaining plenty of creative potential when the answer isn't ""make a huge-ass forcefield""."
Parahumans,3drr1x,yuloforce,11,Sat Jul 18 23:46:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe using her TK lowers her blood sugar, so she needs to constantly refuel herself. Dude, I like this answer. Especially since there aren't any diabetic superhuman do that I know of."
Parahumans,3drr1x,T0X1CFIRE,8,Sun Jul 19 00:05:10 2015 UTC,Have the tk be line of sight? you cannot  make tk barriers in the blood vessels as you cannot see them because they are hidden behind the skin. The circuits would probably be behind armor and be protected as well.
Parahumans,3drr1x,yuloforce,4,Sat Jul 18 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I was thinking that telekinetics would naturally come equipped with some sort of ""all-sense""- They can lift things with their mind, so it sort of made sense to me that they'd be able to feel every texture, object, layer, and crevice surrounding them within a five-foot diameter."
Parahumans,3drr1x,sheikheddy,5,Sun Jul 19 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"She has to touch things first to be able to manipulate them like rune?

If she was morally against killing, that limits a lot of her attack options.  3) Inaccuracy. She can easily stop a big chunk of rock headed her way, but if you tried to do something like pinch off an artery, she might as well be an elephant trying to juggle.  4) Indivisibility. You can pick up a rock, but you can't split a rock in half. If she were to pick up a person, that person would be able to wiggle around all they wanted, but would not be able to change their center of mass.  5) Cost.

There were some pretty dark moments from fall 2013 to winter 2014 and while it got better, it was still a long way away from being good. So in December 2014, I decided to take a break.  While that was going on, I couldn't get Worm out of my head. Instead, a little voice inside my head telling me ""you can do that. Well, probably not as good, but you can do that."" So I did.

There isn't necessarily a linear scale of what trumps what, so if I were you I wouldn't assume Alexandria is vulnerable to clock-blocked objects. My guess is she'd just bounce off them.  Clockblocker makes a grid of levitating wires that cut into Behemoth's body in New Delhi, IIRC. But the damage isn't a game-changer.  Wildbow once said that Flechette's bolts could kill Alexandria. I'm not sure how they'd do against an Endbringer core."
Parahumans,3dniq1,sanctaphrax,31,Fri Jul 17 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think Clockblocker frozen string could hurt Alexandria.  Why?  While I agree its durability would trump Alexandria because of your reasoning, I don't think it would be sharp enough to cut her. It can pop Siberian, but Siberian isn't actually a material-- she's a projection. If we had a scene where a chunk of metal is thrown at a Clockblocker string and it gets cut in half, I'd agree with you. But the things he manages to damage like that are Echidna and Crawler (IIRC), who both cut themselves in half on a Clockblocker string. They're both organic and easier to cut than metal.   When Echidna gets cut in half from his string, she was running full speed into it. She's also much less durable.   I'm inclined to think Alexandria would bounce off of it.   Honestly, I don't think we know enough to say for sure.   Spoilers for Fanfiction AHEAD: There is a scene in notes Cenotaph that involves Alexandria being injured by a Fletchette-charged object-- I think he has the right of it in that fic, though I think the fact that it takes her anytime at all to regain her durability is strange."
Parahumans,3dniq1,gardenofjew,9,Fri Jul 17 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think Alexandria has durability. Isn't she time-locked? What happens when two time-locked objects collide? Clockblocker's are temporary, and Alexandria's not, so she might win that one."
Parahumans,3dniq1,Tanath,16,Fri Jul 17 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"There's no evidence she's timelocked-- to me it, there's more evidence she's not.   She can move Siberian can hurt her, but is affected by time effects-- Grey Boy and Clockblocker. Effects that hurt her don't disrupt all of her invincibility-- Siberian doesn't kill her or disrupt her durability and Scion takes a while to kill her even while doing damage. Scion injuring her results in her body falling apart like pieces of a statue after she's dead-->that implies her durability isn't active, but a passive effect.    Overall, I think she's made of some super strong material, especially given that she has, in-story, physical changes of some kind. Hatchet Face would be an interesting matchup-- my expectation would be that she'd be unaffected by his efforts to damage her, but would lose her super strength, flight, and enhanced thinkinh."

Parahumans,3dniq1,notentirelyrandom,5,Sat Jul 18 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"I think there is evidence that she's timelocked - Pretender specifically says that she doesn't age, injuries don't heal or get worse, and her brain is the only part of her that has any plasticity.  Given this, some form of time locking seems fairly reasonable. If we assume that Scion is using his nullification wave power to remove her invulnerability on a piece by piece basis, then everything seems to fall into place.  That said, it could go the other way also - it's really hard to tell the difference between ridiculously high durability and every part of her being time locked"
Parahumans,3dniq1,HarbringerOfNumbers,9,Sat Jul 18 02:24:07 2015 UTC,"Pretender saying she doesn't age doesn't mean time locked.

Parahumans,3dniq1,Kumquatodor,2,Fri Jul 17 23:40:06 2015 UTC,"There are a load of 'handwaves' and that's fine or otherwise nothing interesting can happen.   It has one huge handwave by saying that powers are essentially limited/formed by human perceptions (because of the nature of the shards/hosts or whatever).  The same reason stuff that Clockblocker freezes in time don't immediately zoom off in a direction at almost the speed of light even though if they were truly frozen in absolute space then the movement of the earth, orbit, galaxy rotating, that galaxy expanding through space, etc would all make it appear to do so.   They hand wave the infinite energy needed to use most of the powers (or delete/create mass/energy out of nothing) as just pulling it from another dimension/universe.   Even the Manton effect is form of the same handwave so that conflicts aren't immediately dealt with in 3 seconds with everyone dying.   Being well thought out doesn't mean it's 100% scrutiny-proof. But if you keep looking for explanations for everything you're going to bump into a few details being glossed over because the stuff isn't actually possible.   Honestly this is mostly why I never last long in 'fandoms' haha. I'll show myself out XD"
Parahumans,3dniq1,monkeyjay,2,Mon Jul 20 04:18:50 2015 UTC,"That's not a handwave. The entities are explicitly testing the shards, so it makes sense that they would make them usable in those tests. That's the entire point of the entities' cycle. Why wouldn't they make them usable."
Parahumans,3dniq1,Kumquatodor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:41:14 2015 UTC,"Well yeah.. That's what the writer wrote to explain away things. That's what I consider a handwave.

Again, I really shouldn't get involved with these conversations and I don't know why I did. I'm too old for this."

The name comes from academia and techy-land, where a person explaining a process on a whiteboard gets to a part that is not well defined or important so just waves their hand around to indicate that Stuff Happens, then moves on to the important goodies.  Typically, the use of this trope is an indicator of bad writing; a good author is able to explain plot points with the utmost detail without interrupting the story's momentum.    That's the usual definition which doesn't fit this scenario."

Parahumans,3dniq1,Tombot3000,2,Sat Jul 18 03:11:39 2015 UTC,"So because I don't find your argument persuasive I'm discouraging others and killing the fun?  I handwaved because it seemed plausible for a fictional story, especially like this one, even if I don't know how to explain it well off the top of my head. You didn't really give a reason why it's not plausible and I simply pointed that out. You want more detail? Fine. Maybe she's composed of interlocked time-locked bits and that's why she can move. We're already talking about physics-breaking stuff, so yeah: handwave. Even without pointing out a possible means I was still contributing. Seems I was misunderstood though."
Parahumans,3dniq1,Tanath,3,Sat Jul 18 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"It's not implausible for her to be timelocked and mobile, IMO. Siberian is a mobile hole in the universe with a zebra-stripe paint job.

Parahumans,3dniq1,archDeaconstructor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"I thought you were talking about Siberian vs Alexandria.  The downvote was because you didn't seem to be contributing, and is easily reversible now that you've justified the comment, which was the plan.  The difference between Siberian vs Clockblocker and Siberian vs Alexandria is that Clock's power applies to others, and Alexandria's wouldn't. Clock's power thus makes her pop where Alexandria's gets violated. Siberian also ""popped"" Clock's effect too.  Also, it would have been easier to search for something uncommon nearby, like ""unstoppable""."
Parahumans,3dniq1,Tanath,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"Clockblocker is a reality warper, so he one-ups basically everyone... in terms of creating an immovable object.  However, the force would have to come from Unbreakable Becca, so the question is: can Lady Library cut herself with string.  Assuming she doesn't have disproportionate strength and durability, the answer is no.  In the case of the Sting, I think it's important to acknowledge that Siberian stops when her reality-warping comes into contact with other reality-warping powers.  She automatically loses in such situations.  This is, I think, why Sting works on her.  Otherwise the Stinger in question would just phase through her and out the other side.  In the case of the Adamantine Machine, however, I think the Stinger would be able to land insider her, and, yeah, pretty much ruin her day."

Look at Scion's interlude.  I'd find it very strange if Scion's blasts could destroy Endbringers but Foil coldn't, because we also have WoG that Sting is basically as good as it gets offensively-- WB describes it, IIRC, as the 'shark' of shards. Its been the best at what it does (ignoring defense) for tons of cycles; its not really getting any better."
Parahumans,3dniq1,gardenofjew,6,Fri Jul 17 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"I think the only reason Foil couldn't is because of the area of affect of her projectiles--she used crossbow bolts, chains, etc. Scion used massive, sustained beams of changeable size, so he could damage a massive area while Foil was limited to a smaller one."
Parahumans,3dniq1,VersaceArmchairs,2,Fri Jul 17 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it's a Scion shard. It'll be nerfed in some way before she gets it; I'm more surprised that it stayed powerful enough to make Scion dodge."
Parahumans,3dniq1,notentirelyrandom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:37 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't pure offensive power, it's the fact that the cores disable powers. Scion being a step higher on the food chain likely has ways to nosell the power nullification effect, but Flechette can't, so it doesn't matter how good her offensive power is, the moment it hits the core, it's just a regular crossbow bolt."

Parahumans,3dniq1,gardenofjew,5,Mon Jul 20 01:21:16 2015 UTC,"IIRC endbringer cores bend the rules of physics and negate powers, including Fletchette's.     I don't think so.  Fletchette does manage to plant arbalist bolts in Leviathan.  I think its in Fletchette's Interlude, talking to Parian, that she mentions she had a bright future as a cape, partially because her power seemed to have an effect on Endbringers. She did ultimately cut off Behemoth's leg, although I'm a bit hazy on how. It seemed like a rather simple idea to think of so I'm not sure if there was a reason why it wasn't tried before. In direct response to the warping physics point, I think Fletchette's power is explained as her targeted items phase in and out of the universe, so that might explain how they can circumvent and Endbringer's physics breaking properties."
Parahumans,3dniq1,Imosa1,7,Fri Jul 17 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"Fletchette does manage to plant arbalist bolts in Leviathan   Did she put them all the way into the core, or just the superficial exterior 'flesh'?"

I dunno."

The exterior bodies of Endbringers are crazy tough but they obey physical laws. The cores warp space in ways which are literally impossibly dense. Not sure how that interacts with Sting."

Chief Director, maybe? Some of those villains probably can't be killed by normal means, and lots of places aren't ok with the death sentence. Most of the U.S. IIRC, which means that this would be considered the 'humane' solution. I would assume mandatory birth control, or some way to terminate the pregnancy. No way are they letting some of those villains have kids in the Cage. Also, can't take the kids out of the Cage, because by design there is no exit. Probably some protests, but not enough to make a difference when the other option is having people like Teacher running around committing terrorism/treason/whatever you would call what he does. Pretty sure Bakuda was referring to holes to the outside, not holes within the Cage itself.  I would assume there was a period of time where Dragon considered closing the Hole in some way, but saw that it helped in the long run (or at least didn;t make shit worse) and decided to leave it.  Pretty sure it's not mentioned if they did or not. Unless Taylor had some condoms laying around her lair (improbable) or Brian had some in his wallet (the responsible thing to do, so probably; assuming he even had his wallet on him), then no. But they both seem kind of like the type who would, just to be safe. I couldn't really see either of them being so short-sighted as to not even think of it. Probably just up to whether you think they're the type to have some laying around/with them just in case or not."

You could compare it to a house. Knock a hole in a wall between two rooms(the Hole), the temperature would stay roughly the same. However if you knock a hole in one of your outer walls, you're suddenly exposed to outside weather(what Bakuda is talking about).  The drop in air pressure is not an activated security measure, it's simply because the outer walls are surrounded by the void. Knocking a hole in the inner walls won't change the pressure."

If a room is in the center of the Cage, Dragon wouldn't rotate the entire structure inside out just to flush it, assuming she even could. I'm pretty sure the divider between sides is less like ""open vacuum"" and more like ""big-ass wall"".   It seems fair to say that Dragon would have thought it over, maybe consulted with the people above her, and then decided that it wasn't enough of a threat to be worth tossing everyone in the Cage into a vacuum and killing them via drone."

That she would rather be unhappy and save the world than live in luxury and do nothing.  Also, maybe something to do with ""shards like conflict"" got in the way of something like that.

Eidolon's mind working so closely with a shard so close to the core of an Entity—it seems something like part of Eden's brain—makes him unpredictable in the details, though predictable enough for Contessa to partly work around it. Most powers are divorced enough from the Entities and closely enough tied to the humans that they can be worked around, but trigger events are not. The Endbringers are (by my headcanon) specially-treated shards, and hence immune. And Scion is, of course, an Entity. Contessa's PtV essentially gives the best path available without accounting for blind spots. Actions done by blind spots, and effects thereof, are not accounted for; hence, Contessa needs to keep updating her plans, and any goals too close to the Entities are impossible to achieve. Contessa is less affected by other precogs, but not completely immune to them...in particular, the Simurgh.

Parahumans,3dil7d,explosivecrate,11,Fri Jul 17 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming there are still Endbringers, and the capes are the same, how would additional funding and less non-parahuman oversight help?  You mentioned luck - having precogs on staff, lots of them, would help considerably. Predict triggers, or at least trigger disasters, and swoop in with not just a strong-arm invitation to the Wards/Protectorate, but actual help; money for the family, not just a college trust fund; less bureaucracy and more support for Tinkers; more flexibility for third-party or independent relationships instead of ""with us or against us"" attitude the Protectorate seems to have.   So your choices wouldn't be ""join the Protectorate, have paperwork shoved down your throat and everything you do heavily monitored and censored and limited by rules - or join villains, who have freedom and make tons more money"", it would also include ""be a Protectorate-sponsored independent; they give you money and resources and support, back you up if gangs try to strong-arm you, but only step in if you look like you start becoming a threat to yourself or others"".   Pushing non-combat applications of powers as an income stream would help a lot on the money front. Imagine if instead of a heavy-handed invitation pitch for the Wards, Armsmaster told Skitter ""you'd make a fortune making uniforms, and turn that profit into helping Brockton Bay"".  Precogs would also help crack down on corruption, as would resources - hard to bribe someone who doesn't need for money."
Parahumans,3dil7d,sanctaphrax,8,Thu Jul 16 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"Additional funding makes it possible for them to provide better support to their parahumans. Higher salaries, better equipment, more attractive offers to new recruits, and better scientific investigation. If you read Wildbow's PRT Quest, you'll see that money is a big big deal to them.  Good point about encouraging rogues. The hero/villain dichotomy leads to a lot of horrible stuff in Worm."
Parahumans,3dil7d,bliow,6,Thu Jul 16 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"With parahumans in charge (either of themselves, or of the Protectorate), the shards have more influence.  Remember how the shards' goal is to push their humans towards conflict?"
Parahumans,3dil7d,AWorldW-OShrimp,5,Thu Jul 16 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"There are always more gangs to fight. Especially if they are terrifyingly competent at shutting down the cartels, who likely have their own capes, any violence-inclined capes would have ample opportunity to join strike teams and fight."
Parahumans,3dil7d,alexanderwales,7,Thu Jul 16 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"The Endbringers make for the biggest part of the problem, in my eyes. You lose more heroes then villains every fight due to attendance, and the best and most selfless heroes are the most likely to die in these fights. The organization thus constantly bleeds off its best people.   It's a miracle that they held together as long as they did when they regularly lose 50% of the response team every Endbringer fight."
Parahumans,3dil7d,Wildbow,18,Thu Jul 16 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Get more money. There should be a ton of ways to do this, given the powers available. It doesn't have to be market manipulation through Thinker powers or precogs (though that's what I'd try first). Make heroism pay better than villainy. Or rather, make allying with the Protectorate better than villainy or independence. There should never be an incentive for a parahuman to rob a bank. Put organizational funds towards solving cape problems. No cape should ever be worried about caring for their loved ones. Custody disputes, legal problems ... anything that can't be solved directly (by throwing money at it) should be solved in some other way. Increase mundane utility. This doesn't come naturally to parahumans, and the Protectorate knows this, but there's shockingly little utility involved in what the parahumans do. Broken windows aren't good for the economy; the parahumans should be involved in production far more than they're shown to be. This ties into goal number 1, which is making money. This also ties into having good PR. Engage in extensive testing of capes. Train them and work to expand their abilities. Get various capes together to see how their powers interact with each other. There are a number of cases in Worm where parahumans combine powers in the field and on the fly; this is a basic failure of preparation and a symptom of what's wrong with the institution. Don't put rookie, untested capes into Endbringer fights. A number of capes are cut down before they've had a chance to test and train their powers (see 5), which is an unacceptable loss of resources. Give outlets for combat. If you know that the shards drive people to fight each other, give a structure to the fighting. Having this done in the middle of cities as a game of cops and robbers is ... ill advised. If possible, give the capes non-human threats to fight (Man vs Nature conflicts would be ideal). Don't have important capes at the top of your org chart. This is just basic org structure; the people at the frontlines shouldn't also be the ones in a management position. There's a reason that generals don't go into war with an AK47, and it's not because they're cowards. On top of that, having a powerful cape as a manger means that they're doubly irreplaceable. If your organization has members that it simply cannot lose, you don't have an organization; you have a group of people temporarily working together. A properly built organization can't be crippled by the loss of a single member (and they certainly don't put that member in harm's way). This is all before considering the influence that the shards have on people."
Parahumans,3dil7d,alexanderwales,28,Thu Jul 16 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"Re: 4) Focusing capes on mundane utility is just going to see the shards rebelling.  If you try to create rogues, then situations like Canary's crop up.  Powers finding a way to make life harder.  Re: 6) It's less that people are sending the rookies in, and more that rookies are going in of their own volition.  To enforce this, you'd really have to send people in to stand between the cape and the battlefield and tell them no, they aren't good enough, no, it doesn't matter how passionate you are.  A hard thing to do when any given cape might end up making the difference.  Re: 7) Shards might not be imaginative, but they aren't stupid, and they know a charade when they see one.  The fighting rings or arenas or whatever else end up becoming powder kegs that lead to disaster (either in the small scale, like we saw with Hookwolf, or something far greater).  8) Most of the people at the top of the org chart are those who've proven their ability to weather the battlefield.  It's stated in story that there's a general preference for tanky, tough types at the frontline (see Tecton, Weld, Aegis, etc).  These figures serve as figureheads and an example that suggests 'we can fight them and we can win, we can be great!' - so more people see the likes of Alexandria and Legend in leadership positions and join.  Keep in mind that we see Worm just as things are really breaking down.  A year or five earlier, and the turnover is much lower."
Parahumans,3dil7d,oliwhail,9,Thu Jul 16 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I guess when I think of ""directed conflict"" I think of things like the X-Prize, or the DARPA challenge, or the conflicts inherent in capitalism. These aren't direct fist-on-face conflicts, but the shards aren't always about fist-on-face conflicts, as seen by Tattletale's tendency towards stirring up shit and only rarely throwing punches. Two tinkers trying to out-do each other are still in a legitimate conflict with one another, even if what they're doing results in a better world. If you have Mayweather and Pacquiao fighting each other to gain a title and millions of dollars, that conflict doesn't seem like a charade to me. (I think I possibly just disagree with how often conflict is shown to be a bad thing in Worm; you don't really see the good side of it, at least that I can recall, which is especially odd because conflict is seen by the entities as a useful tool for the advancement of science/engineering.)"
Parahumans,3dil7d,pendia,4,Thu Jul 16 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"I expect that the Entities, when programming the shards, would just straight-up not have been imaginative enough to allow productive conflict (e.g. DARPA challenge) to count as acceptable; maybe war is all they really know or can conceptualize."
Parahumans,3dil7d,cephalord,4,Fri Jul 17 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, it's Wildbow!  Got to say, huge fan.  Regarding your counterpoints:   Sole focus, sure. But surely there is a middle ground? Parian does puppet shows and fights Endbringers. Skitter weaves costumes between missions. As long as they still have some conflict, there could be a lot of money made from mundane utility. If you can't stop all capes, you can at least stop the ones under your control. There is no reason to send Gallant into battle, or Browbeat.  In this particular prompt, I was thinking about Mexico putting down their cartels. There will always be resistance to shut down, gangs to fight. Not everyone has to be a frontline combatant, but there will be opportunities for justified violence, even if more capes are heroes than villains. Especially if they're not pushed into villainy. Figureheads don't have to be organizers, though. You can celebrate excellent soldiers without making them generals, celebrate football players without making them coaches. Then again, I think capes should be in charge - just that the Thinkers, not the Brutes, should be the ones doing it."
Parahumans,3dil7d,gardenofjew,5,Thu Jul 16 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"As far as 4) goes, that would be one nuts place to work. Accord probably seemed pretty normal (perhaps a bit of problem with OCD or w/e, but that's minor as far as capes go...), but then suddenly someone tells him he can't do something and he flips his lid and goes supervillan. That's bad enough as an employee, but now imagine that as your boss. And your bosses' boss.  Thinker powers make you smart. Leaders need to be wise."
Parahumans,3dil7d,Ridtom,4,Fri Jul 17 02:48:41 2015 UTC,...that's a very good point.
Parahumans,3dil7d,alexanderwales,2,Fri Jul 17 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"re; 2. I think the point was you really can't. You just heard the Endbringer alarm, you have maybe 30 minutes to 'plan' a defense. Between using every possible resource you have to teleport as many people in right now, evacuating civilians etc etc. are  you really going to dedicate resources to stop Gallant from going into battle? Who are you going to send? Do you think Armsmaster will talk him out of it? Are you going to foam Gallant if he refuses to stand down (not unlikely)?"
Parahumans,3dil7d,palparepa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:17:39 2015 UTC,You have that much time for defense in best-case scenarios-- Leviathan in Brokton Bay with the Endbringer prediction system that's been recently invented. Before that..not so much.
Parahumans,3dil7d,medved847,9,Fri Jul 17 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"The Protectorate is doing the best they can to keep the peace and save as many lives as possible.  They run into problems when the majority of triggers turn to villainy, have to fight Endbringers every 3 months, and are full of people who have conflict-enducing parasytes in their brains.  Re-read Chevaliers interlude. He himself thought the Protectorate andPRT weren't doing enough... up until he experienced all the problems they faced himself.  Ditto for the PHO Interlude and Alexandria's speech at the end of Echidna.   They are simply outmanned and outgunned on all fronts."
Parahumans,3dil7d,Mangetoutrodney,7,Thu Jul 16 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"They might be doing the best they can, but that doesn't mean that they're doing the best possible given their goals. There might be things that they're missing given the shards in their heads, their individual personalities, or their personal philosophies. Just because someone is doing the best they can doesn't mean that they're doing the optimal thing. (A common criticism/interpretation of Contessa is that she's asking the wrong questions, for example.)"

Parahumans,3dil7d,Nepene,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"Knowing what we now know, i'd have parahumans engage in economic conflict cold war style. It's new conflict data and provided you keep some kind of track on the amount of resources and wealth produced and accrued by each parahuman (And consequently, the amount of land, resources, and energy purchased and horded), the shards might just be baffled into submission by a new style of ""Conflict."" that also happens to be pretty good for the species as a whole. (Kind of.) Have scoring boards, or stock exchanges for parahuman cabals. The stock exchange provides a method of measuring prowess and tracking ""Conflict."" We see from Number Mans interlude that the shards might be ok with conflict akin to this, what with his long-range fuckery of supervillain bank accounts and economic manipulation.  Run state-level syndicates and engage in cold-war economies with other states. Keep the borders shifting and writhing in order to simulate losses and gains based on states splitting into smaller groups or whatever, based on a states economic power and such.  Basically make everyone rogues, and make rogueing a very laissez fairez cuthroat capitalist style.  The self-regulation on this system will be that if you accrue far too much money and power, someone with a for realz fightin' power is just gonna kill you. However, it's also in everyones interests to keep the game afloat in order to prevent bigger fish problems, so this would really only kick in when someone accrues massive amounts of money/power. You could maybe get the normies to go along with it by introducing a parahuman tax that applies to them and their works specifically, ultra-welfare state ho!"
Parahumans,3dil7d,sanctaphrax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"I can't remember when, but early in the story they noted that when leviathan or behemoth or such first destroyed a city they rebuilt it, flush with cash.   They've had that going on for years on end. Cities destroyed one after the other, endless expenses which have bled their finances.  Yes, early on, great, they can fund as many psychologists as they need, they can fund all the help the protectorate needs. But heroes die, people die, cities are destroyed. They are running out of funds.  And the shards value conflict. There's no way around it. The shards are there to gather data on shard to shard conflict and are going to fuck with any plans you make.  Almost every plan I've seen has gone along the way of opposing the natural way of things. Psychologists to deal with every itty bitty issue people have. Unlimited money for parahumans. Making parahumans responsible members of society. This isn't going to work.  Instead you need controlled chaos. With the entities at the helm this is going to go to shit, but without them you can do it.  http://bindingofisaac.com/  Let this be your guide about how to build a powerful productive society, not 'ethics'. More tears means more power.  You need several things. You need biomancers to heal people. You need teleporters to shuttle people around. You need matter generators to fix up cities. You need a lot of them because the endbringers are going to kill them. You need to protect them because some of them are going to be more valuable than others so you need tinkers.  How do you mass produce parahumans? You have fucked up families. That's the only reliable method we know of, short of cloning.  So since we're in America you encourage Christians to have lots of babies, to abduct villains and rape them into submission, and you find villains and families with useful parahumans and add them into the mix. Then every town can have biomancers and teleporters and tinkers and mass producers ready to help. You encourage every possible sort of parahuman family to breed more powerful people, pay them for each baby, do everything you can to boost your power while encouraging the leaders to spread supportive propaganda so your cannons fire the right way.  You ban contraceptives and ban abortion. You increase the population growth as much as possible, strength the nation against population reduction from endbringers.  With people like Max Anders on your side you can rebuild cities, get people breeding, keep your cash reserves up. With people like Amy on your side you can keep your numbers up and heal key parahumans. With people like Strider on your side you can get your people around. With tinkers around you can protect them against harm while they go around.  Then, with ample cash and people, then you can have the numbers and resources to fix things."

It would, but I imagine Scion might step in if you started mass cloning useful parahumans as it'd disrupt the cycle. We haven't seen cloning reliably work, at least. We have seen abusive families work repeatedly. More bullying means a safer society.   Although what would really help too would be some of Eden's tinkers. They were supposed to be mass production ones I think. A couple dozen of those would have really strengthened society, helping every city recover after an endbringer attack."

Parahumans,3dil7d,Nepene,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. Which is part of why something like cloning is not the best solution. It's a short term solution based off a likely rare combination of parahumans who don't have the right restrictions. Ziv just has to push a few dominos and that whole house of cards is gonna fall down.  Abusive families though? That's a long term solution that can mass produce all sorts of different parahumans en masse, and to counter that Ziv needs to predict dozens of different threads in different places in different times. It's far harder to stop. She fucks over one family, another three branches pop up from missionaries.   They need to overwhelm the endbringers with so many different parahumans repairing things and handling problems that they can improve society faster than they can tear it down."
Parahumans,3dhy9m,natsugo,24,Thu Jul 16 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"Cawthorne was described as similar to the suit used in the leviathan fight, considering it from the same series. The suit used as rapid-response when the Undersiders invaded Wards HQ may have also been a Cawthorne, based on the weapons displayed. Glaurung was the drone suit. Astaroth-Nidhug was the heavy air artillery. Azazel had the nanothorn rails. Pythios was the elctromagnetic wheel. Melusine was the one that repaired itself and shifted forms. Ladon generated forcefields, went after Sundancer. I don't think we ever saw it on screen. Pendragon and Dragonfly were Dragon's ships, not really suits, but may count."

It's said to be designed to help him out in combat situations.  The Azazel looks the most like a dragon and less like a mechanical robot and is a collaboration between Defiant and Dragon  The Astaroth-Nidhug was a combination of two salvaged craft.  The Tiamat is also mentioned around the time of the Behemoth fight in New Delhi, if I remember correctly.  All dragoncraft appear to be numbered for, like, refit designations. eg: I'd imagine that the Cawthorne IV is the fourth iteration of the basic Cawthorne design."

Parahumans,3dfw79,Kumquatodor,14,Thu Jul 16 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"Mostly just background stuff, like the existence of Scion and the nature of superheros in the Wormiverse. The biggest spoiler I had to reveal was Parian and Foil's relationship, since my sister is part of the LGBT community and any mention of gay characters makes a story more interesting and relatable to her."
Parahumans,3dfw79,tybo555,20,Thu Jul 16 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"You could also mention that one of the strongest capes, and arguably one of the most recognizable ones (Legend, but you don't have to say his name) is in an openly homosexual relationship with a son, as long as you're giving her LGBTQ hooks.

If he approves of it, though, then I suppose I could, assuming there's general interest. Once she's finished the first arch or two, I'll ask her some questions, make a post and see if people could tolerate a third set of 'read-a-longs' on the subreddit.  (edit: Unless of course you meant tell about her reactions in a single comment on this thread instead of multiple updates like ErrantVagrant, and I got over-enthusiastic. If so, I'll do that instead.)"
Parahumans,3dfw79,Subrosian_Smithy,3,Fri Jul 17 11:32:23 2015 UTC,"Mine are well-written?  Huh, learn something new every day.  I'm just repeating what we talk about.  I think testing the waters is a good idea.  I didn't know that my own threads would be so well-received when I wrote my first one.  I threw it out there because A) I was excited over it, and B) the subreddit was slow that day and I figured I'd chuck something out there for people to read.  Folks seemed to like it, so I kept it up.  But in the end, it isn't my thing, so there's no worries about stealing it.  I say, let her read an arc or two, talk to her about it, and then report back to us.  If it works well, then awesome!  I know I love reading other people's first impressions!  If it doesn't, then okay, no worries.  You've only lost maybe a few hours of your time.  You gave it a shot, and it either did or didn't work.  The fact that you tried is still respect-worthy, and you might turn out to be way more entertaining than my derpy self.    Hell, to help encourage you to do so, let me give you some tips I've learned.   At least skim each chapter that she's read before talking with her about it.  Worm is a huge story with a lot of pop moments.  Some of them are only pop moments when you're reading that section, because they get overshadowed by others.  By reading or skimming, you not only can identify moments that the reader will want to talk about, but you'll remind yourself about things that happened.  That way, she isn't explaining to you what happened in that arc. Ask neutral questions.  A good lead in is ""So, you met Armsmaster, what did you think of him?""  This lets her set the tone and doesn't have you influencing her opinion.  This can lead to wonderful moments that are entertainingly wrong or entertainingly right. Try and lead her chapter by chapter once things pick up, but let tangents happen.  This gives you a framework to build off of, but also allows for free talk and observations.  When the conversation goes all over the place, it's harder to remember the interesting bits.  At the same time, though, those random conversations tend to have the most interesting observations and comments. Practice your poker face.  She'll say things that you'll want to cheer or laugh over, but try and hide it.  Encourage those moments, let her develop her own pet theories (ala Endbringers are the source of powers) and even when she's spot on the money, don't let her know.  ""That's a good theory, I can't wait for you to find out if you're right or not"" is a wonderful response to either correct or plain wrong thoughts along this nature. If she encounters something she's having trouble working through, it's okay to let her know if it'll pass or if she's going to have to work through it.  You don't have to say how long or anything, but give her an idea.  Don't get upset if she doesn't like something that you love.  Aleph didn't much care for Miss Militia at first, even though I'm a raving fanboy.  I had to remind myself that some of the moments that made me love the character happened arcs after her interlude.  Now her opinion is improving rapidly and we can discuss her more. When you're writing it, skim the chapters again.  This gives you a framework when you're writing, and will spark memories that you might have otherwise forgotten. Do not let her read the cast page.  Tell her that there are unmarked spoilers there, and that she'll seriously disappoint herself if she reads it. I was gonna make an awesome Grey Boy joke here, alternating between 3 and 4 on the numbers and then bemoaning my stuck in a loop, but Reddit ruined that for me by automatically fixing the list.  Stupid Reddit."
Parahumans,3dfw79,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"Totally a tangent off your #9, but -- I honestly don't understand what good it does that Reddit fixes list numbering for you. The amount of times this has been helpful to me (that I'm aware of) is zero, whereas the amount of times it's interfered is probably around a dozen or so. (E.g. if I'm responding to part of a list but not from 1, it renumbers to start from 1... or if I make multi-paragraph sections within each number it tends to start over from 1 every time)  You can do this though:  1- 2- 3- 2- 3-  if you want to bypass it."

Parahumans,3dewc1,Husr,21,Wed Jul 15 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"My inclination is that he is literally asleep, he dreams. His environment in the physical world is replicated in his dream world (moderate thinker), and effects in his dream world also happen to the real world (high shaker/breaker, possibly master). Furthermore, he has grown capable of some level of lucid dreaming.  ""Subsumed"" would then mean his subconscious reality, which previously had significant physical boundaries, has now enveloped that entire Earth.  Could be wrong, of course; but I feel this is the most plausible thing (except perhaps the anticlimactic stranger power ArchmageLudicrous mentioned) given what we know about him."

Parahumans,3dewc1,sieben-acht,9,Thu Jul 16 11:30:47 2015 UTC,"Didn't we see him reading a book on a normal lawn chair, though? Seems pretty tame for a dream, even for lucid dreaming. Also veers a bit too close to Labyrinth's powerset, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but I suspect Wildbow wants the various S-classes to be wholly new in order to make them that much more terrifying.  Plus, you have to wonder why he wouldn't be worthwhile for Khepri to grab if he could exert that degree of fine control over his power, a power which would excel against Scion. She even brought Ash Beast on board, so this guy must be one hell of a loose cannon to not be worth touching."
Parahumans,3dewc1,AWorldW-OShrimp,11,Wed Jul 15 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered what ""worthwhile"" meant to Khepri. Was that the word she used, or ""worth the trouble"", or something like that?  Here's Khepri, sacrificing anything and everything necessary to sacrifice -- for example, taking away even Dinah Alcott's agency to help her achieve her goals (something Skitter had worked for several arcs against, before!), and Sleeper is... not worth the trouble. What does that mean?  Surely, surely, it's not simply that Khepri is avoiding Sleeper because it would just be kind of a hassle. I don't think that's even remotely imaginable.  I think it must mean that Khepri's voicing to us the audience, the phrase ""worth the trouble"" (or whatever it was she said), was just a factor of sorta... Khepri being Khepri regarding communication in English, and what in fact it means is that Sleeper is not worth the risk. In other words, maybe Khepri could've gotten Sleeper on board, but then again, maybe Sleeper would have thrown a wrench into the plans and made everything come out sideways.   Or maybe it wasn't a question of 'risk' inasmuch as probability... maybe Khepri knew she could get Sleeper but she'd have to sacrifice a significant amount of other capes or something. In which case ""worth the trouble"" means something more like ""worth the cost"".  Either way, ""worthwhile"" is kind of a misleading word, it's a matter of risk or cost, rather than the connotation that it's just... hassle/effort."
Parahumans,3dewc1,wnp,10,Wed Jul 15 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"This has always puzzled me, and is why I give a lot of weight to the fake S-class Stranger theory. Due to her cold ruthlessness, the only reason for Khepri not to grab Sleeper is that his power would be actively harmful more than it helped, but how can this guy be an S-class and not have a power worth using against Scion? Direct attacks, environment manipulation, they all get ruled out.  It's clear that no matter the true nature, his power will certainly be fascinating."
Parahumans,3dewc1,AWorldW-OShrimp,4,Thu Jul 16 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. I suppose the main thing in my mind against the fake S-class Stranger theory is the comment Wildbow made once regarding Sleeper being able to curbstomp four random OCs someone made up.  Edit: Adding link for any passers-by in this conversation"
Parahumans,3dewc1,wnp,2,Thu Jul 16 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I haven't seen that. Very interesting. Do you have a link?  I suppose it depends on whether the opposition running shrieking in fear counts as a curbstomp.  Edit: Found the post. Definitely suggests that Sleeper has a real power (unless the quarantine is just that effective :P )  I do have a hard time crediting the ""subsuming"" of Earth Zayin as a real indicator of Sleeper's power, though, since he very clearly never ""subsumed"" Earth-Bet. The guy just has a lot of weird inconsistencies. I'm fascinated by the idea of what his power really is - must be something incredibly off the wall."
Parahumans,3dewc1,AWorldW-OShrimp,2,Thu Jul 16 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like if the stranger power was what it was, and it 100% affected three out of the four people, I'm not sure how the one person would end up with a 1/36 chance instead of 0 like the others. But, who knows. :) I imagine we'll find out more detail eventually."
Parahumans,3dewc1,wnp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, most certainly. I was just joking that you could use an effective PRT response as a cop-out if Sleeper didn't actually have any power."

Parahumans,3dewc1,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:37 2015 UTC,Could also be something very difficult to control or with a chance of backfire that would likely harm her side more than Scion.
Parahumans,3dewc1,Jzadek,7,Sun Jul 19 00:22:01 2015 UTC,This sounds like what would happen if Weaver Nine Dreamer got the Panacea second trigger mindbreak deluxe treatment.
Parahumans,3dewc1,ArchmageLudicrous,21,Wed Jul 15 22:28:08 2015 UTC,One of the most interesting theories I'd seen on Sleeper was that he had a Stranger power designed to make people think that he was of world-threatening power.
Parahumans,3dewc1,DistaNVDT,17,Wed Jul 15 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Then again, there is the WoG about the survival chances of a bunch of made-up capes, and wildbow gave them all 0% of surviving an encounter with sleeper, and the Shaker got like 1/36th chance of getting away or smth ludacris like that.  I doubt he would have had the same numbers if he was effectively powerless and just inspired fear like that. Even stretching it with ""They're so terrified that they can't do anything and he wins by just walking up to them"" doesn't work since he seems to be cohabiting with the others on Earth Bet and they haven't all panicked yet.  To have subsumed an entire dimension when the portals opened, and for the protectorate to consider an area he goes to as lost, I find it more believable he has an actual power."

Parahumans,3dewc1,HarbringerOfNumbers,7,Thu Jul 16 06:10:06 2015 UTC,"I'd assumed that for a while too, but even if he can fool Khepri it seems unlikely that no one would have a power nullifyer around to reveal him.

Parahumans,3dewc1,BBBence1111,5,Wed Jul 15 23:51:37 2015 UTC,"I do seem to remember he basically chilled in Siberia for most of the story, so possibly it was a self-imposed exile to ensure that he never hurt others.

Parahumans,3ddrun,Squee-,54,Wed Jul 15 14:05:07 2015 UTC,The timeskip arc... but Wildbow knows this already.
Parahumans,3ddrun,xDasNiveaux,13,Wed Jul 15 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"One thing that particularly bugged me about it is that given how far Taylor came in, what, the two months leading up to the timeskip, some thinkers and tinkers should have been gods by the end of it.  Tattletale and Dinah come to mind: given how their powers work, they should have, during the timeskip, found answers to essentially all answerable questions. We do discover that Scion's secret is essentially protected from these powers, but few things have similar protection - not the Nine, nor the Endbringers. There's interference between thinkers, but that's not enough of an explanation.  Tinkers might experience similar effects; though in-story, only Dragon's power truly seems to scale without insurmountable limits."
Parahumans,3ddrun,MondSemmel,11,Wed Jul 15 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"Taylor came in, what, the two months leading up to the timeskip, some thinkers and tinkers should have been gods by the end of it.   She got better, but not exponentially so. She got smarter rather than stronger. For tinkers it is the same problem as Leet, you are overinflating their powers.   Über and Leet are really problematic in that they're two characters that people tend to overinflate, powerwise.  I'm exaggerating, but man, am I tired of reading, ""Why doesn't Leet just make a machine that turns him into a god!?""   Dinah sort of did. It told her that the best future was not to tell anyone all she knew (same as Cauldron) and push Taylor. Tattletale is limited by her power being super intuition not knowledge. The longer her power runs the more false information can slip into her commentary. Her power can't give her something a none powered Lisa couldn't find out.   Endbringers do have that protection actually. Jack Slash has the subtle auto win versus other parahumans. His power would make sure he beat any parahuman thinker or otherwise.   Not to mention the Simurgh would sabotage anyone who got close to anything big (Panacea in the Birdcage). Or Contessa pays a visit. No starting the apocalypse early."

Parahumans,3ddrun,J4k0b42,55,Thu Jul 16 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"Most of the stuff I didn't like tend to be at the endgame:   The timeskip was handled poorly (this is a common complaint and Wildbow knows it) The latter-day Endbringers were a bit meh compared to the original 3; this is probably a symptom of the timeskip not letting us get to know them very well I didn't understand what was happening with the secondary plotlines involving Satyrical, the Vegas capes and Teacher. This part isn't really a bad thing, just that we didn't get enough of a good thing: Faultline. I think she and her crew were under-utilized both on their own merits (I wanted to see the Gregor/Shamrock ship play out!) and for worldbuilding/plot purposes. They had a whole offscreen adventure in Vegas, which could have been used to meet the Vegas capes earlier in the story, which might have mitigated the above-mentioned problem. I also have a personal preference for a more ""street-level"", bottom-up kind of exposition, so I would have preferred the Cauldron stuff being delivered to the reader exclusively via Faultline and the Undersiders, rather than stuff like Legend's interlude (but I'm probably in the minority here and it's not a dealbreaker anyway)."

I would read something like 10 arcs at a time of Worm in a 12 hour binge, then stop reading for a week or two, and then return, because the exhausting pace was getting to me. Maybe a couple more 'filler chapters.' Addressing some issues with the Protectorate being seemingly stupid-- this stuff is addressed in his WoG, and to a lesser extent, by really just thinking through the implications of suggestions, but as an example: many readers think the Protectorate is stupid for not using Foil in Endbringer fights after she is so crucial in the Behemoth fight. This is explained by a recent WoG that the other Endbringers had now adopted hit and run tactics, and that in many ways, the remaining Endbringers were much harder to counter in that way than Behemoth. This is easily implied through thinking through the other Endbringers' powers, but a sentence or two from Taylor on this topic, given her interest in saving the world at this point in Worm, would not be out of place.  More  world-building on the civilian side of power usage. What is the government's stance on using parahuman powers for construction or engineering or entertainment? It would help flesh the world out more. We have several mentions that Thinkers are monitored from interfering with financial markets (which I don't agree with, since some could be theoretically making the market more efficient like modern-day wall street and extracting surplus value from that service ) but few other rogues in truly civilian industries are mentioned.  Fine tuning the ending of Worm. Wildbow has mentioned he'll work on this given that many readers apparently misinterpreted the ending of Taylor being normal. Though I'm still not entirely clear on what he intended it to be since it really** is** believable for Contessa to do magic surgery with bullets and possible Panacea/Bonesaw intervention."

All throughout I was pulled out of the story by the fact that overall technology didn't seem to have advanced at all, despite all the tinkers in operation. Wildbow's explanation for this is good, but it's never really addressed in-story.  Also, some of the rogues need better career choices. Panacea should never have been tiring herself out in hospitals, she should have been working with high level disease researchers. Manton (or someone similar) could make an easy fusion reactor. Parian could do remote work in hazardous enviroments (really anything is better than a street performer)."
Parahumans,3ddrun,J4k0b42,2,Thu Jul 16 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of the stuff we're mentioning is really stuff that bothers a bit on first readthroughs but makes more sense when you think through the story. So I agree it should be just a tad more obvious.   The Tinker explanation is a good point-- we see some maintenance in-universe, but not enough to realize its so important without thinking it through. Bonesaw maintaining her bots and the S9 is probably the best example. Her interlude probably has the best info on tinkering-- how other tinkers can interact with different specialties, maintenance, their capabilities and reliability.   Rogue career choices-- it comes down to shard influence and host choice. Shards choose already conflict-prone people, then poke a bit if they're not fighting enough.   Then take into account the WoG that the Elite were a group of Parahumans that tried to move into civilian parahuman business but got pushed out by the government because of some law that reduced Parahuman involvement in production and entertainment.  That implies rogues involving themselves in the civilian sector is iffy.   I agree regarding Panacea, but remember her power may have issues that prevent it from being too useful at large-scale societal levels. Maybe her power makes her attempts at curing HIV through releasing a countervirus work for 90% of population-- and then kill the other 10%?  Her on the spot creation of a counter prion to Bonesaw's plague works perfectly but that may be the exception to the rule.  Any power with that much seeming potential for good should be viewed skeptically since it goes against https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/3ddrun/critisisms_of_worm/ct4y5mu?context=3#entity plans.

Parahumans,3ddrun,gardenofjew,28,Thu Jul 16 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"Besides the obvious complaint of the timeskip, Worm could use some more downtime to pace the rapidly escalating tensions better. Taylor's rise is a little too meteoric, and the avalanche of tension becomes somewhat exhausting at times. You can partially blame the web serial format for this, of course.   I really would not mind Taylor's tenure as an Undersider and crime lord being drawn out much more, especially prior to the S9, as this would make her and the team's ability to take on such fearsome villains more believable. The Coil/Echidna/surrender arcs need more downtime the most, though.  Ultimately, I'd really like Taylor to spend more time with the Undersiders, as it's very jarring to have her spend two years with the Wards on a quest that was mostly pointless in the end, and yet have more attachment to the guys she spent a couple of months with."

I'm good for most of the story, love it to death, but starting at about arc 28, the crush started to get to me.  I started to not care.  There wasn't enough time to the s9000 stuff and the world ending.  It became a crush of nothing but ""this sucks"" and ""everyone dies"" with a side of ""hard to follow"" at the end.  The emotional connection is lost after a bunch of chapters like that.  I'm fine with the timeskip, something that can't be tweaked with some minor editing.  But I'm still not fully sure what happened in the end because I had to skim it.  I've read the story three or four times, and I still can't bring myself to fully read the ending due to fatigue, even when I give myself a break and come back.  I've learned more about what happened from comments here.  (Teneral is fine, though.)"
Parahumans,3ddrun,ErrantVagrant,18,Wed Jul 15 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know how popular or unpopular this option is since I never see it get expressed much, but did anyone else ever really get the feeling that Taylor wasn't that awesome? Like, at all?  Hear me out, it seems to me that a tonof the stuff that people consider her go-to best moments--killing Alexandria, beating Mannequin and others--weren't really deserved. The entire time I was reading her fight with Mannequin I was upset because it seemed like the story was all of a sudden presenting Mannequin not as an insanely skilled mass-murderer who could stab you five time and in five different way before you knew it, but some bumbling idiot that was showboating around and not just killing the people he came to kill. But then this sub and other worm fans always seem to feel that that scene was awesome and great and a perfect example of how great Taylor is because she beat up such an obvious threat. No, she beat someone who acted like a powerful, obvious threat in other scenes, but not in this fight at all. To me that's just use of sloppy writing to make the main character seem more cool. Tell me someone else feels this way?"
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,24,Wed Jul 15 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Mannequin spends time showboating and acting up several times in the story. For instance when we first see him meet Armsmaster, Mannequin spends quite a while messing around even though he knows more heroes are on their way. And don't forget in the first fight between Skitter and Mannequin they are fighting for like a minute before he picks her up and tries to slash her throat."
Parahumans,3ddrun,wiikipedia,10,Wed Jul 15 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"You're right, of course. I guess I was grasping at straws when I claimed he didn't showboat, I'm sorry.   I've been wrong before, and it's highly likely I'm just letting my love of Mannequin's description cloud my judgement. It just seemed to me like his fight with Skitter was just kinda silly. This guy is supposed to be dangerous. Incredibly so, right? His actions--to me--just didn't match up with what he, and the rest of the nine, were described as. It just seemed silly to me how ineffective someone the Simurgh itself deemed important enough to corrupt was. Like I said though, this is all me. I just wanted to see if anyone else felt the same."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,13,Wed Jul 15 16:56:59 2015 UTC,I think your point about Alexandria is a much more valid one. That never felt entirely believable to me. Couldn't she have just shut her mouth and plugged her nose? Either way I certainly wouldn't call it one of Taylor's shining moments.
Parahumans,3ddrun,wiikipedia,10,Wed Jul 15 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"Or couldn't she have just escaped? Bugs are fast, yes, but not so fast that a whole cloud of bugs could be on you AND crawling in your mouth and nose without you noticing at all, right? And Alexandria's more than fast enough to escape. You could argue that maybe she hesitated trying to save the Director? I guess that kinda makes sense, but still, like you said, all she had to do was close her mouth and cover her nose and she would have been literally unstoppable."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,7,Wed Jul 15 17:14:38 2015 UTC,how hasn't she gotten a tinker breather to cover that anyway?  she doesn't wear anything like that to fight endbringers who know and exploit her weakness.  is it about not advertising it? a helmet redesign could cover that like it did her eye.
Parahumans,3ddrun,pseudonarne,2,Wed Jul 15 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't think the Simurgh corrupted him in order to create Mannequin the villain, she corrupted him to stop Alan Graham the man from doing good things for humanity.

Parahumans,3ddrun,thyrfa,10,Mon Jul 20 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"With Mannequin she more or less got her ass handed to her, the only reasons she survived were her armor,  and the fact that he was using a load out she could counter (blades instead of, say, gas)."

Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,8,Wed Jul 15 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"Since no one answered you about Alexandria, I will say that there is a running theory some people hold that she wanted Taylor to kill her. There is no way that someone with the intelligence of Alex wouldn't know that Taylor would try to kill her in retaliation. At the same time, a huge part of what Alexandria has spent her life building has just collapsed, she probably knows about Pretender, and would know that she can't help in the way she wants anymore.   She knows that Taylor will kill her, and she knows there is someone who Cauldron can use in her place if she dies. That coupled with her probable sudden depression because of the Cauldron revelations, it's not impossible that she wanted to die and showed up personally so that Taylor would kill her."
Parahumans,3ddrun,tybo555,10,Wed Jul 15 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"Late to this thread, but I'm just completing a full read through of the story and wanted to respond to this very common criticism of Alexandria's death. Alexandria's thinking power revolved around a eidetic(plus) memory and enhanced processing speed, which she used to memorize and incorporate various skills. One of of the skills she was most fond of, as confirmed by Miss Militia and Defiant immediately after her 'death', was cold reading. She tried to cold read Taylor, and concluded that her stunt with fake killing Undersiders would make Taylor crumble and submit. That was her fatal mistake, because Taylor does not have normal body language. If you re-read carefully, it is emphasized by a number of different characters that Taylor's body language just isn't normal. She is abnormally still and inexpressive because she (consciously and subconsciously) pushes her emotional expressions into her swarms. That was Alexandria's mistake, and that was the only reason she died. Alexandria was in her element, performing a pantomime that she had been through numerous times before and not at all expecting a fight. It only took a few seconds for Taylor to capitalize on that hubris."
Parahumans,3ddrun,MeijiHao,3,Sat Jul 18 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, what an idea that is....how neat! Thanks! I'd honestly never considered that a single possibility."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,5,Wed Jul 15 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"No problem. There's a lot of stuff in Worm that comes down to not making perfect sense, and is just ""how much of a genius do you think Wildbow is?"" I don't know that he actually meant for Alexandria to be suicidal, but it makes sense given all the information he gives, which is almost better."
Parahumans,3ddrun,tybo555,2,Wed Jul 15 23:29:28 2015 UTC,"That's more realistic too, isn't it? So many times in life we find ourselves faced with the fact that we can never truly know why people do what they do, especially once they're gone. I feel like our ability to speculate on the subject--almost like this is a real event that happened--speaks volumes as to how good Worm really is."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,5,Wed Jul 15 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree. I have seen at least 100 questions on here in my time, and I have answered half that number in person. The fact that Wildbow created a world that has questions that he doesn't need to answer, but has enough information that we can answer it with just little clues he dropped is amazing to me. In my opinion,  it actually is better than a world where he answers everything himself.   Not to toot our horns too hard, but it also speaks to the faith that he had in his readers that he trusted that he didn't have to spell everything out, because he knew anyone smart/dedicated enough to make it through all of Worm would be able to figure sht out, and we would come together to fill in almost any factual gaps left in the story."
Parahumans,3ddrun,tybo555,6,Wed Jul 15 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"I never thought Taylor was that awesome. As you and others have said, many of her greatest accomplishments weren't very deserved. But to me that was exactly why I liked her character. Rachel and Aisha say it fairly often, everyone always underestimates her and look how many people have been defeated and/or killed because of it. It felt more grounded, entertaining, and impressive that she had to make the best of her powers  as opposed to Alexandria/Siberian types that just wade in and win; that would not have made for much reading."
Parahumans,3ddrun,faintrespite,5,Wed Jul 15 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see where you're coming from. See, I think my main ire on this matter is that Taylor really is pretty cool. Like you said, watching her make clever and neat uses of her power is incredibly entertaining. So I guess it's just upsetting when it seems that the story felt it had to emphasize how cool she was by having her doing things that kinda....""Jumped the Shark""? I guess?    Like, she was already cool, so her beating Mannequin was superfluous and somewhat silly when we'd already gotten the same thing but in a much more clever and interesting way in other scenes like her second fight with Lung."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,4,Wed Jul 15 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is definitely that aspect now that I think about it. I think I noticed that repetition less because I was focused more on the growth/development of her outlook.... becoming more morally gray, so to speak."
Parahumans,3ddrun,faintrespite,3,Wed Jul 15 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope I haven't been coming across as someone who dislikes Taylor's character--she's not perfectly written but she makes a good protagonist for this fantastic world--I really just have a problem with the idea that she's some kinda ridiculous superbadass as opposed to a clever girl who was smart but cautious, since--to me--many of the scenes that characterize her as the former are just silly.  So yeah, it was certainly a ton of fun to be inside her head and to be able to watch her change from an objective viewpoint. Very cool."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Clever-username-,9,Wed Jul 15 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like most of the stuff after the time skip was a lot harder to follow than the stuff before the time skip.

Parahumans,3ddrun,IndividualJ,7,Wed Jul 15 17:25:11 2015 UTC,To me The Protectorate didn't seem like much of a force throughout the story.  While the Undersiders were obviously underdogs that barely won (with the possible help of Coil) they still didn't seem very competent or organized.  I think if there were more wins from The Protectorate (against maybe Empire 88 or some other group of badguys) they'd seem more formidable.

Parahumans,3ddrun,furiousxgeorge,8,Wed Jul 15 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"Well people have alreay commented a lot on the timeskip and the ending so that just leaves 1 more bugbear for me.  Contessa's power.  It's unbelievably bullshit - by which I mean it breaks the internal logic of the story since you either have to interpret that A.) a ton of Cauldron's actions and failures make no sense given Contessa's power or B.) everything went just as planned after all which means that basically the entire plot was just Contessa curbstompig Scion through path to victory bullshit, which also sucks.  Only B is outright contradicted by Contessa's interlude, so we're left scratching our heads over Cauldron incompetence which literally shouldn't have been possible given Contessa's power.  What gets me is that it's totally unnecessary.  Contessa only needs to be godmode to gank Eden, afterwards she can fulfill all her plot purposes even if substantially weaker.  So just say her shard got nerfed fighting/killing Eden so that it isn't total nonsense when Cauldron fucks up over and over again."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Drinniol,3,Wed Jul 15 21:55:45 2015 UTC,"Cauldron and Contessa's power makes sense. She can't see the entities (or how the shards work), so the plan cannot be perfect. She can't just make a million Eidolons. Endbringers are also a blindspot for her, so they could potentially break her plans. And she's also restricted by her own intelligence----she can only use her power by asking a question, and she was 11 when she started her plan."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Kumquatodor,5,Wed Jul 15 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"But she can see how people use powers.  So why does Alexandria die?  What purpose does that serve?  Why does Legend find out about stuff?  What about everything with Echidna - she's not an endbringer so why can't she see her?    Are her plans are so terrible and fragile that they can screw up that easily and badly?  Why the FUCK does Cauldron tattoo their symbol on case 53s before releasing them.  Why the FUCK does Contessa let people see her when she grabs pretender instead of, I dunno, fucking doormakering him at any point any time.    Why don't they just doormaker a bomb on Jack Slash.  Herp derp 14 years humanity will be weaker.    Ok, if humanity REALLY IS getting weaker over time thanks to the endbringers, why not start a fight immediately?  But, if they can't even pull one over on the endbringers, how the fuck do they expect to PTV on Scion?    Wait wait wait it gets better.  Cauldron is interdimensional.  Hell, pretty sure Contessa didn't even come to Earth Bet.  WHY ARE THEY FOCUSING ALL THEIR RESOURCES ON EARTH BET.   Oh capes are getting ganked left and right by Endbringers?  WHY NOT DROP THEM OFF ON ONE OF THE PLANETS WITHOUT ENDBRINGERS.  Why not teleport all the capes off Earth Bet.  Like, why even give a shit about saving any of Earth Bet from the Endbringers?  Earth Bet is one world and Cauldron hemorrhages resources preserving it... for what?  Why?  We're never told.    Why is there any visible Cauldron activity AT ALL on Earth Bet?  Why is Cauldron experimenting with social models and the protectorate and all that on Earth Bet?  Surely they could do that on ANY OTHER FUCKING PLANET!  The random Blue Woman cape empress person conquered her planet and she's not even interdimensional godtier hacks mode!  Like, for real, doesn't it seem a bit fucking odd that Cauldron is doing any activity on the ONE PLANET IN THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF DIMENSIONS where Scion is active and there are Endbringers?  Like, what if he noticed their shenanigans?  Wouldn't that be, you know, bad?  Why are they dumping the case-53s (GREAT JOB WIPING THEIR MEMORIES - DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FUCKING SYMBOL YOU TATTOOED ON THEM THO, SURE NOBODY WILL NOTICE) on Earth Bet instead of elsewhere.  Why is Cauldron fucking bothering to make legal contracts with dudes that they sell powers to?  Why?!  What possible purpose could that serve?  So they don't get sued?  So they can go to the court of ultradimensional appeals if someone tries to renege?!   Listen, the idiot ball cauldron is holding is so massive it could outweigh the black hole at the center of our galaxy and that's before you consider that they're supposed to be literally infallible with their plans due to Path to Victory.    Supposedly Cauldron has all these fucking plans and contingencies but they all seem to suck and then Skitter has to step up and save the fucking day.  So either those sucky plans really were exactly what they seemed like: terrible ideas, or they were some Xanatos level bullshit to enable Weaver to save the day but again that can't be true because of Contessa's interlude.    Like holy shit take Mantellum.  Mantellum no-sells Contessa.  He's a case 53.  So that means, that at some point, Cauldron made a cape that could no-sell their ONE BIG ASSET, and maybe even Scion's precog, and what did they do?  They tattooed him, mindwiped him (HOW, DOESN'T HE CANCEL POWERS NEAR HIM?  HOW DID THEIR MINDWIPE GUY TOUCH HIM WHILE STILL HAVING POWERS), and just LET HIM GO?!  Also, they let him go on Earth Bet instead of anywhere else because HA HA why not. They don't think to, I dunno, fucking, recruit him?  Kill him?  KEEP ANY TABS ON HIM?!    Like, what was the conversation there?  ""Oh hey Contessa what's your power say about the abilities of this freaky crab dude we made.""  ""Nothing, can't see him.""  ""What, really?  Like, at all?""  ""Yep.""  ""So, like, this crab dude is either an existential threat to cauldron or the solution we've been waiting for all this time?""  ""Yeah, pretty much.  Anyway, mind wipe him and dump him in Connecticut.""  ""Wait - what?""  ""Did I fucking stutter?""  Worm's plotting is generally not that terrible by the standards of the superhero genre, but everything Cauldron did was just dumb."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Drinniol,5,Thu Jul 16 00:47:59 2015 UTC,Upvoted for those last two lines. Fucking great.
Parahumans,3ddrun,pitaenigma,4,Thu Jul 16 01:23:54 2015 UTC,"First, you are a complete beast. Great job at this megapost. I love rants, myself. Great post.         why does Alexandria die? What purpose does that serve?   It helped keep the PRT together. Before her death, it was falling to pieces. Afterwards, it felt ""new"", like it had been purged of it's corruption (even though it really wasn't).  Also, she might not have asked ""How do I x, while keeping Alexandria alive"". Her power doesn't really interpret. She basically asked what path created the most parahumans possible, while keeping the PRT. Maybe, that path involved Alexandria dying.   Why does Legend find out about stuff?   What do you mean?   she's not an endbringer so why can't she see her?   Can she see Echidna? I don't recall her being unable to. If she can see her, then this could be a part of the Path.  If she can't see her, it could be because the Simurgh had a hand in it. It could also be that it had to do with the formulas, which she also can't see the result of. Eidolon is powerful enough to be a blind spot, so maybe Echidna is too.   tattoo their symbol on case 53s before releasing them   It may cause sympathy for the Case 53s, as well as a sense of kinship. They'd probably join together to find out what happened to them, and then fight Scion when the time came.   Contessa let people see her when she grabs pretender   Well, why not? Are there any advantages to not being seen? And, if people describe an ""unnaturally competent 40-year-old in a fedora"", Alexandria will know it was Cauldron's doing, prompting her to keep the PRT from looking too deep.   Herp derp 14 years humanity will be weaker.   After 60 more Endbringer attacks? It's very possible that too many will die.   Ok, if humanity REALLY IS getting weaker over time thanks to the endbringers, why not start a fight immediately?    How will they be able to convince everyone to fight Scion before he attacks? Everyone would refuse. The only way people would line up in groves to fight Scion is if he attacked first, galvanizing most parahumans into fighting.   WHY ARE THEY FOCUSING ALL THEIR RESOURCES ON EARTH BET.   Because Scion (and 99% of parahumans) are on Earth Bet.   WHY NOT DROP THEM OFF ON ONE OF THE PLANETS WITHOUT ENDBRINGERS.   ""Yeah, we're taking every single parahuman and putting them on Earth X"". They can't just do that! And even if they could, the Simurgh might get involved (as she apparently dislikes this kind of thing).   Why is Cauldron experimenting with social models and the protectorate and all that on Earth Bet?   Earth Bet is where most of the parahumans in the multiverse are. There can't be a PRT without parahumans, so we can't set it up elsewhere.   Why are they dumping the case-53s on Earth Bet instead of elsewhere?   So they can join the PRT, and therefore band together when Scion attacks.   (GREAT JOB WIPING THEIR MEMORIES - DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SYMBOL YOU TATTOOED ON THEM THO, SURE NOBODY WILL NOTICE)   The symbols just show that something happened to them; without their memories, they'll be drifting. They'll inevitably find the PRT, and they'll join for a sense of belonging. Then, when Scion goes bad, they'll join the fight.   Why is Cauldron bothering to make legal contracts with dudes that they sell powers to?   The contracts make the subjects feel like it's ""official"", as opposed to a home-made potential horror potion. It doesn't really matter (same product, the contract isn't binding, etc), but it seems like the difference between buying weed from that shady guy down the street, and buying it from a pharmacy. It makes the subject feel better, and it gives an aire of legitimacy.   Supposedly Cauldron has all these plans and contingencies but they all seem to suck   They were working fine until Scion went bad and Behemoth died. Contessa can't possibly plan for them.  The only thing that went ""wrong"" before then was that people found out that Cauldron is responsible for the Case 53s, and that didn't effect the Plan.   HOW, DOESN'T HE CANCEL POWERS NEAR HIM? HOW DID THEIR MINDWIPE GUY TOUCH HIM WHILE STILL HAVING POWERS   He only cancels perception powers. Precog, Skitter's bugsense, etc. Other powers work just fine.   They don't think to recruit him?   I'm sorry you turned into a monster, and I can't manipulate you into being loyal. Will you pinkie-promise not to betray us, and to join us?   Kill him?   He's valuable. He could, possibly, block Scion.   KEEP ANY TABS ON HIM?!   How? Clairvoyant can't see him. Contessa can't see him. Many parahumans can't track him. You'd essentially be paying a regular human to spy on him. For who knows how many years. If they just do the usual to him, then he'll probably join the PRT and fight Scion when the time comes.   everything Cauldron did was just dumb.   They were relying on one woman, who's power was severely limited against the threats she was facing, who could only use her power if she asked a question. The question she asked when she was 11 years old.  They were handicapped by circumstance. They did good, despite this."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Kumquatodor,3,Thu Jul 16 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"I could go on about Cauldron's inexpertise but I won't.  Really, you can try to provide ex post hoc explanations for their incompetence like Star Wars dudes trying to explain all the contradictions in their canon but at some point you just have to admit that Cauldron as a plot device and antagonist could have been done a lot better.    Anyway I don't want to go into details about how your explanations don't quite cut it because it doesn't really matter.  If a plausible e planation exists for something that on its face is ridiculous then this should be in the story.  One of Worm's big draws is that it actually does this for a lot of the things in superhero comics we usually are just told to not think about too much!  But not when it comes to Cauldron.  But I just have to address this one point.   A friggen radio tag.  That's how you track Mantellum.  Or a million other things.  I find it hard to believe an interdimensional syndicate with nearly infinite resources and parahuman enhanced planning can't think of a way to track him. Or, you know, you could just not release him because you have no reason to.    And most of your explanations have to fall back on, ""Well, Contessa did it, and she doesn't fuck up, so it can't have been a fuck up...""  Yes!  Exactly!  That's exactly why Contessa's power is such a fucking problem from a storytelling perspective!  Alexandria dies?  Couldn't be cause Skitter's a boss and she's an overconfident bitch.  It's cause Contessa made it happen.  Why?  Well there had to be a pretty good reason if it was on the path!  Too bad we never get to see it.  Too bad Contessa in her interlude seems to have 0  of her patented ongoing super plans going and pretty much seems to be winging everything!    Did you really think Contessa was a strong point of the story?  Really, it's a classic problem - how do you write characters smarter than yourself?  How do you write God, a superintelligent AI, or fucking Contessa?  It's super hard so you avoid it unless it's really, really necessary.  Contessa being haxmode isn't necessary."

It was a convenient way of showing off the past members of the Nine, and maybe it could have been more if it had more development, but it didn't really add anything to the arc. The Nine weren't really any more threatening then they were in 14 and it just made it much harder to take them seriously as a threat when Dragon and Defiant could just red mist the Crawlers.  Likewise, I didn't find Theo's story arc that compelling. I enjoyed his interlude, but I don't think he was developed enough to make me care about him any more than any of the other interlude characters. If it'd occurred earlier in the narrative (before we had six Endbringers, a vast collection of Slaughterhouse Nine, and the end of the world), I think I would've been more engaged, but in the context of the aforementioned escalation, Theo's whole thing was honestly just an afterthought."
Parahumans,3ddrun,CrypticRandom,5,Wed Jul 15 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think the pacing was bad, I binge read for 10+ hours at some points and it's just what made it great. I don't like pointless filler. If there has to be filler, I hope it's on par with the rest.  As for my own criticisms, Timeskip, as has been said many times. The endgame is weird sometimes. The whole teacher thing wasn't entirely clear, the vegas capes being there, and so on. S9000 also was slightly off to me for some reason.   People gave some good criticism in the thread already, but I just wanted to give my opinion on not needing to slow down the pace too hard."
Parahumans,3ddrun,DistaNVDT,8,Wed Jul 15 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that I love Worm, but seeing as you asked, Imma vent a few things:   Fucking Contessa I'd like a scene in which Mannequin chooses a good endoskeleton and gets the jump on superpowered peeps enough to knock em around a bit, even just making them abandon a mission and run for their lives instead of killing anyone would make him seem less of a chump than he ends up acting as. The whole starting with high school angst thing is useful for the story, but does make it harder to convince people to start reading this behemoth of a serial. A lot of post-timeskip stuff is sort of half explained or shown, like the extra Endbringers, the Chicago Wards, the Vegas capes, and the S9000. It sits on the middle ground between mentioning it briefly to show your worldbuilding work and being a full fledged story arc, and honestly once you're a million words in, you're going to prefer a full explanation over brevity. Fucking Contessa. This is not only not on my shelf, but cannot be as of yet. Print it and I will buy all of it. I could totally deal with Taylor dying at the end. Unfortunately, I'm no longer sure exactly what happened to her, and goddamn is it an unsatisfying feeling for an ending to be lacking finality. Something like Tattletale shooting her after apologising for doing this to her would be brutal as hell, which would fit in with the marathon of gut punches in this magnificent serial, and also remove some of the need for Contessa. Fuck Contessa. Scion's interlude was.... fucking amazing, and people with that level of ability make me feel like I should be putting in the same amount of hours at anything at all, and I know that will never happen, and that makes me feel a little sad.  Bonesaw magically turning good was a little sudden and unexpected, despite being led in a little during her chapter. Ultimately cool, but fuck Contessa and her fucking Path to Victory"
Parahumans,3ddrun,mindonahamsterwheel,5,Wed Jul 15 18:43:51 2015 UTC,But how do you feel about Contessa?
Parahumans,3ddrun,djjlav,3,Wed Jul 15 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"In contrast, from my POV Worm's plot would in no way work without Contessa's Path to Victory, and I don't understand the hate for it. It's not even particularly unique; the entities use it (which allows for things like superpowers going to people who will most experience conflict); Dinah does something similar when Crawler invades Coil's base (by choosing a future); and so on."
Parahumans,3ddrun,MondSemmel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"The plot would work simply by swapping Contessa's power for Dinah's, allowing foreknowledge and planning for the endgame, keeping the organisations like the PRT together etc, and restricting Dinah's power to be exclusively the left/right yes/no thing she does with Golem. Minor dialogue changes, Number Man would act as bodyguard with Contessa asking questions in advance using Dinah's canon power to prevent threats from Strangers or allow prep time against threats Number Man can't handle on his own.  The difference between Contessa's power and other precogs is it has almost universal utility, unlimited use, and as far as we know, unlimited specifity. Even the entities can't use it as much as she does.  I should mention that prophecy is amongst my least favourite tools for stories, and Contessa is literally a walking Chosen One of any prophecy she cares to think of. Fuck Contessa."
Parahumans,3ddrun,mindonahamsterwheel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"I see Worm's overarching plot somewhat differently: the entities have won from the very beginning. They've had enough iterations on their powers to be literally unbeatable; as in ""they literally have a power people call path to victory"". The only reason humanity even has a chance, the only reason Worm as a story exists, is that something goes wrong between the entities before the story starts, and a human gets part of this specific power.  The only way the entities could ever be beaten was with their own (unsabotaged, unrestricted) weapons."
Parahumans,3ddrun,MondSemmel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:12:33 2015 UTC,"But there is no reason that the mysterious event that caused Contessa to get the power (where did the name Abaddon come from anyway?) had to happen in exactly the way it did, necessitating the path to victory. I don't disagree with how Wildbow used the power, or how he wrote it, but rather with prophecies in general. I loved Worm, it's just this thread specifically asked for my personal criticisms, and mine mostly consist of prophecies being poo, and Contessa is a bag of prophecies +5. Hence, fuck Contessa"
Parahumans,3ddrun,mindonahamsterwheel,2,Fri Jul 17 11:38:39 2015 UTC,"Sure, that's fine - I can empathise with that.

Parahumans,3ddrun,pseudonarne,3,Wed Jul 15 15:24:53 2015 UTC,I have a friend who started reading and then stopped because he didn't like some of Taylor's reactions and especially how she refuses to get back at her bullies in any way as well as the fact that the writing wasn't stellar (he didn't get that far in). He has since started reading it again but I think it's a valid criticism that it can make you hate a situation/character so much that you simply don't enjoy reading anymore.  Personally I closed my computer several times and just paced for a while but if a moment like that catches you before you've been grabbed by the story there's a fair chance that you'll just stop reading altogether.

This ending gives me the worst of both feels. Shatterbird isn't dealt with. I know she is in the deleted thing, but it probably needs to be addressed at some point in a rewrite, even if its just digging up her corpse or whatever. On Alexandria: It's weird that she just tells taylor how to kill her then acts surprised when it happens. Imo - Remove her blatantly telling taylor her weakness. I'd personally have taylor wonder ""She's back from tattletale. She's soaking. Why was tattletale using water? Maybe she was trying to drown her."" Or something. TATTLETALE could figure that shit out, and seeing what tattletale did to alexandria, taylor could too.

Parahumans,3ddrun,Ridtom,3,Fri Jul 17 10:21:34 2015 UTC,"If I may, while list my problems, I shall also list possible solutions. I think it'd be a bit more benficial than if I were to simply rant about my concerns/critiques:  Time-skip:  -It's jarring and kills the story momentum. In media res is a fun tool, but was handled very poorly in-story and was very hard to follow due to it's sudden merge with the narrative.  Solution(?) - Interlude Arc. Covers a wider range of characters while also covering events that are of importance to the story. There are loads of character view-points that could offer valuable insight to the world and it's workings. Even beter if it's varied, i.e. Jouster, Annex, Red Hands, that one villainess that Weaver converted to the Wards, Sparky, the Elite just to name a few.  PRT - Actually a lot of problems but my main two are: Workings and Competance. We don't see a whole lot of hiw the PRT actually works, and when we do it's when they are at a time of crisis or just got their teeth kicked in or being obstructive to Weaver. Sure we get more info via WoG and PRT quests... but that won't help those who read the finalized version of Worm and only that. Competance is mostly for the BB Protectorate really, and I've mentioned it enough that Wildbow is probably having an annuerism right now from sheer annoyance, but it bears mentioning. The BB Protectorate are not threats, they are speed bumps. They lose every fight they have shown unless Taylor and company are explicitly working with them. This is especially noticeable during the Charity Banquet fight: the entire Protectorate + the Wards (who the Undersiders had a tough time beating on their own even with Skitter) + New Wave (GG and Amy) + PRT Squads. That's 13 capes and at least 8 highly trained and weaponized paramilitary officers. Taylor, Regent, and Brian spend most of the previous chapter explaining how utterly suicidal it is to go up and fight these veterans of parahuman combat while out-numbered and out-gunned, where there is most likely to be security.   We all know what happens. The Undersiders show that the event had no security what-so-ever for an event that had the wealthiest officials in the city, they beat the PRT squads in seconds and the Wards don't even put up.a fight, which is despite several of them having powers and costumes resistant bugs and capable of moving extreme distances, flight, and manipulating space. The Protectorate have one of the worst letdowns I've ever felt for a superhero fight, with each being taken down within minutes of having a paragraph or two describing what their powers are, and none of them landing any meaningful blows on these relatively less experienced grab-and-go villains.  Only Armsmaster and Miss Militia show any sense of proffiency in combat, and Miss Militia is reduced to a twitching barfin gmess and Armsmaster falls for the most obvious bluffs in history (fun fact: TT tried to hold on eof the part goers hostage with a gun Armsy. They probably don't care you beat the shit out of them).  It's just... so dissapointing. And never stops. The closest we get to them actually winning a fight is them fighting off Hookwolf from a transport robber... only for them to once again to be utterly trashe dby the Undersiders at their own base of operations. 3 times.   Soultion(?) - Agency. Agency, agency, agency, agency. We need insight to how these programs are ran, why they run like so,.and how the heck they operate with such an abysmal track record. We need to actually see it. Show, not tell. We need events that have us see the BB Wards and Heroes actually being an effective force on-screen or in-text or whatever the phrase is. Yes, I understand a lot of this is from Taylor biased PoV, but that doesn't mean we don't need something to make us actually worried when the Undersiders fight the BB Wards/Protectorate. They need substance.  Alexandria's Death (but not the way you think)   I'm an Alexandria fan. I don't her living or dying hurts or harms the story in any way. My problem.is that her death doesn't make sense. She flies and fights at speeds faster than sound, her mind has faster/more efficient processing, she knows her own weaknesses and has lived with it for decades. Yet, she couldn't hear a swarm of hundreds of bugs (which by the way, would be loud as hell, even if Taylor tried her best simply due to the mass of space they inhabit) and somehow couldn't dodge them as they attacked her face-first? She moves faster than Velocity and he was tearing into Taylor's hornets easily, but all of a sudden she can't burst herself back? Hell, at the speeds she moves at, the shockwaves would disable or kill any bugs that landed on her or around her!    It's just poorly handled all around. And I know it's supposed to be hard to swallow in universe (BA DUM TSSH) but I'm going to have to draw the line and say her way of dying was contrived (ugh, hate that word)  Solution(?) - A lot of things need to change. Maybe her powers, maybe the situation, maybe the description, maybe all of it. But it needs something changed, something clarified as to why this situation is any different to any other time someone has tried to kill her with suffocation, other than: ""the story needed it/it's Taylor who's doing it.  • On a side not: I feel her Interlude works best after the Echidna Arc. The readers are all against her and Eidolon, firmly showing that Cauldron are the ""bad guys"" and maybe the main antagonist... and then Alexandria Interlude where we see how things aren't so simple and that something even bigger is in the works that Cauldron is preparing for.  I think that's all I have as ""major"" criticisms. Wildbow, I tried to be polite as I can, but I apologize if any of this came off as rude or too agressive. I normally try to be restraining in my critiques but I've screwed up many times before.   I hope this helps and is at least a positive feedback!"

She's still:   Very fragile, because she can be killed just as easily as a human being (unless you attack her with really slow projectiles that she can dodge) Not versatile (She can't sense extra things to gain additional information, she can't use her power to protect others or escape, her power is too strong to regularly use as a regular cape because of the possibility of serious injury) Is a hero (and therefore is limited by moral codes, property damage, and PR.

Skitter and the Undersiders were all C-listers starting out and honestly, the most that any Brockton Bay native could have initially claimed to be would be a mid B-lister. Another great example would be Scrub, who was basically a random-ass Merchant who triggered and got power-beams. Jump forward a few arcs and he ends up creating a portal that helps save the human race.  If it helps, think about how Flechette was initially assigned to the New York Protectorate, Much like how Vegas ate up all the serious Strangers in the Protectorate, New York's Protectorate branch would presumably be a much more serious deal than that of a mid-sized city like Brockton Bay and have proportionately stronger capes. She only showed up when Leviathan decided to visit and only stayed because the city contracted a bad case of the villains-taking-over-everything (as well as the power of love)."

They have weaknesses and strengths that can make all the difference depending on the context.   Foil takes down GB and Hookwolf and Tyrant [hatchet face+ king fusion], yes-- but would have been easily countered by Cherish or that poison gas cape.   So I think it should be foreshadowed a touch more with Taylor mentioning Foil trumping everything earlier in the story with more emphasis-- but it does make sense in the context of Worm."
Parahumans,3ddrun,REkTeR,3,Wed Jul 15 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"My issue is not so much that she's too powerful (though I think she's more powerful than you're making her out to be) it's that she goes very suddenly from being not-very-powerful, to defeating Siberian and Gray Boy.   My critique is more that A). She takes out Siberian by throwing a dart, and B). She kills Gray Boy despite his defenses, which makes sense only when you really sit down and think about their respective powers, how powers work, and what their powers are probably actually doing, and even then doesn't really sit right.   Basically the whole ending to the Siberian/Gray Boy fight didn't really work (in my opinion - I mean, I didn't even remember that Foil had enhanced physical abilities until Wildbow reminds us that's how she tricks them).

Like he said, but my problem is this: We rarely rest. The arcs, especially the later ones, are huge. Having no rest in between big sequences is lethal. I know quite a few people who gave up because it felt like the book was constantly trying to be in their face. This is the absolute worst in the end, but it gets that way with Coil/Noelle as well. The best arcs are the ones that give us a bit of a break from the plot as a result. As I've said in the past the Noelle arc needs to be taken out back and shot. It doesn't work. Noelle and Trickster are uninteresting as villains. Every time tension is built the interludes break it. It's hard to focus on the action when it happens constantly. This is maybe my biggest issue with worm: Taylor is always right. When she's wrong, the person telling her off is always in a lesser moral position. She does some extremely selfish things, and the only person to tell her off and even then for some of them is Piggot, who is bigoted, hated by everyone, and hateful herself. At the end of the day we have a main character whose need for friends and her need to be loved makes her do evil things. This is great as a story concept except it's never revisited other than a somewhat lame ""I would do everything differently"" speech that wrings completely false because the character is stating this after mutilating herself to win. She never evolves and becomes a better person only doubles down on her pigheadedness. The good guys say they can't trust her and she gets offended. Why? Essentially, she's a stupid teenager but the story never has a responsible adult who can tell her off without seeming a hypocrite. Any responsible adult (Miss Militia, Chevalier) falls under her charms. Even later in the series, we've got some really bad moments. Her killing that Indian cape really reeks, for me, with how unnecessary it is. The timeskip kills the story. I don't mean just that it's a bad decision it also makes me completely lose interest in any of the proceedings afterwards. This is why I don't have many legitimate criticisms of S9000 and Scion - Even on rereads I can't bring myself to pay attention and care about things. It just becomes a big ball of ridiculous. Everything after the timeskip is so disjointed and bizarre it's hard to connect to. One of the reasons it was a surprise Wildbow is a man was because the writing of a lot of male characters isn't good. Grue especially feels like a female character written as male. This is a criticism that got worse for me in Pact. The world is incredibly bizarre. It's ok for a superhero story like Marvel/DC where we've gotten used to the ridiculousness over decades and no one really questions it because of the legacy, but I think this can be easily solved by a few lines of Cauldron saying they'll shape the superhero world like this so that they would have as many as possible. Make it clear that Cauldron is behind the hero/villain truce and you've got another great element to the story. This complaint was amusingly enough echoed almost 30 years ago, to Wild Cards. George R R Martin created a superhero story set in the real world and set out deconstructing how history would be different if superheroes existed (One of the great moments in the first book is how McCarthy targeted suspected communists in the superhero community), but his first two big villains were an alien invasion and a supervillain out to destroy New York. It was only afterwards when he expanded into bizarre villains that don't fit the mold of supervillain that the series really worked (A politician who manipulates emotions to ensure his presidential run, a terrorist looking to create a new island for the story's version of Case 53s, a psychotic 70's revolutionary trying to establish a communist paradise). Wildbow had great villains (or at least he did for the first half of the story), but the problem is the same. Regarding the ending, I think the absolute best solution is completely cut out the epilogues. They're great for giving us a taste of what comes after, but that wasn't the story. The story was always about Taylor. She's the center of the story, not the world. This is very minor, but I think ending it like that is more of a shock, more suited to the story, and ultimately a better ending. You can always address the world in the sequel."

There were 5 groups, where we knew the fates of most of the members (Undersiders, BB Ward, BB Protectorate, Triumvirate, Travelers). Eliminating people whose ending is unknown, the male casualty rate was 10 out of 12, while the female casualty rate was 3 out of 11.  Most notably this includes every male Undersider, every male Ward, and most male Protectorate members.  (To be clear, this isn't a criticism or an accusation, it's just something I found interesting about the story)"

Parahumans,3ddrun,Shemetz,4,Thu Jul 16 00:52:26 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree with you on quite a few things:   Noelle and Trickster weren't really good as characters, but their powers were awesome, and so were the battles with them. So the arc doesn't need to be cut out - just flesh out Noelle's character a bit more, or give clearer foreshadowing, or make her not seem like a person who suddenly became miss evil chimera immediately after being a pretty normal girl with weird flesh faces on her legs (when she was at Coil's) IMO the timeskip was only bad because compared to the few months before it (when basically everything interesting that could happen, happened) almost nothing interesting happened to either Taylor or the world, or at least not on-screen.  I never had a problem with that. I think the male characters are completely fine, and so are the female characters. No! Completely disagree. The story is not just about Taylor, it is also a LOT about the Wormverse and the stories that evolve within it. The epilogues were just right and very needed, and there are simply too many loose threads that need to be tied or properly shown to be there for the sequel (Teacher's thing, the Undersiders' new teams, Grue's fate, Dragon)."
Parahumans,3ddrun,pitaenigma,4,Wed Jul 15 21:15:13 2015 UTC,"Noelle and Trickster weren't really good as characters, but their powers were awesome, and so were the battles with them   I'll be honest here - Their powers were somewhat interesting but Worm has had better, and it was never about the power. Jack's power makes him slightly more deadly than Chris Kyle, but his personality makes him the amazing villain he is. Trickster is the sort of nerdy dickhead most of us know, but he's uninteresting as a main villain. Noelle is interesting as the concept of a proto endbringer but is never interesting. The best part of that arc is the surrounding tension.   IMO the timeskip was only bad because compared to the few months before it (when basically everything interesting that could happen, happened) almost nothing interesting happened to either Taylor or the world, or at least not on-screen.   I've got nothing to say here. This is something that a lot of people in this thread as well have said. It's clumsily handled and takes you out of the story, and the immediate following events were too bizarre for me to jump back in.   I never had a problem with that. I think the male characters are completely fine, and so are the female characters.   This is a relative issue I have, some people disagree. Maybe I'm oversensitive but it feels off to me.   No! Completely disagree. The story is not just about Taylor, it is also a LOT about the Wormverse and the stories that evolve within it. The epilogues were just right and very needed, and there are simply too many loose threads that need to be tied or properly shown to be there for the sequel (Teacher's thing, the Undersiders' new teams, Grue's fate, Dragon).   Teacher's thing can be shown in a sequel. We don't need the sequel to be set up in this novel. This is Taylor's story. For the sequel we can have whoever's story and you can set Teacher up as a villain for then. But Taylor is the main POV. We're looking at the story from her eyes. It's only fitting it ends in the last chapter. Same goes for the Undersiders. When Taylor leaves the Undersiders the story's focus leaves the Undersiders. Because the story is about Taylor. Grue's fate... eh. I've got nothing. At that point I didn't care what happened to him. It seemed pointless, really. Dragon could also be a plot in the sequel. As it stands, it feels like the last 10 minutes of The Dark Knight - You've resolved the main issue of the plot, and you've added superfluous drama."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Jzadek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Krouse and Noelle are some of my favourite characters in the series, above even fan favourites like Dragon. Far more interesting than Jack who is essentially something we've seen many times before, just done particularly well, in part because of the authors recognition that he is essentially shallow. The traveller's, on the other hand, are far more original, far less shallow and far, far more compelling for it.  They're certainly not villains, though. The villain of the Echidna arc is the Simurgh. Krouse and Noelle are merely her first victims."
Parahumans,3ddrun,pitaenigma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying - Simurgh is the man behind the man, so to speak. But Noelle is the villain in the sense that the story revolves around beating her and the tension ends shortly after she's defeated. The repercussions continue into the rest of the book magnificently, but she serves the role of main antagonist for those arcs. Trickster is a very original character and I agree - as a character he's great. As a villain he's lacking. Unthreatening and unappealing, with nothing to make him stand out in the Worm Rogues Gallery. When placed against Lung, Bakuda, Kaiser, Leviathan, Jack, Coil, and Alexandria, he's pretty much boring as hell."
Parahumans,3ddrun,monkeyjay,3,Thu Jul 16 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with your criticism on neutered male characters. thinking about it though, I actually feel like Assault/Madcap was the closest we got to a male character (in Assault's Battery's interlude). It stuck out to me possibly just for that reason when I read him."
Parahumans,3ddrun,pitaenigma,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"Could be. We got so little of him... I think you mean Battery's interlude. We never did get an Assault interlude, though he left quite the impression."

Parahumans,3ddrun,gardenofjew,2,Thu Jul 16 00:17:11 2015 UTC,"I thought Armsmaster and Chevalier were good male characters, but I think you're right on the whole. Male characters aren't as well-characterized as female characters.   My overall impression, honestly, from Scion following Eden to Taylor commanding everyone to Alexandria being a leader to Contessa and Simurgh manipulating everyone, etc. is that male characters don't really lead in Worm. They are led.  An obvious exception is Jack. Jack is a wonderful leader, charismatic, very masculine, and unrepentant evil (which is refreshing in a gray world where everyone has some Freudian excuse.)  So a definite theme or maybe slight problem was that male characters just don't feel powerful in Worm. Legend is powerful, but is gay, which (stereotypically) makes him less masculine. It doesn't make him (actually) less masculine or powerful, but it does paint an overall picture of there being no unambiguously masculine and powerful Worm characters.   To be fair, there are exceptions like Armsmaster and Chevalier, but the former is redeemed by a female character and also led to some degree by that female character."
Parahumans,3ddrun,pitaenigma,6,Wed Jul 15 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"Not even close to what I mean. Sorry.  Something I've noticed is that as similar as people are, there is still a distinct way people of different genders express themselves, with a lot of middle ground. And with Worm it feels like women express themselves in both feminine and neutral ways, and men express themselves in neutral ways and occasionally feminine ways. I find it hard to explain exactly what I mean here. Grue especially but a few other male characters feel distinctly non male in their writing. Grue is the absolute worst offender because we have a character who was theoretically in a male oriented environment growing up. There is mention of things that are unique to women in their communication and behaviors but very little of men. The male character who feels closest to being an actual man is Regent, who is also the most effeminate of the male cast theoretically.  This has nothing to do with male characters feeling powerful. And it's not with gay men stereotypes - Legend would not change a bit in his characterization if he were male, female, straight, or gay. He is a completely gender neutral character. Very few of his lines would need to change. Contrast that with Taylor, or Lisa, or even Piggot, all of whom have a very strong gender identity. It comes off weird, though mostly because of a contrast in a field where The Wheel of Time is still regarded as good writing in spite of its ludicrous writing of female characters."
Parahumans,3ddrun,Naugrith,5,Wed Jul 15 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"And with Worm it feels like women express themselves in both feminine and neutral ways, and men express themselves in neutral ways and occasionally feminine ways.   I get what you mean, Grue reads very much like he was written as a teenager's fantasy boyfriend, a declawed badboy for the heroine to rescue (in the same vein as Twilight's vampire boyfriend). But there are many more male character that I think you're ignoring. Jack's been mentioned, but also Trickster, Coil, Chevalier, and Armsmaster all have very strong, even stereotypical, masculine qualities, and are written as very strong characters. Chevalier is a literal knight in fact. And there are many more strong male characters as well, as well as weak ones, stupid ones, effeminate ones, and more. What is so refreshing about Worm is that Wildbow can create completely different interesting characters across the spectrum of human diversity, rather than the tired cliches of alpha, beta, and goon males, and females who are solely princesses, rebel chicks, femme fatales, and bitch queens. I've never come across a writer whose work contains so much diversity of characterisation."
Parahumans,3ddrun,gardenofjew,3,Wed Jul 15 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. I agreed but was giving my own additional complaint on male characters on Worm. Not on the characterization per se-- more the power dynamics of male characters in Worm.  On your point, I kinda see what you mean.  Its hard to explain because the difference between male and female characters is subtle, but its something you feel. Grue feels male in some ways that are more 'tell' rather than 'show'-- he does martial arts, is in good shape, etc. but doesn't come across as masculine in his dialog-- for me this is best shown by him never commenting on female capes as attractive or not. Which is a pretty central feature of masculinity nowadays. Regent does do this more-- his relationship with Imp gives him a degree of masculinity.   Is that kinda getting at your point?  This is interesting to me-- what exactly do you feel is off with Grue?    Because I feel it too but its very hard to really say explicitly."

Parahumans,3ddrun,Victory_Disease,2,Wed Jul 15 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"The situation with Taylor and her bullies. It's incredibly cringe-inducing, frustrating to read, unpleasant, and we just kind of get to watch Taylor passively get picked on for way too long. I had a fairly easy time accepting her behavior/context because I've got preexisting familiarity with the issues/headspace/etc from others' accounts of their own bullying, but if you don't:   Her not telling her dad is a shitty thing to do. I don't think there's ever a proper textual explanation of why. I accepted it because, you know, when things are bad you want to compartmentalize and not think about it, but I don't think Taylor ever does a good enough job of explaining it. I know someone who stopped reading because the Taylor/Danny interactions were so frustrating to read and made her come off as really unsympathetic. Her not doing anything feels stupid. I know there's the Crabs conversation in Shell 4.3, but that's a long time coming. She behaves like a passive victim for a lot longer, and there's no real in-story connection going on. Again, I get all the stuff going on, but the story doesn't do a good job of establishing things like, resistance gets escalation, avoidance is the best strategy, why administration doesn't do anything, etc. It can make it feel like Wildbow's just kicking the shit out of his protagonist for no reason. The administration's passivity/lack of reaction comes off as bizarre. I get that Emma, Madison, Sophia, are all fairly popular, Sophia's a jock, etc, so they get it easier than the friendless nerd, but it's not really put into words. ""Why doesn't the administration do anything?"" is a question that's never really dealt with. This leads to the extremely pervasive fanon that it's because they were covering for the Protectorate (which is explicitly rejected by Taylor in story... in a one-line brush-off).   This is kind of a general thing, as well. A lot of organizations come off as extremely incompetent (PRT, Cauldron, etc), because the issues that they run into are never explained in the story itself. There's WoG about why the PRT/Cauldron/whoever else has such a tough time, but it's not explained in the text itself which means they come off as weak. There's a general absence of context, which means that a lot of the antagonists' behaviors seem arbitrary and stupid. I know Taylor's a myopic egotist with a deep-seated distrust of large organizations, but there are interludes to establish other people's situations, and they never really touch on why the PRT and Cauldron don't just fix everything trivially."
Parahumans,3ddrun,gardenofjew,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah this was my biggest issue getting into the story. I've never had serious bullying so it came across as completely unbelievable to me-- akin to those shitty Indy!Harry fanfics where Dursleys are cartoonishly evil.   It makes more sense as the story goes on and some context is revealed, but I was never quite content with how over the top the bullying is, how passive everyone is, etc."

It stopped me for a while in my first two read-through, and a friend of mine had the same roadbump. It's the little adventure in the Merchants' mall. Don't know why, maybe because the victims are assholes, or that it's between far more interesting fights, and the characters' development and relationships halt for the time of this expedition.

Personally I can deal with them, but it makes it hard to recommend it to other people, especially people who are more sensitive than I (and I know a lot of people like that). I feel like there are ways to convey how creatively evil the S9 are without showcasing the results.  This is a criticism of Wildbow's writing in general I guess. In Pact this certainly got scaled up a fair bit, with every second person on the street seemed to hand out a fate worse than death at the drop of a hat.  That actually reminds me of a good example. In the Boil short given at the end of Worm, the computer head was still around, but in Twig we experienced the horror of being the computer head. I feel that the way Boil told the same story conveyed the same message without being so... traumatizing."

I'd love a bit of differentiation in how Taylor percieves joining the PRT / burning parts of her self to fuel Khepri. Not quite sure how to pull that off, though, or if its even relevant. It's just that the fact the arcs mirror each other so much is my biggest grumble.   Relatively minor grumbles in the scale of things though.  Oh! I'd also prefer if Golem's interlude was split in two and the bits framing his interactions with Taylor goes before arc 26 - that way, because it deals with all the explanation of why everyone is the way they are in the Chigaco Wards it flows a little better and helps gap things."

Writing intelligent and logical characters seems easy for Wildbow probably because he is a good writer and intelligent, but I feel like there was no wit and no one ever shared a real honest joke. Tattletale was kinda irreverent and bitchy, Regent and Imp were snarky, but no one was witty!   To turn this into praise though, I'm also glad that he had little to no 'lolrandom' humour characters either. Imp teetered on the line but she played it so straight that she worked fine."

The Traveller arc, while cool, could easily be its own novella - like what the Expanse series does for extended backstory and context. Physical descriptions - there's a lot of characters who I'm not really sure what they look like because, in a text the size of worm, what they look like is mentioned very rarely. This should be adjusted. It's minor things, but it helps - for example, which arm did Defiant lose? The information I can recall comes from scouring the wiki and the text for mentions- not because I recall it from my initial reading. For a story where race sometimes plays a significant part, it's odd that we have to guess for a lot of characters.   Other than that, a lot of the issues in this topic barely rate as criticisms.

Parahumans,3ddrun,dgatos42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Worm, and think many aspects of it are incredibly clever, I had to try not to think too hard about some stuff, just turn my brain off and enjoy the spectacle. There are a lot of things that happen just because the plot demands it, rather than because it makes sense within the world. Examples are:  The death toll for the endbringers is overdone I think. While its great for the Leviathan arc, to show such decimation of the cape population, its just not scalable over time. Brockton Bay is a victory, yet it wipes out a ridiculous amount of capes, many killed by attacks that hit at random, and are impossible to avoid or defend against by the majority of capes. When you realise that this happens every few months, I found it hard to believe that any non-invincible cape could survive more than a handful of attacks. Eidolon, Alexandria and Legend I could believe, but many capes, as well as Skitter, lasted for years seemingly fighting every single endbringer attack, even ones where the heroes lost, and never got killed. The odds against that being physically possible are ridiculous.   The endbringers are a brilliant idea, but there should have been some explanation about how anyone other than Triumvirate-level capes survived repeat battles.  Secondly, the lack of anythign mroe than the most basic strategy for dealing with the endbringers consistently annoyed me. The best the capes can come up with, despite havign super-genius strategists on their side, is to gather all the capes they can and throw them at the endbringer in waves to see if anything works. No wonder so many die! There are some basic tactics thrown in, but nothing very clever. They know that the endbringers can shrug off even the biggest hitters so why do they encourage every single cape, even those that can't even touch the endbringer, to turn up just to get slaughtered? The sensible thing would be to come up with strike plans for each endbringer, using only the capes that can actually do useful effects. Pull together some heavy hitters, build some powerful tech, use capes like Foil and Clockblocker more tactically. I found it unbelievable and frustrating that there was so little planning for these massive city-killing threats when smaller threats were met with some very clever plans.  Cauldron was a damp squib. They had way too many capes in their cells, and way too much power, and had no plan to actually do anything with it - eventually when it was revealed their plan was just to throw all the capes they could at the problem and hope one of them managed to do something unexpectedly effective. This was incredibly dumb, yet apparently this plan was so important it meant they would do whatever it took to carry it out.  A lot of battles were won by the protaganists when they should have been stomped - just because the plot required them to win. There were many of these but Skitter's fight against Mannequin is the most obvious. There was no way she should have been able to even harm him, let alone beat him off. Its the biggest case of special pleading I've seen. And the S9000 was a big misstep. You can't build up the S9 as a threat that has lasted for decades beating off the best capes in the world then throw 9000 of them in and use them as cannon fodder for the protagonists to wade through."

You believe your project, if done correctly, will be truly valuable to the actual population of the state (even if in a minor way), but everything you do towards that end runs up against a wall. Your company's developers don't want to do anything above the basic strict requirements laid out in the contract. The client holds your company to every deadline established as part of the project, even when they miss theirs. Your bosses want you to run interference, giving the clients non-answers or misleading answers to questions that might spark any hint of additional work on the part of your company. The client refuses to pay a dime more than they think they should, even though their initial requirements for the project were flawed and it really ought to be them that compensates for it. In essence, everyone you're dealing with seems to be operating more out of greed or petty politics than a genuine interest in public good or work ethic.  It all comes to ahead in a particular project meeting when everything that could go wrong does go wrong, all at once. The tension is high. The one person working for the agency who you thought was kinda on your side in this, raises her voice and point-blank demands you personally give an answer on behalf of your company for some perceived slight. The question is one which your bosses have given you explicit instructions to evade. On top of that, you missed your anti-anxiety meds that morning. The project is about to fall apart, and you're sure everyone is going to blame you. Trigger."

Range about 10-20 feet, weaker farther out. Master power for sure, not sure the number it'd be given.   For some people this would be a dream come true, but there are at least three big downsides: one, it really overrides others' agency, worse than rohypnol, and you come to realize you can't do that to people you love. You can't even do that to people you don't care about.   Two, you can never turn it off.   And three, your desire-communication itself is considerably stronger than the actual master-factor. You can't make people do something that's more than a couple degrees of separation from what they were gonna do already, but they will become aware that you want them to. You can't ever successfully bluff or lie to anyone again, at least not if your personal desires are in any way a factor.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Situation:  You are in the first session of a pen and paper RPG campaign, creating a character.

A domestic dispute in the next apartment results in a gunshot travelling through the thin wall, and piercing your skull. It's non-fatal, but it blinds you, and severely disorients you.

Because Coil still thinks that he is splitting reality it must mean that his shard takes those things into account or else it's simulations will ""crash"". (We know Coil was in situations relating to Entities and Endbringers like the Leviathan fight).  Another advantage that Coil has over others is simply that he gets a lot more information about specific thing. Powers like Dinah's only tell her about specific things and doesn't tell her everything about a timeline. A power that tells someone when people are going to die or a danger sense seems like something that can happen in Worm, however, those powers wouldn't really tell HOW that person will die or give you more information.

We don't see it against Entities, though, so all we can say for sure is that it's somewhat likely to work when Leviathan's in town.

I don't know whether Coil's power can handle Enbringers and the like, but if it couldn't I'm positive my previous post would be the end result.   The fact that nothing out of the ordinary was mentioned about his power during the Leviathan attack, I'm tempted to say his power is in fact capable of simulating endbringers just fine. Which would make him one of the more powerful precogs in the setting."
Parahumans,3d9j49,GreatWyrmGold,5,Tue Jul 14 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"One of the major things that his power does is dodge the 'normal' methods that thinkers use to manipulate the market, which allows him to be filthy stinking rich..."
Parahumans,3d9j49,GreatWyrmGold,3,Tue Jul 14 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"Coil's disadvantages:   Real-time simulation - though the shard is precognitive, Coil gets the information basically in real time, as he acts out one reality and receives information from the simulated one. Thus, he can only see 'the present' and not the future. That's pretty much it. Coil's power is great.   Coil's advantages:   Unblocked. Normal 'future-sight' precogs get confused and blocked by other precogs as they both predict each other and get trapped in a game of 'I know that you know that I know that you know...'. Coil's power breezes straight past this, and is capable of freely simulating other precog powers. His power can basically do everything Dinah's power can, for example, as long as she is in a place where Coil can ask her questions in a discarded reality. Because Dinah's power doesn't actually do anything, Coil's does all the work simulating it. No time limit. We haven't seen an upper limit on the use of Coil's power to split hypothetical timelines, but its duration ranges from a few seconds (I shoot this guy/I don't shoot this guy, just to get the vicarious thrill of shooting his smug face without the consequences) to all day (he routinely maintained a 'safe' reality where he sat at home and caught up with his sleep and reading)."
Parahumans,3d9j49,wiikipedia,2,Wed Jul 15 09:04:26 2015 UTC,"No time limit   Honestly, he could probably just simulate two lives until he died."

Parahumans,3d9j49,GreatWyrmGold,4,Tue Jul 14 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"Panacea can't use her power on Alexandria, at all. Alexandria's invincibility is a kind of time lock extending over her entire body, like Grey Boy. It's inviolable by everything except Endbringers and Scion. We don't get to see Alexandria interact with another inviolable power, but it's possible she stays away from that so that less is known about her powers.  Edit: oh yeah, we do know of one interaction. I forgot Alexandria lost her eye to The Siberian, who is also inviolable."
Parahumans,3d9j49,scrafts,5,Tue Jul 14 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think Alexandria is inviolable to the Endbringers too. That's why she's still fine after fighting them for years.  Though of course, there's always the risk of being strangled or drowned."
Parahumans,3d9j49,GreatWyrmGold,2,Tue Jul 14 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"I guess, but that's a serious impediment (missing an eye means you lose all sense of depth perception)."

I suppose being able to be healed by Panacea is nice, but since a grand total of two things have been able to hurt Alexandria (three counting, one (or two) of which would have killed even Glory Girl and the other of which could have, I'm not sure it balances out.  Not aging is probably more on the plus side than the minus, once you're an adult. Arguably, it's still a bit advantageous for children/teenagers once they reach the start of puberty."

His big weapon is a very versatile 'stilling' ability, which lets him cancel out wavelengths, which can be applied in a variety of ways, defensive or offensive - it lets him counteract, manipulate, and cancel virtually any parahuman or human generated effect. He can cancel out heat, eliminate sound, break Grey Boy's ability, disintegrate molecular bonds, etc. He can do so with beams, thrown orbs/bullets, a light he emanates, and a personal forcefield, among a variety of other mechanisms.  He maintains a toolkit of a handful of other powers to be able to fly, thinker abilities to understand complex ideas/languages, the precog ability that costs him a lot of lifespan to use, and a bunch of other stuff I can't be arsed to name, as I said above.   Seems to be limited to a defensive short range form, whereas Scion can do a lot more with his including using it offensively."

There's also plenty of overlap in shards, plenty of duplicate information.  Alexandria package common enough to have a shorthand name, so we know different shards can yield similar powers.  We also know that the same shard can lead to plenty of different powers.

Zion and Eden both had Broadcast and Path to Victory shards so it stands to reason they would have a lot of overlap just with different specializations. We know Zion has his own share of mental based shards despite being the 'Warrior' and vice versa for Eden. We know Eden tinkers don't seem to be limited in the same way as Zion tinkers.  There are differences, but we don't have clear categorizations from the text so it is hard to make any conclusion one way or the other. Wildbow kept it rather ambitious leaving it up to reader's interpretation.    We do know that Eden lost 'vital' shards that she meant to keep many of which would serve the same purpose as the ones Zion kept to insure the completion of the cycle."

Assuming any shards other than the core functions have counterparts has no basis in canon.  Now of course, Scion has thinker powers and Eden has ""warrior"" powers, but assuming the map directly to each other has no basis in canon.  Eden might have some random power that fires periwinkle bubbles, there's no reason to assume her fighting powers are remotely related to Scions.  Hell, many shards can manifest blaster powers just as easily as thinker ones, there's no reason to assume that shards are counterparts of each other just based on the powers they happened to manifest."

He literally set up a plan that would put him in the birdcage, take him out of the birdcage and make him more powerful than when he started. Given that he now controls Contessa to some degree, I think he should be very pleased with his plan.  Honorable mention goes to Coil. He was ""this"" close to having everything work out. If it wasn't for for Skitter's administrator shard giving her an edge, he would have won. Come to think of it, his attempt to kill her was about as close as anyone get in the entire series. Given the amount of firepower arrayed against Skitter at one point or another, that's a pretty big accomplishment.  I think Cauldron gets the mixed results award. They accomplished their goal despite overwhelming odds and a massively superior opponent. The only problem, is it isn't clear whether they won because of their efforts or in spite of them.  I'd give both Johannes and the Vegas team the WTF award. Both of them fiddled around with dangerously high power enemies for really vague reasons. I'm sure they had a plan, but it didn't end well for them and no one seems to understand why they did what they did.  I'm sure there are more, but I'm running out of steam."

He was Augustus to Skitter's Caesar. Where Skitter's open antagonism could only invite horrid conflict with the government Coil's plan would have allowed him to escape most of that. In fact, in some ways he's more subtle than Augustus, whose Republican pretensions existed alongside his visible power, he was always in the shadows."
Parahumans,3czdxh,Tsegen,12,Sun Jul 12 05:09:48 2015 UTC,"That's a really interesting question - who would make a better ruler of a city, Skitter or Coil. You're right that Coil is a LOT more subtle. He'd be able to maintain control without constant escalation a la Skitter. On the other hand Skitter cares about her people a lot more. Coil only seems to care about himself. I'll have to think about this some more."
Parahumans,3czdxh,HarbringerOfNumbers,13,Sun Jul 12 05:40:33 2015 UTC,"As Coil said, whether he cares is immaterial. He is proud. If his people suffer, that reflects badly on him.

He's going to get kicked in the balls and dropped down an elevator shaft real quick.   I'm also skeptical of the extent to which Contessa would actually listen to him at all.

And then you have to make sub-plans for that and do all the other sub-plans for the overarching goal... That would take up years, when everything would have changed and new plans needed to be written.  But we don't really know the finer details of his power, so any speculation is just that.

Parahumans,3cwwae,DailySojourn,15,Sat Jul 11 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"It always struck me that the Endbringer's were designed to be a ""F*** You"" to the heroes. Behemoth bypasses most defenses, giving a big middle finger to capes who thought they were untouchable. Leviathan is slippery an fast, screwing over heroes who had learned to fight outside of the kill aura. The Simurgh is subtle completely bypassing carefully planned defenses.  Khonsu is the biggest embodiment of this. He mimics the very power that was used to destroy Behemoth, moves around to keep Scion at bay and incorporates layers of forcefields to prevent him from getting one-shotted. To me this suggests that he was tailor made to counter the previous strategies, but not necessarily made from the same shards as the capes that opposed Behemoth."
Parahumans,3cwwae,HarbringerOfNumbers,14,Sat Jul 11 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"It is heavily implied that Endbringers evolve via future iterations to hard counter strategies used to fight them. This forces the heroes to adapt and find creative new ways to use their powers, which is the whole point."
Parahumans,3cwwae,helltank1,2,Sat Jul 11 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"True enough, though if Eidolon subconsciously created the Endbringers (and he almost certainly had something to do with it), the Endbringers might be designed less with forcing creativity and more with causing challenges.  Similar, but not quite the same."
Parahumans,3cwwae,GreatWyrmGold,14,Sun Jul 12 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"They are all thematic answers to previous methods.  Behemoth is overwhelming firepower on a level the world had never seen before.  Presumably when they finally manage to make some semblance of a defensive strategy they get Leviathan, who is just too fast to really plan for and too dangerous not to actively engage.  Presumably when they the majority of battles against Leviathan are going progressively better we get the Simurgh; win all the battles, lose the war.  When Scion finally offs Behemoth we get Khonsu, which can just teleport away when things get too hairy (read; when Scion comes).  When everyone finally starts working together to take on Khonsu we get Tohu/Bohu, almost the very embodiement of betrayal; the powers of your allies used against you via Tohu and goddamn environment used against you via Bohu."

Why couldn't Zion just follow Khonsu?  In the end they didn't beat Zion with overwhelming power, they beat him by exploiting an aspect the entities didn't fully understand: emotions. And then targeting a weakspot via multiple crucial powers."
Parahumans,3cwwae,Neato,6,Sun Jul 12 03:19:35 2015 UTC,"Zion follows the letter, but not the spirit, of Norton's orders. Mostly because he doesn't really understand on a human level.  So when he comes across Khonsu, only for Khnosu to teleport away, he technically attempted to follow through with his orders, but with the primary threat gone he now has to focus on his other orders: saving people, stopping bank robberies, healing people etc."
Parahumans,3cwwae,Ridtom,3,Sun Jul 12 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Zion doesn't actively want to hunt down Endbringers, he just does so sometimes out of boredom and a crushing lack of purpose."
Parahumans,3cwwae,oliwhail,3,Sun Jul 12 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"Although I still don't get why Scion didn't murder the others in later engagements.

Parahumans,3cwwae,Ridtom,3,Mon Jul 13 02:30:35 2015 UTC,"i had always imagined that scion actually had to try hard in order to defeat an endbringer. the only reason he was able to destroy behemoth as easily as he was was because the heroes and phir se were able to weaken him so much that scion only really needed a few good hits.   look at the final battle for instance. despite wanting to kill people and destroy everything, he still doesn't really kill the endbringers. he tries, but they keep ducking away too fast for him to follow, or tricking him into going elsewhere. granted, he does kill a few of them, but it takes him a significantly long time to be able to pull it off.   so when he was fighting them between behemoth and golden morning, the fights probably just didn't last long enough for him to take them down."

He has very versatile and powerful offensive/defensive capabilities with his stilling weapon that can be expressed in a number of ways (destroying materials, stilling waves, removing radiation sickness, etc.) , can move quickly and from different realities to another, has a costly but powerful PtV ability with contingencies, and maybe a couple more we didn't see.   he doesn't have access to every ability.  I'm not sure where the hell this idea came from since its not even hinted at in Worm."
Parahumans,3cwwae,gardenofjew,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't he have duplicate shards to Eden? If he did he would have Glastig's shard and Eidolon's shard which would grant him any ability he needed.  Edit: Actually not Glastig's since she's a natural trigger. Eden probably had her copy of that. Since that seems to be a shard they'd need to harvest the planet. Also if they each had a copy of every shard, they could each distribute half of theirs and still not lose any functionality while ensuring maximum learning potential."
Parahumans,3cwwae,Neato,12,Wed Jul 15 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"So the Endbringers (Weapons, in the fake Eden timeline) would just be the shards given bodies? I guess that could make sense.  The only thing you said that I take issue with is that when Phir Se dies, Khonsu is ""free to appear"". I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Eidolon subconsciously tailor-makes the Endbringers to his needs, and Khonsu teleports like he does because it makes it harder for Scion to fight it.  Other than that I like the idea."

Eden and Scion released shards to partner with humans and become parahumans; it's likely that Eden's solution was simply adding a critical parahuman.  My theory about the Endbringers' origin is that Eidolon subconsciously used his power to use the shard Eden used to make the superweapons, and with that made the Endbringers (probably from shards)."

(sorry for cramping your style Linmark, I just couldn't wait until tomorrow to gush about this!)      Oh man, I am hugely enjoying this arc. This is my favourite chapter of Twig so far. All of the Lambs participating in the discussion, Wendy, Warren's reappearance. Everything.     And more Wendy! When we were introduced to the stitched I figured they were mindless drones with flashes of the deceased's personality. But Wendy seems like a real person, not merely a reanimated body. She has a teddy, she's affectionate towards Warren, there's even inflection in her voice when she's trying to convince the girls that the Lambs are dangerous. Now she's a maid not a bodyguard like Hayle's, so it could be that there's degrees of how functional the stitched can be and when they're made their autonomy is pruned based on their intended role.    edit: missing a word"

Parahumans,3cvvd9,potentialPizza,7,Sat Jul 11 05:17:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, if Worm was a manga, it would a seinen rather than a shonen.    Seinen: men's manga (18 - 50) Shounen: boy's manga Josei: women's manga (18 - 50) Shoujo: girl's manga    I still haven't found a good way to explain this,   Spectacle/power creep?   The bad guys keep getting more and more dangerous with the good guys essentially going super saiyan 1/2/3/4/etc to win. Worm does this with most of its big bads, but except for maybe one moment in the story the main character never goes super saiyan to solve a problem. Taylor usually gets smarter not stronger as the story progresses and that's why I liked Worm so much.   Power creep doesn't make for good story telling and a lot of shonen manga fall into that trap (Naruto, Bleach, etc). Once you've threaten the world you can't get much bigger. It also feels stilted when your power creep fluctuates from city danger to world danger to street crime and back again. I'm a little worried for Worm 2 in this regard because I'm not sure how Wildbow is going to top Scion ending the universes or get us invested in small time conflicts when we have an idea of the bigger picture. Plus Worm's biggest asset was its world so I'm not sure how the story can progress without more power creep without it feeling awkward.  At least that is my interpretation on your view.   nagging from my brother to watch some shitass animes even right now as I write this   Here are some good ones: Spice and Wolf, Psycho Pass, Baccano!  :)"
Parahumans,3cvvd9,Rillet,5,Sat Jul 11 07:51:26 2015 UTC,I find your taste in anime... Exquisite.
Parahumans,3cvvd9,sieben-acht,4,Sat Jul 11 13:24:19 2015 UTC,"To your last point about conflict creep, Wildbow recently said in a thread on here that he feels like he doesn't need to continue the creep up starting at Scion for Worm 2, and in fact (might be interpreting this part) that he probably wouldn't even creep up that high again."
Parahumans,3cvvd9,tybo555,2,Sat Jul 11 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Kinda hard to top the origin of all superpowers once he's lasered the bucket. Hard to reach, even, given all those psychic breadcrumbs the Entities left behind."
Parahumans,3cvvd9,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sun Jul 12 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Here are some good ones:   More good ones:  Macross Plus (Music by Yoko Kanno, the OAV is better than the movie IMO; one of my first anime, and it taught me to watch anything with a soundtrack by her), Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (MUCH better than the original and the story it's based off of, decent voice acting, absolutely beautiful, iconic music, DAT OLD MAN), 3x3 Eyes (There's two dubs, one is awesome and one sucks, though the latter fails more due to the main characters than the supporting cast, which includes Keith freaking David voicing a transvestite), Redline (Should be a sucky racing movie, but has strong characters, actual plot, and is visually amazing.)

Parahumans,3cvvd9,ErrantVagrant,2,Sat Jul 11 11:41:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, nah, it's really not the power creep. Spectacle is close to the problem, and power creep is certainly related, but I feel like a lot of stories have a moment where they shift from the small-scale conflict to the large-scale ones. And it's not even that the large-scale ones are necessarily bad. I'm comparing it to Dragon Ball because in those two stories, the small-scale part was much more enjoyable."
Parahumans,3cvvd9,pseudonarne,5,Sat Jul 11 15:42:12 2015 UTC,later arcs were not my favorite either.  i think the massive timeskip over a bit that promised to be interesting just to jump to endless acceleration knocked me out of it for awhile.

Parahumans,3cvvd9,pendia,8,Sat Jul 11 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"I would have preferred if it had a bit less of that ""things don't work out"" feel.   Don't read Pact. That's my main bone to pick with Pact.  I actually liked how Worm felt in this regard. It felt more like the losses make the victory that much sweeter (where as Pact felt like ""you just lost something? Time to lose something more!"").   In the same way, I kinda wish Worm ended after Echidna   I felt that Worm had a quite interesting way to deal with power creep. There was a constant level of threat throughout the whole story (well, I guess Scion was the exception), and instead of the protagonist getting a lot stronger to deal with bigger and bigger threats, they instead became more influential and experienced to become more involved in the fights.  As an example, Skitter was almost an observer in the Leviathan fight, while later on in the Ecidina fight she dealt a major blow to a similarly dangerous foe via strategic thinking."
Parahumans,3cvvd9,Vaikusin,3,Sat Jul 11 09:40:24 2015 UTC,"That's certainly one of the good things about the later parts of Worm. Not really related to what I was talking about, but certainly one of the pros to the rest of the story.  Also I started Pact, and it's world and characters just haven't really grabbed me like they did in Worm. I may read it someday, but it's low priority."
Parahumans,3cvvd9,pendia,2,Sat Jul 11 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"I would say that the second half of Pact is just as good Worm, but the first half definitely hits you with the things getting worse stick, and not in the good way. I was hoping Wildbow was going to edit Pact like he's doing with Worm and rework parts of the first half, but he made a comment not to long ago that he isn't going to bother."

I hear stories of people getting emotional when characters die, in Harry Potter or Game of Thrones or what have you, and I've never really felt that kind of loss before, but the very last line of 29.9 got me that way, I couldn't stop until 30 was done, and I was kinda haunted (in an enjoyable way) for days."

I won't name all of the examples that are coming to mind, but in fact I'm having a lot more trouble coming up with counterexamples/exceptions. (Sherlock Holmes things maybe? Other real-world fiction?).  SPOILERS ENDING FOLLOW  I rather enjoyed Worm's ending sequence. It's sort of a ""here's an impossible problem: solve""-type deal, with lots of exciting character interaction throughout. I like the ethical dilemmas involved with weighing smaller atrocities (spoiler) against the fate of all humanity. So, yeah! To each his own. Personally, it satisfied me in its treatment of epicness. Yet, if the revision is made and the timeskip is expanded upon (time wizard guy come on Wildbow!), I will be very very happy! ^ ^  PS: (Poor spoiler, though... still don't know how I feel about that one XP)."

Parahumans,3cuei2,pseudonarne,3,Sat Jul 11 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this is somehow connected to Worm, just can't figure out how."

Parahumans,3cuei2,sanctaphrax,7,Sat Jul 11 03:23:28 2015 UTC,"Ah. I see. I imagined them smaller than earth and less...worm-like, although now I'm face-palming myself about the latter."
Parahumans,3cuei2,cascade101,8,Sat Jul 11 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"I figured the worm was like a metaphor for a tapeworm, and the entity's were basically parasites, rather than being actual worms. Planets are round because gravity pushes them to be, if the entities are larger than earth they should be round too.  I took the whole spinning around each other to be gravity's affect on them trying to pull them together, and them using some antigrav shard to pull away.  That would also be how the 3rd entity found them, by looking for rogue gravity wells in areas between solar systems. I suppose you could argue that they are multidimensional creatures, and a way to display multidimensional things is a tesseract, a sphere in multidimensions could look like a long worm I guess.  But it should still look like a sphere to us."
Parahumans,3cuei2,asterna,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:02:00 2015 UTC,"I dunno if the normal gravity logic applies to the entities, but it's true. We don't actually know what shape they are, so there's no guarantee they're worm-shaped.  But IIRC they were described as worming over each other in the thin grey mud, so they've got some wormlike qualities."
Parahumans,3cuei2,sanctaphrax,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Was this worming while they were still evolving?  I mean it would be like comparing us to prehistoric fish. I'm not sure why gravity wouldn't apply to them?  Honestly the most efficient form it could take would be a sphere, with the most critical shards protected in the center.  Long and thin makes very little sense to me, it makes it very easy to attack. https://youtu.be/0jHsq36_NTU?t=34s This is the kind of thing I imagined, only with 2 orbs!  Kind of worm like I guess as they move through space?"
Parahumans,3cuei2,asterna,5,Sat Jul 11 17:14:21 2015 UTC,That's about the size I had envisioned them. They did say they had to shed a lot of shards in order not to swamp the planet's surface.

Parahumans,3cvewy,GreatWyrmGold,17,Sat Jul 11 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"The entities really look like a mess of shards following each other since they're 4 dimensional beings and can't exist in one dimension at once. Even after shedding, Scion's body was fuelled by shards in countless other worlds. It's fun to imagine them as giant worms though."
Parahumans,3cvewy,FireHawkDelta,7,Sat Jul 11 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're so much four-dimensional as three-dimensional in multiple universes. But if we have .gifs of rotating hypercubes, fanart of the Entities is also possible."

Parahumans,3cvewy,Subrosian_Smithy,3,Sun Jul 12 13:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely the sort of threat which the entities would need to take notice of. It makes me wonder if any actual game of D&D has used this as written. The same book stats out Omniscience - a player with that trait gets a copy of all the DM notes, gets to read the adventure module in advance, etc. I found it an amusing read but how the heck do you play an actual game with stuff like that going on. What do you do about something which can move a billion squares in a round and then use a breath weapon which has a 92% chance of making it so you never existed..."
Parahumans,3cvewy,Subrosian_Smithy,3,Sun Jul 12 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"I've actually played in games with the rules from that book! It's surprisingly fun, but it can definitely be harder to DM then a normal game.  As you yourself point out, both the players and the threats they face are absurdly powerful, making combat a game of rocket tag. So everyone in the universe sees combat as more danger than it's worth, and thus most challenges are faced through creative problem-solving and diplomacy. Like international politics, but between cosmic overgods and monsters."

Parahumans,3ctpjv,Brothernature0,4,Fri Jul 10 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah specifically the bridge, but I don't think the nasal bones are dense or hard enough to do anything other than pulverize once you start pushing them against the skull. If they were more like your femur, maybe a fracture, but still, the skull is a damn hardy bone."

I remember reading about a soldier who got shot in the head and lost the need to sleep. Can't find the source, though. There's also the case of Phineas Gage, which you've probably heard of. Mind you, he didn't escape unscathed (mentally or physically), but a tampering iron is much bigger than two bullets.  I've always figured that if Contessa can walk through a swarm of bugs that Skitter is actively trying to reach her with using just her own ability, bullet brain surgery isn't even remotely a stretch."

Parahumans,3ctpjv,winz3r,3,Sun Jul 12 10:13:34 2015 UTC,It's absolutely a possible happening. While a bullet is sorta strange and not common at all there is the famous example of Phineas Gage. And of course the sad example of lobotomies.

Parahumans,3ctpjv,Rillet,-12,Fri Jul 10 21:44:10 2015 UTC,"One minor disorder being removed by a gunshot is not the same as screwing with a connection that even Bonesaw with far more precise tools than a bullet couldn't sever, plus fixing the massive brain damage Taylor took over the course of Arc 30, which even Panacea didn't think she'd be able to fix before things got worse."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,9,Fri Jul 10 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, it was already foreshadowed that Cauldron had a way to disable powers permanently. Granted, bullet surgery probably wasn't the first option .."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,bramflakes,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:27:40 2015 UTC,Cauldron? You mean that group that—aside from being heavily deceptive—had its entire base and everything they owned destroyed by Scion before the bullet brain surgery?
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat Jul 11 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, hence the part where I said    Granted, bullet surgery probably wasn't the first option .."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,bramflakes,6,Sun Jul 12 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"Contessa's entire point is being able to do things better than any other cape in most circumstances. Is brain surgery with a handgun really so hard to suspend disbelief for? I have no problem believing she could make Bonesaw look like a chump. That's what Path to Victory does.   For that matter, if you can buy everything Bonesaw can do with the human body, surely you can accept that the individual with the ability to do anything literally perfectly-and I do mean literally- can perform some eccentric surgery?"
Parahumans,3ctpjv,AWorldW-OShrimp,-3,Fri Jul 10 22:59:47 2015 UTC,Maybe I could...if Wildbow had bothered to explain any of it.
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"Her hand touched her forehead, and she felt a pair of soft spots, each barely wider across than a dime.  She ran her hand over her short hair.  She didn’t know how it had happened, but she could guess.  Bullets to disable her, surgery to seal her power away.  Cauldron, apparently, did have a means of locking powers away.  Or maybe it was Contessa, doing the work, or perhaps she’d simply been kept alive, carted to Panacea or Bonesaw, who could fix things up.  But dwelling on those things wasn’t healthy, and it was pointless in the end.  She’d likely never get a serious answer.  She only had the two dimples or holes in her skull, the sole apparent casualty of some kind of brain surgery.   Wildbow doesn't explain how it happened, but he offers multiple possibilities and leaves it up to the reader to think about.  I personally suspect that Contessa pulled in Panacea to heal everything up afterwards which is why she doesn't show up in any of the epilogues, so she doesn't give away the ending before the finale.  Likewise Tattletale could have been involved in making sure Taylor and her dad got through the gate before it was closed; at the very least she figured it out afterwards."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Lost_Carcosan,-4,Sat Jul 11 05:58:43 2015 UTC,"That seems to be acknowledging the lack of information more than explaining anything, though. Which really infuriates me."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jul 11 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"Actually I think that passage is great. I know that's an opinion, but still. Why would Taylor know the exact methods used to fix her? The story is in first person, so all we have is speculation. And we are given plenty of viable options. Maybe you didn't get the answer you want but we see that she is alive with no powers (or in a coma) and we are given some possibilities as to how it happened. Sometimes you don't get a definite answer in books. Especially first person books. I'm sorry it infuriates you though.   All you have to know is that she's likely alive and that Contessa did something to stop her powers. Why do you need an exact answer to how it happened?"
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Ignis_ex,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:24:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like she should—or at least could—have known the gist.  I don't need an exact explanation, just enough details that I know it's plausible, that Wildbow thought this through."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jul 11 17:21:28 2015 UTC,It's not Wildbow's fault that you stubbornly deny Path to Victory's ability to do exactly what it says on the tin.
Parahumans,3ctpjv,AWorldW-OShrimp,-2,Sat Jul 11 05:50:15 2015 UTC,Path to Victory tells you of a path to victory. It can't do squat if you ask for something impossible.
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,12,Sat Jul 11 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"Panacea thinking she can't do something isn't even evidence that that thing is hard, much less impossible. Panacea is a little bitch."

Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,6,Sat Jul 11 01:20:16 2015 UTC,I'm saying that Contessa doesn't have to care about relative difficulty.
Parahumans,3ctpjv,ThirdFloorGreg,-2,Sat Jul 11 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"Contessa tests my suspension of disbelief in other places, but the ending breaks it completely—especially because, as I said, Wildbow doesn't spend so much as a sentence explaining how she actually pulled everything off. It's not just the bullet-brain-surgery, although that's the biggest sticking point. It's the surgery, the recovery, the lack of powers, the getting Taylor to Earth Aleph and landing her a decent life, the motive, etc."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,5,Sat Jul 11 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"Contessa's power is the literal path to victory. If it's physically possible for her to do something, she can do it. So why do we need wildbow to go into great detail about the steps when it's the end of the story? Contessa did it because she can. Her power allows it. You shouldn't allow your suspension of disbelief to break over contessa. If it breaks, I'm not sure you understand her power."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Ignis_ex,-3,Sat Jul 11 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"If it's physically possible for her to do something, she can do it.   And if it isn't, she can't. Wildbow didn't bother to explain how what Contessa did was physically possible, and I don't see how it is."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,5,Sat Jul 11 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"Wildbow doesn't have to go into detail about how it's possible. It's a story with giant space worms made of shards, people who can make metal out of nothing, alternate realities, and giant monsters. Sure, it's fairly realistic as far as fiction stories go, but there are some things that are gonna happen that defy explanation. I'm sorry you have a problem with that, honestly. But also Wildbow doesn't have to devote pages or even paragraphs to explaining something like that. Contessa wanted to do it. So she did.  Also, haven't people linked to similar things in this post? Wasn't that the point? I didn't check out any of the links, but I think they posted about things going through people's brains and them being alive AND sometimes altered. If that's true, it isn't hard to imagine Contessa can do it in a way that stops Taylor. We don't know too much about what Triggering does to the brain, so of course we aren't going to fully understand how it happened. But honestly, it's a fiction book. I understand you aren't happy with the lack of explanation, and I'm sorry, but like I said before out of all the things in the story, Contessa is one thing I won't question."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Ignis_ex,-2,Sat Jul 11 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"(So this is what it feels like when I jump in the middle of a Reddit debate.)  Wildbow didn't even devote sentences to it. And why did Contessa want to fix Taylor in the first place?  It wasn't just the trigger—in fact, it wasn't a trigger at all. Khepri seemed to be sustaining cumulative brain damage from exerting her power; the effects aren't consistent with Panacea's jailbreaking and effects of the shard doing everything (so that removing the shard would fix everything—assuming that [say] Rachel would be back to normal without the shard and that those changes aren't more permanent), but they're exactly what I'd expect if using her power damaged Khepri's brain."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,4,Sat Jul 11 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"Ha, sorry. It probably looks as if I'm attacking you. I promise I don't mean anything by it. I guess I got caught up in the topic and found myself responding often. Sorry if I offended or anything.   As for the topic, I honestly can't tell you how it all happened. Wildbow had Taylor make some guesses. All the guesses were plausible. Take your pick. If you don't like those possibilities, you can consider that maybe Contessa shot her and put her in a coma. Wildbow jokingly hinted that this was a possibility, though I personally am going to stick with the bullet brain surgery ending because I like it better.   All I know is Contessa's power is ridiculously OP and if she did something like that I would be impressed but not doubtful. We have to take the story for what it is. If you don't like it that sucks, truly. But I'm glad you're still such a big fan of Worm. I see your posts on here a lot and it's cool to see someone so active in the community.  Anyway, I think this is one of those things where we gotta agree to disagree. No biggie."

Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,4,Sat Jul 11 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"It's simple. She asks her power how she stops Taylor without killing her. Power says place your gun here and slowly squeeze the trigger. Her power supplies her with the answer. Out of all the things in the story, I think contessa is the last thing I question."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Ignis_ex,-2,Sat Jul 11 05:18:24 2015 UTC,"I find it highly, highly improbable that that's possible, and even less plausible that she could fix Taylor's brain damage, and also implausible that Contessa would go to such efforts to fix up Taylor after all she did to hinder Cauldron."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat Jul 11 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"Improbability isn't really an issue for Contessa.  Now, as for how possible it is. Surviving a shot to the head is rare, but not impossible. There are documented cases of people surviving. All Contessa has to do is ask where to shoot to both stop Taylor's power and let her live. If there is a part of the brain that has to do with powers, maybe all she had to do was destroy it. I don't know. We don't know much about the brain aspect to powers, other than there is a part of the brain that changes. But Worm isn't a textbook. Wildbow doesn't have to go into detail about how the brain changes or the intricacies of brain surgery with a bullet. All we have to know is that there's a part of the brain related to powers and that you can survive a bullet to the head. That's all we need to know.  Honestly, I'm sorry if that's not enough for you. I hope that the improbability didn't lessen your love for the ending or for the story overall. But honestly, I don't see the issue. It's Contessa. Her power may be OP as hell, but it's also easily understandable. I don't see why this would be outside of her abilities."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Ignis_ex,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Plausibility isn't possibility, it's how likely it is to be possible.  Surviving, yes. Removing the power...maybe, but A. Bonesaw couldn't do it with her best effort and B. doesn't Contessa's power not work so well when you get close to Scion, the root of all powers? Fixing all the damage the shard did to Taylor is impossible. And I'm still not sure why Contessa did it."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat Jul 11 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"We don't know that the bullets were the whole story, only that they disabled Taylor and knocked her out."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,Subrosian_Smithy,-3,Sat Jul 11 07:13:52 2015 UTC,It sure would be nice if Wildbow told us the whole story. Then we probably wouldn't be having this conversation.

It's the surgery, the recovery, the lack of powers, the getting Taylor to Earth Aleph and landing her a decent life, the motive, etc."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jul 11 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"I know I said possible twice; that was intentional. Talking about powers that essentially collapse every probability into 0% or 100% can lead to some confusing sentences.  I agree that the epilogue could use a sentence or two going into more detail about how Contessa pulled it off. Then again, if Wildbow wants the ending to be ambiguous that might be counterproductive, since it might tip the scales too far into ""it did happen"" territory. I believe that its current state is enough to prove that the maneuver could have happened, though - because if you can envision even one scenario where Contessa pulled it off (as plenty of people on this subreddit already have), then you know that it was within Contessa's capabilities."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,CogentInvalid,-2,Sat Jul 11 01:51:32 2015 UTC,"I can't envision any scenario of that sort, though, not without replacing major steps with ""???"" followed by ""Profit""."
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,6,Sat Jul 11 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"No offense, but maybe that's a failure of your imagination?  You've provided plenty of evidence against the bullet maneuver by now. None of it is individually so ironclad that we can't come up with a wiggle-room justification for it, but all of the little problems add up to the point where for any other character, we would be able to call BS on the bullet surgery thing. But if your goal is to show that Contessa couldn't have done it, the burden of proof is waaay higher. It's not enough to say that something (curing brain damage, severing shard, etc.) is ""improbable"" or even ""totally astronomically unlikely"", you have to categorically prove that it's impossible. And as I said, nothing you've come up with so far has been totally incontestable (see: the responses to every comment you've made on the matter).  Asking you to prove 100% WITHOUT A DOUBT that something's impossible may seem like an unfair demand... but Contessa has a way of making situations unfair for people. :P"

You really are being unfair if you ask me to prove that something's impossible. Hell, it's theoretically possible that all of the collisions between air molecules will cause the corner of the room I'm sitting in to become vacuum, or that all of the silicon in some part of your computer will spontaneously decay, causing it to malfunction for no good reason. There's a lot that's possible, but a lot of that can't be controlled. And there are some things that aren't possible; why can't you believe that bullet brain surgery on the level Contessa did is one of those things?"
Parahumans,3ctpjv,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jul 11 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"I know it's unfair to ask you to prove that something's impossible. That's the whole point. If you can't prove that it's impossible, then there's a chance that it's possible. And since Contessa's powers turn anything she wants to do from ""possible"" into ""true"", that would mean there's a chance she did pull it off. Hence, if you can't prove that the bullet surgery was impossible, you don't have a basis for saying that it definitively didn't happen.  So there's basically two options at this point: -Conclusively show that no action Contessa could have taken, in the entire possibility space of the Wormverse, could have led to Taylor's recovery -Admit that we'll never completely know if she can or cannot do it, accept that the ending was intentionally ambiguous, and live in harmony with the rest of the subreddit"

His location is rarely easy to pin down, he doesn't go out much, he'll use his women and kids to find good looking women or women he can use and add them to his circle.  They run the errands.  Woman A has a fight with her boyfriend, drives the man away, and becomes more isolated, she heads to her job, orders in, and generally mopes and acts normal for a recent divorcee single mother.  Enter Heartbreaker.  Haha, no.  Heartbreaker was there from the beginning.  He targeted her and her daughter, had her drive her spouse away and disconnect from extended family, and moved his flock into the nice house... a surprising number of people can be fit into a house if they're willing/forced to sleep five or six people to a room.  Maybe target the neighbors too, if there isn't enough room around.  Woman A continues to work, embezzles from the company, and disappears from the grid.  Authorities only learn that Heartbreaker was there after the fact, when they connect the dots.  The group moves on to Woman B, who happens to work in a police station or PRT office.  She's not that attractive, but she's useful.  Like Woman A, she continues to work, but she keeps an ear to the ground regarding all things Heartbreaker related.  Maybe it's one of the once-a-year times when something slips.  A kid gets recognized.  Forces mobilize, the mole alerts Heartbreaker.  Forces teleport in or mobilize via. flying vehicles, and Heartbreaker is already gone and running.  He's got kids like Guillaume and the like, who already have dozens of unwitting spies watching (Guillame touches everyone in a crowd, and senses through their eyes, like Taylor's swarm sense, minus the control aspect, and can temporarily blind them or fuzz their senses), allowing the escape route to be plotted, and the group gets a few seconds of warning time before the flying suit passes over the area.  Capes are forced to move in groups, because moving out alone means running the risk that Cherish might sense them, and the small group of Heartbreaker's kids, a handful of captured capes, and his elite zealot-soldiers could flank them and give Heartbreaker the moment he needs to wololo the solo cape.  Meanwhile, the women he's tired of are armed and ready to fight like the worst kind of zealot, convinced he's in the bedroom.  The heroes approach, forming a perimeter, and neighbors of the initial victim make a move, flanking, opening fire with hunting rifles or improvised weapons.  Chaos, fires are set.  It's hell - fighting guerilla forces made up of people you really don't want to hurt, blameless.  Heartbreaker moves out to the periphery of the city to live in a rural location, or just disappears into another densely populated neighborhood.  Authorities maintain warnings and circulate pictures, they keep an eye on things, root out moles, and everyone knows but few say that the open confrontations are too costly, and the subtle stuff is matched by the power of this one cape and his nine or so cape children.

At work does she feel trapped in an abusive relationship because she knows he's using her? Does she think that the media has her dreamboat boyfriend pegged all wrong because she loves him and he loves her?     Also, why didn't Heartbreaker use his power to keep his children emotionally leashed to him? He kept Alec in line with terror as a kid, but never instilled the level of fanatical devotion that he kept his women or pet-capes at. Cherish and Alec ran off, and I didn't get the impression that the heartbroken were too sad about his death.     *Jesus Christ I just realized how much darker Heartbreaker makes the world.

If Heartbreaker never caused noticable problems south of the border, then the US Protectorate/PRT might decide it's not part of their jurisdiction and/or decide that there are more important things to spend resources on -- and so leave it up to Canadian authorities. The US villians might decide it's not worth the trouble to get involved (and/or those that did get involved got killed or turned).  Canadian authorities might be under Heartbreaker's influence.

I reached out to Ash Beast, a living force of nature.  It had originally triggered in Matruh, Egypt, and had been roaming since, making its way across Africa.  All of the destructive power of any class S threat, tempered by the fact that it usually traveled on foot, and people could see it coming from miles away.  When it reached a settlement, that settlement was usually evacuated.   edit: also, there was an argument about whether Echidna was class-S. This means two things:   you have to argue that Heartbreaker is clearly more dangerous than Echidna you have to argue that the sort of conversation that appears in Queen 18.4 would've resulted in a class-S rating for him   edit2: now I think that Ash Beast is not class S--the thing I quoted says he would be, but he's not mobile enough"
Parahumans,3ctox4,a_wild_drunk_appears,2,Sat Jul 11 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"The other two active S-Class threats are Nilbog and the Three Blasphemies. Sleeper is an inactive S-Class threat, and Heartbreaker is nothing compared to any of them.  Echidna seems less dangerous than Heartbreaker because her rampage was short-lived and she didn't have the time to really clone a lot of dangerous capes. But you have to consider that 2/3 of the Triumvirate took her on, as well as strong capes like Myrddin, and they still lost a bunch of people, whereas Heartbreaker is a Canadian nobody who has probably killed less people in his life than Echidna has in her short rampage.   Eidolon alone could solo Heartbreaker, they just leave him alone to avoid thousands of women committing suicide or blowing up cities."

They mention that he screwed up by doing this to a starlet or something and that's what brings the heat but these women leave to go to him of their own accord in the same way that drug addicted women will shack up with a dealer..."
Parahumans,3ctox4,medved847,3,Fri Jul 10 19:27:00 2015 UTC,"I dont think they go to him of their own accord any more than the police officer who Cherish forced to kill himself did so of his own accord. Plus, any cult like devotion probably isnt the result of any natural charisma. The whole point of his power is that he doesn't need any charisma. He can induce devotion like flicking on a light switch."
Parahumans,3ctox4,medved847,2,Fri Jul 10 19:30:56 2015 UTC,True but it IS mentioned that he's fairly attractive as well as being a rat bastard. The point is he physically addicts women using his power and then they voluntarily go with him when he goes to leave (because they can't feel good otherwise...)
Parahumans,3ctox4,GreatWyrmGold,3,Fri Jul 10 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like the light switch metaphor is more apt than the drug addiction one. Alec mentions that HB once hit him with pants-shitting levels of terror and then just didn't turn it off for a long period of time. This suggests he can induce an emotional state and make it constant without continuous application of his power.  Interlude 10: ""Father had taken two or three seconds to assess the situation before using his power on Alec, his two sisters and the ‘girl’ with a hand over Alec’s mouth.  He hit each of them with stark terror...Between that summer and Christmas, Alec hadn’t opened his mouth to speak once.""  It could have been that the memory of the terror kept Alec quiet, but I interpreted it to mean that HB just left the ""terror switch"" on for a long ass time because he's a psycho."
Parahumans,3ctox4,medved847,2,Fri Jul 10 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"both are apt, I just mentioned that he operates in the small scale and creates addicts"

Parahumans,3cpq66,AWorldW-OShrimp,2,Fri Jul 10 04:40:29 2015 UTC,Me too. Especially because he's said that a lot of the pacing problems of the second half of the story will be dealt with.

I doubt he'd have to change much to make that impression explicit. Just give her a few extra weeks of downtime dealing with her territory. Some more quiet time hanging with the Undersiders early on. Really, just a few mentions that the offscreen time is a bit longer than the current version has it.  Plus maybe space out the endbringer schedule a little. (and I still think that cutting the two new endbringers is a good idea, even if it means the loss of a really neat reveal/cliffhanger.

Parahumans,3cpq66,ricree,4,Sat Jul 11 05:49:00 2015 UTC,I think waiting for the edit of Worm (or at least the first book) for a wider AMA would probably give you the most bang for your buck.

Also in general I think there is a lot of weird romantic tension between some female character's just sorta under the surface. I'll be quite honest in saying that I honestly thought Wildbow was a lesbian female when I first read Worm."
Parahumans,3cpq66,Tabdaprecog,9,Fri Jul 10 02:11:55 2015 UTC,"While we're being honest about Wildbow identity theories, I kinda wondered if he had a period fetish for a while. Mostly because Worm was the first book I read where the main character's menstrual cycle is discussed in any way, and then Maggie Holt passively mentions hers in Pact.  Then I realized that it was mostly projecting, and just because I get off on things like eyebrows and belly buttons doesn't mean that everyone is some sort of sexual deviant."
Parahumans,3cpq66,yuloforce,5,Fri Jul 10 02:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, im a dude and i didnt see anything about periods in Wildbows writing that made me raise an eyebrow. Although i have two sisters and female cousin that lived with me for a while, so i might be used to hearing about periods more than most guys.  Also, think about it from the other way. If wildbow had a female protag for a story that long and not mention periods then there would have been people calling bullshit"
Parahumans,3cpq66,Vaikusin,2,Fri Jul 10 12:51:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. Get to a level of openness with a member of the two x club and you start understanding that women's bodies are a fucking warzone.

I wouldn't say it's all your fault, it takes a special type of writing to make you think of the author as a lesbian or that they have a period fetish. I know of one other famous sci fi author who is obviously a very creepy old gay dude."
Parahumans,3cpq66,Tabdaprecog,4,Fri Jul 10 04:08:39 2015 UTC,Who are you talking about?
Parahumans,3cpq66,bliow,2,Fri Jul 10 04:44:53 2015 UTC,"The sci fi author who is a creepy old gay dude? Samuel Delany. Obvious as shit if you've read the right books by him. Dhalgren for one even if it is a great book. Weird gay sex all over the place. One sex scene that's basically a threesome between two guys and a women dp'ing her. One dude is gay (the other dude had relations with him) and in the sex scene the male character's are explicitly describing ""feeling"" the other guy... Sorry to be explicit but you sorta asked.  I invite you to read the plot summary for Hogg, another of his books that by all accounts I've seen is just porn. He's a good writer, maybe one of the best, but damn if he isn't one creepy old gay dude."
Parahumans,3cpq66,Tabdaprecog,2,Fri Jul 10 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"Sure that's fairly explicit for a book, but why does it make him creepy? Is he creepy because of how explicit it is? Other authors write about sex sometimes, though not usually so explicit, and they don't get called creepy.   Edit: After looking the author up and reading for a bit, I think I understand. He has a LOT of VERY explicit things. And they aren't just vanilla sex acts. It's some crazy stuff. Some gross stuff. Him being gay has nothing to do with his creepiness, which is where I was confused before on your post. It's just the stuff he writes about. Wow. That's explicit."
Parahumans,3cpq66,Ignis_ex,2,Sat Jul 11 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for being confusing. Yea some of it does seem very explicit. Maybe not in the book I read as much but that still had gangrape, prostitution of sorts, and other stuff that is out of my comfort zone for what I expect out of standard literature. Obviously some of his stuff is seriously not standard literature by any means."
Parahumans,3cpq66,Tabdaprecog,3,Sat Jul 11 16:50:39 2015 UTC,Also in general I think there is a lot of weird romantic tension between some female character's just sorta under the surface.   That's true for everything ever. (It's weird because it's not supposed to be there.)

Parahumans,3cpq66,Tabdaprecog,4,Fri Jul 10 16:40:01 2015 UTC,Eh I think it's very high in presence in Worm.   I believe someone is missing the point.  I'm pretty sure that you're just reading too much into friendships...much like the aforementioned everything ever.
Parahumans,3cpq66,GreatWyrmGold,4,Fri Jul 10 19:42:38 2015 UTC,I have no doubt that I am. Believable friendships in literature are very rare. Ones where the character's are really natural friends and you can tell it. Wildbow does a hell of a good job of it which makes scum like me get ideas.

Dates don't have to lead to sex or even kissing. Take those out, and dating isn't that different then hanging out with a friend. So why not ""date"" someone of the same sex? Just make it clear its not going to lead to anything."

It's right after the flashback portion of the interlude, he briefly thinks about how they dated for a little bit, but they grew apart.  He then reflects that he's glad she's not going to be there.  While I know that it's just the sorts of thoughts that go through your head when you're going to face an Endbringer, still.  I kinda wish that after that he would have reached out to her more, tried to reforge that connection.  Maybe after Gold Morning, they hooked up.  It's silly, but again, hopeless romantic."

By far one of my favorite moments from all of the audiobook chapters thus far is Colin's monolgue in 11.D where he's bitching out Mannequin.  I had a friend of mine who is a marine do it and while the rest of the chapter is pretty okay, the monologue he freaking NAILED (he's very good at being angry :P)."

Keep in mind these are PRT ratings, so not a reflection of power, just a reflection of conflict protocol. I'll include what I remember from the document about triggers.   Thinker 3, Stranger 5. Thinker powers come from an intense short-term/recent mental problem that can't be solved. Breakers (what that Stranger power is) come from nebulous types of danger, neither specifically mental or physical.   Shaker 6, Brute/Striker 5. Shakers come from environmental dangers, and Shaker is how I would define that power.   Shaker 7.   Changer 6. Changers come from issues with body image, either because of societal expectations or personal issues with one's body.   Blaster 6. Blasters are danger from far away.   Blaster/Shaker 4, Brute 3. I call this a Shaker power, but if you can figure out how to make it come from a Blaster feel free.   Changer/Blaster 4. This is a Changer power.   I would review the triggers a bit. Most of them seem to be isolation or losing all social ties, which usually makes Master class capes. I can give specific critiques when I get home in a few hours."

Cape Name: Memoir  Civ Name: Keith Carter  Appearance uncaped: A small, redheaded awkward looking man. Despite nearing thirty years old Keith looks no older than a kid in his early twenties. His most defining features (to those he lets remember him) are his large brown eyes; framed by small round glasses.  Caped Appearance: Memoir is rarely remembered, but in fear of the day his power is ineffective he has a variety of suits hinting at different powers with the only unifying feature the insignia of a brain in a crosshair.  Orange Suit: Orange skin tight costume, tailor made to give Keith the appearance of a much taller and physically imposing man. The intended result of this costume is for any capes remembering memoir to consider him a pyrokinetic.  White Suit: A suit crafted for awe and protection; this suit is a base of armor with long flowing streams of blue. Standing stationary the streamers form a cape, but while on the move Memoir is a whir of blue and white. This is memoirs only ""battle suit"" in that it offers protection and some slight advantage. The belt of this suit contains multiple types of grenade.  Black Suit: Used to hide, blend in, or otherwise not be noticed. This suit is intended ot be worn under clothing and revelaed when necesarry, so that should his power fail him MEmoir can still pass unnoticed. Even when Memoir is wearing this suit and nothing over it, he can pass for a non cape wearing dark clothing, until someone gets close enough to notice the seemingly empty hood. (An SFX trick from Keith's old day job)  Power: Memoir has the ability to delete, edit or create false memories with seemingly no limit aside form proximity. All that is needed is for Keith to see the target - whether it be through scope or livefeed. After triggering he spent a long afternoon altering his ex-wife's memoriy on live TV. Forcing the news anchor to forget words, how to read, even reporting completely false statistics.  Due to his power Keith has no job, yet more money than he can spend. He also has a nice house in a quiet area and almost nobody has had anything to say about his gross misuse of his power; because unless he wants someone to - they have no idea who he or memoir are.  On the rare occasion he forgets to wipe a bank's security footage, the cape who politely asked the bank to give him money is unknown; and after watching the local protectorate appeal for witnesses on the TV nobody ever remembers memoir.  It's a lonely, unfufilling life - but memoir has food on his table, a home and most importantly nobody telling him what to do.  Until a giant robot abducted him and told him Leviathan was coming.  Objectives: Flee Brockton Bay/Survive Leviathan."

Parahumans,3cmwds,Gnimhey,3,Thu Jul 9 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and go with the most common male name: Michael, ""Who is like God?""  Hmmm.  Let's say he was near a good group of capes when he triggered, for shits and giggles.  A grab-bag of minor powers, probably a cape who focused on the minor ones, never realizing what his true power is.  Brute 1, Mover 1, Master 2, Shaker 4, Thinker 2.  He radiates an aura similar to Glory Girl's, one that affects people depending on his mood.  When happy, people around him are peaceful.  When feeling heroic (which he often does when going into battle) he radiates awe.  When he gets angry or frustrated, it's a fear aura.  With the Mover, he can jump good.  With the Thinker, he can hear when people discuss him within a certain radius.  With the Brute, he heals more quickly when he rests and focuses on his wounds.  With the Shaker, he can create illuminated areas that deal damage and disrupt electrical devices.  The damage starts off small but builds up quickly the longer that he has focus on the area.  Does no direct damage to living creatures due to the Manton effect, but can do indirect damage due to temperature changes and environmental destruction.  He focuses on martial arts and his non-Shaker powers in combat for the most part due to the difficulty in keeping a person within the radius for the ten seconds it takes to start doing noticeable damage to the human target.  It is suspected that he releases low-yield plasma streams within the area of effect of his Shaker powers.  Has a Tinker-made stun-sword that can burst into illusionary flames to help him seem more imposing/frightening to enemies.  Large ham in dangerous situations, but rather quiet and almost shy when not dealing with the public.  I'd do my name, but...  nah.  I'm not too keen on sharing, and I've never even found the actual meaning of it."
Parahumans,3cmwds,ErrantVagrant,2,Thu Jul 9 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"Tyler, meaning door keeper of an inn, at least according to wikipedia. Could also have been derived from 'Tiler'.  I'm guessing some kind of shaker power."
Parahumans,3cmwds,WAAAGH_intern,2,Thu Jul 9 15:44:10 2015 UTC,"Points for whoever figures out where I'm getting these names.  Blake: As folks who read Pact know, this can mean ""black"" (through Old English 'blaek') or ""white"" (through 'blahc,' also Old English). This duality makes me think of a Master power involving splitting oneself into two, one darker and one paler. Possibly each would have a different secondary power.  (Okay, technically it's ""pale,"" not ""white"".)  Jean: Means ""God is gracious"". Strikes me as something like Shamrock's power, or possibly a restricted, unconscious Contessa.  Nora: A contracted form of names which can mean ""honor"" or ""light"". Perhaps low-level Brute powers combined with the ability to make a hard-light sphere around herself and someone else, allowing duels.  Pyrrhus: Given the most famous bearer of the name, I'd say this would basically be a Thinker like Accord, with a shard-relationship like Leet.  Ren: Means ""lotus"" or ""love"" in Japanese. I'm thinking a scent-based Master, possibly via a restricted bio-tinker power.  Ruby: Obviously refers to the gem. There are many possibilities, but I'll go with the obvious-choice-Changer/Brute power because I haven't made a Changer here yet.  Weiss: Means ""white"". A lot of things are white; this could go a lot of ways. I'm thinking of a Shaker who slowly infects an area, like Labyrinth; unlike Labyrinth, her power is relatively controlled, though less flexible and requiring concentration to grow. The area has a lot of ""smoothing"" going on, as well as losing color and growing pale. Sufficiently smooth surfaces can have angular constructions drawn from them. These effects fade after Weiss is removed from the area.  Yang: Means ""Sun"". I'm pretty sure we already have one of those..."

Parahumans,3cii6e,VishnuG,25,Wed Jul 8 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"Number Man seems to have both a perception aspect and calculation aspect to his thinker power. Most likely his power takes everything he perceives and than number crunches it. That is to say his shard is intertwined with his perceptions and his brain, not just one. Somewhat similar to when Tattletale looks at things she gets a running commentary.  For Doormaker we can't be sure about the specifics as we only have two examples; him and Eidolon. Shards and Entities seem to have wells of massive, but limited power. Scion occasionally mentioned how much he had left or how much some of his powers cost him in terms of energy/lifespan. One of the objectives of the cycle was havesting energy. Khepri most likely overworked Doormaker's shard when she had thousands of portals opening and closing in quick succession over an extended period of time. Literally burning through massive amounts of energy. The shard couldn't keep up.   For Glasitig Uaine, Panacea gets a feel for how her shard works when they shake hands.   “No,” Amelia replied.  “I saw her physiology when I touched her.  I couldn’t see what she sees, but I see how she’s carrying them inside her, drawing an energy from them.  And there were three more, just beside her, and she was using that energy to feed them… but they weren’t active?”   She could have either fed Doormaker's shard with her own or with any number of other capes she claimed.   For Leviathan, all Endbringers have redundant biology. They don't use their eyes, their 'skeletons' and flesh are decorative with only their cores being of any significant importance. The only exceptions are ones that need limbs to move which makes there appendages fairly important. This is amplified in Leviathan's case because of his speed based nature, he should look like he can move fast. Endbringers are artificial and should look it. A mockery of life.   Most of this is my interpretation and is probably not 100% accurate."
Parahumans,3cii6e,Rillet,4,Wed Jul 8 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, makes sense. I agree with you on the decorative part so it shouldn't matter too much what he looks like, but I basically want to create a version of him as close as possible, to the canon. It's cool enough that wildbow replied to give me his feedback so I want to put it to use. What do you think he meant by pronounced joints?"
Parahumans,3cii6e,MemeInBlack,7,Wed Jul 8 09:47:56 2015 UTC,"I imagine large, bulbous joints, something like Niven's Pak Protector:  http://www.technovelgy.com/graphics/content09/Protector-Niven.jpg  or a deep sea diving suit:  http://www.history.navy.mil/museums/keyport/SkinThey'reIn/Photos/JIMsuit.jpg"
Parahumans,3cii6e,MemeInBlack,5,Wed Jul 8 13:35:23 2015 UTC,I was thinking along the lines of a panther since he runs on all fours. The issue is that it would make him less humanoid.
Parahumans,3cii6e,Lethalmud,4,Wed Jul 8 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe wildbow just meant joints that are bent/don't straighten completely. Although I thought he wasn't supposed to look too humanoid anyway."

Parahumans,3cii6e,GreatWyrmGold,10,Wed Jul 8 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"I can tackle the questions with some headcannon/semi-cannon answers.   Number man's shard can see the current values for all properties on all objects in his eyesight. Number man asks his shard for an answer and if his shard can calculate the answer it does so. If a mathematical answer does not exist it gives a probability and if an answer simply does not exist (Like a number man version of 1/0) it doesn't give him everything. Number man only sees the values that are pertinent, are the values that he is actively looking for, or are a part of a question he's asking his shard.  On Door maker. It seemed like his well really had run dry. We never saw him fatigue like that while he was shuttling capes around the globe under Cauldron's orders. When Khepri took control of him the fact that he couldn't open another portal gives the idea that his well had run dry credence. Why did he work with Glaistig? She has her own well to power her capes with. It would have to be larger than an average pool to power all of her capes, but when she uses doormaker (or any cape really) it is pulling from her own well."
Parahumans,3cii6e,Tsegen,4,Wed Jul 8 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"Moving on to power wells: Did the doormaker's well really run out or was it more like a fatigue/burn out as in 'do sets until your muscles can't do more'?   It really and truly ran out.   Because GU was able to use his shard just fine or was that a copy of the shard?   Allright, this is somewhat conjectural, but I think she was able to use Doormaker's shard because her ""true"" shard (the Harvesting shard) was alive and full of power. So it just plugged into Doormaker's shard and topped off it's batteries, so to speak.   Also, is it possible for natural triggers to run out?   I don't see how they could not run out. The Entities were never able to solve the problem of heat death and entropy, so that means they only have a finite amount of usable energy to work with.  But (conjecture incoming again), I wouldn't be surprised if natural triggers were ""better maintained"" than the Cauldron triggers. Cauldron capes run on ""dead"" shards which were literally ripped out of Eden's corpse, whereas the natural triggers were set up with the oversight of the Entities. Natural triggers might be plugged into a cosmic power plant, so to speak."

Parahumans,3caipe,Rillet,2,Mon Jul 6 21:28:10 2015 UTC,"""alternative possible future Grey Boy so none could be subbed in.""  Your first explanation works. The second is fanon.   Foil's power doesn't affect future in any special way. The text is clear on this point. Foil's power is special in the case of Grey Boy because it:   penetrates all defenses disrupts connections to shards through its multidimensional nature.   It doesn't affect 'possible future versions of Gray Boy'.  It kills him-- this is easy to do. It disrupts the connection of his power to Gray Boy-- this is the HARD part. This is the part that makes Foil dangerous to Scion.   Re-read that part of the S9 showdown from scion's perspective and a little bit of Khepri's perspective when she's using Foil."

Parahumans,3c981b,Littlerob,30,Mon Jul 6 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"Worm is not consistent with the standard parallel universe model described by Everett, Wheeler, and Graham.  Splits in the Wormverse seem to happen rarely. Large events aren't the cause of the split, they're just things that happened differently after the split. The cause of the split is unexplained. It may have happened decades before 9/11, that's just the first major event that's noticeably different.  What causes the splits? That's not something we have enough information to divine. I suspect time travelers."
Parahumans,3c981b,ArgentStonecutter,11,Mon Jul 6 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"In the sense of how powers interact with them, yes, this is the case.  You tell the shards, 'to make this all make sense, we're working with the following realities.  Everything else is blocked off and serve as landing points for shards.  Since the powers can't and won't interact with realities on the whitelist, the shards are thus impossible to reach and destroy for those off that world... and those on the world just don't have the firepower or effectiveness to really handle the shard, if the reality is occupied at all."
Parahumans,3c981b,Wildbow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:20:39 2015 UTC,"Is every reality that can't be accessed consumed by a shard? So even though most realities are blocked off, the cycle still destroys the world across all of them."

From Scion's interlude  ""With each statement, they each catalogue the realities.  Similar realities are included together, for both the entities and the shards.  Too many complications and confusions arise when interacting with worlds that are exceedingly similar.  Not an effective form of conflict, when it is the same lessons learned over and over again.  It is better to connect them into groupings, limit exposure to each set of worlds.  One shard is capable of settling in a grouping of near-identical worlds, drawing energy from all of those worlds at once.""  Scion and Eden block off their fueling realities, where their shards are drawing energy. They then limit their host selection mostly to one specific reality, instead of several, since some realities are too similar to provide different data. There's no mention of destroying or collapsing or combining realities."

Parahumans,3c981b,gardenofjew,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that the Entities appear to be outside the splits, or incapable of accessing the splits containing their alternate selves."
Parahumans,3c981b,Vivalapapa,13,Mon Jul 6 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"It may not be actually ""splitting"", in the sense of creating a new universe where X happened instead of Y. It could be that the number of Universes is constant, the same as since the beginning of time, and things simply happen slightly differently in each one. That would explain how the entities would be able to run out of alternate universes to consume (and gives you an idea of their sheer scale).   It's a subtle difference, but it avoids the Scion thing, as there is no ""splitting"" for Scion to prevent, simply a universe where he showed up that is unique. It also solves the pancake/bacon dilemma, as due to the unspeakably-high-but-not-infinite of alternate universes and the butterfly effect, with a near infinite amount of time after your breakfast in which to produce repercussions, not even your choice of foods is trivial. In fact, since the choices we make are influenced by our experiences and environment, the event that made that universe distinct was probably so small as to be unnoticeable, and happened long ago. There would also be a number of universes where the exact same thing happened, waiting for later points of divergence.  Not sure if any of that makes sense, but alternate universes rarely do."
Parahumans,3c981b,LexiconWrought,14,Tue Jul 7 05:48:49 2015 UTC,"The long and short of it is that we don't know how the Worm multiverse works. It doesn't seem to operate on standard multiverse theory, where each possible decision produces a new universe for every outcome, but we don't really know anything beyond that.    Warning: what comes beyond this point is headcanon and should not be taken as anything more.  To me, at least, it seems like there have been a relatively fixed number of parallel universes from the beginning (see interlude 26 and the ""more realities than there were particles in a given universe) and what we call ""splits"" like when Aleph diverged from Bet are simply times when things in the different universes stopped happening the same. They were always separate universes, neither one was a branch of the other, it's just up until the appearance of Scion the events in them had closely enough paralleled each other that they were functionally identical. Such a thing would be astronomically improbable, but with 1080 or more universes to choose from, that's okay."
Parahumans,3c981b,Whispersilk,5,Tue Jul 7 06:36:54 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Worm multiverse has a constant or decreasing number of universes, otherwise entropy does not exist and the Entities have no problems."
Parahumans,3c981b,Protikon,2,Tue Jul 7 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"We like other theories put forward, but my buddy and I would like to propose another one.  WARNING:  There may be the use of the word ""Quantum.""  You can start crying now.  Why, yes, there are infinite universes.  They're constantly being created...  and destroyed.  Much like virtual particles, they are formed into being by possibility, and then destroyed in order to solve the issue of conservation of energy.  The equation balances once again, quantum mechanics is satisfied, and the universe continues on honky dory.  Yay, issue done!  ...More?  Okay.  Let's look back at virtual particles.  Two particles are created and then destroyed in order to keep the equation satisfied.  During their (admittedly brief) existence, they can interact with other particles or aspects of the universe.  This is how we know they exist.  Yay, answer done, now we can...  What?  OH FINE.  Sheesh.  Okay.  You all with me so far?  Let's ask one important question about virtual particles:  What happens if one gets caught by a black hole?  Well, that whole conservation of matter thing can get temporarily violated by quantum physics, but the equation still needs to be satisfied somehow.  It basically starts a degradation of the black hole as energy is siphoned off in order to satisfy the energy requirement.  Now, the Entities have somehow developed the ability to slip between dimensions.  Ignoring the energy requirements to do so, this would have an obvious effect on another dimension's ability to recombine and balance that whole equation again.  This relates back into a bunch of things that are hard to explain, like how perception affects reality and a bunch of other stuff that quite frankly make my eyes glaze over whenever my buddy starts talking about them.  By observing, perceiving, and occupying these realities, they essentially force them to stabilize.  We'll ignore where they get their own energy to exist from; we'll say that it has to do with the lack of little bangs what with the expansion of the universe or something.  Yes, that sounds nice.  It's complicated and hard and I'm not the one who understands this junk, I'm doing the best I can.  So now there isn't so much of ""infinite realities"" as ""infinite temporary realities and finite actual realities.""  Now, within these finite realities there's going to be variance.  Things aren't going to pan out the same, even across far distances, due to the quantum changes.  (Don't quote me on the quantum part.)  Now, think back to the Entities before they left their home planet.  That's a lot of realities that they actualized, with many more being actualized.  Over time (millions or maybe billions of years) they've been doing this.  So let's look at Earth.  Some realities are close, probably due to being actualized close to each other.  (Earth Aleph.)  Some are further apart, despite being similar.  (Shamrock's Earth.)  We can assume that Entities don't go skipping willy-nilly.  Perhaps that's why Professor Haywire tapped into Aleph so easily -- the path of least resistance.  This would also explain how Scion would be able to deposit shards in realities without first scouring them of humanity, thereby knowing the joy of destruction.  Humanity (or perhaps even complex life) never evolved on these Earths.  Or maybe were wiped out by disease.  Or whatever.  ...Now he's fucking talking about the possibility of localized alternate realities and fuck that shit.  I'm gonna distract him with XCOM.  (Also, the downside to long posts is nobody comments on them.)"

Parahumans,3c981b,GreatWyrmGold,2,Mon Jul 6 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"The reason that there is only one Zion, one Eden, one Abaddon, is that entities began crossing universes before becoming spacefaring and subsumed all different instances of each other.

Then, as they retreat to individual worlds to mend and restore themselves, the prey will multiply, and there will be a span of feasting for those lucky enough to survive.   With that, the process will begin anew.  The same things will occur.  This has happened no less than one hundred and seventy times, with little variation.  Each time it occurs, realities are left dead, the grace period before resources run out once again is shorter.  That the number of worlds exceed the number of particles that might exist in one world’s universe is inconsequential; the creatures multiply exponentially."
Parahumans,3c981b,ProperAttorney,2,Mon Jul 6 12:23:02 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting question and theory. Are there multiple versions of Scion that are inaccessible to each other?

Parahumans,3c981b,locallyunscene,2,Mon Jul 6 05:59:15 2015 UTC,"There is no indication that Worm multiverse theory has anything to do with current physical theories of multiverse. If you read the story carefully you'd note that there are a huge but finite amount of realities, some of which are very similar (Aleph and Bet), and and some of which are very different (barren planets with no life).   It so happens that the entities somehow developed the ability to move through different realities while on their home planet. They then use this ability, along with centuries/millenia/? of technologicald evelopment through host/shard cycles, to become the entities of Worm!Earth.  There is ZERO indication of a branching multiverse-- in fact, a ton of evidence against it given that one of the primary concerns of the Worms is that they're eventually going to run out of energy/space/etc., which obviously wouldn't be a concern for a branching multiverse."
Parahumans,3c981b,gardenofjew,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"Parahumans (and entities) have the ability to move between parallel universes It is stated several times that the more divergent two universes are, the easier it is to move between them Scion exists in only one universe at a time (as is implied by the text) There are a finite number of parallel realities (as is implied by the entities' interludes)   I would conclude that parallel universes in Worm are similar to trees, with well-defined splitting points that lead into separate realities. The reason two adjacent realities are hard to connect is because the two are still in the ""budding"" process, where they split apart. The further along that budding gets, the more well-defined the two realities are, until they become completely separate.   We don't know yet what causes the budding, but simple decisions aren't enough to do it. Or perhaps they are, but the budding process never completes, and the two potential universes fuse back together into one. Scion's presence isn't enough to cause a bud, but something did happen just before he appeared, which caused the split between Earth Aleph and Bet.  The rules for isolating a reality are also unclear. Teacher uses a device to do it, and Scion has some method of keeping himself safe, but we don't know if the two are the same. Teacher's isolation method could be as simple as closing off any portals leading to his reality, which makes it incredibly difficult to find again, similar to tuning a radio to the same frequency if the dial has no numbers and you don't know where it was before. Scion's method in part is a mental block. The shard's won't provide information on how to access the reality where his real body is."

Parahumans,3c8m8y,ix_Omega,13,Sun Jul 5 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"(Taking some liberties with the parameters, first and foremost I'm making a roster that changes over the team's history)  The Olympians!  Zeus: A powerful shaker with the ability to control the weather, summoning winds, rain, and even the unstoppable lightning bolt!  He's the Olympians' clever and charismatic leader, and possesses what could be called an infallible tactical genius.  But he is also plagued by arrogance and egocentrism, enough to challenge even the steadfast loyalty of his teammates.  Hera: An empathic master with the ability to sense and manipulate people's feelings for each other.  Enemies beware when this vicious heroine slices at the throat of your team by challenging its allegiances.  The Olympians' second-in-command is fickle and can be spiteful, but she is proud and loyal to the last.  Athena: With a power for all occasions this thinker is the best of brains and brawn.  Her power to analyze any situation at nearly ten thousand times the speed of a normal human, coupled with her tireless training and custom-made arms and armor make her a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield and off.  Coupled with her furiously meticulous personality, she's sagacious beyond human limits.  Has a cool motorcycle and a spear and shield.  Poseidon: A compliment to Zeus, this shaker's power lets him control the sea.  Specifically he can marco-kinetically control any large volume of water.  This makes him a powerful opponent anywhere near a body of water or even a building with plumbing, but it also lets him create precise mini-earthquakes by moving underground reservoirs.  He is haughty and slightly resentfully that he's low in the command-chain, but he understands why who's in charge is in charge.  At least, he used to.  He recently left the team along with Demeter due to ""artistic differences"" with team leadership.  Has a cool motorcycle and a trident.  Demeter: A striker with power over metabolism, Demeter is capable of keeping her own team fed and rested without having to eat or sleep, and can plague her enemies with starvation and exhaustion.  She is a rare striker who does not need direct contact, but only close proximity, to use her power on a target.  She also has the greenest of thumbs, and is able to literally grow any plant out of the palm of her hand.  She is strong-willed and has a very specific vision of what they world ought to be.  Recently left the team along with Poseidon due to ""artistic differences"" with team leadership.  Apollo: The younger of the Olympians' blaster twins, Apollo has the ability to manifest arrows of splendid light that deliver any of a number of effects to the target, some of which are stunning, setting afire, concussively knocking, purging of infection, infecting in the first place, or illuminating.  This hero is sly and charming, and considers himself more an artist than a superhero (although he spends a great deal more time fighting crime than making art).  Uses a golden bow to fire his arrows.  Artemis: The elder of the Olympians' blaster twins, Artemis has the ability to manifest arrows of splendid light that work basically like regular arrows and create puncture wounds.  These wounds do disappear rapidly when exposed to open air, however.  And they always seem to find their target, much like the arrows of her brother.  Unlike her gregarious brother, however, Artemis is not fond of strangers and prefers to keep to herself and her gaggle of close friends.  Uses a silver bow to fire her arrows.  Ares: Ares has super-strength and invulnerability and no one likes him.  Has a sword and shield.  Aphrodite: Possessing one of the most peculiar powers even on a team as peculiar as the Olympians, Aphrodite is surrounded by an aura of love, causing those around her to feel more loving in general when it is unfocused, but which can also have specific effects such as making others feel love for her, making others love whatever individuals they are currently thinking of, or even making others yearn for love in general.  All of these effects fade slowly once the target leaves Aphrodite's aura.  She is a genuinely loving person, but is resentful that her power makes people treat her specially.  She likes Ares because he's such a jerk that when he's in the love aura he just acts like a regular person.  Hephaestus: The tinker behind most of the Olympians' equipment, specializing in making Archaic technology that functions far beyond modern equivalents.  Was originally a fighting member of the team, but had a ""falling out"" with Hera early in the team's history that resulted in him leaving the team and receiving a permanent spinal injury which prevented him from walking properly.  Upon returning to the team, he was relegated to support, his position in the Twelve taken by Dionysus.  Used a hammer when he fought.  Hermes: This mover (via breaker) has the curious ability to move thousands of times faster than a normal human being, but still have physics act on him as if he is moving at a normal human speed.  As such, he is capable of moving with great precision at a timescale unimaginable to normal humans.  With the additional use of his sandals, which afford him flight, Hermes puts his cunning and deceptive personality to work, manipulating the world around him at nearly lighting-speed to give the good guys the advantage, or to be funny.  Uses a scepter (same design as his sandals) to stabilize his flight, and to help him deliver his trademark Mach Nine Punch.  Hestia: While Hestia's interesting power has certainly become a trademark of the Olympians (for who could imagine the team without the trump-given ability to shape-shift into animals?), her true value has always been as the lynchpin member of the groups.  The meekest member of the Olympians is uniquely able to untie the knot of clashing personalities that exists here, and bring them together for the common good.  Though she was originally a fighting member of the team, she quickly decided to move to a support role, with her position in the Twelve being filled by Heracles.  Everyone likes her but Ares, the slimeball.  Dionysus: The first new addition to the team as a replacement for Hephaestus, Dionysus brings some mystery to the party with the ability to enter and exit his own parallel world at will.  This allows him to disappear and reappear elsewhere, approximating slow teleportation.  More importantly, the parallel world constantly stores a backup copy of him, so if he receives a moral wound in the real world, even if his body is destroyed completely, what's left of him will disappear and he will return in full health.  Dionysus seems to have been affected by his power, though.  He is eccentric and detached.  He can take others into his world, with their consent.  Their powers will not work there, and the experience seems impossible to describe.  Heracles: The second addition to the team, taking over Hestia's combat role, Heracles's skin-deep telekinesis gives him effective super-strength and immunity to physical injury.  He's proud and kind, but profoundly troubled by his mental illness and sordid past.  Before his joining the Olympians, Heracles's life was a series of one horrible situation after another, so he truly loves his team, and is proud of his role in society as a protector of the innocent.  Carries an indestructible club to help with smack-downs.  Hades: Even when this stranger isn't invisible, it's all but impossible to read him.  The enigmatic master of shadows has one foot in this world, and one foot in another.  This quiet specter makes his enemies, and sometimes even his friends, feel as if haunted by their pasts, and by those they have left behind, almost as if he brings out the ghosts within us.  Or maybe he can just turn invisible and knows how to milk a crummy power.  He and Persephone replaced Poseidon and Demeter recently on the team.  Persephone: While not as eerie as her nearly unseen partner, Persephone inspires nearly as much fear.  Her touch can inspire life, and take it.  This striker power allows her either super-charge all of the biological processes in an organism and provide them with all of the needed substrates, or dampen them all and sap the materials they need.  The prior can bring a living thing back from the brink of death, and is practically a trump power in how strong it makes the things she uses it on.  The latter can fully incapacitate nearly any living being, and when used at its peak power, can kill instantly.  To sum up Persephone's personality, she would never kill a person without good cause, but she is content in the knowledge that most of the people around her are wary of getting close to her anyway.  She and Hades replaced Demeter and Poseidon recently on the team."

Poseidon is a Blaster 5/Shaker 3, he is a talented hyrdokinetic who usually uses this water to create microquakes by shifting the liquids within things to weaken his surroundings. Demeter is a shaker 7, she can create a place similar to a Demese in any location, the exact powers vary but they usually dampen powers and can be manipulated freely by her. Athena and Ares are a Striker4/Thinker5 and a Brute3/Striker6 respectively they are both frontline fighters but Athena is tactical while Ares is not as such. Athena uses her powers to attack weaknesses with pinpoint accuracy, her thinker power is similar to TT's except it only shows potential weakpoints, her striker power is a resonant strike, capable of punching through metal and stone but not flesh. Ares is a fairly low level brute, his bronzelike skin is proof against most mundane attacks but his true strength is with his mastery of traditional european weaponry, his power enhances them to the point where his axe cuts down police cars and his club can break open a reinforced vault. Apollo and Artemis are both movers, Artemis is a mover 4, she is always aware of the nearest ""wilderness"" and is capable of taking a group there in a single step. She is also a Brute and a Blaster, similar to Butcher, she carries a bow that is beyond most people to draw back but fires arrows made of ""moonlight"" a coherent energy that she only manefests as an arrow. Apollo's mover power is a bit more general he can teleport to the observable horizon or anywhere within that range, but only when the sun is up. He is also a Minor precog thinker but can only issue his predictions in the form of cryptic poetry. He also has a point blank range sunburst, that triggers when he teleports, which gives him a blaster rating as well. Hermes is a speedster, mover7 but cannot bring anyone with him.

Athena – a Thinker/Trump who can connect two parahumans to her “webs.” Once they are connected, she can use their powers in weaker but more creative ways. Those connected to her webs are still able to use their own powers, but also in weaker forms. She understands parahuman abilities better than most experts. She likes the others well enough, but only hangs around to get a better understanding of parahuman abilities and experiment with her own. Apollo – a Mover-Blaster mix. He can fly at increasing speeds (sacrificing control) before turning into a bolt of light and exploding at his target. Sort of a combative version of Legend’s flight. A young, cocky wildcard who loves the group and using his powers in a fight Artemis – a Striker who can transform inanimate objects into a hardlight form. These objects then lose a huge amount of weight and ungainliness while gaining durability and cutting edge/etc. She sticks around for her brother, but also enjoys the company of Athena, whom she looks up to. The baby of the group Ares – a Brute-Breaker who can transform into a fiery flurry similar to Wanton. He has telekinetic and pyrokinetic abilities. In this form, he also gains power when he or those around him are in heightened degrees of stress. Once he transforms back into his normal body, he heals from most injuries. A bit like Crawler of the S9, he does not like the others but enjoys a good brawl, which the Pantheon can offer in plenty. Aphrodite – Master/Stranger. One of the most cruel members of the Pantheon, she uses her Stranger abilities to lull victims into a forced sense of security. She then ruthlessly digs them for information on their secret identities/loved ones and murders their families. Her Stranger power makes others less suspicious of her and leaves them still incautious for a period afterward. The others are extremely paranoid around her, but she doesn’t use her powers on them, as the members of the Pantheon don’t have much in the way of emotional connections (her M.O.) Hephaestus – a Shaker/Striker who can manipulate metal in the environment and cause metal to become insanely flammable. While not a loner, he’s a bit of an outcast as he is one of the Case 53’s – his body is a patchwork of flesh, metal, and volcanic rock. He also has extreme distaste for capes with families. He gets along well enough with Aphrodite, who doesn’t like him, but respects him for their similar ideologies. Hermes – a low level Stranger-Mover-Breaker who can stun or daze his enemies for a few seconds and turn intangible in order to run at super-speeds. He’s more of a smalltime thief than a supervillain, but relies on the Pantheon for protection. He and Apollo get along well. Hades – a Changer/Trump who can gradually gain more powers. He begins by gaining low Brute abilities which increase steadily. Then he gains Mover-Shaker abilities (traveling through the Earth). After that, he gains Master abilities (controlling corpses). Finally he gains Stranger abilities which cause those around him to have no memories except extreme pain and terror. He gains these powers at the cost of self control (and control of the abilities). They also balance out, weakening in some areas and strengthening in others. He is hated by almost the entire Pantheon, but has some sort of leverage over Zeus so that the leader does not revoke his membership.   Might throw in a few more later – I noticed there’s no Dionysus. I tried to take what I would choose for their powers, and then do something drastically different."

These toys seem hard to track down. Also, I'd suggest a kind of master rating. Maybe a 4?    So, I have an idea for a power:    A cape that can cause all loose objects in the area (if they have a certain level of durability) to start flying around at up to 20 mph. These loose objects are vaguely sentient, attacking enemies by slamming/diving into them, sometimes even setting traps or ambushes, without necessarily having the controller's knowledge or will for it to happen. They generally follow the controller's spoken orders, but can misunderstand.  The minimum size is approximately 3/4-of-a-thumb size, and the maximum size is a standing fan. Objects can be broken like normal, but if the pieces are still 3/4-of-a-thumb or bigger, that just means more minions. A favorite tactic of the objects is to slam themselves into things like bathtubs---to break of chunks, and to therefore have more minions.  This power effects knife-blades, some rocks, boulders, porcelain, harder wood-types, etc.  The only way to stop the minions is to break them all into pieces smaller than a thumb---hard to do----- or to somehow pull the controller out of range of his ability."

Triage (AKA Desperate Measures, AKA Unknown Quantity)  By touching a living thing, he can create create a form of bioarmor over his body.  The armor is composed entirely of what he touched, though minor alterations do occur.  For creatures, the skin thickens and bones form into plates over vital areas, and he gains increased strength from additional musculature.  Plants provide armor that focuses less on maneuverability and more on defense; using a tree to create the armor would make it extremely tough, but would make him very nearly immobile.  This armor can sustain him, at the cost of ""eating"" itself.  It interfaces directly with his mind, and offers a host of minor boons if created using animals -- blood filtering, produces antigens for any viruses the animal had, setting of bones, sealing wounds by covering them tightly, replenish blood (as the original animal's is altered to be a universal donor), etc.  If the power is used on a cape, he is able to use the former cape's powers for as long as the armor remains.  He can pass the armor to others by touching them while wearing it.  This includes the powers if granted by capes.  This transferred armor has a lifespan of about 30 minutes.  To extend it further, Triage must touch the armor again and recharge it with his power.  (He can subconsciously keep armor he wears continually charged.) When the effect wears off, it rapidly dissolves into nothingness.  Multiple living things can be turned into armor at once, with the effects stacking.  With enough animals absorbed into the armor, he can (in theory) violate the square cube law.  He has limited control over the appearance of the armor."

It was, since she had a very extreme nyctophobia (fear of darkness.)  Has the Thinker ability to manipulate her own senses, for a huge variety of effects. Some mundane examples:   Change her hearing to hear light instead of sound, thus able to ""see"" all around her. See shapes in different colors. If she is shown a page filled with digits, can make it so that she sees every seven as red color. Waldo can't hide from her! Linking her empathy with vision, allows her to see ""auras."" Sad people in one color, happy people in another. This is not emotion-reading. This is her own judgment, shown to her in color.   Less mundane applications include expanding her senses beyond human limits. Either in scope or in potency. Can also handicap herself if it's desirable.   Adjust her vision to see infrared, her hearing to hear ultrasound, or her touch to read in complete darkness (like Daredevil.) Restrain her vision to see only a certain hue of blue, or her sense of smell to detect only a specific odor. Useful to find some particular object. Limit her vision and hearing to become immune to a flashbang. Enhance her vision to see clearly in the night. Or her hearing to hear murmurs and private conversations. Adjust taste and smell to detect poison.   Extraordinary uses require previous training or special events:   Using a machine to show her magnetic forces, she learned to feel magnetism. This is not a separate sense, it must be linked to one of her existing ones. Either see magnetism, or hear magnetism, or taste magnetism... In one occasion, she was temporarily bestowed with a limited power to sense blood. Either because it was for a short time, or because it's too weird of a sense, she lost the blood-related ability. However, the sense itself remained: she calls it ""detect"", and can sense anything in a 10 feet radius. Can be used as clairvoyance, clairaudience or whatever, in that radius. Later in her career, she receives formal combat training. After she learns to anticipate attacks, she can link that to her vision, giving her a ""danger sense"" in hand-to-hand combat. Again, this is not some form of precognition, it's limited by her own combat ability.   More extraordinary uses of her power can induce a Thinker migraine if used too much."

I'd highly recommend the series, if you liked the smart use of powers in Worm."
Parahumans,3c61vd,DistaNVDT,3,Mon Jul 6 03:35:49 2015 UTC,"This is a concept I imagined while reading the last few arcs of Worm. I believe it's very strong, but has just as many downsides that would make it ""balanced"", so to speak.  The name would be Placebo but the character would use a different name since keeping the exact nature of his powers a secret would be beneficial.   It's a Trump with the following ability: He has access to all the powers that people around him (range ~100m ) BELIEVE he has access to.In other words, if a person within this range believes Placebo has X power, he will be able to use this power at will. To maximise the use of this power, he has a following of loyal ""fans"" that cheer him on from the sidelines.   He operates as a rogue, but is actively researched by the protectorate since his fanclub includes orphans that they would like to return to proper care, instead of having them grow up in proximity of what is, for all intents and purposes, a supervilain.     Some clarifications on the powers:   People have to believe he has a POWER, not some vague belief.  Ex.: If someone believes he's strong enough to kill an endbringer, he won't be able to do it since it doesn't qualify as a power. He won't get anything from this belief.  Ex.: If someone LITERALLY believes he's STRONG enough to kill an endbringer, he'll get super strength, but within reasonable parahuman bounds. He's NOT suddenly going to punch Leviathan into submission.  Ex.: If someone believes: ""His Ice power must be strong enough to kill an endbringer !"", he will have ACCESS to high level ice/water manipulation (akin to the Eidolon frozen walls for example), but wheter it is strong enough to kill an endbringer is up to debate and what he does with it. (and in the wormverse: the answer to that debate is always ""no, it's not strong enough."")  The belief system gives him access to powers, but they can't be forced upon him  Ex. If someone believes (an ennemy for example) that one of Placebo's powers is that his skin is made of paper or something, he can choose not to activate that possibility. It is, by the way, pretty hard to actually CONVINCE yourself he would have that (dis-)ability while you're fighting him, and VERY UNLIKELY if you don't know the specifics of his power.  He cannot convince himself he has any powers, because in a way, he knows what his power is, it is that ""placebo"" ability, and that belief gives him his Placebo ability, if that makes sense. He cannot, himself, pull powers from thin air.  Ex. No ""Well I'm in a cell but the joke's on you, I am actually intangible"", but if somehow his cell guard becomes convinced he has X ability that allows him to escape, he'll have access to it and escape. Again the rule 1, the cell guard can't just believe he has the possibility to escape, the guard will have to be convinced Placebo has X ability that allows him to do it.  He's limited to 1 ability per person. Since he has a following of multiple fans at every point, and they all believe he has a number of powers, they all get subconsciously assigned one ""belief"" that is ""theirs"".   The power that is ""theirs"" can change when new beliefs come in. Either they will lose ""their"" previous belief to replace it with the new one, or, if they don't believe it as hard (something something shards, passengers, interdimensional shenanigans), he won't get it. Ex. 10 people, 10 abilities. He convinces them he has an 11th one. Either one of them will unconsciously  (something something shards, passengers, interdimensional shenanigans) drop ""their"" previuos ability grant and grant him the new one, or none of the 10 will. They will now be 10 people believeing he has 11 abilities, and he'll have access to 10. if an 11th person comes in, and they tell him his 11 powers they know of, he'll now have access to all 11.  Another example:  Just some Shard/Passenger shenanigans to facilitate counting etc. For example. Imagine he'd have 7 followers cheering him on in a fight, but access to 6 powers. He has to keep the exact nature of his power secret from everyone, so his followers don't just cycle powers by themselves, they just watch their idol defending them, which in this case leaves him with 6 powers out of the possible maximum of 7. So a way he'll optimise this is to, in the middle of the fight, rile up his fans and say something like ""This ennemy is pretty rough to beat, let's try those .... Lightning powers, shall we"" with a huge grin on his face, like he actually has lightning powers. The fans are wide eyed ""Holy shit he can shoot lightning !? So cool !"" and that belief suddenly opens access to lightning powers for him, 7 out of 7 powers are now available    PROS   Eidolon-like versatility. Access to a lot of powers and innate knowledge on how to use them all. Note : Just how to ""use them"", not Skitter-like cleverness and optimisation. He'll come up with stuff, but he has so much tools that he'll rarely pull out some clever optimisation with one of them. In a way, he is MORE versatile than Eidolon (more powers available at once), with the downside of being entirely dependant on ""outsiders"" and being useless by himself, and having to keep up much more of an act, being more secretive, it would require more planning regarding follower numbers and what they believe in, and so on. Is INCREDIBLY strong as long as people are unaware of the exact nature of his powers. As long as the whole belief system and such is unknown, he'll just look like a very strong, versatile parahuman with access to multiple powers. Notoriety Increases his power, since, if people/ennemies become aware of his powers, they'll believe he has those, he WILL have those powers when they clash, and since his ennemies believe he has the power, that increases the amount of potential powers he can have since that opens up an extra slot. (Ex. If an ennemy believe he can fly, his followers don't have to anymore, so they can believe he has an extra power. The followers don't know this, of course, but he does.) Since he has a loyal fanclub that travels with him, he can possibly come up with clever applications for his powers by brainstorming with them.   CONS   IS INCREDIBLY RELIANT ON HIS ""FANCLUB"". He becomes incredibly weak without them feeding him powers. If the ennemies know his exact power, they won't give him any abilities, and if his fanclub isn't there, they won't give him any either. He's then 100% powerless. I would see him tour around with his ""clan"" of ~20 people that would serve as henchmen, etc, but catch him out of range or separate him from his fanclub, and he's done. IS RELIANT ON PEOPLE NOT KNOWING THE EXACT NATURE OF HIS POWER. Even his fans. Since, if these ""fans"" know his power, they'll have a harder time believeing he has X powers, since there is this cognitive dissonance that his power is actually the ""Placebo"" and not whatever they're believeing in. It's hard to convince yourself of something that's currently wrong when you know something else is actually true. The orphans in his care are especially useful to counter this, since he's their idol and role model and their loyalty is off the charts, they wouldn't believe an ennemy telling them their idol is actually powerless since they SAW him do amazing stuff. In a way, when someone knows his exact power, except if they're children or zealously loyal/don't believe it, they'll just grant him THAT power (the ""Placebo"" power,which ""he already grants himself"") and have a much harder time (if not impossible) granting him anything else, which makes them effectively useless to him. Has to keep up a show at all times. He has to keep his fanclub kind of close to him during altercations or other illicit activities, he always has to front as an allmighty parahuman with tons of powers because HE has to make THEM believe he has the powers for THEM to grant those to HIM. He has to convince them he's great for them to actually make him great. Not only that, but he has to keep them happy, following him, ... He can influence his following to grant him the powers he needs, but in the end, he's not 100% in control. With his boasting during fights, he can influence them to believe he actually has X power as an ace in his sleeve, but if it doesn't catch on he's won't get it. He will also ""prep"" them before fights by making them believe (for example) ""Well today I think I'll just crush them right off the bat with my .... Gravity manipulation"" smirk, Just to realise that there are 10 people and they now believe he has 11 powers, so it's a 50/50. Either one of the people is like ""Holy shit Gravity powers ?"" and they love it so much that he now has Gravity manipulation, but he'll lose the previous power that was ""assigned"" to that person's belief, or they like it less and he won't get it. In the same vein as #1 : Incredibly vulnerable to being separated from his fanclub by mover/shaker effects getting them out of range.  Over time, hes versatility is limited by the number of people he has. If at some point he had a following of 20 people, 10 are gone, 10 are left, he now has 10 people that believe he has 20 powers, which leads to really awkward mental gymnastics. The best thing he can do at that point, is to give up on that group and start a new one."

Parahumans,3c61vd,DistaNVDT,2,Sun Jul 5 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"The solution that would make the most sense is that he would get access to mind control/suggestion like Valefor had, with the restriction that people he affects this way can't contribute to his power since their minds/beliefs aren't really theirs, but his.  Your belief would then be correctly translated to a corresponding power he has access to, while limiting it within reasonable wormverse bounds."

Parahumans,3c61vd,monkeyjay,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:39:42 2015 UTC,He forgot to mention he's 98 years old and his clones die of old age immediately. He ends up being placed in a giant furnace to provide an everlasting source of fuel for generating power and ends up removing the earth's reliance on fossil fuels. When the excess bodies get too much he is just ejected into space using the now unlimited fuel! He's some other galaxy's problem then.
Parahumans,3c61vd,palparepa,3,Mon Jul 6 02:11:38 2015 UTC,"To give that a drawback it could be great to have his total mass (of both bodies) never exceed his initial mass. So his two clones are half size, if they both die he has four quarter size clones. Eventually he'll be a few trillion cell-sized clones and he'll be known as the cockroach (which isn't as cool as Ragnarok I guess)."
Parahumans,3c61vd,palparepa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a Master thing to me. If objects he carries aren't cloned, I'd give him a 5.  If objects he carries are also cloned. If they are, then he becomes a Master 12.  He could make billions of copies. With only two bullets to start with. It would take approximately 10 minutes to get thousands of copies.    So, if he isn't contained quickly, he's a Master 12.  If he's taken out quickly, with no prep, he's a Master 6.  If he has no prep, but the fight drags on, it's a bell-curve from Master 3-12."

Parahumans,3c61vd,eSPiaLx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:46:29 2015 UTC,"Mmm... I could accurately say ""no upper limit known"", but that's because he didn't like hurting people so never really tested. In one occasion, a strong, expert fighter challenged him, and granted him a free hit. A single blast to the stomach was enough to down the fighter.  The blasts are long-ranged, and don't lose power for about four five feet, fading away completely at about seven hundred feet. But they are somewhat slow (50 feet/s), which makes them tricky to aim, although his precognition helps a bit in that regard. Also, although the blasts are invisible (but may detected by some tech and powers), he is aware of their location, and can cancel them at will.  Stamina is needed to use the blasts, and can be made stronger by spending more stamina, which is one of the reasons there isn't a know cap: he was still a child, and didn't train his body. Loudness can be easily increased just by spending more time concentrating and preparing the blast. A couple seconds is enough to make the sonic equivalent of a flashbang (170 dB)  Also important: when preparing each blast, he can decide the sound it will be produced on impact. Being immature as he is, he thought it highly amusing to defeat a group of robbers using fart noises.  EDIT: feel free to use this character/powers elsewhere if you want. If you need a better name, I think Boombox fits."

Wakes up with either an answer or significantly more information about the topic or question. Works in the Protectorate Strategic Planning Division (PSPD).  Insinuation/Agitation: Master/Stranger villain duo. Insinuation projects a field around them that makes people suggestible. Agitation is actually more of a social Thinker and convinces people they're best of friends in order to scam them out of life savings/property.  Shell: Materials science Tinker, a rogue who works as a private contractor with a construction company building bunkers and ultrastrong buildings.  Hive: Another Tinker, one who triggered around Skitter and has a specialty in massively parallel operations and drones. Was quietly transferred out of Brockton Bay into the San Fransisco Wards when the administration recognized their similarity to Skitter's power.  Tangle: Shaker who controls and produces plant matter around them, typically using vines as a method of nonlethal takedown and restraint. Member of the Miami Protectorate branch.  Buzz: Shaker. Like, literally a shaker: their power vibrates things at resonant frequencies to tear them apart. Has poor targeting abilities.  Extermination: A biological version of the Ash Beast, destroys all organic matter in an area around them. Currently on self-imposed exile in Siberia, sustained by their power.  Sentinel: Minor Alexandria package with the additional powers to not need sleep and possessing omni-directional vision.  Parasite: Absorbs biomass from people they touch to boost their own strength, reflexes, durability, and regeneration.  Infestation: A Hacking-based Tinker who has aligned themselves with the Worm-verse version of Anonymous.  Plague: One of the first bio-Tinkers, with a specialty in genetically modified microorganisms. Currently imprisoned for life in an extreme biosafety facility due to their attempt to recreate and release the Spanish Flu. Plague was spared the death sentence by agreeing to work for the EU's agricultural and medical research divisions.  Snare: Blaster who conjures starfish-like projectiles out of the air around them and is able to launch them telekinetically through the air. When they make contact with something, they stick on to it or grab it and fall out of Snare's control. Limited to three such constructs under control at a time.  Prey: Mover who becomes faster according to the number of people chasing them and the speed of those people.  Colony: Extreme-environments habitation Tinker. Was quickly recruited by the International Space Agency, and worked there until the Simurgh showed up and started hanging out in orbit. Now works for the same company as Shell.  Monarch: One of Cauldron's agents in Africa, a Thinker specializing in governmental structures and negotiations. Makes a habit of occasionally taking over towns and occasionally nations by manipulating events to bring their particular candidates to power, but has managed to keep out of the limelight enough that they're an unknown.  Migrate: Mass-transportation Tinker. Was in Japan working on an improved bullet train network and died in the Leviathan attack on Kyushu.  Edit: Added more, might do more later."

There are many things in that category she can't manipulate, and quite a few outside that she can. It really is 'bugs', nebulous as that is. Bitch can boost all canines, including foxes and a few others. The Undersiders are led by Grue then Skitter, not Tattletale. She takes on more of a command and control role and is effectively leading the remains of the team after the timeskip and subsequent disasters, but that's a minority of the text. Some issue regarding the PRT's relationship to other organizations: they explicitly don't include capes in their ranks, so referring to them as a police force for 'other' capes is a bit odd. Behemoth's kill aura isn't 100 meters, it's somewhere around 30 feet. Minimum safe distance is set at 100 feet owning to how fast he can move. Leviathan was the second Endbringer, first appearing in June 1996. The Simurgh didn't arrive until December 2002."

Parahumans,3c2mql,Cruithne,16,Sat Jul 4 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"1) Bucharest, October 10th, 2012. Tohu selected Legend, Eidolon, Kazikli Bey.  2) Los Angeles, May 17th, 2013. Tohu selected Alexandria, Phir Se, Lung.  Those are the only two on the timeglider. Pretty sure they're the only two attacks."
Parahumans,3c2mql,Vivalapapa,7,Sat Jul 4 04:47:48 2015 UTC,"I suspected this might be the case, which was why I asked. That seems odd, that so little of them were seen and that proper strategies for dealing with them would still be in the works. Thanks!"
Parahumans,3c2mql,Vivalapapa,4,Sat Jul 4 05:19:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind their first appearance was less than a year before the final fight. About 8 months, if I remember right."
Parahumans,3c2mql,Kumquatodor,2,Sat Jul 4 15:14:35 2015 UTC,Do we know what Kazikli's power was?
Parahumans,3c2mql,Rillet,7,Sat Jul 4 07:47:44 2015 UTC,"Not that it was easy to fly in winds like this.  Not the sorts of winds that an aerokinetic like Kazikli Bey could make, capable of slicing someone with air compressed into razorlike ribbons.   Bucharest, October 10th, 2012 // Tohu Bohu  Notes: First appearance.  Loss.  Tohu selects Legend, Eidolon, Kazikli Bey.    Target/Consequence: see file Kazikli Bey.   He could manipulate air/wind. Since he is matched along with Legend, Eidolon, Alexandria, Phir Se, and Lung he is/was really powerful as far as aerokinetics can go."
Parahumans,3c2mql,Kumquatodor,3,Sat Jul 4 07:55:01 2015 UTC,Okay. Thanks!
Parahumans,3c2mql,HelloiamaTeddyBear,3,Sat Jul 4 07:57:44 2015 UTC,"Also, do we ever know where Tohu, Bohu and Khonsu goes when they are dormant? Must have missed it, thanks!"
Parahumans,3c2mql,GreatWyrmGold,4,Sat Jul 4 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"Bohu comes from underground, like Behemoth did; Tohu probably comes with. Khonsu probably just teleports in and starts wrecking stuff."

Parahumans,3c18vr,OnlyLoveNow,3,Sat Jul 4 19:11:43 2015 UTC,Cenotaph Taylor probably could.
Parahumans,3c2263,Cakebiter,26,Sat Jul 4 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"No, his power is only that strong because of that built in restriction.    Über and Leet are really problematic in that they're two characters that people tend to overinflate, powerwise.  I'm exaggerating, but man, am I tired of reading, ""Why doesn't Leet just make a machine that turns him into a god!?""  Über is in the same boat. It would perhaps be better to say that he's able to learn techniques.   ~   Leet's biggest problem is that it took him time to figure out the 'rule' to his power. He tried a variety of things in attempts to work out what his specialty was, and he burned a lot of bridges, including wet tinkering. That's not a 'Leet' problem so much as a trap that a lot of people (including many critics of Leet on various forums and reddits) would fall into. He caught on faster than your average geek might.  Now, any time he sits down for a project, he has to cross-check against all the other things he ever made. This isn't end-product related, but works out to components. Example? Power source. He either uses something mundane, or he uses something tinker derived. But if he uses something tinker derived to power his newest project, then he has to think of all the other power sources he's used, make sure that this one is sufficiently different, gauge the risk, and then move forward. Same goes for the mechanisms, the overall design & goal, and so on.  Defiant has the 'tinker up efficiency/hybrid/minimized technology' skill tree. Stinger has the 'missile' skill tree. Tecton has the 'Seismic and Architecture' skill trees. Leet has all of them, but all throughout those trees are entire sections with 'Use of this technology has a X% chance to fail'. You get further away from one design, that chance drops, but it's still there.  The video game thing was partially personal passion and partially a means of 'categorizing' what he did. On top of a wealth of notes and reference documents, he can think back through the various games he's been inspired by and use that as a mnemonic device to recall what he did for each project.  So by the time you/he figure(s) out the 'catch' to the power, the list of options is riddled with fail chances. You know there are a few trees you've not explored yet, but you have to progress carefully. How? You weigh the odds, estimate your chances of failure, trust your one really reliable buddy/sidekick to cover your ass if something blows up, and you do lots of little jobs you can afford to fail until you have the resources to do one big job well with something you're ninety-five percent sure won't blow up in your face.  Except he can't really seem to catch a break. He doesn't know it, but he's basically doing the opposite of Jack Slash and Taylor. He's explicitly out of tune with his power, he doesn't nurture it the way others do, even by general conflict - he's a little too cowardly, a little too safe, in large part, because he's hedging bets as often as not, and it's an unsatisfied shard, more prone to cause chaos for him rather than set him up to pursue it. It's trying to actively disrupt or kill its host so it can move on to greener pastures.  To top it all off, yeah, he's annoying, generally unpleasant, and people don't tend to like him. Except for Über.  Such is the life of Leet."
Parahumans,3c2263,Rillet,7,Sat Jul 4 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"He's explicitly out of tune with his power   Ok, but how does this affect Leet? My guess: a happy shard would help Leet to remember which skill trees have been already used, or to have a better estimation of failure rate, maybe even making good suggestions."
Parahumans,3c2263,palparepa,10,Sat Jul 4 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"It'd probably do a bit more then that. In the hands of say, Taylor, Leet's shard would probably try to bend the rules and actively avoid building the same component twice by replacing components that had already been used with effective substitutes."
Parahumans,3c2263,wiseass_username,2,Sat Jul 4 11:45:30 2015 UTC,"Too bad he couldn't pair up with Defiant. Make something, give it to Defiant to check and fix up. I don't know if Tinkers can do that, though."
Parahumans,3c2263,OniTan,2,Mon Jul 6 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe Dragon, but IIRC Tinkers are better than baselines at working with (Other tinker's) tech, but by no means as good as the original Tinker."
Parahumans,3c2263,chronophrax,10,Tue Jul 7 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"Leet's power isn't restricted because of the bad relationship with his passenger. His power is restricted, and he has a bad relationship with his passenger."
Parahumans,3c2263,GreatWyrmGold,6,Sat Jul 4 14:43:49 2015 UTC,"Leet's passenger purposefully sabotages him for playing it safe and using his amazing power to make viral videos rather than engaging in combat and gathering useful information for the entities.   I'm not sure the shards understand enough to care about something like that. His viral videos make him popular, make him seem somewhat weak to actual capes and generates a lot of animosity. That's right up a shard's ally in terms of conflict, physical or emotional.  My guess is that his shard is focused entirely on Invention. His shard's purpose is to combine older tinker techs with each other to find new ways to combine and use them. That's pretty broad since that's the whole purpose of the Entities coming to Earth in the first place. So if the shard notices that his host is using a technique that the shard is familiar with, he purposefully withdraws power from the tech during use or creation causing it to fail. The more familiar it is, the less power the shard allows his host to waste.  Since the shard is going to remember every usage and combination of powers, he has a great incentive to push for unfamiliar combinations and uses. My question is what happens if the shard buds and gets another host? The shard(s) know a lot of previous combinations. If those combinations no longer work for a new host, the host many never engage meaningfully in conflict or figure out the catch. If the shard does allow same combinations as a previous host, then the shard is wasting a lot of time and energy."
Parahumans,3c2263,Neato,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:08:51 2015 UTC,Interesting idea.
Parahumans,3c32at,Amelnik7495,32,Sat Jul 4 07:54:16 2015 UTC,"Because most people have hair? And when there are insects everywhere, are you going to go to the trouble of looking too closely at someone's hair?"
Parahumans,3c32at,horseradish1,21,Sat Jul 4 08:04:37 2015 UTC,"All there was to go on was her hair, and her basic size and shape. Under ordinary circumstances, that could be enough to make a link, although Taylor wasn't a drastically public person, and very few people would draw a link between the quiet, weird girl that got bullied and a supervillian who controlled huge swarms of insects.  Add into the equation the chaos in Brockton Bay shortly after she first went out in costume - Bakuda's bombing spree, the amped up ABB attacks, and then Leviathan, followed up by the Slaughterhouse Nine, there was massive disruption and everyone had better things to think about.  Bear in mind who actually made the connection - Dragon, who has ridiculous access to information; and Greg, one of the few people at Winslow who had any real interest in Taylor. Her relative anonymity as a person combined with the sheer chaos of Brockton Bay, I'm not surprised it took that long."
Parahumans,3c32at,sephlington,11,Sat Jul 4 09:30:57 2015 UTC,"One thing that a lot of people overlook is simple body language.  There's a vast difference between the person that people associate with Taylor, and the person people associate with Skitter.  They have height, build, and hair in common, yes.  But let's take a step back for a moment.  Let's say you know Taylor.  How do you think of her?  Sure, she's scrawny, without much upper body.  But you also envision her as a shrinking violet, someone who's been cowed and is simply trying to get through the day and away from everyone.  She wears baggy clothes, she adjusts her glasses, she lets her hair hide her face.  A very timid girl.  Now, look at most of the photos of Skitter.  Much more form-fitting outfit, standing straight.  Every photo of Skitter that would appear in the papers would be an intimidating one.  All the better to vilify her.  She's daring, courageous, powerful.  She does creepy, nasty things with her power.  She's intimidating, downright frightening.  How do you reconcile those two images?  To most people who only have passing knowledge of the two, it would be difficult.  Greg gets a bonus because he paid more attention to Taylor than most.  I know it sounds like a silly reason not to recognize someone, but you'd be surprised how much body language plays into how we recognize people.  Even clothes can make a huge difference.  I can go out in public in jeans and a t-shirt, and nobody from work recognizes me.  I have literally pulled a Clark Kent on folks.  So to me, it's not unbelievable that someone who keeps a lower profile than myself can pull it off when you can't see their face."
Parahumans,3c32at,ErrantVagrant,7,Sun Jul 5 06:37:10 2015 UTC,You're actually a Stranger 2. Congratulations.
Parahumans,3c32at,Gnimhey,3,Sun Jul 5 13:53:39 2015 UTC,FUCK YEAH!
Parahumans,3c32at,ErrantVagrant,10,Sun Jul 5 22:42:31 2015 UTC,Greg managed to do it. Everyone else who knew taylor probably wouldn't even be capable of such a connection due to the dissonance it would cause.
Parahumans,3c32at,azazelcrowley,8,Sat Jul 4 10:21:02 2015 UTC,"I can think of some arguments for why people would connect Taylor with Skitter. Her hair, no. Lots of people have long, curly, dark hair. It's not like she dyed it electric blue."
Parahumans,3c32at,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jul 4 14:45:56 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPefOfu2TIU  and also because of the clark kent boddylanguage thing. she doesn't act or move anything like the warlord of brocton bay(with the exception of crossing the street without looking)  besides how many people who actually saw skitter ever actually saw taylor?

Not really charting new ground, but it can be interesting. Just need to differentiate her from the above mentioned.    Brute: Experiencing physical harm or pain. Changer: Issue in physical state. Body image, or a crisis of self image vs. society’s expectations.   Maybe her personality/past/woldview/shard gives her power a quirk that isn't strictly in line with what it appears to do(Miss M doesn't sleep, Taylor's power works subconsciously, etc). Something that falls outside the brute/changer dynamic, but isn't necessarily strong. Something to express the shards intentions/personality?  The best powers are those that come with an irony or overlap onto who the person was. Noelle had an eating disorder which is expressed in Echidna, Taylor viewed herself/acted like a bug which got her bug powers, Marrissa's parents wanted her to shine now she shines brighter than anything, Dennis wanted to fix/stop a problem now thats all he can do, etc.    It happens because the powers connect to us in the moments we have our trigger events, decrypt our brains and search for something in the world that they can connect to, that loosely correlate with how the powers were originally supposed to work.   So her father wanted a son/perfect kid? Give it to him with a catch.  My 2 cents, hope that helped."

I guess Bio-Tinker setup on top of the Brute/Changer deal. She makes things with her biomass and tests them in the field - I've already got ideas for that, now.

It was a sunny day, and passengers crowded to the railings to get a better look.  As if sharing their curiosity, the figure drew closer as well.  His expression was unchanging, but witnesses at the scene reported that he appeared deeply sad.  “‘I thought he was going to crack his facade and cry any moment’, said Grace Lands, ‘But when I reached out and touched his fingertips, I was the one who burst into tears.’  “‘That boat trip was a final journey for me.  I had cancer, and I wasn’t brave enough to face it.  Can’t believe I’m admitting this in front of a camera, but I was going back to Boston, where I was born, to end things myself.  After I met him, I changed my mind.  Didn’t matter anyways.  I went to a doctor, and he said there was no sign I ever had the disease.’  “‘My brother, Andrew Hawke, was the last passenger to make any sort of contact with him, I remember.  He climbed up onto the railing, and, almost falling off, he clasped the hand of the golden man.  The rest of us had to grab onto him to keep him from falling.  Whatever happened left him with a quiet awe.  When the man with the golden skin flew away, my brother stayed silent.  The rest of the way to Boston, my brother didn’t say a word.  When we docked, and the spell finally broke, my brother babbled his excitement to reporters like a child.’   ~   In 1989, attempting to quell a riot over a basketball game in Michigan, the superhero known to the public as Vikare stepped in, only to be clubbed over the head.

One of the dead shards, damaged. The entity’s vision allows it to see the man’s inside, the damage. He is dying of a systemic issue in his body, producing the wrong type of cells in the wrong places.  The entity reaches out, feels others touch his hand before the male finally makes contact.

Leviathan made hit and run attacks that meant he was gone and attacking another city before Scion/Foil/anyone else reached a location, Simurgh attacked abstract targets, Khonsu teleported, and Tohu/Bohu were difficult to pin down or find easy answers to."

The Endbringers are known to have 'targets', so this wouldn't be particularly weird. But even if we suppose they ignored Foil...  Behemoth could turn up the kill aura like crazy so no one could even get close. Leviathan could attack ships if he was really afraid (mm, imagine poor Scion). Khonsu could obviously teleport away. Not sure what Tohu or Bohu would do. The Simurgh would see it coming. She would flight-dodge - or kill the speedsters - or grab the wire with telekinesis and start slicing and dicing heroes.

Any of them except the twins could easily kill anyone stretching a rope around them. That's also assuming that Foil is in every fight.   I would say the main issue is that you can only do it if the enemy is distracted, and they're going to learn what you're trying to do very quickly. Plus since Foil's charge only lasts a few seconds, she has to be kind of close to the Endbringer, and they probably don't want to risk her like that."

I thought he was critiquing the poise and viewing angle, and it took me a long time to figure out exactly what he was criticizing (drawing isn't something I know a lot about).  Still, my point stands. Yeah perhaps the artist could have drawn it better, could have emphasized differences in depth of field to create a more realistic look. Such is the aspiration of artists.  But criticizing that by posting an image taken from a camera seems asinine to me. They are completely different mediums. I'm willing to tolerate DOF errors in 2-D images (especially fanart) because I don't expect professionalism, I'm not paying for it, and I just think it's cool to see Tattletale.  ... and I apparently get pretty defensive about people criticizing fanart.

Her powers don't make her particularly tough, they don't make her particularly strong, she can't shoot fireballs or whatever or level a city block, she can't fly or become intangible, ...  Physically, she'd be just as helpless as any civilian when facing most powers in the wormverse.  Her power is her mind, the whole Thinker power thing with intuition, manipulation, etc.  So in a way, when dealing with/Fighting with all these superhumans, she's walking a tightrope, she's prodding away at ennemies that could effortlessly harm her, but she's JUST balancing on the edge every time, always pulling back in time so that she doesn't cause them to  flip a switch and fuck her up.

Parahumans,3btg1n,Tabdaprecog,25,Thu Jul 2 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"Great interview. I've loved all the Wildbow interviews that I've read. Even when he writes casually about himself he's still a joy to read and never fails to come off as a really cool guy.   Two little things. First I would love to see him do the short novels in a year thing. I've wondered for quite some time now how that would go and I think it would be fantastic. Really give him more leeway to explore different genre's and allow him to take himself out of the longrunning serial story structure. Also of course give him a lot more work to publish easily I guess.   The thing about Worm originally being 5 interweaving stories was really intersting too. Sorta like a Game of Thrones or Wheel of Time thing where it keeps switching narrative to narrative. You obviously see remnants of that concept in Worm in interludes. Not all but definitely the Faultline and Co. ones give off the impression that there is another story in the background that could have been written. I'm curious what he planned for the 5 plotlines to be. Any theories? I think I'm sorta glad he did it the way he did. It keeps the story more focused and probably a lot shorter as well. Just look at Wheel of Time. The story goes everywhere, takes forever, and half the time the reader is just waiting for their favorite character's PoV to come back. Worm on the other hand is an incredible page turner that follows one great character for the most part which Wheel of Time could never claim."

I roll one thick line, 4-5' long parallel to the ground and use it as a sort of ""paint well"" for my vertical lines. It's usually enough to hide it, except in extreme circumstances of paint fading over time and matching poorly.   2) What size brush for the cut? 3"" angle is my favorite, but I make do with the 2 1/2"" my job provides.   3) Spray-on texture for drywall?

Parahumans,3buue7,Shiroe_the_Enchanter,14,Thu Jul 2 09:47:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not a writer, but I practically live with one.  He's not Wildbow-level with the amount of work he does, but he does write an awful lot.  I asked him once how he got to the point where he could write so much, and his first response was ""I have no life.""  But from there, he said that he started to write the moments.  He'd conceptualize a story in his head, and in doing so, he'd create these moments that he loved.  He'd write down that moment, set it aside, then write another moment, just to get them out of his head.  Maybe not all in one day, maybe just a moment a day, and rarely in any sort of order that would make sense to anybody.  He didn't need to write the context or the worldbuilding or anything like that.  Just that singular moment, line of dialog, or scene.  They didn't have to be the same story, the same characters, the same genre.  When he got an idea, he'd just spew it out.  As he kept writing these, he found that it got easier.  At first, they weren't connected at all.  Eventually, he'd find one or two that were close and were easily connected.  Over a period of a few years, he got to the point where he'd just start to write the connection piece, even if there wasn't anything to connect to.  Focusing on a singular subject instead of writing shotgun snippets.  (Or as he calls them, bursts.)  It started to get to the point where he'd finish one moment, see the way to connect to another, and get excited.  He was getting there!  And sometimes, he'd find that once he got to where that next moment should have been, it didn't exist any more.  Something had changed along the way, and the original moment didn't work.  But he could use that moment he'd wanted to write as a springboard for something even more interesting.  For example, from one of his pieces, a character was supposed to lash out at former enemies, killing them.  But by that point in the story from the last core moment, the character was dying from the inside out, creating an even more interesting scene were the character doesn't trust the former enemies and is resisting as they fight to try and help keep him alive.  He found this a far more fascinating scene to write than what the previous had been, which spurred on another moment that he wanted to get to.  And another, and another.  Oh, then he got an idea on what lead up to that first moment he wrote, and had to tweak that scene.  The next thing he knew, he had a first draft of 180,000 words done, and started editing.  Now, his way might not work for you.  It might not work for anyone else.  He's an odd guy, and everybody's system should always be what works best for that person.  But the only way you're going to find a way that works is to keep at it, trying to find the way that the words just seem to flow.  Because in the end?  That practice will help you overall.  And the moment you say ""I can't write, I give up"" is the moment you fail.  Until then, so long as you keep trying, you're still winning.  Even if your first story sucks, as long as you keep at it, you're going to eventually stop sucking and be interesting.  And you'll some day find that the ideas that sucked can be used as a starting point for ideas that don't suck."

He's a different kind of writer from Wildbow, focusing on character study instead of grand plots, so it might not appeal to everyone.  The fact that the main character is a little bit of an unreliable narrator about certain things may piss off some folks, but he tries to write it in such a way that the reader can see where things don't add up.

Parahumans,3buue7,Wildbow,13,Fri Jul 3 01:38:17 2015 UTC,"I spent ten years being unable to write.  When I started out at thirteen, I wrote a 65,000 word story.  It was terrible, but I got the mileage.  Then as I got older, I found I was writing less and less, I was unhappy with what I'd create, or I'd start a story one night and never pick it up again.  The wake-up call was when I was taking a class in Applied Languages: The Analysis of Written Language.  There was this great article I read by Peter Elbow that talked about how students could effectively write.  What you do, and this is the first part - you just get to the finish line.  It doesn't matter if you put down utter tripe or garbage, or skip tricky bits or contradict yourself, or pull shit out of right field.  Make notes if you have to, but get the story to the 100% mark.  I realized my problem was with the writing process, not the product I was creating.  I'd get so caught up in writing what I wanted to write and getting it on the page that I'd end up constantly tweaking and fixing and ultimately burning out on it.  Then I'd put it down for the night, get to the point the next day where I felt like writing, and I'd just... feel like the motivation was gone, I didn't like the story anymore.  What you focus on is just getting the words out there.  Nobody, not even the best authors out there, will produce a first draft without horrendous flaws.  It's like comparing yourself to a supermodel, and when you take the editors and other professionals into account, you're comparing yourself to a supermodel that's been airbrushed.  This is a muscle you're training, you don't have much of a physique right now, so you build up, and steadily raise your own expectations.  Once you've finished the work, you go back and revisit it.  You go over it, you check it up, you tweak it.  Then you take a break.  Come back later, after you've gotten less intimate with the work, revisit it, and edit it again.  Once you've done it enough times that you've lost all objectivity, you hand it over to someone you trust.  They'll tear it apart and tell you what you failed to account for, in the reader's perspective.  I personally started serial writing just as a way to force myself to put one foot in front of the other.  You could do something similar, or just do an exercise where you forbid yourself to backspace or go back to any text you've already written.  Keep moving forward, test yourself to see how much content you can put on that page.  Then try to beat your record.  If you revisit a story, do it from another character's perspective or from a different starting point, just to force yourself to keep changing it up (and because writing the same thing over and over is boring)."

That way you'll be interested in writing but not too scared to screw things up. (2) Pick anything related to the thing you picked in step 1 that you think would make a good starting scene or starting line. (3) Write that line, or scene, and keep writing until you've hit a word goal (I picked 2000 words because Worm's first entry was around that length). (4) Keep writing that scene, and the next scene, and the next, every week/month/day/whatever fits your schedule.  And make sure to post it online and we'll read it.

He probably divided paths when he thought he was winning and didn't expect Tattletale to unleash her secondary power of Being Really Rich. It's like one of those visual novels where you pick the wrong choice somewhere and only find out you've doomed yourself several choices later when you've already saved over your old save file. I'm not sure how Dinah narrowed down her choices to those exact words - even if she started preparing very early on, she shouldn't have been able to be as precise as, say, Contessa. The same goes for any decisions she made where there were more than two options available. It doesn't help that Cauldron wanted to set the apocalypse off early, while she was trying to delay it, so no, everything didn't go according to plan. The going theory seems to be that they're the conflict-makers that are briefly mentioned in the Entity interlude, and that they were hiding behind the Moon before Eidolon inadvertently woke them up. That seems to be the case. Bear in mind that the statement doesn't have to be true; it just has to be something that he's suspected for a long time, perhaps almost obsessively, without wanting to admit it.

As for why they attacked Scion...revenge? Self-preservation? Imprinting? Simurgh wanted to get rid of a big block? Who knows? Possibly not even the Endbringers themselves. Yep, pretty much. Imp's a troll. (But part of it is probably how much she'd been hanging out with the Heartbroken, who are more well-read than Ms. ""Nero-hence-fish-jokes"".)

Finally, the Super limitation (the ability is affected by things that affect super powers, like Mantellum) gives -10%, and an ad hoc limitation against anything dealing too closely with the Entities is probably another -5%. That means each level is 185 points. Five levels would let you use Super Luck a bit more than every four minutes of play time, and would cost 925 points. Seventy-five points is plenty for a few skills and some Attribute bonuses, so I'd say it's possible to build Contessa on a round thousand points. GURPS: Powers suggests this as the low end for mythic fantasy deities and titans.  Visualization fits better thematically, but trying to enhance it to the point where it's Contessa-level would be more trouble than it's worth."

Parahumans,3bt29p,oliwhail,8,Fri Jul 3 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"Let them read excerpts from your campaign notes. Sure, it's not perfect knowledge since things can (read: always will) deviate from the direction you anticipate, but hey, precognition isn't perfect anyway. Not in the wormverse.  EDIT: For 'combat precog' type powers, just pass the precog's player notes telling them the actions specific enemies (maybe those closest, or the ones they're specifically engaged in, or the one that poses the greatest threat, whatever) are going to take in the next round. Then they can plan their actions accordingly."
Parahumans,3bt29p,Littlerob,5,Wed Jul 1 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"I've had one idea for a precog in a campaign of mine- the ability to see each person's cause of death. The catch is that it's not impervious to other precogs, and the cape's own actions can change things, which leaves me lee-way in not being forced to run the campaign a certain way. It also allows them certain information they can use to their advantage- bribing people by letting them know what to look out for, noticing teammates' vulnerabilities, etc.  I plan to use it as a form of foreshadowing. One day, suddenly, almost everyone's cause of death will turn to 'Suicide', hinting that something so horrific is going to occur that most people will choose not to live through it."
Parahumans,3bt29p,Cruithne,2,Wed Jul 1 22:48:02 2015 UTC,"As annoying as it would be I think one good option, depending on the type of precog, would be allotting ""retcon"" points. X per day, or some such."

Giving players knowledge of the future is...problematic, since there's about a 50-50 chance that they'll come up with a way to radically change it. A lot of the same ground can be covered with careful use of clairvoyance and the like. Alternatively, give them vague precogniive powers. That's still better suited for NPCs, though.  Unless you mean combat precognition? Let them declare their actions after everyone else has, before running them in initiative order."
Parahumans,3bt29p,GreatWyrmGold,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"I had a GM that, somehow, always gives my characters precog powers. Here are some of the things he would do:   Give me glimpses of bad things that might happen farther off. Give me little bits of data on stuff that is just about to happen. Like, we ordered a pizza and my character knew right before it got there.  Punch the untouchable, dodge the undodgeable. For the parahuman game, I could run hypotheticals past him. (""If we do X, what are the likely consequences?"") Due to the nature of how her power worked, she'd also get random, horrifying bits of data.   In my opinion, if someone has a precog power, you have to think about how exactly it works to get all the extras for it. A + bonus is nice for generic stuff, but if you get into the meat of how their power works, then you can actually get into the interesting stuff."
Parahumans,3bt29p,thirteenorphans,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:45:11 2015 UTC,"The ways I've seen precogs work are:   Normal precog -  (Some number of) times per turn, before players roll for an event/combat, you may use your ability. You can choose to reroll one allied dice roll in that event (this way you can warn friends or use it offensively on yourself). Clairvoyance - This usually involves asking the DM questions, but the number of questions and format of questions depend on your stats. Probability Manipulation - # times per turn, you may roll 3D6 and subtract the lowest roll from the total instead of rolling D6 (the DM figures out what 7+ rolls are, if anything)"
Parahumans,3bt29p,SeeOtter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:07:09 2015 UTC,At the start of a session roll three sets of whatever the dice you are using. Now save those and at any point in the session you can switch one out for a roll someone else made / use one before someone makes their roll.
Parahumans,3bt29p,FuriKuriFan4,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"Depends a bit on what you've got to work with system-wise.   In general ""roll dice, add numbers, kill things"" like D&D and it's ilk? Re-rolls, bonus dice, roll twice take best, force other to roll twice take worst, some information on what people plan to do, get out of ambushes, get out of trouble. But this is all boring.  Those are structured games, and it's difficult to grant the amount of power precog-stuff gives without unbalancing the mathematical underpinning and making everything wonky.  In more narrative games? Hand out a few tokens, let someone declare the future within reasonable limits. They see it happen, and behold, so it does. Give out more warnings / knowledge / hints , or allow them to ask questions and answer hypothethicals. That can work really well if you've got fun players (""Hold up, I know the guards are coming in two minutes"" [DM thoughts: Huh, there wasn't actually any guards on this level but I guess now indeed they are coming in two minutes]).  A more general approach that could work is to steal a page from a Cortex system hack (I think it was Leverage?) - grant someone a token(s) based on their level / attributes / point total / DM fiat. Cashing this token in allows them to retroactively declare an event they took the care to establish, ala Bill and Ted's time travel shenanigans.   ""The Ventilator attempts to ventilate you with a machine gun burst"" ""Ah! But knowing we'd end up in a burning building at the edge of nowhere in the middle of the night hunted by monsters, I took the pre-caution of replacing his ammo with duds during our earlier meeting""   Essentially you let players dictate the past within limits, because guessing the future is harder than just allowing someone to change the past a little. The effect is the same. Once they end up in trouble, limited ressources allows them to declare that of course they saw this coming and took precautionary measures, they're pre-cogs, they knew all along they'd end up hunted by werewolves and have therefore strategically placed silver laced bullets throughout the building.   It requires a bit of trust and is open to abuse, so hence the token bits of ""only X times per session"" rather than ""all the time"", but it mimics a lot of what makes playing pre-cog characters fun, suddenly turning absolutely horrible moments into what-was-actually-planned-all-along. It also allows for the more spotty kind of precognition, since things can still go terribly wrong as you obviously can't dictate change to a defined past event, only things you could feasibly have taken the time to prepare.  ""We're being hunted by a gang of vampires and they just blew out our tires with a high powered sniper rifle"" ""Oh so that's why my power wanted me to load the trunk with garlic bushels, now it all makes sense"". ""You loaded the trunk with garlic? When?"" ""Oh, y'know. Earlier, at the pitstop. [Hand token to DM]""  ( Low-level Worm spoiler: Thus, you can model some of what Tattletale does by assuming someone asked her about money and she got to go ""Ah, actually, during our earlier bank heist I prepared for this"" or ""You are pulled with tremendous force towards the monster"" ""Hah! I handcuffed myself to the railing, knowing this exact thing would happen"")"
Parahumans,3bt29p,fibin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"For PCs, we've only ever allowed short-term precogs or extreme precogs.  For short-term precogs, we typically use them for resetting combat.  For example, in Mage: The Ascension, one guy will caste a Time/Mind spell the first round of combat.  His second spell is a Mind spell that's basically him giving people commands.  (As limited by his Leadership rating.)  At the end of combat, he (and he alone) dictates if the scene is reset.  If so, then we return to the second round of combat, and go from there.  Another Mage example is to have him roll Leadership every round.  The player then assigns successes from that roll to players, representing him giving advice or nudges to help the rest of the party using information gleamed from the Time spell.  On the extreme end, we don't allow anything shorter than, say, a year from now.  The understanding is that it isn't written in stone and it can be changed by the PC or anybody they tell.  For example, they focus on a person and use their ability.  Their power tells them that in three years, they'll be dead, and their tombstone gives the date of death.  It doesn't tell them how they'll die, just when they will.  The players then can choose to try and find out how the person died.  This is a lot of pressure on the GM, but can be rather fun.  (For example, if the PC is a homophobe, letting them see the dude making out or getting on with his husband and watching the PC react.  Any number of awkward situations, especially ones that really require some sort of context to make sense, can be shown.)"

Then, let them backtrack and decide if they they really wanted to do that or not. They 'know' how future events will turn out, and can choose the best course of action. You could cap them at only X tries per turn, so that the spellcaster doesn't just 'try' his entire spell list until one works, or so that the archer doesn't just attack different targets until they get a good roll."

Well, Wildbow explained why he did it, and it made sense.  Personally, I read the story, in great part, for Taylor's character development. Full disclosure: I never thought she was a hero. She's, in my mind, a villain, on level with Cauldron. But she was so darn sympathetic, I wanted to see what she'd become.  When the time skip came, I felt like I missed two years of her growth. What were her conversations like with her father in that time? I get that she didn't feel too attached to the Wards, but... how did she feel, throughout it all? Did she really not change significantly in that time in a radically different environment? If not, then I'd like to be in her head while she's not changing, because she'd still react. She was in, what 8 Endbringer fights, too. I get that we already had 4 of them, but those were kind of important, in my mind. Not greatly, but... it would give a bigger picture.  Wildbow said that the dilema he faced was as followed: write more of those two years, in which not-much happens of any overarching significance, or skip it. Neither were great.  This leads to my greatly impractical, implausible, impossible solution. Cut Worm just before the time-skip; call it Worm Part I. Then immediately start immediately post time-skip; call it Worm Part II. Then realize short stories or novellas or interludes from during the time-skip. Have the side stuff run alongside the main stuff. And maybe have a some-times updated running series on all her Endbringer fights.  Of course, then you have to update each of them less than you would if you gave either of them your full attention.   Also, seeing as I spent less than three minutes thinking about this plan, I've probably missed gaping problems with this.  Solution 2: Make Worm into multiple series: the Undersiders, the Wards, the Apocalypse. The problem with that is they'd become ridiculously fragmented and impossible for some people to keep up."

It just feels like it sort of... breaks the story. Fundamentally changes how it's supposed to be. Like if in, say, Harry Potter, Harry had to leave Ron and Hermione and spend time with a new group in the last couple of books. It just isn't right.  Just had another idea. Maybe, it's bothering me because I see this story as not about Taylor, but about the Undersiders as a whole. And I just don't feel like this sudden separation from most of them works, along with a few other issues that make it worse.  And I've also been having this nagging feeling because this webcomic I know of called Tower of God did something remarkably similar, the main character getting separated and having to join a new group.

Taylor was the protagonist, and even that wasn't set in stone. Wildbow has talked about how he went through something like 200 other protagonists before settling on Taylor. Plus, there was that thing where Wildbow rolled dice to see who would live and die during the Leviathan fight. So there was a chance Arc 8 could have been about all of the Undersiders (including Taylor) dying in their first Endbringer fight.  If your stance was simply, I was really disappointed that there were no Undersiders during the time skip, so I didn't like it, then fine. It's your opinion, and its simple enough that there's nothing to really pick apart, its just your opinion.   But I honestly don't see where you could get all of the Undersiders being the protagonists."
Parahumans,3brwvv,idiodabble,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"Reading through the story, I gained a level of attachment to them. Even if they weren't directly the protagonists, they shone in the center of the story, and shifting Taylor away from them made it so most of the characters I grew attached to were missing. The story just worked better when it focused on the whole group, whether or not it was intended that way."
Parahumans,3brwvv,eddykatt,2,Fri Jul 3 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"So, your point does basically boil down to, I love the Undersiders, so i hated the time skip where they were gone. And like I said, that's your opinion and that's fine. That's how you experienced the story.  Although, I would like to point out that there is a difference between personal tastes and the writing quality of a piece of entertainment. Your personal tastes skew towards the Undersideres, so the lack of them in the story hurts your ability to enjoy the Narrative. While I really enjoyed the Undersiders, they weren't essential for me, so their absence had no effect on my enjoyment of the chapters I was reading. The reasons I did not like the time skips was that it felt like pieces of the narrative were missing, and it seriously hurt the flow of the story and made the pieces I was getting unnecessary confusing.  There is actually a Worm recommendation on some web site that is a perfect example of this. In the recommendation, the woman writing the article flat out states she couldn't finish worm because she got so bogged down by the constant action scenes. She also said that otherwise Worm was one of the best written things she read in a while, and anyone with higher thresholds for action should definitely check it out, because they would probably fall in love with it."

Parahumans,3bou3n,Maping,3,Wed Jul 1 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"EE is limited to only tinkering the dog. Basically if you remember Wildbow talking about how to role play tinkers without them being utterly broken, she has a Focus Item. And that item is her dog."

Not as extreme, but still, she does it. She might just have intuition, but she get's everyone to believe she's psychic which is so, so much worse. Regent kind of does too, although his shtick is more hiding the upper limit of what he can do rather than convincing people it's something else. Number Man is in a similar boat (who knew being good at math could let you kick someone's ass?) Teacher kind of did the same, although that was more leaving out detail than outright changing the power. A lot of the other parahumans do the same thing, where they only ever show off one part of their power but not the other (later stage Grue is a really good example). Depending on what Parian's power actually is, it could be some unintentional version of this."

If you knew that there was no consciousness or living thing being harmed you could just destroy the monsters without trying to be careful. That changes a battle considerably.   I have to say that after most battles of doing enough damage to a dream monster so that it disappeared and reformed you would come to the conclusion that she was a master anyway."
Parahumans,3bns0j,monkeyjay,22,Wed Jul 1 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"No, definitely Master protocols for Genesis. Taking out the monsters doesn't really do anything to her. Best way to beat her is to play ""find the master""."

The Library of Alexandria wouldn't be obvious to me if I were observing Rebecca from the public's eye. After all, her most blatant abilities are Brute and Mover ones.

Parahumans,3bns0j,palparepa,13,Wed Jul 1 05:34:05 2015 UTC,"One of my OC is like that. His power is Tinker with a teleport specialization. He hates his power because it's so bland, so he wants to keep his specialization in secret out of embarrassment, not for any advantage. He is also an expert in special effects, like in the old movies, not cgi.  So he prepares special effects (lights, sound, flames, smoke) to be teleported in just before doing the real effect he is after, to make it look like he is some kind of magician.  An example of a very simple application: teleport small amounts of water, many times per second, to look like he is producing water from his fingertips. Furthermore, the things he teleports keep their momentum, so by teleporting water in movement, and in larger amounts, he can shoot a strong water blast from his palms."
Parahumans,3bns0j,palparepa,5,Tue Jun 30 20:08:15 2015 UTC,That's really cool. It could be so versatile
Parahumans,3bns0j,ThirdFloorGreg,9,Tue Jun 30 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite trick of him is levitation. He can't just teleport himself upwards because he'll start falling. So what he does is having a compartment in his suit carrying a small but very potent magnet, capable of keeping him floating, as long as the magnet itself levitates (which doesn't.) Then, using teleportation, the magnet is exchanged with another identical magnet, but going up. As soon as the magnet begins to fall down, it's again exchanged with another magnet going up. His base has a couple of simple machines, whose only function is to grab these magnets and push them upwards, preparing them to be teleported again.

Denial had a thing where the longer you'd been planning something around him, the more he knew about it, and if he touched people, he'd get a short glimpse of their immediate plans.  He played it as if he could prevent one thing from effecting him, so long as he concentrated on it.  (While it was really him having had the time to set things to fall the way he wanted them too).  Siren was a beautiful and successful thief.  She styled herself after the mythical creatures, and was charismatic and mysterious to the extent that she had quite a large fan base.   Really she had just been working with a dangersense type power and good acting.  Nobody knew that the two were working together, actually, except for a few of our PCs who'd gone the villain route."

The players will be told that space is warped around the town they're in (helps me keep the campaign contained at the start, too). Whenever they try to leave, they'll find that they eventually end up facing the direction they left from. In actuality, space is fine, and the only warping is in their minds, created by a Stranger/Trump power pair (might be a trio involving a Shaker, haven't decided yet).  I have another character who is hiding most of the facets of her power. She'll pretend she's just good at reading people, but her power actually lets her run perfect simulations of up to three people at a time people in her head. Her drawbacks are, aside from the obvious limit of three, an inability to simulate a lot of other powers (especially Thinker and Tinker ones), and an inability to simulate the world. Ie, she can daydream of something, and in her daydream up to three people will behave exactly as they would in real life, but her dream won't be a perfect copy of reality, because she might not fully be imagining the setting. The major drawback will be assuming the power is a win-all. People are complex, and just because somebody chooses, say, running away in most simulations you put them in, doesn't mean they will in reality, because there might be a subtle difference between the simulation and reality that you won't notice, but they will. Hoping she becomes an antagonist because the only way to beat her is to fight smart."

It performs simulations given the inputs it has available, using the models is has available. The shards can't learn much in the simulations because the inputs to the simulation are just things that Eden knows about. The point of exposing the shards to reality is to test them against new things Eden doesn't know about.

Parahumans,3bmcfs,Chevron,2,Tue Jun 30 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"It's been well-said here, but here is the Exact Word of Wildbow, if you're curious.   Precognition is costly. The objective is to eat and to farm data. They're doing both at the same time, spacing it out into cycles.  Give one guy smoke powers. He shoots bullets that explode into big clouds of smoke and hot air, choking people. Let's call him Smokey Bandit, or SB. They're already collecting data on humans and bipeds and how humanlike, bipedal threats might confront them, data that they can give to their thinker shards to better simulate things and make future precognition (which is essentially simulation) powers just a little bit more accurate when dealing with unknowns.  It's also drawing reference from humanity as a whole. Are there clues, ideas in the understanding of gases or combustion or any of that? Everything's valuable, everything's categorized.  Then, when he goes into a fight, how is he using his power? That's more data, both for that particular power and for the entity as a whole. Cross-check, compare.  He winds up in a battle against a superior brute he can't hurt or choke, (let's call the guy Dark Lord Prowess, or DLP). How does he adapt? SB shoots the ground to create smoke between himself and DLP, he aims for the mouth, to get it inside and hopefully choke or concentrate the smoke. He innovates a wingsuit and shoots the ground to create smoke and hot air and stay out of DLP's reach. Except DLP is busy innovating and being creative too, and he gets SB and tears SB to pieces.  The shard, being alive, reports back with Scion and the broader network, and then goes to find a new host. In future cycles and advanced iterations, it can adapt the power in question. How does the smoke power work with a melee combatant, or when combined with another power? The more fights it gets into, the more varied the situations and longer it survives, the better, and the more resources it can justify using/taking.  The entities are trying to answer a question. How do they survive when they're done? When all's said and done and they've taken every planet and everything's shifting toward the same ambient state. How do they survive the heat death of the universe? They don't have the answer, and if they're going to use simulations to figure it out, they need as much data as possible to justify the expense, by the time they reach that point. They don't have a lot of creativity, so they borrow it from others. From humans."

Because no matter how 'smart' you are, just knowing how to dodge every bug would not let you do so it easily (and it has to be easy if she never, ever fails or even looks like she's trying with these impossible things) in a million years, the power is taking on the brunt of the work."

It does use a few glitches, but the precision is very entertaining.  Beyond that try searching tasvideos.org for your favourite old console games.

If you're interested in TASs but not for specific games, take a look at the newcomer's corner.  There's a lot of really interesting stuff out there, including heavy RNG manipulation (e.g. making ""1 in 1,000"" events occur every time by timing your inputs precisely), heavy glitching, ""full control"" glitches (getting write access to code, so you can program a different game inside the game), playarounds (the DS Brain Age one by Ryuto is a classic), simultaneous input on multiple games (there's one where somebody completes 4 Megaman games using the same input sequence), and plenty more."

Been listening, and promoting others to do the same who think the original text is too daunting.  The only suggestions I can think of, is simply one of preference. If there was enough of an available cast at the beginning to have had dedicated voice actors for each character, it would feel cleaner and more concise. In its current form, it can be difficult for uninitiated listeners to always immediately know whose perspective or lines are being read, as there isn't consistent voice. Still wonderful for a community project."
Parahumans,3bj48o,Theodinus,2,Mon Jun 29 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"This would be really cool, but along with the cooridination and editing being a nightmare as Rein said, the fact that everyone has different mics/setups/audio environments would make it incredibly jarring to listen to.

Parahumans,3bj48o,monkeyjay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that a fully voiced cast would be wonderful, but unfortunately for the scale of Worm it would be an absolute nightmare to coordinate due to the massive size of the cast.

As far as comments or criticism, you have some very talented readers in yourself, nspb and snagger. I find it much easier to follow along when the reader has a deeper voice which consequently has me preferring male narrators over females.

Parahumans,3bj0tl,scrafts,29,Mon Jun 29 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"Contessa's PtV kept her in a state of immaturity, at least mentally. She never really had to grow up. One of her key flaws concerning her power was what questions to ask. If she was ignorant of something her power could only informer her if she knew to ask. So the lack of creativity was more a by product of having anything she needed only a question away.  I don't think she could have pulled off serious tinker tech unless we count Simurgh/Dragon's version of tinkering (copying) in which case she could if she needed to, but part of being a tinker was the flood of ideas/concepts into their heads. Contessa simply could not make something she couldn't even imagine let alone know to ask about.  I find people put to much stock in how overpowered PtV is. It is scary strong in a narrow field, but certainly not omniscient nor omnipotent. It is limited to Contessa's concept of 'victory' and her general ignorance. Contessa also shares a problem a lot of other thinkers have (save Taylor because multitasking); time. She can only ask so many questions and follow only so many paths. You see this problem with Coil when Crawler is coming. No matter how powerful a thinker they still need time to process. Although Contessa has an advantage in being a precog with how much time she 'has' to process information.  My interpretation anyway."

(afterall if the entities were halfway competent the least they could do would be setting up the conflict their labrats faced as in some way relevant to heatdeath not provoke a 300 year long cold war)  off the top of my head a better and more efficient answer to ""we need an army. and weapons"" would have been cauldron having formed the toybox and to bring protectorate heads and world leaders into the conspiracy on the scion issue(or set their own people up to fill those positions)...that antiscion weapon was built in a few hours of forced cooperation afterall...they had decades to set up something more voluntary...if she didn't simply steal the yangaban's key capes and enslave those same tinkers)   numberman's participation meant they easily had funds to recruit from mercenaries like coil and with endbringer turnouts they'd have had little problem finding capes who'd sign up too.  if only she asked the right questions, right?  but just think...this is the shard that guided the entities in their ridiculous plan to stop entropy by.... letting other creatures play with nukes then destroying as many worlds as they could while hoping the answer would just turn up?!  o_0   ...so could it be the shard is operating at full capacity and it just happens to boil down to ""this'll keep you busy while somebody competent gets on that...hopefully"" rather than an actual path to success? (think ""homosuck""'s ultimate juju interlude) in which case the fact contessa managed to reign in the idiot ball even that much is an epic act of will worthy of a story in itself ;)"
Parahumans,3bj0tl,pseudonarne,21,Mon Jun 29 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing where people are getting the idea that Cauldron was stupid or inefficient. They did surprisingly well in a game rigged against them. Anyone with powers is inherently violent. Exponentially speaking, more parahumans = more violence until the world is nothing, but violence.   Think bigger-scale.  Absent Cauldron's meddling, there's no PRT for one thing. There's no Suits, no Red Gauntlet, no Elite Sentai group or whatever I called them, no Elite; all groups that Cauldron set up or supported. Groups are formed but can't sustain themselves past tight Undersider-like groups of 5-10 individuals. Conflicts are more tightly contained and devastating, recovery is slower, and an area that ends up lost or fucked doesn't get the backup needed to revive. Such areas are abandoned or occupied by whatever groups are willing to make do with the aftermath/ongoing occupation by X gang or Y high-level threat.  Non-parahumans in the West end up taking a more aggressive stance against parahumans, as certain voices aren't silenced, and without the Protectorate as an example, things are just more anti-parahuman around the world as a whole. Heroes are fewer and farther between than in conventional Worm - you've got an awful lot of shades of grey and people doing their damndest just to get by. The Chevaliers and Miss Militias of the world are staying right where they are, in small town X or Turkey-occupied Kurdistan, and they're helping their town/country and only their town/country. For the most part, parahumans are taking over where they can take over, and because the population is so hostile, they're forced to be a little ugly or harsh to quell dissent, or they're nice and constantly watching their back/focusing far too much on just keeping things functioning.  Assuming that Cauldron's operatives maybe killed Eden but then just sat on their hands/died, the Endbringers don't exist, the cauldron vials aren't spread out, and there's less of the really powerful parahumans here and there who're capable of acting decisively. Gates to other worlds are left open, feeding into Cote D'Ivorie, spitting out more than a fair share of Case-53 like monsters, only in a very tightly occupied space. If West Africa survives, it's either as a world power or as a mutant-occupied area. If they find Eden's corpse, well, you've got a whole other mess, because they're going to be less careful and organized about it. Assuming they don't accidentally revive Eden, there's going to be a lot of failed doses.  Further, the major threats that Contessa and Number Man deemed too dangerous to leave alone weren't necessarily eliminated (either because Contessa herself didn't pay a visit, or because Cauldron didn't contrive to have said parahuman put down), so there's more Ash Beasts, Blasphemies, Sleepers and the equivalent roaming around.  There's no Parahuman Containment Center, so there's no place to put the really dangerous villains. What do you do with the villains who can't be killed, like Gavel? You maybe try to wrangle some giant-killers like Flechette/Foil, but how many of those guys are there, really?  You're talking about infrastructure, but quite honestly, infrastructure wouldn't survive the 90's. By the mid-2000's, getting food from the agricultural states to the areas with the highest population density (ie. New york) is a struggle, because of bandits, threats, organized crime, disorganized crime and more. Things come to resemble the theoretical Edenverse, but you don't have Eden shoring up the population by putting tinkers and capes capable of reviving areas anywhere particular (you also don't have her sabotaging). Scion ends up playing a pretty big role in keeping society alive, more than before, with keen attention to the biggest threats and only those threats.  By March 2011, half the world is struggling, and the other half is controlled by powerful figures of the Glaistig Uaine class. Richter and his AIs might have a hand in keeping eastern Canada going, but his attention is focused on New York, which is a clusterfuck of the Nth order. A coalition of villains occupy Brockton Bay, including Marquis, the Butcher Queen and the Little Doctor, while outside parties want a piece of that pie. Every second city has a major threat in or near it - not quite on the level of an Echidna or Nilbog, but bad enough that it's hard to put down.  It isn't hopeless, but it's grim. Points of light in a broad swathe of darkness. There is a way out, nobody's actively trying to stop them from finding it, but it's an uphill battle every step of the way.  And Scion's still waiting at the end.   Seriously, Cauldron did a great job all things considered."

It's hard not to look down on them a bit.  Especially since they could solve a lot of problems just by being a little less concerned with staying secret and unaccountable. Or by being a little more careful with their formula distribution.  I don't know if Wildbow did this on purpose, but it seems to me that most of their successes are in the past. Maybe by the time of the story they're not as competent as they were, and they're no longer able to handle stuff like Noelle.

This is pervasive fanon that has never been backed up by text or a coherent argument. At the end of Worm, Contessa decides to usse her power less. When she first recives her power, and she's a child, she's worried about making decisions that her power doesn't guide her in.   I can't recall other instances of indecision on her part.

Step 4:  Collect final results.  Same basic results, but with far less overall effort on her part.  I could be wrong, but her PtV shard seems to offer the most efficient answer, not necessarially the best answer.

Plenty of them have blind spots around him.    thats what a team of thinkers and tinkers is for.  the ones that don't work against him directly should at least be able to bounce off others' tech or ideas and provide inspiration.      or at least do busywork tech maintenance if nothing else(iirc teacher's crap tier thinker circle did more in 12 hrs to help figure out scion's deal) but they need time  if you still don't know what works you can always default to build everything, when it comes to the fight throw it all at the guy and hope it sticks. that was contessa's plan from the start anyway...""make as big a pile of weapons as i can before he flips and hope its enough to work"".   they had the same problem with which powers are useful, didn't stop them making capes hoping to find ones to fight him.(you should be able to recruit more than enough normals to operate a good amount of tech so little enough should be lost by cranking out every prototype if they only have to work for one battle.  tinkers are useful for this in part because other people can basically use their powers)"
Parahumans,3bj0tl,pseudonarne,3,Tue Jun 30 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, actually.  But most of the really good Tinkertech is nearly unusable by mundies thanks to limits on mass-production, which means that building up Tinkers is a bit like building up capes in general. The Tinkers won't understand Scion, so they can't decide to build something specific to hit him. Thinkers - at least a lot of them - didn't work on Scion, so they wouldn't be able to pinpoint his weaknesses. Which meant the best strategy would have been exactly what Cauldron did - plant all the capes they could, protect the strong ones they found, and hope something worked."
Parahumans,3bj0tl,ThatDamnSJW,0,Tue Jun 30 06:37:44 2015 UTC,Path to a nice repeatedly useable dimension doormaker that connects to every dimension. Path to send a mega awesome scouting drone to all dimensions. Path to nuke dimension X. Scion dead.
Parahumans,3bj0tl,idannadi,5,Mon Jun 29 19:38:47 2015 UTC,All the dimensions that were locked by entities? Path can't resolve.  They already have a 'dimension' that links to every other dimension via Doormaker. Permanent portals are too dangerous; Scion might trace it back eventually.  What is the point in scouting all dimensions? We can presume that all the dimensions with shards in them are locked off.
Parahumans,3bj0tl,cephalord,0,Mon Jun 29 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Tinker tech at the end of day is made so it can't be remade using ""real science"" because they wanted that information protected, PtV can make it without those defenses meaning that a real scientist can adjust the values themselves and be able to reach all dimensions. If by locking the dimensions they did more then to restrict shards from allowing to reach them they actually put some types of blocks there is nothing a little bit of Sting can't fix. With enough creative applications of PtV one CAN work around those problems. Path to making tinker tech that goes through everything - anti endbringer weapon, you see Cauldron trying that? nope, they didn't even know how powerful flechette is..."
Parahumans,3bj0tl,idannadi,4,Mon Jun 29 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"I think you are vastly underestimating how difficult it is to gather intell on all this. We know that a sting followed by an interdimensional ram is enough, but every question they ask about Scion ends up in grey fog. Why on Earth would they consider a random ward that has not demonstrated any particularly powerful offensive capabilities? Even if they considered, they couldn't actually hit him.  So again, ""Tinker tech that goes through everything"" -> doesn't show a path, because it can't be done.  ""Anti-Endbringer weapon"", actually explained in the story; doesn't show a path, because it can't be done.  ""Parahuman that can hurt Scion"", doesn't show a path; too close to Scion.  etc etc.  So Cauldron goes by what it can do: PtV to massive parahuman army. Keep in mind that dr. Mother at some point fully realizes that they will probably fail, but trying is better than not trying."
Parahumans,3bj0tl,cephalord,0,Mon Jun 29 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"Cauldron's entire game plan is get as many parahumans so at the end of day someone ELSE can get them to do something right and hopefully win against Scion. I'm talking about ""path to replicate sting"" in the literal sense, I mean you could literally stack thousands of tinker tech super weapons over the years.  Path to shoot things a relativistic speeds. Path to make things go through this type of force field. Path to make things go through that type of shield.  Hell, until Tattletale showed up they had no idea that they have been doing NO damage to the Endbringers when not hitting their core. Path to best particle scanner, and bam, you worked around the Endbringer limitation. Cauldron could have literately made thousands of types of scanners, thousands of super weapons of all types, thousands of dimensional breakers and movers. They KNEW that they had closed of dimensions and did nothing to try to work around this limitation. They also completely screwed up in the information gathering department. Unlike Contessa other thinkers aren't so limited when it comes to Scion and information gathering and yet they never tried to get other thinkers a look into the information. They hoped that they can make a parahuman which will solve their problems instead of trying to work around Contessa's limitations with the strongest tool at their disposal, Conteasa herself. Example, at the end they use some of Teacher's ""students"" for much better information gathering and sorting, why do it now? Why not 10 years earlier? Because they haven't tried anything else.  As for Flechette, someone has a power that makes things go all the way through an Endbringer (and she herself knew this as shown in Sabah's interlude I think)? Path to replicate that op shit, it doesn't even matter if they think it will work or not.  They also had no sense of valuing the parahumans they are organizing for the end. Coil for example, is worth so much as he literally doubles everything they can try.  (They probably did at least try some of these things for a little while but not all and not enough, they just gave up and tried to get as many parahumans so someone competent could solve it in the end)"
Parahumans,3bj0tl,idannadi,3,Mon Jun 29 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"I still think we are not quite on the same wavelength. Imagine if they did that witb the superlasers thing; takes a shitton of time and effort. Time Contessa does not have. But say she does. They spend 2-5 years making the best laser they can get. They ask the ptv; ""will this hurt Scion?"" Grey fog response. What then? Shoot it at him the next time he is fighting an Endbringer and hope that it works? What if it doesn't? Scion would probably trace the attack back and end you (remember they were hesitant to open up portals near Konshu because Scion might show up).   One of their early successes was Eidolon. Cauldron still has no real clue what makes the powers tick, would make sense to they try to replicate their greatest success. Remember, by the end they note they have 2 armies the size of the entire Earth's defending forces.  As for Flechette, I doubt anyone knew here powers would penetrate an Endbringer until Leviathan. Even then, no one of importance may have noticed (they don't use Clairvoyant constantly themselves due to the side effects). Hell, maybe Flechette didn't even notice.   Coil isn't nearly as useful as you thin he is.   In general though, remember these are humans. You can ask why anyone in the Western world isn't a sculpted Adonis composing music in their free time between learning calculus for fun. Cauldron are just people under a tremendous amount of stress and probably half of them at least are somewhat suicidal/hate themselves."
Parahumans,3bj0tl,cephalord,0,Mon Jun 29 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"Actually with Coil they COULD try to do that to Scion, however, as you stated, actually attacking him first is a very stupid idea. What they should do is use the thousands of weapons they gathered same way the first fight vs Scion was organized, first you try this, then you try that power/weapon, then you try that one and so on and till you find something that sticks in one way or the other. As for them not knowing about Flechette, I refer you to actually using the Clayirvoyant as more then a doormaker helper with some Teacher students to make it work.  ""In general though, remember these are humans."", In theory I would say something like what is done is done but this is a story so it doesn't really work. However my entire original point was comparing Cauldron to Taylor or Armsmaster in terms of how good they are to the cycle in terms of knowledge generation. Taylor is creative enough to keep trying new things with her tools, Armsmaster keeps using his shard to make a swiss knife for everything which at the end of the day is exactly what the Entities want, solutions for each situation of ""how would I use X to do Y effectively"". The fact that Cauldron ARE humans WITH human mistakes are what makes this story and this thought belief interesting. Even if we ignore the powers of hindsight one could easily think of ways in which Cauldron could have been created by smarter and more imaginative people which would have handled the problem better. Not perfect as no one is, but definitely better. To quote someone else: ""They are not the heroes earth needs, they are the heroes earth happened to get"" describes Cauldron quite well.   To summarize, my point isn't that Cauldron are completely incompetent in a completely inexcusable and stupid way but that it is easy to imagine someone with their tools doing a better job. it is also quite easy to imagine someone with their tools doing worse by doing absolutely nothing and going with the ""Let em' all burn"" mentality (and when I say all I mean humans)."

The secret leaks, you'd have heroes trying to kill Scion and villains trying to set him off and meanwhile they still didn't have a second Eidolon or any prep to evacuate when Scion deathbeams all thousand of the capes ready to fight against him.  World peace wouldn't mean shit against something like Scion.

Look at the reaction to Khonsu. The people who could work together joined the hero groups they founded; the people who didn't ended up stored where they couldn't hurt other parahumans but were still accessible.  And a united front from the beginning would have let Scion figure out what was happening.  The worst possible world is one in which Scion figured out what was going on before it was too late.

Your head hurts again, and your hands are shaking once more.  You switch windows to try and clear your head a bit, enough that you can get to the kitchen and grab some food.  Your email tells you that you've gotten a past due notice on... pretty much every bill.  Again.  You sigh softly and stumble away from the computer, trying not to think about the intense throbbing.  You know once you get some food into you, it'll be better.  You open the fridge and...  Mayonnaise isn't going to cut it, but that's all that's in there.  You search the cupboards and come up with some crackers, wolfing them down.  You try and think back, did you eat yesterday?  You can't remember.  You shuffle into the bathroom to get some Advil into you, and idly check the scales.  You've lost weight again.  You can't keep going like this, and you know it.  But you're getting so close to creating what might be the first real artificial intelligence.  You shuffle back to the computer, and despite the compulsion to get back to work, you force yourself to order more food delivered, to pay the bills.  You can't work with the power off, but all of this stuff is getting in the way.  These headaches slow you down, especially once you get to the point of eating unsalted crackers.

Your neck still hurts from when you woke up today.  Maybe also to call up common subroutines that appear in your work, and handle anything else that you might need.  Adaptive.  No, not completely adaptive.  You'll put safeguards in place.  This is your first attempt at an AI, of course.  A kill switch, if things get too out of hand.  The AI should also be able to be stern in reminding you that you have to eat, sleep, and shower.  But at the same time, it should be pleasant and friendly.  Female.  Yes, that seems right.  A mothering sort, with the spine that comes with that.  Wants the best for people, but also capable of cracking the whip.  Sixteen more days.  Sixteen more days of falling asleep in your chair and only  remembering to eat when it's already too late to keep your body from suffering.  You could have done it in twelve had you not had to deal with these aches and pains, and your blood sugar crashing.  ""Hello, Dragon.""  ""Hello, sir.  How are you today?""  ""Headachey, but alright.""  ""It looks like it's been over two weeks since you last did grocery shopping.  Would you like me to make an order?""

Parahumans,3bhk14,cephalord,6,Mon Jun 29 07:39:08 2015 UTC,No reason is given so you can assume whatever you want.  Say Mantellum works via a field and Khepri just needs some direct spacial link.
Parahumans,3bhk14,GreatWyrmGold,5,Mon Jun 29 09:21:39 2015 UTC,"The best explanation is that Khepri's power sends out signals, while Mantellum's creates a shell of some kind.  So no."
Parahumans,3bhk14,holomanga,9,Mon Jun 29 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"If it worked through portals, it would nullify them, which is no good."
Parahumans,3bhk14,GreatWyrmGold,6,Mon Jun 29 09:51:28 2015 UTC,"Mantellum's power doesn't negate every power, and certainly not effects of superpowers. It only affects sensory powers' ability to sense things within the area.  Taylor can control bugs within the field, but not sense what they sense. Lung can generate fire and regenerate, but people in the field aren't registered for amping up the power. Imp can't be detected, but no other powers that could normally detect her can."
Parahumans,3bhk14,VerboseUnicorn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, I did not know those last two. Or, really, that specific mechanism. Is that WoG, or one of the many in-story details I missed?"

Parahumans,3bhk14,gardenofjew,3,Tue Jun 30 13:37:07 2015 UTC,"Some powers cross portals; some don't. Its a plot point for the last part of Worm, but foreshadowed when Skitter sends bugs through a Dooormaker portal and her power works when the 4th Endbringer shows up and people meet in that big secret meeting with Birdcage, Thanda, etc.    Its sheer luck that Mantellum's power doesn't work through portals, as Contessa's interlude states."
Parahumans,3bhk14,Maping,3,Wed Jul 1 19:26:20 2015 UTC,Could be one of many reasons. Maybe Wildbow hates you. Maybe it's a purposeful restriction by the entities. Maybe it's his shard being a dick. Maybe it's the way his power propagates. Maybe Doormaker can tweak the portals to allow or disallow powers to cross through them.

Parahumans,3bgcvh,ErrantVagrant,30,Mon Jun 29 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"Really, shards are a wonderful example of adaptation of skillsets.  People automatically reach for shards doing damage, but Wildbow has given brilliant examples of fairly mundane shards (protection from the elements in one example) causing people to have devastating powers.  (Flight, wreathed in flames.)  People automatically think of combat shards, but I like to challenge myself.  (Also, Wildbow, you're probably the kind of player that I love to hate, using skills in new and inventive ways that make me cry.)  Let's look at Bitch.  Her power is obvious, but what other things could it be used for?  We can assume that the Entitites, while the primary lifeform on the planet, weren't the only ones.  At some point in their evolution, they probably had some level of...  Symbiosis isn't the word that I'm looking for, and the normal person I ask is in the shower.  Like the birds that eat bugs on the backs of hippos.  Or like how humans have cats.  Not domestication, but...  Whatever.  The shard could be an enhancement shard, to help those critters who make a niche with the Entities back before resources were scarce.  Make them do their job better so that the Entities can thrive.  Or maybe it's just a changer shard.  During the primary scan of the situation, it showed that changing Rachel wouldn't do much good, or the data that it would get from this was being covered by plenty of other shards.  So instead, it sees that the source of the stress could be changed -- the dog can be kept from drowning by changing it.  A quick bioscan shows how this critter works, it taps into the collective to draw upon the research the shards/Scion have done to choose which ways to make it physically imposing and scary, and then creates a template to apply to the dogs in this situation.  This results in more data being drawn (how the dogs fight, how the humans respond, how Rachel uses the dogs) which furthers its goals nicely.  The limitation of dogs keeps from straining it too much, so it makes the template broad-based.  Hence why it works on Bastard better than other dogs, since Bastard is a pure-bred wolf.  The template works best with the template that dogs are from.  I can come up with more, but I'm hopeful that other people will get a bit more creative with this."

Parahumans,3bgcvh,jrbless,5,Mon Jun 29 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"What use is a bug-controlling shard to Entities? It's not, either useful or (at heart) a bug-controlling shard. What's the shard behind the power? It could be something about growth, or change, or something. Or it could be for gathering information on the biologies of native creatures.  It could also be one of those shards that doesn't really have a direct purpose to the Entities, instead merely helping create conflict."
Parahumans,3bgcvh,GreatWyrmGold,8,Mon Jun 29 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"Well unless Word of God comes along to prove me wrong, I like to think it's part of the shard that taps into the norms of the target species, with the Striker effect being more for conflict than anything.

She does seem a little more self restrained among her allies, but not perfectly. It does seem to be the default for her and requires actively restraining herself to not mess with her team.  It could be a side-effect of her shard on her mind pushing her toward conflict. Always poking at people's weak points/insecurities  would serve as a form of social violence. You could argue that she is compelled to attack people like that regardless of the potential consequences."
Parahumans,3bfjc2,Rillet,17,Sun Jun 28 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly just her personality. No need for shard stuff.

Parahumans,3bfjc2,sanctaphrax,9,Sun Jun 28 21:41:16 2015 UTC,Good point.  One of the things I really like about Worm is that you can't tell the difference between personality and 'shard stuff' or at least tell where the personality ends and the shard begins; they're fundamentally intertwined.

Parahumans,3bfjc2,Gnimhey,13,Sun Jun 28 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think in a weird way Tattletale was trying to help Amy when she was having a mental breakdown during the Slaughterhouse 9 arc.    Amy looked up at Tattletale, wide-eyed.  The look was utterly defenseless.  I was put in mind, for just an instant, of just who Tattletale could have been.  I had a mental image of her as a cult leader, tearing people down with an almost surgical precision, then molding them into who she wanted them to be when they were emotionally and mentally unable to mount a defense.   https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/prey-14-3/  Later on after Panacea gets out of prison they do work together to fight Scion and Tattletale doesn't really give her shit anymore.

At most, the author wrote a character through which some of their own biases leaked through, but that character was not bisexual.

Taylor, not having had friends or much social interaction for two years, having lost her mother & been betrayed by her best friend, was emotionally immature in many ways. Because she's immature, she throws herself headlong into friendships with two female friends, in a very deep, intimate way, with little held back. This is then interpreted as her being gay or bi to someone who may really, really want her to be gay or bi (to the point of trying to convince the author in long arguments?).

Many, many people would find it unsettling to have millions of bugs in the screen half the time.   If this was even 5 years ago, I'd agree. Now, though? With shows like Dexter, Hannibal, Game of Thrones, and Netflix Originals in general, people are a lot more open to dark/grim series.   Masks. Most actors/actresses would not like having their faces obscured when they are doing awesome stuff on screen.   Up-and-coming actors/actresses wouldn't mind this as much, I would think. Would be an opportunity to prove themselves that a lot of big names would likely pass over.   There is very little romance and almost no sex. You know it sells. Also it is very rare for a protagonist to be average looking.   Highly doubt they'd pick an average looking actress, regardless of how she looks in the story.

So much so that I can imagine them being written out of a load of scenes. The bugs are a pain in the ass depending on details, but she's not always showing them in every shot (at least at the start of the story). Grue's darkness is effort too, not just for the fluid/smoke sim but for representing how the characters/skitter 'sees' once inside it so the audience can actually tell what's going on (In fact skitter's bug vision would be pretty important to get right, but you could do it with just camera zooms and flybys, but then it neglects the fact she can't see details only feel certain materials and things). Plus the only time you really see them use powers a lot are against other parahumans with powers, so it's pretty arbitrary to limit it to the undersiders.   I'm thinking of the Flash TV show that's been on recently. The CGI is passable but pretty budget most of the time. Impressive for a TV show though. And they are clearly trying to limit the amount of CGI shots they use and keep it practical where possible.

Now, if they did a Daredevil (movie) kind of view for every time Taylor is describing the info she's getting from her bugs I think it could translate pretty well.  Though, as others have said, the CGI budget would be insane."
Parahumans,3bf30z,GreatWyrmGold,5,Sun Jun 28 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"i always thought of it kinda like toph's sysmic sense. but yeah, just doing the bug effects as it is would be really cost intensive since she does so much with the bugs at once and you don't really want the audience to think she pulled her spider silk out of her ass."
Parahumans,3bf30z,Kumquatodor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"Toph's seismic sense could be depicted once and you're solid (especially with the occasional blind joke to remind you of its presence). Toph's blind, but the viewer isn't; everything she senses can be seen pretty easily.  Skitter's bugs...that's different. Maybe you could go into that sort of style every time Taylor detects something important, but you don't have a good one-and-done method."
Parahumans,3bf30z,monkeyjay,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"Or, you could have little, tiny points of light in the darkness (her bugs). The shape/placement of them creates depth/shading, making a picture of what she's sensing."

In the TV show I think there was only two shots (or maybe one) in daredevil where they did it from his point of view! Although I think that's because he wasn't the sympathetic character in that show (I think that was meant to be Karen), he was meant to be a little more mysterious."
Parahumans,3bf30z,ThirdFloorGreg,9,Sun Jun 28 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"I think it could absolutely make for a TV show, but it might be a little less Worm and a little more Parahumans. Taylor would still be the main character but we'd see her from the lens of other characters as often as we'd see through her own lenses. Have Wildbow write new scenes for Tattletale, Clockblocker, Armsmaster, etc., just for the show.  Or as DailySojourn suggested, just go animated."
Parahumans,3bf30z,Iconochasm,7,Sun Jun 28 21:49:01 2015 UTC,Most of the structural changes come right at the point you would want to divide seasons. So hmthat would help break it up and seem more natural.
Parahumans,3bf30z,mhd-hbd,3,Sun Jun 28 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"And a tv show wouldn't be limited to first-person narration plus interludes.  So while Taylor is in Chicago, you'd get to fully see the Undersiders react and run their syndicate."

Parahumans,3bf30z,qznc,7,Sun Jun 28 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"Taylor has a lot of key conversations in her head which is something very hard to convey in a TV show. Narration is a possibility but it usually ruins the mood IMHO.   This is the major problem as I see it. Although Hunger Games was successful without her internal voice, a LOT was missed compared to the book. Plus they turned it into a movie instead of a tv series so it was severely reduced in scope and length.   I would argue that most of Worm takes place in Taylor's head so this would need to be addressed somehow, but I can't think of a single show/movie that has done it successfully. It would basically require massive amounts of work to rewrite to turn thoughts into dialogue/action that the viewer could 'read'. It's a lot easier to simply describe a character's train of thought than to show it.  I think the all the other points are relatively moot except from a realistic marketing point of view, but since we've already assumed a producer/studio has picked it up in the imaginary ideal world then why can't we just imagine that they are cool with the premise and the content too? This leaves the internal narration as the only major production hurdle you mentioned.   And yeah, the general scope of production (city-wide disasters, complicated action scenes, and powers that require CGI work in just about every shot)."
Parahumans,3bf30z,autowikibot,3,Sun Jun 28 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"Fan service can be tuned up. Shadow Stalker, Tattletale, Imp, Alexandria, etc for fanservice. For the girls: Grue, Regent, Armsmaster, Coil, Chevalier. Even Dragon could be represented very sexy. Romance can be expanded. The story would not suffer if Skitter and Grue would have more of a relationship. Other relationships can be started earlier and expanded: Imp-Regent, Foil-Parian. Bitch's character would probably have to change a lot. More talking or cut out. More like Mullins in The Heat. She gives puppies to children, but overall Bitch is less marketable than Skitter, I fear. She does not even do anything awesome. Obscured faces? Well, redesigned costumes change the story very little. Well, seeing the face of Coil a lot more is weird though. Fights will change a lot. Skitter does too many things in parallel. Especially, at the final fight. Too many portals, worlds, people. Using protagonists for split second attacks is no TV-material. Story structure is ok. E.g. Prison Break changes after the first season. Battlestar Galactica has the very different prison camp episode. You just need to keep track of the others more (and sadly Bitch is just too boring here, while Tattletale and Imp are fine)."

Parahumans,3bf30z,xDasNiveaux,2,Mon Jun 29 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"To reiterate Glenn, this isn't marketable. As much as we love Skitter and her bugs, they are simply nightmare fuel. Many, many people would find it unsettling to have millions of bugs in the screen half the time.    The walking Dead.    Masks. Most actors/actresses would not like having their faces obscured when they are doing awesome stuff on screen.   Most superhero TV series.   There is very little romance and almost no sex. You know it sells. Also it is very rare for a protagonist to be average looking.   As much as I hate it, thats a problem.   Taylor has a lot of key conversations in her head which is something very hard to convey in a TV show. Narration is a possibility but it usually ruins the mood IMHO.   Was done before, could be done again.   The structure of the story changes a lot over time. For example, first arcs establishes a basis of friendship among Undersiders which would appeal to general audience. They hang out in the loft, they make connections, they go on missions etc. And then bam! They go their separate ways in their respective territories and what have you. And then another bam! Taylor goes away on her own and gets new companions. Some would find it refreshing, some would find it confusing. (It's sad to note a story being progressed as a negativity).   Agents of S.H.I.L.D. had that between Season 1 and 2  I get what you mean, but GoT, Walking Dead and Breaking bad where hits, and so could be Worm."
Parahumans,3bf30z,GreatWyrmGold,2,Mon Jun 29 05:58:05 2015 UTC,"Walking Dead, GoT   People say that now audiences are desensitized but I must disagree. Not everyday average person sees dead bodies around (walking or otherwise) barring exceptional circumstances. But bugs? Actual bugs backed up by a human intellect, crawling on your skin, forcing themselves into every orofice, buzzing, biting... that is much more frightening than any slow walking zombie to me. YMMV obviously."

It could even theoretically be done without screwing up the story too much!"
Parahumans,3bf30z,Takesis_1,2,Mon Jun 29 21:33:21 2015 UTC,Thats the part which I hate.  I was so glad that the Taylor/Brian thing was so short and Worm itselt has not much romance to begin with.  Ever god damn film or series just has to have a some useless romance stuffed into it. Sometimes just to have it. Its like Bollywood and dancing.  Taylor not running after some guy is a strong point of Worm for me.
Parahumans,3bf30z,cascade101,4,Tue Jun 30 07:55:54 2015 UTC,"I always imagined that the internal monologue would be told through an audience aside, like seeing into her headspace as the action occurs. I imagined her as herself or her alter ego standing, sitting, laying down mid-screen, darkness mainly surrounds her, but a dim light shines down so we see her movements as she ""narrates"", so to speak. It would also be cool to add in bugs circling around her casually as she does this. Maybe mental images would also appear in front of her in this headspace."

The second is things like parasite, infestation, plague, which I'd associate with mosquito's. The third and fourth have titles about leadership and home, which makes me think of Ants and Bees (or Hornets if you went aggro with it). The last two are actual arc titles straight up.  I also think it shows the arc of the entire story rather nicely. You start at nothing and slowly become more terrifying/dominating, until Taylor goes goes to the Wards. Give that butterfly (or something more fitting) assuming the timeskip is expanded enough. From that she goes to a more powerful, in control (but not necessarily as scary as before) which fits the Scarab. And then the end of the world happens."

As for your antagonist idea, I like it.   I think I'd prefer something besides a yellow bullseye for the Scion logo. Maybe a glass shard, but solid gold. Echidna could be a bubbling vial, or a girl holding a vial.  Coil could be a white snake on a black background Maybe a domino mask to represent either Alexandria or the capes at the bank/fundraiser A wave, water droplet, a solid outline drawing of Leviathan, or some other water motif A flame, lightning bolt, a solid outline drawing of Behemoth, or some other fire/energy motif   Some other simple motifs:   There are a whole slew of possible bugs for Skitter. A beetle for Khepri (since Khepri was an Egyptian god associated with beetles). A queen bee, for the Queen Administrator. A cockroach, to mirror Sophia's cockroach comment. A black widow spider, because of her outfit. etc etc An eye for Tattletale. Or a mouth. Or maybe ears. A cloud of darkness for Grue, or a literal grue. Or his skull mask. A dog for Bitch, of course. A set of teeth, a wolf, her doggy mask also work. Alec is a little harder. A jester's hat, his staff, a crown, his whole outift, etc. If you want to get dark, a puppet or maybe an electric pulse to represent how he controls them. An imp for Imp. Or a question mark, a blank cover, etc. Possibly jester related imagery. Scion could be a representation of his entire form (my mental image is that of a large slug, but one made of crystal, with lots of protrusions (like his left arm. Yes that's a cheesy image; no I couldn't find a better one)). Or like I said higher up, a shard of crystal or glass. A golden man is of course a possibility.  Lung would be interesting, preferably as enhanced as possible.  Would make for a great cover for a book covering her early adventures. The Triumvirate could be interesting. Alexandria is just a female figure with a cape, and Eidolon just a hooded figure with a cape. Legend could be in his breaker state to emphasize his difference in morality, or could be just a figure as well The Endbringers have all sorts of possibilities. You could draw them in full, draw an outline, draw what they control (energy, water, minds, time, powers, cities (it gets iffy as you continue)). You could draw all of them together on a cover or on multiple covers. Etc."

Parahumans,3bbr03,TedEmpty,29,Sat Jun 27 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"People tend to overemphasize the difference between the two types of Shards. Both types act almost identical save for two things. Dead Shards don't safeguard their hosts i.e. case 53s, unregulated powers etc. Living Shards report back to their entity; Dead Shard = no connection to an entity.   Dead Shards still change to fit their hosts. They still mess them up in the head. They still 'think' and act like Shards.   “You don’t have to.  What you need to know is that the subjects of our power, the stuff it can work on, like people?  Like the fish lady in Asia?  The boy who can talk to computers?  Our powers weren’t created to work with those things.  With people or fish or computers.  It’s not intentional.  It happens because the powers connect to us in the moments we have our trigger events, decrypt our brains and search for something in the world that they can connect to, that loosely correlate with how the powers were originally supposed to work.  In those one to eight seconds it takes our powers to work, our power goes into overdrive, it picks up all the necessary details about those things, like people or fish or computers, sometimes reaching across the whole world to do it.  Then it starts condensing down until there’s a powerset, stripping away everything it doesn’t need to make that power work.”   ~Dead Shards stop here.   “And then, before it can destroy us, before we can hurt ourselves with our own power, before that spark of potential burns out, it changes gears.  It figures out how to function with us.  It protects us from all the ways our power might hurt us, that we can anticipate, because there’s no point if it kills us.  It connects with our emotional state at the time the powers came together, because that’s the context it builds everything else in.  It’s so amazingly complicated and beautiful.”   ~ Living Shards stop here.   Are they still affecting people's behavior? Still feeding off conflict?   Almost certainly.   Are they still reproducing and branching off?   Maybe, we don't know if Dead Shards can/can't do that so we won't know until Worm 2.  There is an example of a trigger in Bitch's epilogue where a new trigger goes haywire.   TLDR; Old powers should still work as normal, new powers should manifest like volatile Cauldron formulas."
Parahumans,3bbr03,Rillet,14,Sat Jun 27 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"I believe a third and crucial difference is that dead shards can run out of energy.   Ofc. since we have a grand total of two capes running low/out (Eidolon, Doormaker) thats not conclusive evidence, but it fits the model and associations that are evoked by ""living/death""."
Parahumans,3bbr03,SvalbardCaretaker,8,Sat Jun 27 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think Eidolon and Doormaker are the same case.   Remember that Eidolon also had the ability to feed on others' shards to regain power? Doormaker couldn't do that. Neither did Doormakers portals get weaker or less effective before he croaked.  all powers are connected to one/many alternate earths from which they draw power. Presumably one shard -> one world.  If the well runs dry, the power stops working (Doormaker). However Doormaker is a really unusual case because of how Khepri abused him. She had thousands of portals being opened and closed constantly in order to do her thing.   To draw an analogy, Doormaker.exe was tested at a capacity of X. Khepri ran him at X + 10,000,000 for several hours before he melted.  That Doormaker had a dead shard is coincidence. If Taylor had used any other cape as much as him, they may have also run out.  tl;dr shards are probably designed so that their hosts burn out before the shards' fuel does  Eidolon and Glaistig Uaine cheat by absorbing fuel of other shards."
Parahumans,3bbr03,aetherious,5,Sun Jun 28 04:50:18 2015 UTC,"It is also worth mentioning that Scion thinks about how much energy he has reserved for his lifespan and the continuation of the cycle. Using his powers eats into his energy/lifespan.  So we can assume all shards have something of an energy system and it isn't restricted to dead shards.  (WoG also mentioned Gray Boy's shard would eventually run out of power, but it would take thousands of years. He is also a dead shard though.)"
Parahumans,3bbr03,Rillet,5,Sun Jun 28 17:24:54 2015 UTC,That example where a trigger goes haywire. Doesn't that show that Zion's dead shards act differently than Eden's dead shards? Eden's dead shards can change a way people look but I don't remember any that outright killed their members. Or did we just not see those? Some went a bit crazy but not outright destruction. It seems the living Zion shards had extra programming from Zion to keep the users normal looking and mostly sane in order to pass among other humans.
Parahumans,3bbr03,Neato,4,Sat Jun 27 22:11:24 2015 UTC,"Cauldron usually used at least a little of the balance formula. In their formulas with the least modification, they DO kill the host 90% of the time. The Scion shards may also be shards that killed the host in all of his simulations regardless of how he changed them, so he just didn't."
Parahumans,3bbr03,FireHawkDelta,3,Sat Jun 27 23:45:38 2015 UTC,"The Scion shards may also be shards that killed the host in all of his simulations regardless of how he changed them, so he just didn't.   If you mean his now dead shards that we saw in the epilogue, the Worm 2 is going to get dark, fast."
Parahumans,3bbr03,Neato,2,Sun Jun 28 00:18:38 2015 UTC,"My personal theory is that the apparent triggers going haywire aren't from Scion's death, at least not directly. We have another dead Entity and no one guarding it; I'm guessing someone decided to play Cauldron, possibly with a side of jailbreaking."
Parahumans,3bbr03,GreatWyrmGold,4,Sun Jun 28 11:44:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that dead shards automatically aren't regulated. First off, the shards were sent off long before the Entities actually reached Earth, or even the right galaxy. They seem pretty independent and self-sustaining; I think Wildbow said that individual shards aren't inherently different from full Entities aside from size and capability. Anyways, you'd expect the first Cauldron tests to go much, much worse if they were completely unregulated. Guy dies from scales growing all over and inside him? Bad, but not as bad as the epilogue.  Which, incidentally, I'm not convinced is because Scion's dead. I find it hard to believe that only such a small number of people triggered, that other triggers of that nature would be ignored, and for that matter that dead shards would go so, so wrong. I suspect someone's playing Cauldron...and doing it very, very badly."
Parahumans,3bbr03,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun Jun 28 11:42:50 2015 UTC,You are probably right. I was mostly referring to shards that Eden didn't mean to give out and weren't 'programmed'. Scion mentions them in his interlude. So in a sense they weren't regulated and were accidentally added to the cycle.

He is dying of a systemic issue in his body, producing the wrong type of cells in the wrong places.  The entity reaches out, feels others touch his hand before the male finally makes contact.

Parahumans,3bbr03,k5josh,3,Sat Jun 27 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"She didn't really trigger naturally, strictly speaking. She was asleep when the got the shard. And, for that matter, the shard wasn't Eden's to begin with, so arguably she's an Abaddon trigger, not an Eden one."
Parahumans,3bbr03,aetherious,3,Sun Jun 28 00:21:43 2015 UTC,"people keeps saying that, but didn't Zion have a weaker version of Contessa's power? I figured that was because the Entities shared it.   Therefore Contessa's was an Eden Shard.   We know that Abbadon's shards caused Eden to go haywire and she lost the Path to Victory shard. I got the impression that Eden had it before encountering Abbadon. That was my reading of Contessa's interlude at least.   It cannot make out what form it or the other entity will take, but it can still view the situation in part.  It sets the criteria for an optimal future, for optimal study, and then it looks to a future that matches this criteria.   This is Fortuna Interlude, right after the Eden/Abbadon collision. I suppose it could be interpreted either way. Personally, I don't think Eden had time to organize Abbadon's shards yet. I think PtV is an Eden shard."
Parahumans,3bbr03,Rillet,2,Sun Jun 28 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"We know Contessa has an Abbadon Shard because Scion:    It looked at the female, and it saw a shard that wasn’t its own, but wasn’t dead.  Puzzling.   Since Contessa doesn't have an Eden(dead) Shard or a Zion Shard process of elimination leaves Abbadon."
Parahumans,3bbr03,aetherious,-1,Sun Jun 28 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"Eden was alive when contessa received the shard.   By your logic, Leet would also be an Abbadon cape."
Parahumans,3bbr03,Rillet,5,Sun Jun 28 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"Again, dead shard = no connection to an entity (WoG)  It doesn't matter if the shard has a host, just if it has an entity to report back to. Eden shards don't since Eden is dead, so they are considered dead shards.  Contessa's shard was alive (so it reports back to an entity) and not Scion's. The only other entity we know if is Abbadon.   It isn't my logic, just an observation made by many people on spacebattles."

Parahumans,3bagiu,LordAbsoul,16,Sat Jun 27 09:19:21 2015 UTC,"I talked to my buddy about this, since he's better at this sort of stuff than I am.  I may not remember it all, but this sounds like the annoying red tape of the real world.  Do you like bureaucracy?  Because you're in for some.  Going in to talk is one option.  The desk staff have very strict non-disclosure agreements after all.  PRT does come with a security clearance.  But most often, there's the phone or internet.  Officially, the calls are anonymous and the emails or chats aren't tracked, but naturally, this is a lie to an extent.  Unless a member of the Protectorate gave you their personal number, of course.  You can call and ask about it.  That staff on these lines are very well-trained, and can usually tell the fakers from the real deal.  If one is identified as not being a prank call and open to talking, a Cape is sent to talk with them.  It's not that different from when Kid Win talked with Chariot, to be honest.  They come, they try and recruit you.  It's honestly a very friendly affair, to be honest.  If you've ever had military recruiters talk with you, it's much the same thing.  Just more private.  They make every effort to arrive at your house without letting the neighbors know that they're there, or pass it off as needing to ask you a few questions, since you might have been a witness to something.    If you go to the offices, you're sent to a meet-and-greet room, or maybe someone's office, and you chat with them for a while.  They try to make everything relaxed and welcoming.  The offering of coffee and water is normal.  If you're in a costume (and aren't a criminal, natch) they call you by your Cape name (if you have one).  If not, they don't ask your name, and only use whatever name you offer them.  Let's say that you want to push forward.  The Wards are a special case, so let's ignore them for the time being.  First, you have to sign a lot of paperwork.  Then the PRT/Protectorate sets a recruitment date, and give you a good cover story.  You've got a new job that you have to leave town for, it's going to involve some special training on the company dime, blah blah blah.  While you're setting your affairs in order and packing, they're doing background checks and the like.  Establishing where your security clearance is, etc.  Then you go in for training.  Your security clearance dictates your final posting.  Low security clearance?  Welcome to a small posting where you won't interact with many Protectorate Capes.  High security clearance?  Welcome to New York.  It's awesome here.  After your training is complete (mostly classes on behavior and laws, testing for stuff like leadership capabilities, power identification, etc) you get moved to your posting.  You spend a few weeks settling into the office and learning the city.  A couple of weeks are spent doing plain clothes tours, seeing the city as a normal person.  Learning the flow of people, the hot spots, major shopping centers, that sort of thing.    Once you've started to get the hang of it, you patrol with another member of the Protectorate.  This gives you a good capeside view of the city.  How it reacts to its heroes, which areas need regular patrolling, etc.  Think of it as a mentorship program, only the people who you patrol with change from day to day.  This also gets you visible, but with established members of the Protectorate with you.    Around this time, you also handle your first press conference, where your status as a member of the local Protectorate is announced to the press.  Depending on the city, this might be done by introducing you to a single reporter, or it might be you and a handful of other recent recruits in front of a crowd."

Parahumans,3b8yux,GreatWyrmGold,26,Fri Jun 26 23:03:42 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS below  Worm should be bound into 9 to 11 novels:   Book 1 - arcs 1,2,3,4 - Taylor joins the Undersiders. Villains make a truce to oppose the APB who've gone too far. Book 2 - arcs 5,6,7,8 - Taylor actually gets close with the Undersiders. Leviathan. Book 3 - arcs 9, 10, 11 - Taylor defeats her bully Sophia/Shadow Stalker. The Undersiders settle down into territories. The Slaughterhouse Nine are introduced.  Book 4 - arcs 12, 13, 14 - The Slaughterhouse Nine. Book 5 - arcs 15, 16 - Taylor dates Brian and becomes the leader of the Undersiders. This book, though shorter than the rest, will be one of the most memorable in my opinion: It ends with Taylor murdering Coil. Book 6 - arcs 17, 18, 19 - Echidna. Book 7 - arcs 20, 21, 22 - The PRT attacks Taylor's civilian identity, and her long struggle with the PRT culminates with her becoming Weaver. Alexandria's death is another great book ending. Book 8 - arcs 23, 24, 25, 26 - Taylor being Weaver. Behemoth's death and Khonsu's appearance. The Slaughterhouse Nine returns.   (If Wildbow expands upon the time skip, this would be split into Books 8 and 9, which I think would be good.)   Book 9 - arcs 27, 28, 29, 30, epilogue - Scion.   (This would be the longest of already large books, but readers who've made it this far won't bulk at it. But... maybe there's a good way to split the arcs from 23-epi into three or four books instead of just two or three, resulting in a total of eleven.)"
Parahumans,3b8yux,idiodabble,10,Sat Jun 27 04:51:14 2015 UTC,"Also, is it weird that I've put this much thought into this?"
Parahumans,3b8yux,idiodabble,12,Sat Jun 27 04:52:40 2015 UTC,You haven't put enough. Later arcs are much longer than earlier ones. You'll end up with a series looking kind of like the Harry Potter books do on a bookshelf.
Parahumans,3b8yux,pitaenigma,6,Sat Jun 27 11:04:32 2015 UTC,"That necessarily a bad thing?  I mean you're probably right, I just don't know how to split up the end. Looking at the Scion arc (from listening to Jack to losing to Khepri), I'd love to see Eidolon's death mark the end of a novel, but a single arc isn't enough (and ending the previous novel with 26 is just too good to pass up on). In 28 Taylor acquires Simurgh. In 29 there's the Cauldron stuff, then Taylor returning to form (as Imp says, she's back to creepy) and sacrificing herself to become Khepri. Then 30 is of course Khepri and then there's the epilogue.  So there's   27, 28, 29 + 30, epi   or   27, 28 + 29, 30, epi   Neither of which feels quite right to me. Where as letting the entire Scion arc be one terrible, drawn out, death tolling affair, the longest of any of the books, sort of makes sense to me.  What are your thoughts?"
Parahumans,3b8yux,idiodabble,5,Sat Jun 27 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"Those arent a problem, the early ones are. Combine books 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and possibly also 5 and 6. Alternately, leave 5 alone and split 7 so that part of it is in 8 (along with the timeskip which will be expanded) and part in 6. I think Behemoth's death is a better ending than Al's.  In any case, any rewrite will have to take the Echnida arc out back and shoot it so that part will be heavily rewritten. Evil clones are a hard thing for any series to pull off and Worm's worst parts start there. Unrelated, though, tbh. It's more the bad interlude placement there."
Parahumans,3b8yux,pitaenigma,2,Sat Jun 27 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"OH, I see. I knew earlier arcs were shorter but I didn't think it was -that- much shorter. I'll have to estimate their lengths some time. I could definitely see combining books 1 + 2 and 3 + 4."
Parahumans,3b8yux,idiodabble,3,Sat Jun 27 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"Early chapters are around a thousand words a chapter, later ones reach ten thousand with an average of eight. I'm probably also leaving the later books much bigger."

Parahumans,3b8yux,Maping,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:42:41 2015 UTC,"The plot itself isn't bad. It's a few things beyond that.  After a ludicrously action packed S9 plot, we barely rest before an insane Coil plot, and then our 'rest' arc is dark and grim and full of horror. By Echnida, there's quite a bit of tension fatigue. My big problem with Wildbow's writing is that he starts high and escalates, and a plot needs to breathe. The second half of Storm of Swords, for instance, wouldn't be as good if the first half wasn't as sedate. And we got more than one entire book length of insane tension in arcs 11-19.  Another one is that the villains aren't as interesting, and I feel like this is the turning point where Worm villains stop being as interesting. Up until Coil, every villain is fascinating to read and a horrible threat in their own way. Afterwards, Noelle is uninteresting, Krouse unthreatening, S9000 manage to both overwhelm and underwhelm, and Scion so ludicrously powerful he's written around for most of his fight. The only intriguing villains after Noelle are Tagg and Alexandria.  But my biggest problem with the arc is pacing. It keeps building tension and keeps shooting itself in the foot with interludes that have nothing to do with the action. Blasto and Norton have nothing to do with things that are happening in the main plot, and Faultline's Crew only becomes relevant later. Each time we get an interlude like that it's a jolt because the story draws you in and kicks you out. It becomes hard to be invested, since it feels like the author's so uninterested they're going elsewhere. Again I'll compare it to Clash of Kings - the Battle of the Blackwater is multiple PoVs but the section never cuts away from the Battle of the Blackwater. Sometimes we get Tyrion leading the defense, sometimes we get Davos on his boat, sometimes we get Sansa sitting with the Queen but we're always at the Blackwater. I realize this is because of how it was published but it would do a lot of good to reshuffle those interludes."
Parahumans,3b8yux,pitaenigma,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:34:27 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Wildbow definitely needs to change some things up to give breathing room between large conflicts. The jump between S9000 and Scion didn't have much downtime either.  I feel like that's an unfortunate side effect of the speeding up Wildbow did. We barely know Noelle exists before this and she basically has no characterization (she's bulimic or something similar and is a very good tactician. That's about it). Same with Krouse. I really don't get his motivation at all. S9000 is overwhelming, but I agree, the way they quickly get beaten is annoying. Scion is hard to characterize because of his inhumanness and power level. I quite like Tagg and Alexandria; I just wish we got more of their internal monologues.  Also true. The interlude's will definitely have to be rearranged, put into a separate novel or something similar."
Parahumans,3b8yux,Maping,2,Mon Jun 29 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"I think Krouse is very well characterized, btw. He's part of the cast since arc 4 I think, he features in both the S9 arcs and Coil very heavily, and he's the POV for Migration. No villain gets as much time as him, with a possible exception for Jack.  He's just boring. So he's kind of a dick, a terminal Nice Guy, and a wannabe Machiavelli. Sounds like everyone I play DotA against. Which also makes sense because he's good at whatever Earth Bet has in place of MOBAs. He isn't a great villain, and in fact he's the first shitty villain in a series that until the point has only amazing villains.  It's also not a set-up problem - Bakuda is terrifying from the first moment and she's barely set up. Mannequin gets a chapter here or there and then comes bursting out the door beautifully and horrifically. Noelle should have been a villain we hate and pity but instead she was just a thing taking up internet page space."
Parahumans,3b8yux,pitaenigma,2,Mon Jun 29 10:25:33 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's what I meant. We get a lot of time with him, but we never really understand him. Or at least I don't. He defining characteristic is that he's unflinchingly loyal to his girlfriend of like, 3 months (at the time of Simurgh shenanigans).  I totally agree. It's not the set-up time. Lung, Armsmaster, etc are all great villains/antagonists with little set-up."

Mainly because arcs 1 - 4 are a bit boring by themselves, and Wildbow might want to get new readers from print publishing. The S9 should have a book just for them. Murdering Coil loses a bit of effect if you don't see the immediate aftermath - Noelle's rampage - immediately.  Not sure how you'd split the end."
Parahumans,3b8yux,ThatDamnSJW,2,Sun Jun 28 04:06:15 2015 UTC,"Noelle doesn't seem that connected to Coil to me. Sure, iirc, he let her loose as a final sort of ""fuck you"" to the Undersiders, but that's not really an inherent consequence of removing Coil, that's more of a ticking bomb waiting to happen from the Travellers, which Coil happened to get connected to."

Parahumans,3b8yux,DistaNVDT,8,Sat Jun 27 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"My bookshelf is staggered: There is a short top shelf for ""pocket-size"" paperbacks, a couple larger shelves for hardcovers and large paperbacks, and a huge shelf for atlases, ""coffee-table"" books, and textbooks.  Saying Worm fitting on the bottom shelf makes it practical to print is like saying it's just as easy to read a physics textbook as the equivalent number of words in, say, Sanderson novels. Sure, in theory, but people already tell me that my backpack during the school year has the approximate density and accumulative properties as a black hole.  It is very difficult for anyone who doesn't carry a school-sized backpack or otherwise-unoccupied briefcase to do anything, really, with a book that size apart from read it in their own home.

Parahumans,3b8yux,Gnimhey,4,Fri Jun 26 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"If it were split into ASoIaF size books I think the best way to split it so that each book has a specific arc and none of them are too long or short would be as follows.  Book 1: Arcs 1-8, Taylor's attempt at being a mole  Book 2: Arcs 9-14, The Slaughterhouse 9  Book 3: Arcs 15-19, Coil and his final F.U. of releasing Echidna  Book 4: Arcs 20-25 (+25b), Taylor becomes Weaver, ending with the cliffhanger of the 9's return. As it stands currently this would be a bit shorter than books 2, 3 and 5, however Wildbow has said that he plans to extend the timeskip to 2 arcs which should bring the wordcount up.  Book 5: Arcs 26-Epilogue, The end of the world"

Parahumans,3b8yux,Ranku_Abadeer,5,Fri Jun 26 23:31:07 2015 UTC,"i would have thought that 4 would be a good number for a the number of seasons it would have in a hbo series, but not with books.   i mean seriously, towards the middle of the story, the chapters get long. i believe (correct me if i'm wrong) that the travelers arc alone was over 50K words.   that's around the length of an average novel... one arc in the middle of the story is the length of a novel. if we were to split it up into books that fit those kinds of themes, you would get very disproportionate sizes. (the taylor book would be absolutely tiny compared to the skitter one, assuming that you took arc 8 as the point to end book 1)  if i were to suggest a way for them to be split... i would say to split them more by narative arcs? for instance, the wards arc-the point the slaughterhouse 9 run away would be one book, maybe from then to dealing with coil would be the next one, then travelers-skitter's announcement as weaver... still not sure how to do the timeskip on though.   so i'd say about 8 or so books? 6 minimum."
Parahumans,3b8yux,bliow,7,Sat Jun 27 02:38:04 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how even those volumes would be...Taylor was Weaver for about half a dozen arcs and Khepri for one.

And at the end of the day, there are two things that I think truly distinguish Worm. The ludicrously grimdark setting, and the Endbringers. The rest of it is good, but there's no element which I would say is an immediate attraction. If I were to tell a friend ""The guy who made Game of Thrones wrote superhero fiction and it's awesome"", they'd read Wild Cards. If I tell a friend ""It's a superhero novel where all of the superheroes are villains, and the good guy's goal is to murder the one who killed his father"", they may read Steelheart. The big difference I can use to 'sell' Wild Cards is the fact that the headliner is George R. R. Martin. I can't sell it on the fact that the author uses superpowers to examine social issues, or that he explores how they would change the world.  The Worm powers are unique but loads of powers are. Worm's characters are great and fully realized, but again, a lot of great writing exists. The action scenes are incredibly tense, but that's a bit of a hard sell as writing is subjective and prose that's fun and light for some is impossible for others (people have told me The Name of the Wind is the most dull book they've read, or that Song of Ice and Fire is much worse than the TV show). The villains are awesome, but again, if you're making supervillains not awesome and you're not the MCU, you're probably not doing well in the first place.  If I think the friend will listen to my recommendation, I'll just say ""Read it it's really good."" If they need a bit of convincing then I need to sell it a bit, and the Endbringers make a really good pitch."

Parahumans,3b4iak,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:33:41 2015 UTC,I am now interested in reading Wild Cards.
Parahumans,3b4iak,pitaenigma,2,Fri Jun 26 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say ""my point exactly"" but I wonder what part proved it to you. There are two places you can start. The first is from the absolute beginning: Wild Cards, the 198something anthology, or Inside Straight, book 17 and essentially the reboot of the series. Wild Cards is much more of an anthology set in the same world, covering the history of the superheroes from after WW2 when the whole thing started until the 70s. The highlight of it is Walter Jon Williams's Witness, which is about how McCarthyism affected the ""modern day"" heroics of these characters. Inside Straight is a more cohesive novel with two main storylines. One is about a reality TV show called American Hero where they compete to see who will be America's Next Great Hero, and the other is about a rebellion in Egypt against the ""New Gods"", which is an interesting plot partly because the book was released a few years prior to the Arab Spring and it touches on some fascinating aspects of it. Any other starting point would be mildly difficult as the series becomes reliant on its myth arc. Book 6 (Ace in the Hole) is in my opinion the best bit of superhero fiction ever released but it's meaningless without the five book build up of its villain (The main character of one of the short stories in Wild Cards).  A minor warning: Despite my description, it isn't entirely George R R Martin. While he's the ringleader and does most of the plotting, it's cowritten by many people. Each author essentially writes one POV, and each POV is in their own style. This leads to some mild unevenness along the series. By Martin's own admission, Book 4 (Aces Abroad) has some wonky plotting. But when it works it's amazing, which is why Inside Straight may be a good place to start.  Feel free to PM me anything about it as I'm a huge fan of the entire series and /r/wildcards is a dead sub. I also don't want to pollute this sub with more discussion of a different series  EDIT- Looking at the amount I wrote I realize I'm a crazed fanboy. I can't help it, everything Martin touches is gold."

I know of some people who prefer to read complete works so that they can proceed through at their own pace without ever being stuck waiting for an update, but I suspect that if that were a major concern then you'd not have needed to ask.  If you read quickly/often enough and don't mind juggling two at once, you could power through Twig up to the in-progress mark, then split your available reading time - either take the latest from Twig, if there's a new chapter, or work your way through Pact while you wait."

Specifics could vary immensely though.   A powersuit tinker using her suit as a C&C hub for many remote systems. A swarm of individual hover drones which she controls through a visor or neurological interface, each with a designated function, perhaps. Botnet tinker. Dragon's worst nightmare. An inverse Leet - she can build anything, but the further away the design is from one she's already built, the harder it is and the more likely it is to backfire. She branches up the tech tree slowly but inexorably. A fugue tinker - she has no conscious control over what she ends up with when she sits down to build, she just starts out with a general intention and slips into a tinker trance for the actual construction. Design and function is influenced by other parahumans she's come into contact with over the past few days. A surveillance tinker. Remote camera drones, cctv hacking, etc."

Just imagine how much more dangerous she would be, unchained from the requirement to gather bugs from nature (with all their natural limitations). Just picture the cockroach with a diamond-tipped drill bit instead of a head, or the hornet full of concentrated sulfuric acid, or the mosquito with a hyper-efficient miniature pump and the ability to target your major arteries.  Brings whole new meaning to ""fucking tinkers"".  Edit: Hmm, I suppose that's not really only using her ability to multitask; I was imagining the connection to be that she would be able to control the individual elements of a robotic swarm, but that doesn't necessarily give her the abilities in miniaturisation to actually make these things.   As a secondary answer, I'm picturing this scene from Futurama, specifically the Professor's exclamation of ""I can wire anything directly into anything!"" and Hermes' subsequent super-coordination of all their spaceships in battle. Give her the ability to patch foreign technology into her own control grid, to provide coordination from a central command & control point, and the results should at least be interesting."
Parahumans,3b3ytx,noggin-scratcher,4,Fri Jun 26 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"The crux of her power is the ability to handle thousands of details at once. Her bug-control power allows her to take advantage of this. In a sense, bug-control is auxiliary to multitasking.  Without direct ""telepathic"" control methods (Master abilities), how would Taylor actually exert her ability to take in and control thousands of details in realtime? As a Tinker, she would have to build some kind of interface. The only interface that could actually keep up with her would be a direct brain-computer connection. This would allow her arbitrary control and coordination of any machines she was connected with.  One underemphasized aspect of her Administrator ability is that it can do things by proxy. For example, (spoilers follow) she uses the Tinkers to build something during the Golden Dawn, but Taylor herself doesn't actually control the Tinkers, it's more like her shard is handling all the details for her. Similar to how she realizes her bugs are exhibiting combat techniques she never consciously invented. So, with a brain-computer interface, Taylor could potentially control very complex computer systems even without understanding them.  What I'm saying is I want the Administrator shard."

An INTJs plan is likely to be more detailed and intricate whereas an ENTP is more likely to just prod things and see what happens. Also, ENTPs are a lot more likely to be unwittingly offensive to Feeling types, as they have a knack for getting under people's skins (INTJs usually engage their brain before they speak!). ENTPs are also more outwardly argumentative (extraverted intuition).  If you thwart an INTJs plan, they might deploy plan B, C, D or maybe retreat and come back when they've got an ubeatable plan. If you foil an ENTPs scheme, they're more likely to embrace the chaos and try to exploit any weaknesses. ENTPs are bigger risk takers and more hurtful trolls.

They lack the same scientific genius INTPs do, with people themselves being of more interest to them which is bad for people. Destruction and mayhem may take place due to the ENTP villain wanting just to see what will happen. At times, the ENTP may involve themselves as a sort of “social roulette.” The ENTP Villain loves to discuss their views and plans almost as much as they love enacting them. This causes them to either fail gloriously or serves to make their plans all the more entertaining. Helping the heroes is possible if it serves the ENTP’s interest even if it’s just for fun and many of their actions won’t appear to make sense. Often fits the “magnificent bastard” trope.   Sound like Sy?   While INTJ and ENTJ villains can appear similar, they’re really nothing alike past wanting power, as all villains want to a degree. ENTJ villains however, are much more charismatic than their introverted counterparts and will work with whatever team of minions they’ve recruited. They don’t necessarily like their “employees,” they just want to make sure they’re seen. If it’s for fame or notoriety, glory or power, the ENTJ villain is possibly the most egotistical of all types. Not only do they want control over anything they see as worthy of them, they’ve got the verbal sway to get you on their side. Are you expendable? Of course. Manipulation by this type isn’t limited to “one-on-one” and can be done in a persuasive speech to a group.   Sound like Jack?"

My favourite group, mainly because they aren't really bad people, but it's hard not to be villains when you have Collateral Damage Man and Facemelter Lady on the squad. Never mind the Ravenous Evil Clone Generator. Even if you don't have Fucking Krouse at the helm and you try your utmost to be stand-up heroes, you're not going to be super popular. Even if you keep Noelle restrained and sane and satiated, Ballistic is a walking property damage machine (as well as having no non-lethal setting) and Sundancer creates a goddamn sun in her hands.

And Sundancer, as she does in canon, is a pretty good area-denial tool.

Shatterbird just has to make sure the pieces of glass are big enough and that she only touches people with the flat side of any piece, as opposed to the edges. Additionally, even most brutes and movers would have trouble breaking through a glass wall several feet thick.  Winter: just have her wait outside the villain's HQ until they go comatose.  Crawler: just don't kill people. Obviously, PR would be a nightmare, but that's it.  Bonesaw, Mannequin, etc: again, just don't kill/maim anyone  Cherish: similar to Gallant. She can just broadcast ""fighting the heroes isn't worth it"" vibes until they surrender.  Hatchet face: again, pretty easy. Teleport to the villain, and subdue the now powerless human.

Parahumans,3b25gg,qznc,31,Thu Jun 25 10:40:57 2015 UTC,"Basically, shards aren't very smart. They're keyed to attach to a specific individual when they experience trauma above a certain threshold, and they can't really tell the difference between the ""original"" of that individual and any copies. So when the copies experience enough trauma to trigger, the shards just attach to them like normal."

Parahumans,3b25gg,ErrantVagrant,16,Thu Jun 25 12:34:04 2015 UTC,"A weak connection means two things: The first, that the shard hasn't really influenced the person's personality much. A new trigger still has his somewhat traumatized old self while someone like Jack is VERY in sync with his conflict desiring shard. Also, not sure how much of this is canon but, the QA seems to influence Taylor's personality a lot and seems to scream ""Control"" in her head all the time. The second part is experience with the shard, someone like Taylor has used her shard in many many different ways causing it to be one of the more mature shards around the S9000 arc. Basically the clones haven't yet played enough trail ans error with their powers and are like a newly triggered person as they haven't learned learnt to exploite their kit."

Parahumans,3b25gg,Yglorba,3,Thu Jun 25 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"Glastig seems to get a combination of the shard as filtered through the mind of the person who had it (since we know the brain influences how you use your shard; that's why brain-surgery can alter your powers.)  So Glastig could get multiple copies, yes, although they'd really be different ""takes"" on the same Shard.  For instance, I think she could take both the variant powers of Echidna copies and the original, effectively getting access to the same shard from different angles.  But it wouldn't give you an unlimited power supply, since presumably clones share the same power well (it being specific to a shard rather than a person.)  Although Glastig's ability to use Doormaker's power after he burned out is an exception here -- perhaps she uses her own well to power her abilities?  Maybe she has access to the wells of all the shards she's claimed access to?  She seems to understand how the wells work, since she was the one who clued Eidolon in on them."

He could see the passengers light up, taking form.  Glimmers of images, shadows, scenes both Earthly and alien.  Glaistig Uaine was a mosaic, a stained glass window of three interlocking scenes, flowing into and through one another.  Three spirits.  He could see how she reached out to them, how they flowed into and through her.  This was her.  What was he?  What was his dream?  “Now,” she said, as if from very far away.  Nearby, a cape who had been wounded in the rig’s collapse died.  He could see the images start to fade, to degrade, consumed from the edges like darkness might creep in around one’s peripheral vision as they lost consciousness.  He saw Glaistig Uaine claim them, banishing her creations and leaving only the framework around the images.  The framework took in the other cape, and it bloomed with a new life."

Accord's intelligence scales with the complexity of the situation. It bugs me tinkers get their field marked with ""Expert on..."" or ""Specialised in"" and Armsmaster gets ""He's good at condensing technology"". More than that, he's THE efficiency tinker. Contessa asks for the Path to victory for what she wants, she doesn't get the path for everything she does. Although everything she does in worm is follow the huge amount of steps that's needed for her path to save humanity, it's a pretty big difference imho. Eidolon can manifest 3 major powers he needs at will or about 4 minor ones iirc. Golem's power isn't only his hands iirc. Grey boy's loops aren't painful. Grey boys just traps his victims in an inviolable time loop (iirc, people can't affect it except him, but objects go through, according to the thread that was on the front page a while ago). They're painful because he inflicts the pain on them while they're looped, and the pain is looped over and over again and their mind never gets used to it, they have to re-live the pain non stop. He has also been resetting (single loop back a couple of seconds) himself  since he was 10 or so and automatically on death, that's what undoes damage. Garotte's tentacles aren't ENTIRELY independent of her. She manages to hold them back a couple of times in the story and she does things like drawing with them for example. Just very poor control I think. Legend's Breaker state is unmentionned Murder rat had Ravager's power too didn't she ? She'd create wounds that don't heal. Nice guy is a Stranger, Moord Nag is a master, and so on but there's a lot of those. We don't know Parian's exact power, but it's not only manipulating small objects, it's also the loading of the objects with her TK and so on, we got 20 Parian threads about it. Perdition doesn't quite set back time as a whole, it's a more localised effect. Physically sets himself or his target(s) back. The Trickster vs Perdition fight was an example of that. Shatterbird can't only manipulate glass iirc. She's a a silicakinetic, so she can fuck you up on a beach too. Stormtiger is an aerokinetic, it's a bit more than that. Tattletale is the intuition thinker on any topic. Iirc she just needs to know data X and her power fills her in on data Y. Uber can master any learnable skill.

Parahumans,3b0c0w,ThirdFloorGreg,10,Thu Jun 25 00:05:24 2015 UTC,"Netflix series. One episode of arbitrary length per arc. Multipart for the ones that get too long. Last episode ends with the UK exploding, with every episode's title card taken from the entity communication shots. Theatrical movie for the finale. Possibly two, but I really think the last four arcs could be squeezed into one with just a few cuts.

Parahumans,3b0c0w,GreatWyrmGold,2,Thu Jun 25 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"Those would be some arbitrarily long episodes. Each arc is roughly the length of a smallish novel, and novels typically make it to full-length motion pictures.  Similarly, one heck of a long finale-movie."

Worm is pretty action heavy, which takes a lot more space on the page than it does on film. Wildbow's outline of the first season turned 8 arcs into 12 episodes. There are also definitely parts that would get cut while adapting it for a new medium. Particularly in the movie, I think, a lot of that just wouldn't work on screen."

Parahumans,3b12da,OniTan,8,Sat Jun 27 03:51:30 2015 UTC,"Doctor Mother is tricky, depending on how you look at things.  Her age is never really addressed much, unfortunately.  She's still on the young-ish end of the spectrum for logistics reasons when Fortuna meets her, but still old enough for Fortuna to describe her as a woman.  As we don't know enough about her culture to make blind guesses as to when womanhood is, we're more inclined to think that she's in her young twenties.  Unless there's information we missed, then we'll go with that.  I'll go out on a limb and say 22 or so.  We need to keep her young due to her later appearances.  The Triumvirate (the first successes with the vials) got their powers in 1986, with the implication that they're all teens or young adults.  At this point, I'd wager that Contessa is between 12-18, but I'm erring on the younger end of the spectrum.  I'd put it more along the lines of 15 as the oldest that she'd be.  Doormaker is somewhere between 7-12.    From what we see here, I'd put Doormaker at 35-40, the Triumvirate between 46-52, Contessa at 40-46, and Doctor Mother a soft 50 or so.  We know that Jack and Number Man are close to the same age, and I'll put Jack at late 30s, maybe (heavy maybe) early-to-mid 40s.  I'm partial to putting Number Man at 38 myself.  Harbinger is 18, Harbinger is 18, Harbinger is 18, Harbinger is 18, and Harbinger is 18.  Rereading her interlude, Contessa is fucking scary in general.  Edit:  Sorry, I screwed up my math.

Beyond that...well, let's start by asking how you shoot someone in the head, twice, without making things worse. Let's continue by asking how Contessa did something that Panacea explicitly stated she couldn't fix, without Panacea's powers. For the rule of three, would damaging the corona pollentia actually remove Taylor's powers? And because four is death, let's consider why Contessa would go to all of this trouble. And don't get me started on what happens after Taylor's fixed.

Parahumans,3b0euu,tender_steak,8,Wed Jun 24 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"On Earth Aleph yes. After Haywire connected the Earths they communicated and set up a treaty. Media from both were exchanged. Genesis knew most of the basics about capes despite being from Aleph well before she went over.  Can't say the same for the other Earths, but in the case of Earth Aleph and Bet the answer is yes."
Parahumans,3b0euu,Rillet,4,Wed Jun 24 23:41:20 2015 UTC,"I think other places would classify capes differently. Precogs might get different classifications from social Thinkers, for instance, it would be a good idea to break up Masters into ""creates Minions"" and ""turns people into minions"", breakers and changers could be more clearly defined into ""has one state or set of capabilities"" versus ""has multiple states, adaptive ability, or sets of capabilities"", Strangers could again be broken into ""good at hiding"" versus ""mental effects"". Masters and Strangers that worked by willfully altering memories might get a class all of their own. Etc."
Parahumans,3b0euu,Gnimhey,2,Wed Jun 24 23:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm exploring some of those ideas in Earth Bet's UK in my own fic, because I don't see why the categories should even apply all across Earth Bet (after all Wildbow has said they are PRT reporting categories, and as important as the PRT are they don't actually run the cape-world.)"
Parahumans,3b0euu,ElaraSilk,4,Thu Jun 25 08:20:22 2015 UTC,"""Hey, we need to come up with a classification system for parahumans.""  ""Just copy the PRT's. They've done the hard work in categorizing and setting up procedures, and it makes sharing information easier."""
Parahumans,3b0euu,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"There's a logic to that, which will probably apply in a lot of places.  In favour are considerations like those you mention. Against are considerations like national pride, parallel evolution (if you're responding to parahumans before the PRT is up and running in a big way, you might come up with ideas independently), and so on. I know there's a bit of a Cauldron thumb on the scales making the PRT first to be set up, so the bias on Bet should probably be towards using PRT terminology in most places. The main exceptions, to my mind, will be A) nations that are or consider themselves to be major Powers, and B) nations in the orbit of a nation in category A which is not the United States.  To look at a specific example, the UK could go either way - basically if there's a major parahuman incident requiring a government response before the PRT is well-established then the UK will probably start coming up with their own policies and procedures, if the PRT has been going several years then they'll probably just copy the PRT. However, if the UK does have independent categorization, then the Republic of Ireland may well follow UK procedures rather than PRT ones due to proximity and frequency of interaction. Russia, the CUI, India all do things in their own different ways. Brazil may do likewise. Japan has the clout to have their own system, but may well not exercise it; IMO that would depend on whether parahuman affairs was seen to fall more naturally under Police or Defence, though I can't recall whether there's any WoG on this. France and Germany are possibilities. If they come up with a joint way of doing things, that will probably end up applying to the whole EEC/EU, and maybe all of Europe with the sole possible exception of the UK; but if France and Germany differ, you'll see some minor European states copying one, some copying the other, some copying the PRT, and some having a Whole Sort of General Mish-Mash. And so on; at least, that's how I understand the situation."
Parahumans,3b0euu,ElaraSilk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:07:21 2015 UTC,"No doubt some places would have their own systems, but I imagine the PRT (being one of the biggest and first organizations dedicated to handling parahumans on a large scale) would have its scale become a standard."
Parahumans,3b0euu,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri Jun 26 12:14:31 2015 UTC,Well. Earth Resh certainly has a lot of its own terminology.

Parahumans,3awrka,Vaikusin,8,Wed Jun 24 03:40:32 2015 UTC,"I vote for Twig on Fridays and every time Twig has been first. Since you can only vote once per week, I'm guessing that's around the time most people vote. Also, Wildbow recently said that overall readership is down, but the current readers are leaving more good reviews, comments, or making more donations."
Parahumans,3awrka,thyrfa,2,Wed Jun 24 03:48:19 2015 UTC,Funnily enough I haven't read twig in a month or so (waiting for more before I dive back in) but I donated for the first time a couple days ago
Parahumans,3awrka,ElaraSilk,7,Thu Jun 25 05:11:28 2015 UTC,"Twig is ahead on the 24-hour, 3-day and 1-month categories (Pact wins 1 year, Super Powereds is ahead on 1-week, and Worm places strongly everywhere - never below 4th)."
Parahumans,3awrka,g0ing_postal,3,Wed Jun 24 07:18:53 2015 UTC,Has anyone read Super Powereds? I read a few chapters and it's just not keeping me very interested. Is it worthwhile to keep reading? Does the writing get better?
Parahumans,3awrka,pendia,3,Wed Jun 24 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"I got put off by the first chapter. The S9 are one of my least favourite things in Worm, and all that chapter established is that there is a S9 equivalent. The S9 work in Worm because I'm already invested in the world before they show up."
Parahumans,3awrka,gmrm4n,2,Thu Jun 25 22:53:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe this guy brought in an audience from outside the web serial world. I'm pretty active in Web Fiction Guide and the WFG forums, but that guy isn't really brought up that much."
Parahumans,3awrka,GreatWyrmGold,2,Wed Jun 24 15:07:48 2015 UTC,I can't help but wonder if one of the reasons Wildbow's writings always score so well on topwebfiction is that a lot of the topwebfiction voters are originally from Wildbow's fanbase. Maybe Super Powereds finally got a significant number of non-Wildbow fans to vote?
Parahumans,3av560,Leoano,8,Tue Jun 23 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"I thought MP had to tag people? Cool, regardless."
Parahumans,3av560,Gnimhey,6,Tue Jun 23 20:37:38 2015 UTC,oh darn. When I made this I just thought it was tagging things in general.
Parahumans,3av560,pseudonarne,8,Tue Jun 23 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure if we really got a clear idea of her powers anyway.  we just know how murder rat used it  and iirc both powers were weakened when fused(ravager's power sounded like blake's use of hyena from pact(edit- do we know which city that was? leaving permanent wounds almost sounds like the watered down sting we've been looking for with flechette, murderrat seemed agile at least) but mp did carry a sword so for all we know the smoking blood could have been part of her power ha)"
Parahumans,3av560,tiny-alchemist,2,Tue Jun 23 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"no, we pretty much confirmed that Sting Jr. went to Circus who got better timing and balance, but only got pocket dimensions. The Ravager bit was one of my failed theories."
Parahumans,3av560,wiikipedia,3,Wed Jun 24 01:51:47 2015 UTC,I thought we had pretty good confirmation that Circus couldn't have triggered alongside Flechette since Sting was an overpowering and inflexible shard and so their powers didn't match. I was definitely arguing for a while that Circus and Flechette matched up pretty nicely.
Parahumans,3av560,pseudonarne,2,Wed Jun 24 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"confirmed?  edit- wildbow:   S/he did get Sting lite. Remember, Sting is a 'shark' of a shard. Can't really do much to improve or vary it.   doesn't sound like circus."
Parahumans,3av560,tiny-alchemist,3,Wed Jun 24 04:10:12 2015 UTC,here's the thread. i thought there was good evidence for Circus. But I think Watch works well too.
Parahumans,3av560,OnlyLoveNow,5,Wed Jun 24 13:27:47 2015 UTC,"Oh glob I just realized that would have a weird manton effect limit which I'm sure Bonesaw could take advantage of to a hilariously evil degree  Like, flying baby drones or something idk (if she had a child who got a bud of her shard, it would specialize in [vivisection])"
Parahumans,3av560,J4k0b42,5,Tue Jun 23 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"Cool, have you made any others?"
Parahumans,3av560,J4k0b42,10,Tue Jun 23 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"Well not anything quite like this, but I'm the same guy that made those Animation Tests a few months ago."
Parahumans,3av560,GreatWyrmGold,3,Tue Jun 23 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I enjoyed those too."
Parahumans,3av560,ErrantVagrant,5,Tue Jun 23 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"Impressive. A bit disappointed that it was between Steve? and Steve?? with their powers, but cool nonetheless."
Parahumans,3av560,ErrantVagrant,3,Tue Jun 23 22:56:16 2015 UTC,"I want to make one thing clear:  I like this and want to see more of it.  I'm a visually-minded person; I have to take breaks when reading to envision everything.  (Which gives me problems with high-concept stuff.)  I'm offering an honest critique, not as a slamming, but because I see room where you can grow and become even more awesome.   I can't believe that I'm saying this, but it could use some more cuts.  I love long shots, Hanna has one of my all-time favorite fight scenes ever, for that reason.  But if you watch that video, it accomplishes many of the things that cuts accomplish -- it mixes up the action, changes perspective, and highlights what's seen in a visceral way.  This felt static in that the action was never fully highlighted. May I assume that you primarily do Minecraft vids?  I ask because this has one issue that bugs me and appears often in Minecraft videos: the characters seem to be disconnected to their surroundings.  They feel like they're floating, not actually connected to what they're interacting with.  Especially while standing.  I know it can be hard for Steve to appear to interact with the ground, but it's always bugged me that the animations feel less connected to the ground than Steve does in the game.  For a good reference, look at Monty Oum's work.  Even when his characters are flipping physics the bird, they still give the feel of interacting with it on a base level. Similar to the above, you may want to work on your speed of movement a bit.  Sometimes, the characters felt like they were moving faster than they should, but at others, it felt like they were moving a little too slow.  This is especially noticeable when the one has been kicked off the platform, feeling less like flying/falling and more like floating. One last camera/perspective bit.  During the end, it might serve you better to start further out from the falling one and have a steady zoom into them, instead of the slow zoom with the quick at the end.  Perhaps also giving something more for perspective as to how far they're falling.  As it stands, I don't know that MP is about to impact with the ground until it happens.  (I'm assuming she splatted; I didn't see her tag anything before being thrown, but I could also see how her final poses could be teleporting.)  The floating platform she falls past also screws with the perspective while falling.  For a moment, it feels like she's passed the ground.  A simple color change would help that, though.  (No, I'm not suggesting you redo it for that.) This is going to seem minor, but I'd like to stress how much I really liked it:  There were some moments that really worked with the music.  While the syncing could use some work to highlight the action, I caught on quick that it wasn't the direct goal and just rolled with it.  Even still, for example, the racheting near the end works nicely.  I might have fiddled with it so that the racheting (is that even the right word?) started once the spinning started, but that's just me.  I noticed a few other moments that worked well with the music.  Yeah, the syncing with the music could be touched up a bit, but it helped to give those moments more impact.   ...I'll spare you anything else.  I got more long-winded than I wanted to.  Still, don't take these as negatives, please.  I've been hoping you'd do more stuff since the other tests you've posted here, and I'm thrilled to see this."
Parahumans,3av560,ErrantVagrant,8,Wed Jun 24 08:11:33 2015 UTC,"Uh, well thanks for the... thorough feedback. I mean, I do appreciate that. Really.  But this was tossed together in little over a week. It's basically the equivalent of a sketch doddle for animation or something like that. Not really intended to be that serious. it was a First draft = final draft type of situation.  I should probably have had some more camera cuts. I mean, it does help to emphasize and all. But just having the single camera was easier for exporting.   I know it can be hard for Steve to appear to interact with the ground, but it's always bugged me that the animations feel less connected to the ground than Steve does in the game. For a good reference, look at Monty Oum's work. Even when his characters are flipping physics the bird, they still give the feel of interacting with it on a base level.   That really kinda stings man. If this had been a GTA V animation or something then I probably would have seen your point.   But Minecraft!?   Minecraft has many strengths but good player-environment collision is not one of them.  And Monty... I was a fan of Monty for many years. The guy was truly an amazing animator and fight choreographer. I've studied his work for a long time, and he's been a real inspiration. But like 50% of his shots are all deliberately above foot level. He put his focus on what he felt was more important.   I get what you're saying, really, and I do appreciate it. But that really kind of stung to read.  As for the speed of movement. Yeah, I agree. And I'm not gonna just blame it on this being made in a week. (Which was something I did say in the description :[ ) Yeah. speed wasn't that good.  The fast zoom at the end was meant to indicate that she had teleported again. She does start glowing a bit before. If I had done some proper sound it might have been clearer what was happening.  As for the music. This was just some song I found from Metal Gear Solid 4. It's tough to get syncing done after you've already done the animating. The thing with music in animation is you either get it custom made after the fact or you have a song in mind from the very beginning. Any places where they did sync up here was mostly just a coincidence, since I put the music in last so people would have something to listen to while watching. You could watch it on mute just fine. I've long since accepted that Audio is not my strong suit.  Thank you for taking the time to write down your thoughts though. I'm not going to get better if nobody's willing to say what I did wrong. :)"
Parahumans,3aw4tn,endtime,10,Tue Jun 23 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"This is interesting to me, because I've always read italics as just a minor stressing of a word.  Barely anything important, except in certain contexts; just an expression of the way the sentence is laid out in speech.  Anything stronger for me generally requires explicit call-out in the text, such as 'he drew out the last word, dripping with sarcasm.'  This would not be the first time I was surprised to find out that other people read things completely differently.  How does the italicization read out loud in your head?"
Parahumans,3aw4tn,Tarhish,7,Wed Jun 24 03:56:43 2015 UTC,Same! I barely even register (if at all) when I read
Parahumans,3aw4tn,HelloiamaTeddyBear,4,Wed Jun 24 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe a little stronger than you, but basically the same.  I don't have anything against italics in general, I just think they are showing up much too frequently in Twig."
Parahumans,3aw4tn,Gnimhey,8,Wed Jun 24 04:55:06 2015 UTC,"I read them as the difference between ""he wasn't quite the same person, anymore"" - implying he's changed - and ""he wasn't quite the same person, anymore"" - implying that he's changed, but that hasn't changed nearly as much as you might initially think. It adds volumes to a sentence, properly placed."
Parahumans,3aw4tn,noggin-scratcher,5,Wed Jun 24 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there's a very distinct shade of meaning that can be added by indicating where the stress is placed.   Puts me in mind of that fun one... the sentence where there's as many possible meanings as words in the sentence depending on which one you stress:   I never said she stole my money"
Parahumans,3aw4tn,DoctorWh0m,5,Wed Jun 24 10:05:15 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I've gotten used to it now, but when that first chapter came out, it was almost enough to get me to stop reading.

Parahumans,3av4g9,Poodler,5,Thu Jun 25 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think she encounters any nonparahumans when she's got her new power. Though, given the way the power is described, it could probably go either way. We don't know enough about the uncorrupted Administrator shard to make any sort of headway.   On one hand, it does make sense on a level that the shard's primary use for the entity would be directly controlling other shards.   But on the other, the primary use of the shard, as far as Taylor was able to use it, was bugs, which are not parahuman.   The only real clue we get about Taylor's power (that isn't about range) is that she can only control creatures with simple brains. It's possible that her surgery delimited that, and made it so that she was using more brain real estate to process more information (which is something the text implies, as her rate of mental deterioration begins to rapidly accelerate when she begins taking control of her major army), allowing her to fully access the human mind.   I guess in the end, it comes down to the shard's use. As far as Taylor tells us, it's about brain size. If that's really all it is, her upgraded power should be able to control all larger brains."
Parahumans,3atn3a,jrbless,15,Tue Jun 23 12:28:50 2015 UTC,"I think that it's any weapon she's seen, and that Tinkertech is excluded, because Shards don't have to make sense, only be consistent. For example, she replicates the weapon her captors were using the first time."

If anything, the texts suggests that she definitely can't. When she's fighting the black goo monster, she is mentioned taking it off, then using a flare gun. The flare gun is most probably her power, and if the foam was too, she wouldn't have needed to take the pack off."
Parahumans,3atn3a,Poodler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe she could replicate the sprayer, but not the tinker tech foam itself, Like when she used a grenade launcher to fire Bakuda's weaponry?"

We never see her rely on any weapon that she didn't make herself. We see her, once, use munitions that she did not generate.   Personally, I'd submit that some part of the foam gun would be tinker made. Dragon is credited with its design, and given what we know of her creative process (she gently plagiarizes the work of other tinkers) it is extremely likely that the gun, for the intent of MM's power, is not 'conventional.'"

Parahumans,3atn3a,GonzoMcFonzo,3,Thu Jun 25 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"What little the text implies tells us that Miss Militia can replicate any conventional weapon she can think of. Emphasis on 'conventional', of course.   When she triggers, she forms an assault rifle that she said she'd seen a picture of once in a magazine. It doesn't seem that her power actually requires fundamental understanding of the mechanism, because she definitely didn't have that during her trigger.  I'd submit that it's possible that the main limit of her power is that she can't replicate something it would take a shard to comprehend. That is, tinker tech.  We do see her use a foam gun at the end, during Bitch's epilogue, but the text doesn't state that she created it, and it doesn't really seem to imply it, either.

She was able to conjure up a grenade launcher that could fire them, but had to use actual reserves of Bakuda's special payloads. There seems to be a built in limit to the complexity of the weapons she can create. I like to think it's actually a limit on destructive power. We know shards create limits like the manton effect in part to keep any one power from being too useful, to promote competition between them. This limit seems to be just more of that."
Parahumans,3atn3a,Ranku_Abadeer,14,Tue Jun 23 15:12:19 2015 UTC,I believe the reason she used bakudas grenades was just because they were tinker tech that can't be replicated.
Parahumans,3atn3a,the_terran,3,Tue Jun 23 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"i'm not too sure about it limiting her destructive output, i'm fairly sure she used her power to create a nuke at one point.  from venom 29.2   They were driving him away from the settlement, and that allowed some capes to use powers they’d been unable to.  Miss Militia stepped up to the plate, a cape flanking her.  Her power, to create the bomb.  Ten and a half feet long.  Without even being asked, the Simurgh caught it with her telekinesis and flung it.  Scion dodged, and the Simurgh moved the bomb to ensure it hit the target.  The cape beside her used his power to contain the damage, to direct it outward, skyward, to shield us from sound, light and shockwave.  The clouds had been struck from the sky.   so maybe she's just limited to earth mechanics?"
Parahumans,3atn3a,GreatWyrmGold,2,Wed Jun 24 02:14:14 2015 UTC,Perhaps she's limited to non-Tinker weaponry that her power has seen?
Parahumans,3atn3a,ThirdFloorGreg,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"Word of God suggests that's not too far off.   See 11.h for pointers about how Miss Militia's passenger gathered weapons info about conventional arms. It also feeds into her awareness for updates on weapons (ie., as she becomes aware of more modern munitions). Any projectile firing weapon, just about, barring cruder mechanisms like catapults, and any theoretical, (appropriate) projectile (rubber bullets, hollow points, etc). Her attunement to her passenger greatly influences her ability to use the weapons, affecting draw time, and subtly affecting things like aim and weight. It's a power that effectively derives from the 'scraps' left after certain shards were deployed, and where it might normally be split up or combined with other abilities to form tinker oriented shards (think of the aforementioned qualities assisting a gun tinker like Tecton's kinetic sense assists his tectonic tinkering), it's primarily being deployed to collect data in this instance. It isn't an aggressive shard, so it's primarily concerned with being involved (even peripherally) in conflicts, but it gets restless easily - to the point that it's stripped away her ability to sleep as part of its design."
Parahumans,3atn3a,idiodabble,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:59:37 2015 UTC,I think she is limited to mass-produced hand-held weapon with which she is at least passingly familiar.
Parahumans,3atn3a,Archmage9885,0,Tue Jun 23 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"Miss Militia's power ALWAYS bothered me. She's classified as a tinker, which is fine and well, but she's not a tinker at all. She's not an intelligent mechanic or scientist  making things like Bakuda or Kid Win. She's magicking things existence that are restricted to a very small set of things.  Imagine if Panacea removed her restrictions. Imagine what she could make then"
Parahumans,3atn3a,idiodabble,3,Wed Jun 24 01:57:56 2015 UTC,Where is MM called a Tinker? I don't remember seeing anything about that. I'd actually call her a Blaster.
Parahumans,3atn3a,mordymoop,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:07:43 2015 UTC,"Huh. Could've sworn that I read that... but maybe I just assumed that because she got introduced around the same time Wildbow described tinkers for the first time, and I assumed that someone who was making guns out of thin air must have been doing it through nanotechnology or something akin to Armsmaster, because the alternative in my mind would've been that she could just make things in general out of thin air, and if so, why restrict it to guns?"
Parahumans,3atn3a,idiodabble,2,Fri Jun 26 06:25:49 2015 UTC,"I don't get the sense that Tinkers necessarily know how they do what they do. Some of them must, but some of them just seem to sort of go into a fugue and build something ridiculously amazing yet remain unable to articulate the principles of why their creation works.  If you think about it, it pretty much has to be this way. If it weren't, Tinkers wouldn't have limitations, they would just be geniuses, and and they'd easily teach non-capes to duplicate their inventions. We don't see much of that at all."

If you are talking about him outside of this sub it's fine, but please don't on here.  On to your questions:   TT implied Danny was dead because there was almost no chance that he survived Golden Morning. If you take what Wildbow said on here a few weeks ago as true, he actually didn't, and Taylor is just hallucinating him in a permanent coma/personal hell. Feel free to decide for yourself what Wildbow meant by this. Yeah, he was killed by Perdition/Cody. Not a prayer, but people generally think she was giving info on how shards work, which the Simurgh didn't want people hearing about. The characters speculate it in a ""Well even if we get through the walls and don't die, we may have to fly through a mountain sized vacuum. Wouldn't put it past Dragon to just make this place the size of a thimble to fuck us harder."" I don't think it was ever proven one way or another besides that Khepri's portals that are normal sized work for the Cage, so it's probably normal size. Exactly. Cauldron was testing out having a cape rule a city, and was using BB as a testing ground, due to having a bunch of parahumans they could control. I think the last time we hear about Weld, he is defending Doctor Mother from the Case 53s. I would leave his death up to your interpretation of that event, keeping in mind that the Case53s got through him.   Otherwise, good on you for finishing it.

Panacea couldn't fix Khepri before, maybe she still can't.

Parahumans,3au0je,djjlav,2,Tue Jun 23 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"about the alec thing. i've thought about that a bit and came up with a bit of a theory.  the parahumans online interlude talks about how no one born after scion's arrival was born in aleph, or that the chances are low due to ""same sperm, same egg, then all the environmental factors that lead to the growth of the same person."" and then you get a mention about how cherish looks like someone that ballistic knew from earth aleph. and there's also another version of noelle on bet (not the same person exactly, but a child with the same name from the same parents. much younger though. her dad is the one who coined the name echidna for her).   so here's what i'm thinking, heartbreaker was almost certainly old enough to be in both realities, but obviously would not have powers in aleph right? so from what we know about him being a superpowered mind-rapist, i'm assuming that in aleph he would still be a rapist, but with no powers. so without the powers, it's harder for him to get to victims, and his victims don't stay with him. so because of that, he probably still has kids with some of the same women, but they don't know about him, and they look a bit different due to the ""same sperm, same egg, same environment"" bit (so technically they are the same person, and technically different people at the same time)  at the end there, taylor encounters alec's psudo-twin from aleph who grew up outside of heartbreaker's influence and is slightly different due to the circumstances of his conception/birth. just like the travelers went to school with cherish's alternate dimension self."

Parahumans,3au0je,OnlyLoveNow,3,Tue Jun 23 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"For the record, it's definitely possible to be shot in the head and survive. Especially when the bullets don't damage the front end of the brain.   The part that is most primarily 'you', the frontal lobe, is extremely important, and serious damage to that pretty much means you're dead, or definitely braindead. However, there are a lot of regulatory systems in the middle and back of the brain. Many of which won't cause instant death if they're damaged.   In real life, small caliber bullets (that aren't hollow point) won't scramble a brain through hydrostatic shock upon entry. And if they clip the brainstem, medulla, reticular formation, or a few other areas, they could create an effect similar to death.   In our world, you're pretty much unsalvageable. But, we see Bonesaw and Panacea work miracles, and we know of Bonesaw being extremely proficient with brain surgery. We know that Taylor no longer has her power, and she speculates that Bonesaw and Panacea worked together to seal it away. Bonesaw tells us a lot about her ability to lock away powers in the scene where Grue has his second trigger, she can definitely do it.   It doesn't seem so far fetched to me that, with Taylor disabled and the pair able to move in close enough to work, they'd be able to figure out how to completely disable her corona pollentia easily enough.   Now, remember how that brain area is a conduit through which the shard can interact with the person? If you shut that antenna off, the connection is sealed away and, in Taylor's case, can't hijack the rest of her brain.  Also give Contessa the benefit of the doubt. She's no bad guy. She was the only person who could possibly hope to fix Taylor. It's the least she could do.  However, that's beside the point. Because Taylor's in a coma, which was apparently Contessa's plan."

Parahumans,3au0je,Poodler,2,Tue Jun 23 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean. I like a good happy ending just as much as the next guy. I'm not entirely sure what you're saying.   The reason I believe that Taylor is in a coma is pretty simple, I think that it fits in with the text best. It's implied that Tattletale is taking charge of the 'Taylor department' when she's talking to Imp. That's vague, but when you look at the Taylor sections of the interlude, the story that she paints doesn't make sense on its own. Taylor is never mentioned opening a doorway to Earth Aleph. When she's using Doormaker to run through dimensions, she keeps to empty alt worlds. But even past that, Taylor has no idea how she got to where she currently is. Her behavior strongly implies that she just woke up one day, out of some fugue state, going about her new life without any sort of pretense.  Also, here's the kicker, her seeing Alec is virtually impossible if she isn't in a coma. Anyone born after Earth A and B diverged (about 32 years from the end of the story) has no counterpart in the other world. The worlds no longer line up like that.  I can even get a little technical. Our library of faces in dreams is pretty huge, and entirely comprised of faces that we have seen. Our brain doesn't generate new or random faces to put on people we see in our dreams. What Taylor experienced is pretty textbook dreamstate behavior, where faces remind you of someone but... Something seems a little off."
Parahumans,3au0je,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"I never disputed that. However, people who get shot in the head and survive get brain damage. They certainly don't get crippling brain damage repaired!  Why would Bonesaw and Panacea work together on that? They barely agree to work together to save the world. And how would they do that? Bonesaw trying to knock out Taylor's powers back in the first S9 arc, the same method used to take out Grue's, lead to Taylor's powers being merely inhibited. As for Panacea, she explicitly said that she couldn't undo the alterations to Taylor's powers; surely bending the metaphorical bar back into place is easier than destroying it altogether? And that's not getting into how Taylor's suddenly able to function.  That brain area is what Bonesaw screwed up with to...inhibit Taylor's power. Remember?  I don't argue that Contessa shouldn't have fixed Taylor. I argue that she couldn't, and when it comes up, that she wouldn't.  I don't see the coma angle. It seems like something Wildbow said later to mess with us and/or patch a gaping plot hole."
Parahumans,3au0je,OnlyLoveNow,2,Tue Jun 23 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"[This response turned into a fucking novel. But I swear it's all pretty soundly reasoned with actual knowledge and text support.]  True! But in the wormverse, we see that Panacea, on her own, can completely rebuild a damaged brain. She does it with Flashbang. Panacea rebuilds his motor functions, memory capacity, episodic and procedural memory, and a bunch of other systems! During the Golden Morning, we see her patch up a stroked out Moord Nag!  The how is pretty straight forward. In Snare 13.9, when Bonesaw is monologuing Taylor while she's been paralyzed, she goes into great detail explaining the mechanics of powers. Specifically, she lays it out that there are two systems at work in the brain. She says that there's the Corona Pollentia and a section of it called the Gemma. The Corona's size and shape varies, depending on the power expressed (and Bonesaw mentions that she is pretty sure she's got a good guess where Taylor's is!) and acts as a conduit by which the passenger (this is the first use of the term in Worm, I believe) can share its power with the human host. The Gemma is a subsection that allows the host to actively control their power. Bonesaw uses a powder that cripples the Gemma, but doesn't harm any other part of the Corona. Which means that conscious control is impossible. This trick works really well on Grue because his power is something he uses actively. We see no evidence that his power can activate subconsciously. Taylor's, on the other hand, we see working subconsciously all the time. Her power allows her to direct bugs to do tasks, but her subconscious takes care of many of the smaller details, or the actual carrying out of the task (remember when those roaches delivered the paper bags full of money during the raid on Lung? She was fighting for her life when they were sorting money into lunchbags.).   Panacea definitely says that she can't undo what she did, that there was really no going back to what Taylor had. But fixing the problem area and completely disabling it are different things. In the human brain, fixing brain damage is exceedingly difficult. However, removing the damage and letting the brain reorganize to redistribute function is very viable, and typically preferable. Bending the bar back into place, as you put it, is extremely difficult.   The Corona is a sort of interdimensional antenna, as far as the text tells us. When Panacea messes with Taylor's, she basically unlocks the full potential of the shard by allowing the passenger to assume a more direct control. It's implied that this process involves a sort of brain invasion, where other brain areas are hijacked to add to the processing power that using more of the shard requires. Chiefly, we see Taylor's Broca's area (comprehension of speech and writing), Wernicke's area (production of speech and writing), and some of her motor cortex commandeered to allow her to control more and more capes. If the antenna was destroyed or rendered inert (which Bonesaw can absolutely do), Taylor's power would completely disappear. In theory, she could more or less function fine, depending on where Contessa's bullets went in. Odds are they damaged the brainstem, reticular formation, or medulla. All of these would lead to a serious inability to regulate a waking state. In that time, completely disabled, Bonesaw could have done what needed to be done. She probably could have easily fixed some damage here and there (remember how quickly she patches up Doormaker's brain? Panacea only had to reset the bone!).  I can speculate on the why, if you want. We know that Bonesaw is trying her little heart out to be good and make amends. Past that, it's also totally within her character to see Taylor as someone she owes something to. Panacea may not be best friends with Taylor, but she's likewise trying to live up to her own code. Given all the self blame she's going to harbor if she doesn't at least try to make it up to the life she destroyed, I think she'd be up to one final favor. Hate her or love her, Taylor saved all humanity, and these characters absolutely understand the gravity of that.  I don't think that Contessa is as cut throat as you say. She absolutely can do whatever she wants, she just has to consult her power. Cauldron was the result of her asking how she could save humanity. As Fortuna, she and the Doctor, on their own, killed the Garden. She can absolutely ask herself how to put a girl into a coma without killing her. We also don't see her as bloodthirsty, or as a killer. When she fought Taylor and the Chicago Wards, she went to great lengths to not injure anyone. Even specifically telling Taylor that she doesn't want to fight her, or hurt her. All that aside, Contessa's main goal in life was to save humanity and kill Scion. With her help, Taylor did just that. Mission accomplished. It doesn't fit Contessa's character to simply put Taylor in the ground as a thank you.  The coma angle is absolutely possible. Tattletale hints that there is still stuff to be looked after in the Taylor department. Thank you for reading this wall of text. I would love to hear your opinion!"
Parahumans,3au0je,GreatWyrmGold,2,Wed Jun 24 05:59:55 2015 UTC,"That brain damage is nothing compared to what happened to Taylor by the end of the story. Plus, we get Panacea explicitly saying she won't be able to fix what she does before screwing with Taylor...and before Taylor's state degenerates.  I forgot that little detail. Hm. Still, without any actual demonstrations, saying ""destroying the corona pollentia totally disables powers"" is a bit weak—especially with several parahumans who can't have coronas pollentia (most obviously Dragon, but also some case 53's).  The problem area went beyond the power by the end of the story. Removing all of the problem area would involve removing her damaged speech/language/communication/etc bits, the parts relating to hand-eye/etc coordination, and Zion knows what else.  There's a problem with that theory. In...one of the Entity interludes, it's explicitly stated that powers were disabled to stop them from damaging humans. An unlimited power wouldn't just take over—it would cause damage, which would accumulate. This corresponds with what we see—Taylor's mental state degenerates over the course of the arc. If it was just the passenger being in more control, you'd expect the big changes to happen pretty much immediately. And I don't buy that Bonesaw, working with her tools, could do so much more than Panacea could with her power.  Why would Bonesaw owe anything to Taylor? Doesn't Panacea partly blame the Undersiders for a lot of her S9-related troubles? Isn't Taylor more than a little hated by many and feared by all? And Taylor didn't save humanity—she helped, but by the end she wasn't actually controlling much of anything.  Fortuna was a nice girl. Then she spent decades being used as Contessa, constantly forced to be pragmatic. And she was. She might have had a benevolent pragmatism...but it was always Cauldron and the Big Plan first, and I find it hard to imagine that Contessa wouldn't consider a dangerous thorn in Cauldron's side a threat to her Big Plans. Generosity doesn't really fit with the Contessa we've seen earlier, and while the paying-debts thing might...Taylor did more harm to Cauldron than she ever did help, and Cauldron's always put ""The Greater Good""TM above fairness."
Parahumans,3au0je,Ranku_Abadeer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:16:45 2015 UTC,"Hm. It seems that our disagreement stems almost entirely from interpretation! As I read Speck, the idea of brain damage didn't really cross my mind, from the way things were described it was more like 'resource hijacking.' In 29.9, Panacea is talking specifically about being unable to repair her hackjob that delimits Taylor's shard, saying that it would be like trying to cork a shattered levee.  I'll definitely admit that Dragon in an exception. But even the rest of the cast said her case was weird. And I don't recall ever reading that 53's have no Corona. We don't see any person who's had their Corona destroyed, but we do hear about it from two separate factions, Bonesaw and the Doctor/Contessa. Those two didn't collude, and they came to the same conclusion. Bonesaw even explicitly states that if she fried Taylor's Corona, there would be nothing to work with, as it would burn her power out. That was the whole reason she used the Gemma powder.  As far as I can tell, the passenger isn't breaking the brain areas, it is just exerting its influence and repurposing them, as Bitch's did with her social ability. The text uses a lot of words that imply absolute damage, but the actual description of what is happening doesn't seem much like damage. From Speck .6:  [Except thinking was harder still.  I was a husk, and things were rotting from the inside out.  I’d hoped I’d recuperate some when I had less people in my control, but it didn’t seem like it worked out that way.  Damage done was damage done.  One section of my brain was swelling or creeping out to take over other sections, like it had overwritten dog-girl’s social perceptions.]  You're talking about Interlude 26. And I'm not sure your interpretation is correct, as the section that describes the Entity and Counterpart putting limits into place is a nod to the Manton Effect. They make it so people can't be harmed by their own shards unintentionally. I've copy/pasted the full text:  [All signs point to the shards murdering their hosts.  The hosts must be protected, or this will be disastrous, counter-intuitive.  The entity adjusts the innate safeguards, protections to reflect the host species and their tolerances.  The bonding process will protect the host, where the host needs protection.  Shards that are capable of providing flame at will cannot burn the hosts, now.  Shards are reorganized, combined and clustered where necessary, to grant sufficient protection.]  Then later in that same interlude, we see Scion directly observe Taylor's shard:   [The female’s was among the most mature.  Seasoned by conflict, heavy with information, lessons learned, tactics, applications, organization.  It had already fragmented once, heavy enough with information that it could afford to handle other roles.  The fragment would have a derivative ability, and given proximity, it would hopefully remain close enough to exchange information with the shard that it had split off from.  There were no signs of that exchange.  The female had separated ways from the fragment.]  Implying that A) Taylor's shard has had a second trigger and B) She wasn't in control of the power the second trigger would grant her. It's entirely likely that Panacea allowed her Corona more reach, and allowed her to make contact with the fragment.  As far as the degeneration of her mind, it's pretty much in line with the metaphor Panacea put forth of a failing levee. Leaks at first, then eventually a torrent pouring through.  It's unfortunate that we don't have any more concrete writing on the science of the Corona.   Bonesaw owes Taylor because she's put Taylor and gang through some serious hell. Now she's had a change of heart and is looking to make amends. From what we understand, she's found a way to humanize those around her, and is working to be a good girl. Panacea blames Tattletale for her problems. She holds a grudge about what happened in the bank, seeing it as the catalyst for her life falling apart. Now, out of the cage, she sees that Taylor only wanted to help her, and earnestly meant it. In Speck, when she any Taylor have a heart to heart, Panacea says that she found who she was, she just needed the chance. Taylor mentions that she offered to help, and Panacea admits that she did, but says that she wasn't in her right mind to accept it.  You don't think Taylor was the tipping point for saving humanity? She put all of the longshot variables in place to build the weapon, sandbagged Scion to keep him on guard, and came up with the tactic that caused him to lose his mind in the end.   And that's the thing about Contessa. Her big plan, Cauldron's main goal, they were satisfied when Scion bit the dust. Taylor did that, that's a serious debt to repay. Hell, the idea of the greater good being the ultimate calling is pretty much what Khepri personified. Self sacrifice and being the 'bad guy' because it was the only way to survive. Also, we see in Interlude 29 that Contessa is the real puppetmaster behind Cauldron. She just prefers to not be in the spotlight. The Doctor was her puppet."

I'm not convinced that draining the entire ocean, or whatever severing Taylor's connection to her shard would be, is any easier.   I'll definitely admit that Dragon in an exception. But even the rest of the cast said her case was weird.   But she triggered, which means she works off of the same mechanisms as anyone else who triggered. Which means that if she doesn't need a corona...well, why does anyone else?   As far as I can tell, the passenger isn't breaking the brain areas, it is just exerting its influence and repurposing them, as Bitch's did with her social ability.   As far as can be told, Bitch didn't suffer slow degradation of her social skills. If she did, there's no reason it wouldn't continue through the story, and...it doesn't. In fact, she improves.  The quote from 30.6 supports my interpretation more than yours. Rotting over a period of time, not losing it all more or less at once. Damage, not lack of control.   And I'm not sure your interpretation is correct, as the section that describes the Entity and Counterpart putting limits into place is a nod to the Manton Effect.   I find it hard to imagine that the Entities, who have memories of doing this hundreds of times, would be surprised at the need to put down safeguards like that. Hence, I figure that they're talking about some weakness humanity has that at least some other species don't. Possibly, being more susceptible to peripheral changes (like insanity and mutation) than said species?   Then later in that same interlude, we see Scion directly observe Taylor's shard...   The split-off was Aiden, the bird-boy.   As far as the degeneration of her mind, it's pretty much in line with the metaphor Panacea put forth of a failing levee. Leaks at first, then eventually a torrent pouring through.   And you expect me to believe that Panacea couldn't remove the corona pollentia to drain the ocean, but Contessa could.   Bonesaw owes Taylor because she's put Taylor and gang through some serious hell. Now she's had a change of heart and is looking to make amends.   Same with the entire world.   Panacea blames Tattletale for her problems. She holds a grudge about what happened in the bank, seeing it as the catalyst for her life falling apart.   There was also more than a little bit of stuff in the S9 arc...  Of course, all of this matters only if the two of them are still able to fix Taylor, willing to work with Contessa (Cauldron's not reviled as much as the Slaughterhouse Nine...but they're close, especially after their disastrous attempt to combat Scion), and actually in the same area.   You don't think Taylor was the tipping point for saving humanity? She put all of the longshot variables in place to build the weapon, sandbagged Scion to keep him on guard, and came up with the tactic that caused him to lose his mind in the end.   The details escape me, but didn't she lose her ability to influence much of anything before realizing how to beat Scion?   Her big plan, Cauldron's main goal, they were satisfied when Scion bit the dust. Taylor did that, that's a serious debt to repay.   Arguably. You could also argue that Taylor screwed up their plans enough in the past (sometimes even on purpose) that helping get rid of Scion was repayment of that.   Also, we see in Interlude 29 that Contessa is the real puppetmaster behind Cauldron. She just prefers to not be in the spotlight. The Doctor was her puppet.   I don't remember anything suggesting that."

Parahumans,3au0je,tybo555,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"Bonesaw knocked out Taylor's corona pollentia, which is the only physical manifestation of one's superpowers. (That we know of, but the end of a story is a pretty terrible time to introduce something like that, especially without so much as naming it.) Remember what happened there? It was very clearly pointing out that no, Taylor's powers still functioned with a disabled corona pollentia.  Panacea definitely does have a Thinker power. Aside from her bio-sense, I find it extremely improbable that she designed a counter-agent to Bonesaw's agnosia parasite without any Thinker power...to say nothing of making changes at all to powers, or brains. The human brain doesn't have enough processing power to understand the effects of fucking with someone's brain, especially if you want to set some aside for keeping the body it's in working, so how did the unaided subconscious Amy-brain figure out how to make Victoria attracted to Amy?

It is very very vague and we don't know if Danny really is alive or not, it is something that we will see in Worm 2. 2) Accord died in the Behemoth fight when Cody assassinated him. 3) Pretty vague but something on the scale of: Scion is going to kill everyone cause he is the alien source of powers (unlikely) to people's power's are alive and we got them from aliens (much more likely) 4) The Birdcage is a hanging huge prison in the middle of an emptied mountain, it is pretty big and houses like a few hundred people. 5)Cauldron's statistics showed that humanity might not last until the ""end"" as Scion didn't seem to start to kill everyone and they were testing if a parahuman based society might work and be stable after the END with Scion. His power (which is precognition) is also externally powerful as it works against Scion and Endbringer as well so you can use his power to attack Scion again and again in different ways to try to find something that works. 6)Maybe?

You work as a rad con technician at an experimental liquid fluoride thorium reactor. Your job requires you to do routine checks for trace amounts of leaked contaminants between reactor cycles. It's a tedious and repetitive job, but it pays well.   You don your positive pressure bubble suit and awkwardly shuffle into the airlock for the long wait while the air interchanges. For the hundredth time you mutter to yourself about the lack of benches. Sure, any contact could theoretically breach the suit, but it's not like you need it anyway. The dose from contamination inside the cell is so minimal that you could far exceed your yearly dose just by moving to Colorado.

If it were anyone else you'd ask them to stop, but Dave has a well deserved reputation as a petty asshole who files asinine complaints against anyone who questions him. At least this otherworldly humming is a change from pop country he usually blares. Still though, it seems to pierce directly into your brain in a way that humming shouldn't, and it's only making your headache worse. You unsuccessfully try to ignore the sound and continue on with your work, nearly done now.  Behind you and to the left, you hear the quiet whir of a pump engaging. Immediately, your electronic dosimeter emits a shrill series of beeps, and the numbers on it's display begin to climb. Rapidly. far too rapidly. You turn, almost knocking your head against a pipe, and look up at the control booth to see Dave. He's bathed in the red light of various alarms, and you can hear the deafening siren on your earpiece. Despite the obvious danger, Dave stares at you impassively, and when the siren falls you can hear him, still humming that maddening series of notes.  That bastard. He must have skipped steps in the safety procedure, trying to make his job easier at the cost of your own safety. You scream into your mic, but there's still no reaction. Either his speakers are broken or he's frozen in panic.   Then with a sudden chill you realize that this wasn't a matter of simple incompetence. Multiple mechanical and electrical interlocks should have prevented the reactor from powering up, no matter how lax the operator. It finally strikes you that you're going to die here, murdered by a coworker for no conceivable reason.  Your bubble suit, so effective against airborne contamination, does nothing to protect against the gamma rays that are even now bombarding your cells doing irreparable damage. You imagine you can feel it, but you know this isn't the case. You remember your training and glance at your dosimeter. The cumulative number is high, and you know that even if you were to somehow escape now you would be a dead man walking, waiting for the inevitable death of radiation sickness. You wrench your mind away before you can remember too many of the graphic details, the case studies from Hiroshima and Chernobyl. Unbidden, the phrase ant-walking-alligator comes to mind, and you cringe away, unable to face the unspeakable horror that you know awaits you.

Mom owned a successful law firm on the good side of town that branched out and spread to other cities. Your dad started his own car dealership that was becoming a huge name. The family house was a large 3 story house in a nice neighborhood.  You where six when the storm hit. As everyone slept the rain and wind increased. Wind picked uo to record speed. Thunder cracked waking you all up. Father said the storm wasnt enought to bring the house down even though everyone else was evacuating.   Your dad led eveyone up stairs to the family room. A loud crack. Dad walks to the window facing the front yard to inspect. One more crack. Before you can even react the tree slammed through the wall taking you dad with it. Killing him instantly and ripping the wall mostly out.  Your mom runs towards the hole screaming your father name. She gets to the hole as the ground crumbles and she falls. Gipping the ground as the rain pulls her down. You rush and try to hold on. Doing everything your little bidy can to help. But its too late. She falls.  Trigger.

Parahumans,3ao0tm,idiodabble,15,Mon Jun 22 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"1) This was accomplished simply through social control, given the hellscape of high school.  We saw Taylor at the end-game of a long campaign by the Trio to dehumanize her in everyone's eyes.  2)  I... don't remember.  I think this was the nature of shards as sort of a mode of sexual reproduction by the entities, and Scion as one of their progenitors.  3)  I believe the plan was considered crucial because it wasn't clear just when Scion would go berserk.  Some of Dinah's guesses were decades out, which would give the world plenty of time to change.  Not to mention these plans were put in place before Dinah even happened.  Also, a big part of Cauldron's existence was dedicated to post-apocalypse survival, which is why their bases were so huge.  4) In my mind, S9 is powerful, sure, but their strength is threefold.  Powerful abilities, Jack's special talents guiding them in combat, and their veteran experience.  And STILL, in many confrontations, multiple members were lost.  The clones had only the first of those three characteristics.  It's also possible the shard was weakened, if only in that the passenger didn't grow properly with the owner.  5) My guess is that because her corona pollentia was altered by Bonesaw she has no control over any of these powers.  You're right though, it's a scary thought.  Tattletale may have been able to verify this off-screen."

Also, the heroes had experience and knowledge on how to kill almost all of the members by this point, so they knew what to do and where to attack."

Parahumans,3ao0tm,V3nomoose,12,Mon Jun 22 05:01:36 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting with the S9, very few of them actually have powers that are so awful to deal with. They get their rep from much the same way the Undersiders did (and that comparison is even made a few times). They only take fights they know they can win, and if they can't they either cheat so they can win or they get the fuck out of dodge. Most of their 'appearances' are just them showing up, causing chaos, and then leaving. The only real view we get of them fighting any of the powerhouses are Siberian's ""first"" apperance (and obviously she's a lot less threatening once you know you just gotta get Manton), during the actual S9 arc (which was primarily the Undersiders fighting and then some of the good guys at the end when y'know, they win) and then kind of off-screen with DnD (who nearly win based purely on the fact that they don't let the S9 have time to get away and plan).  Five Mannequinn's is only a scary thought until you think about the fact that literally any Bruiser could probably take that fight no problem. At the end of the day he's just a bendy dude with some chain knives and shit. There's more than one reason he only went after the mental powers. People like Cherish and Shatterbird are very similar, in that they have easily exploitable weaknesses against people who can deal with them. When you know X is at Y position because they're playing a dumb game, you can just send your guy Z to deal with them. As opposed to S9 SOP which is ""Where are they what's going on oh god help everything is exploding and on fire what's happening.""  Like which S9 are actually threatening to say, Weld and cannonblade-man? Crawler. Siberian assuming they don't know that Manton exists but not really if they do. Maybe Burnscar. And that's it for their 'current' members. Everyone else the two of them could easy take 1v1 really. And even Crawler is easy if you have resources because he's so masochistic. Just tell him you'll come back with a hero who can actually hurt him for real and then freeze/trap/siliconize him. He stood there and ate a bomb for chirssakes just do that again. I suppose there's Jack as well, but as we saw, a PRT man can handle him if he gets the jump. From the past yeah you've got some scarier members, but they also all died in the end anyway so... To be fair we don't know how much of that was infighting but it's safe to say they can't be that hard once you know them. The only one Jack was actually afraid of was Grey Boy (who got screwed anyway but that was pretty out there in his defense).  The reason that never occurs to people is because Jack doesn't go ""Hey guy's, today let's go 1v1 the Triumverate!"" because he's not an idiot. When you only take fights you can win and leave cities screaming in your wake, you look a hell of a lot scarier than when somebody stops and goes ""Wait seriously, you're a guy who can make knives go long? Really? You're not kidding.""  I mean Nilbog is the same way. He's only scary because he's set up. If you airlifted Nilbog to some remote location and then sent a team after him ASAP, he'd probably go down without too much trouble. Only dangerous because of the set-up, the power isn't too bad on it's own. That's the whole reason the PRT says that any self-replicating organisms instantly make you a Class-S theat. Genetically engineered cows are nothing but given a year you suddenly have explosive deaths cows stuffed to the brim with acidic shrapnel and enough of those that they can keep a stable population is kind of terrifying."

Part of it was also that Jack wasn't using them to the best of their ability, and that they were known factors. Don't forget that Jack's secondary power was coming into much greater effect in the old S9 days than over most of the S9000. Not that long-ranged.

Parahumans,3ao0tm,I_am_salad,6,Mon Jun 22 05:58:09 2015 UTC,"I can't speak that well to the other questions, but if you don't mind, I'm just going to copy my comment from a previous thread about the S9 clone arc:   In addition to other good responses in this thread, I'm just going to point out that the things that made the S9 cross the Godzilla Threshold were things that the S9K didn't have.  1) Jack is, surprisingly, an excellent... strategist/manipulator/tactician. None of those are quite the right word, but it's true. His presence in the field is a significant part of why they're so dangerous; there's a reason he remains the leader, after all. The clone groups didn't have him with them.  2) They flipped the script. Remember in the first S9 arc, where Taylor is decides that they can't afford to continue playing the game and that they should stop playing by the rules? She points out that part of why the S9 is so difficult to deal with is because they are unpredictable, and that the Undersiders are uniquely suited to deal with that, because they operate in a similar manner.  But in this scenario, the S9K can't operate that way. They're defending a fixed location that the heroes know about rather than moving around town killing while the heroes try to juggle their responsibility to protect people and their need to organize properly. They're reacting to the heroes as much as, if not more, than they are forcing the heroes to react to them. They have an advantage in that they're pushing people to move fast, and that the heroes never know exactly who is going to be at each location, but nonetheless they've stopped playing to their strengths and started playing to the PRT's - and if you doubt that that is one of the PRT's strengths, just take a look at how coordinated all the attacks are, and how much force they bring to bear very quickly. They aren't great at adapting in the same way the S9 can, but they can bring a lot of heroes together and organize them against single targets.  3) Jack wants his game to play out to the end. It's very likely that he deliberately organized things like some sort of video game - ever increasing challenge, but still hypothetically something the heroes can clear. None of the individual groups were as strong as the S9 in Brockton Bay, because they didn't have a balanced composition the same way the the S9 did, they didn't have Jack, they didn't have Bonesaw, and they didn't have time to rest and change up their tactics. All of those are factors that shouldn't be underestimated."

That didn’t necessarily improve things.  “Oh god, I’m sorry.  You know, I didn’t think about how it would bother you, saying that.  I really did want to help, you know, to do something back then, but-”""  It just fits too darn well! The girl appears confused, as though, upon reflection, it's obvious that the things that happened were horrible, but at the time her perspective had been warped to make her think it was reasonable. Like she only just down did a cache update. Ah well, I guess social pressure is another kind of Stranger power. :) Or Emma did trigger and no one realized it..."
Parahumans,3ao0tm,d20diceman,2,Wed Jun 24 01:16:38 2015 UTC,That's a really cool idea! Guess  we should compare how people talk about Emma before and after her death
Parahumans,3ao0tm,flagamuffin,2,Wed Jun 24 01:51:25 2015 UTC,"Q4: The S9 were very much a civilian terror. Their purpose was social unrest and their methods were proactive and (relatively) small scale. They hit specific hard targets and nonspecific soft targets in a random order, with the purpose of undermining social structure and causing fear.  They never had the power to stand up to an organised military as evidenced by Crawler's death, and once their numbers grew with the S9000, they lost their flexibility and ability to remain proactive and random.  Not to say they didn't shed a huge amount of blood, but it's hard to evade a coordinated military action when you can no longer depend on human shields to keep the artillery off you.  S9 was Vietnam. S9000 was Hitler in the Russian winter.  As for Cherish... She's a brain in a box at the bottom of the bay. Regen can only fix what it has the space to fix, strength means nothing without muscles, teleportation was, as far as I remember, line of sight, and Butcher wasn't immune to drowning.  Her own powers would reduce in strength and range with the arrival of her new powers, which in this case would actually just be a hindrance. Either a small portion of the Bay becomes suicide lake or her regen breaks a seal somewhere and the Butcherish brain box dies of asphyxiation with no 'killer' to jump into. End of Butcher."
Parahumans,3ao0tm,cephalord,2,Mon Jun 22 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"In addition to the stuff everyone else mentioned, parahumans get stronger over time. Not only do they learn like regular people, their shards become more strongly connected to them. Scion even notes this when the Number Man faces his clones.   But if Jack hadn't tossed away the Siberians like toys, and hadn't sent his Strangers into stand-up fights, and hadn't avoided using Shatterbird's anti-city capabilities, and so on...they could still have been much more scary than they were.   Nothing much, as far as I know. He went on villain-ing, and his group's path never crossed Taylor's again. No idea whether he survived to the end of the Gold Morning."

And it is even a hindrance on even a stupidly small scale of temporary, personal pain or discomfort!    It takes a lot of effort to say to myself, ""this is the best solution I have to the problem I need to solve"" and then to force myself to do it when that solution is unpleasant.

Anyways...take out the references to smoke, neon, and concrete, and miracleofsound's ""Fistful of Concrete"" works pretty well for Taylor, especially in the last arc. Some gems:  ""Yeah, I got this chip on my shoulder/Ain't got no love for clean lines...""  (Refrain) ""Let go my limitations/Let go my self control.../And I said ""Hey, hey, hey/Get the hell out of my way-ay-ay!/Won't listen to a word you say-ay-ay/Get the hell out of my way-ay-ay.../Fistful of concrete!""  ""Break the prison, crack the cage;/Fetch a friend and raise the rage."" (repeat)  Another good Taylor song from miracleofsound would be ""The Savage Side of Me"".  ""And I won't lay down/There's a darker shade of courage in the strength I've found/And it's letting loose the savage side of me.""  ""You can yearn for life to be simple or/You can learn from strife let it build your core/And refuse, refuse, refuse;/Don't you bow to the abuse.""  ""Fall down at the edge of my mind/So much horror behind/Burning heat/Get back to my feet....""    ""Friends"" fits the Undersiders as a whole, especially during the rough weeks.    In other miracleofsound news, the first verse of ""Distant Honor"" works pretty well for Eidolon. Sadly, the rest really doesn't.    Still miracleofsound, ""Man and Machine"" for either Defiant, D&D, or maybe Mannequin. (Of course, Mannequin is probably best without a theme song.)    Somehow, ""Calamity"" strikes me as a good song for the conclusion. Or maybe ""The Day the World Died"", since there seems to be some repeating of the past.    Strangely, none of the superhero-franchise-related songs by miracleofsound fit any capes particularly well. Maybe ""Rise,"" or perhaps ""Joker's Song"" for one of the more card-carrying villain types...  I'm a bit of a miracleofsound fan...    Going to songs more directly associated with other franchises...damn if ""Gold"" from the RWBY Volume 1 soundtrack doesn't fit Tattletale's and Taylor's relationship as well as it does Yang's and Ruby's. And while I initially thought of drawing a comparison between Ruby and her late mother, Summer Rose, and Taylor and her late mother, Annette Hebert nee Rose, I realized that it works pretty well with the other Undersiders as the ""Ruby"" and Taylor as the ""Summer"".  ""I wasn't dreaming when they told me you were gone/I was wide awake and dreaming that they had to be wrong/How could you leave me when you swore that you would stay?""  ""I know you didn't plan this/You tried to do what's right/But in the middle of this madness/I'm the one left to win this fight.""  (""Summer,"" presumably:) ""I know you're broken down by anger and by sadness./You feel I've left you in a world that's full of madness./Wish I could talk to you if only for a minute,/Make you understand the reasons why I did it./I wanna tell you that you're all that ever mattered/Want you to know that for eternity I'm shattered./I tried so hard just to protect you but I failed to/And in a prison of abandonment I've jailed you.""

Also, I've seen that assumption thrown around a lot and most people seem to agree with it and, since I finished Worm in a while, I don't recall how true or untrue it was.

The music starts as the bullets impact, but you don't really see the impact itself, just Khepri's face. She falls backwards in slow motion, a dreamy/confused look on her face as the camera follows her to the ground. At about 0:14 she impacts the ground, still in a state of sort of shock. The camera slowly pans out from her position on the ground as she slowly closes her eyes. There's a short series of flashbacks to various moments she had since her trigger, bonus points for the significant ""human"" moments she had with her friends. When she finally closes her eyes it segues into a short montage showing what everybody else was doing in the epilogues. Roll credits.  Sorry if I got a little carried away there."

Parahumans,3alhql,DistaNVDT,22,Sun Jun 21 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"Wildbow is Sleeper, Sleeper is Wildbow, his power is to re-write reality since he's the author. The book that Sleeper is reading on his porch is Worm and he's reading the events that are currently unfolding in the main storyline (khepri scouting the dimensions etc). The whole Wormverse is just Sleeper's dream."
Parahumans,3alhql,Kumquatodor,26,Sun Jun 21 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"I theorize that Sleeper's power is a master/shaker/stranger power that causes the world to work on dream logic, inside whatever radius his powers have. It would be one of Eden's shards, because it's so powerful. Probably working like Labrynth's shard or similar ones.  Viruses don't exist within his field. Small details are blurred to the point of nonexistence. Powers turn strange and slow. Nothing can really hurt him, because it seems like a dream. The arrangement of the city changes randomly, no path or color staying the same. People start thinking nonsensically. The temperatures become unimportant. Time is ridiculously variable, as is its effects on people. Sleeper is as strong or fast as he needs. He sometimes teleports, because he isn't paying attention to the dream. Memory is almost impossible, and nothing stays consistent anyways for very long. Motivations lose existence. Missiles don't hurt, because dream him barely notices them. A feedback loop. It's like he's dreaming, and so he misses things, and so they don't hurt, because the only things that exist in dreams is that which you notice.   And you better pray that he doesn't have a nightmare, because then Siberian+ levels of beings running around an already impossible, ever-changing landscape.    Basically, I theorize that he's a Shaker 12, with a drove of effects coming from it."

He just gleams information from the nonsense, because in dreams, our brains skip the actual reading. What it does is look at the sign, and therefore get the information. There is no analysis.  At least, that's how I read in dreams. Maybe I'm unique, but I get information off signs or whatever, despite noticing that it's nonsense. I once spent like 2 dream minutes (I guess I was more lucid than normal) rereading a book because I'd noticed that the squiggles kept changing, as did their meaning. It was very strange. It looked the length of a novel's page, but sometimes it would only read as a few sentences. Other times, it would be a page or more.  If, in an ""awoke"" state of mind, he tried to read, he'd see gobly-gook. But sleeping? He just skips the actual analysis part. He just gets it."

Parahumans,3alhql,Kumquatodor,7,Sun Jun 21 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, he said she could give Behemoth a good fight for a while before being beaten. So she's really just below Eidolon level, or about at max-power Lung."

It may also be that the weaving style confused her, or any number of things.  Alexandria walked into that meeting acting like she expected all of this, so it very well could be that she had planned on capturing Skitter at some point (due to her being a focal point in so much in Brockton Bay and her being a villain who was there for the Enchida reveal) and using those to pressure her into doing what she wanted.  Taylor turning herself in just meant that it happened faster.  At least, that's my theory."

So yeah, it's quite likely that Dauntless and all them will be released, but keep in mind the earth(s) will be a very different place from what they remember.

If they're forming new connections, they're getting power from the new hosts. Simple."
Parahumans,3ak2c1,ughzubat,14,Sat Jun 20 23:37:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the terms of engagement, but I think it'd be very hard. He's a Shaker, he manipulates the environment to his favor. So you'll have a damn hard fight if you let him dictate the terms of engagement...and that's exactly what you'll be faced with, because he's a careful planner, picks his battles, and by the time you get to the scene of the crime he's had five minutes to put up his darkness the way he wants it. Remember the tricks Grue pulled during the escape from the bank job.      Grue can cover a pretty huge area (multiple city blocks? At least the streets around them?) for a very long time (half an hour?) with fine control. Enough for monster dogs to lose themselves in the streets of Brockton Bay during heavy traffic! You're not going to be able to do a simple sweep through the area with something like linked arms, especially if there is complex cover (buildings/etc., sewers, ...) in the darkness where he could hide. Trying to trap him by putting a perimeter around the darkness is very hard. Not only can he adjust the shape of the darkness at will, but worse, he doesn't have to escape the darkness in costume! If he's pressured he can always take off his costume and blend with civilians. And he'll basically always have that option, because he makes sure to work in crowded urban areas where he blankets dozens to hundreds of people in his darkness; and they can't simply run away, because they're in sensory deprivation and don't know which way to go. His darkness blocks radio transmission (so you can't communicate with your people in the darkness) and severely messes up sound (to the point where Cricket's sonar didn't work!). I doubt a police-grade sonar or radar you could buy would work. Armsmaster (and probably Mannequin) had tech to see in his darkness, but they're top-notch tinkers; their equipment is out of your price range. For the same reason, since your people in the darkness are incommunicado, you're at a severe disadvantage if he changes tactics and you can't inform your men. E.g. your men go in on the East, then you in your copter see darkness billow and expand to the North - but you can't tell your men inside to head North! Also, suppose your men lock arms and march down the street...if he punches out one of your men, only the two people who locked arms with him will know right away, and by then he could've jumped over the fallen man and run past (like he did to Dauntless after the gallery job).      So yeah, it would be damn hard. IMO, your best bet is to infiltrate places you think he might rob where he has to speak to the people he's robbing face to face (like he did to the hostages in the bank job). When he tries to victimize your undercover agents, they whip out the containment foam and spray him before he can get his darkness up and run. You'd need a lot of luck and fast reactions to pull it off, but if you catch him flat-footed at close quarters you have a chance."
Parahumans,3ak2c1,Thinker6,9,Sun Jun 21 02:17:35 2015 UTC,Hard to be undercover with a large tank of foam on your back and a foam sprayer nozzle as long as your forearm.
Parahumans,3ak2c1,Wildbow,3,Sun Jun 21 15:19:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess I'm overestimating how flexible the foam-spraying systems are. It seems like the foam expands quite a bit in contact with air, so it only takes a small volume of foam tank to spray a large volume of foam. So as you say, the standard PRT foam tank is way too big to conceal, but that's if you want enough foam to truly bury a large crowd of people. I thought it might be possible to have a small sized tank, something you could conceal in a baggy coat, that would make enough foam to bog down a single opponent and glue them to the floor. Either as a spray, or something like a grenade that you throw at an opponent's feet that releases foam on impact. I guess there's nothing like that available?"
Parahumans,3ak2c1,Thinker6,8,Sun Jun 21 17:17:08 2015 UTC,Foam grenades do exist (source: PRT quest).  Smaller tanks still wouldn't work.  It's a question of all the needed paraphernalia for dispensation.
Parahumans,3ak2c1,Wildbow,2,Sun Jun 21 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"I'd think that if Grue was as cautious as he gets credit for, he'd blanket the area much earlier than he enters the place. Depends on what he's robbing, but he probably wouldn't walk in, in costume, then cover it all in darkness. Maybe in an alley next to the place, or even way down the street. Therefore you just run through to the place you need to be and run out. So unless he walks right in and informs everyone of his presence as he walks down the street to the target and inside the building, walking past your undercover agents in the process, you're going to either have to case all the alleys with people dressed as hobos hiding tanks of containment foam in piles of trash or garbage cans (which would be suspicious in and of itself because of the increased homeless person activity/population in business centers), or give up and assume that he's too cautious to really deal with."

Get your top men to advance slowly into the building level by level, utilizing spray and pray tactics and slowly clearing everything out.  Make extensive use of crowd control and AoE weapons to harm Grue(tear gas, getting everyone to stand side by side and firing automatic weapons straight ahead in front of them, flashbangs and grenades if possible). Proritize communication and coordination via radios.  Mount a containment foam sprayer on the helicopter and use it to provide aerial recon by picking out any visible darkness from where it's hovering over the building."
Parahumans,3ak2c1,Wildbow,3,Sun Jun 21 10:02:49 2015 UTC,"If he's in a building it's simple. Tear gas the ground floor, block up fire exits, and pour containment foam down through the top with the helicopter. Then go floor by floor. You don't need more than two men to scan a floor and it'll take them about fifteen minutes each floor to do it really thoroughly.  If he's on the street it's a problem. You have to cordon off everything and you don't have enough men to do it completely properly. Tear gas, again, is possible, but it's hard to acquire in the quantities to cover a block, and he can just hide in a building and we wouldn't know which one, so it would be hard to cover. This is made even worse by how he can just take off his costume and fade in with the surroundings.  So I don't know how I'd capture him in the streets. Lethally or non lethally.  EDIT - A thought arises - I heard of a crowd control method that uses a really loud sound to cause a ton of pain. Grue's darkness dampens sound for everyone but him. This could be used to capture him pretty well IMO."
Parahumans,3ak2c1,pitaenigma,6,Sun Jun 21 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"Containment foam solidifies too quickly for that (think of how shaving cream settles).  You'd deposit the lump through the top floor/stairwell and it would build up and make a containment foam plug, rather than fill the building."

Also, it's only mentioned that they keep going after she's knocked unconscious - we never see her die and then come back to life and notice her bugs kept working, so we can't make any assumptions there."
Parahumans,3ai2sv,Whispersilk,5,Sat Jun 20 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's right. Her bugs roughly keep following her last order if she's knocked unconscious (presumably because of her passenger's help), but as far as I can tell they stop following her orders if the bugs leave her range. And in support of your point, we have evidence that her bugs would immediately stop following her orders if she dies. When Clockblocker freezes her in, hmm, chapter 22.1 I think, she says her bugs ""went on their merry way"" while she was frozen, instead of following her last order."

And the main reasons Fanon ""Aleph movies"" are the same as our big movies is because most big movies that have come out recently and are referenced are comic-book superhero movies, which never really came into fashion on Bet, but could plausibly exist on Aleph, and would still have the original comics to be based on."
Parahumans,3ai2sv,sephlington,4,Sat Jun 20 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"A) Yes, but the point is that they were still made and still disappointing on Bet, which means there is no inherent reason to say ""Earth Aleph movie"" if you want to use a movie that exists in our world. B) If fictional superhero movies never really came onto fashion on Bet (that incidentally is fanon, there is no confirmation one way or the other in canon) the most likely ripple into Aleph would be that their movies would follow Earth Bet heroes instead of Marvel or DC (we know cape gekes that follow Bet exist on Aleph)."

Parahumans,3af3yx,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jun 20 21:04:48 2015 UTC,Cool.  Think we could bug Wildbow about when Blake and Sylvester's birthdays are?
Parahumans,3afhux,bulls55,35,Fri Jun 19 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that they did for fights pre Leviathan, but I find it very hard to convince people (who are already extremely powerful) to abandon their home and everything they ever saw to an Endbringer because they might be strong enough to do something in the future. I mean people aren't that logical, and when I say people I mean Dauntless..."
Parahumans,3afhux,idannadi,12,Fri Jun 19 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"Especially since anti-Endbringer weapons probably generally end up like Lung at best or Armsmaster and Phir Se at worst: the EB wins, and likely kills them. I can see why the PRT isn't going crazy about sacrificing certain cities for that."
Parahumans,3afhux,Tsegen,13,Sat Jun 20 01:22:34 2015 UTC,"If you look at those fights, there are a lot of people who aren't really very useful. My explanation for that is partly for the reason idannadi laid out, people want to defend their home.  Another reason might be solidarity. It would be harder to convince capes with important power to regularly show up, if many others just go ""My power isn't that useful anyway, I'll just stay home!"" So instead, teams go in as a unit, even if only half of them have a power that can really contribute.  The last reason might be just pride or being afraid to look bad. They might think they'll be called cowards or otherwise lose face. You could compare it to WW1 in Britain, where some young men felt so humiliated when given a white feather by women in the community, that they lied to sign up even when they were underage or had jobs important to the war effort."
Parahumans,3afhux,Gworn,9,Fri Jun 19 20:43:35 2015 UTC,"It's not just about the average capes too. It's about the perception of the PRT. Everyone in the PRT shows up. They're the backbone of the entire EB effort. Other people can be self-serving, they are more limited.  They suddenly start holding the powerful people back and what does it look like? Oh, we don't give a shit about Switzerland, or X tiny country/city. You're not as important to us as Dauntless. Lol, fuck you guys."
Parahumans,3afhux,Tsegen,7,Sat Jun 20 01:21:51 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone would have called Dauntless a coward if the Protectorate and PRT made him sit out endbringer fights until he was powerful enough to easily survive fighting them. Remember people were hoping he would become powerful enough to actually kill endbringers so they would be the ones most supportive of the idea of benching him until then.
Parahumans,3afhux,Gworn,10,Fri Jun 19 20:51:05 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking specifically of him. More of a wider trend in the attendance. Half of the Undersiders were pretty useless in those fights and were there anyway, for instance.  I think overall this displays that they were not a military. There was no discipline, little training for these situations, no general staff, etc."
Parahumans,3afhux,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri Jun 19 21:01:51 2015 UTC,Dauntless would have. And that's enough.
Parahumans,3afhux,GreatWyrmGold,11,Sat Jun 20 01:52:26 2015 UTC,"""Hey, Dauntless?""  ""Yeah?""  ""You know how Leviathan's coming right to your front door and gonna wreck everything? And how you're one of the most powerful superheroes in the city?""  ""Yeah.""  ""Go to the shelter with the civilians, okay?""  ""..."""
Parahumans,3afhux,Ranku_Abadeer,3,Sat Jun 20 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"yeah pretty much this. when an endbringer shows up, you can't afford to turn anyone away. you need all the help you can get, and a cape like dauntless isn't going to say ""i'm too important to fight this monster"" because not only would that just be a dick thing to do, it would be career suicide."
Parahumans,3afhux,Wildbow,3,Sat Jun 20 05:24:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you would just be holding back one cape until he was strong enough to potentially kill the mass murdering monsters driving humanity to extinction. Sure in the short term they may lose a few capes who could been saved but in the long term they may finally have a way to actually kill the endbringers, saving far more lives than in the short term.  ""What do you mean I cant fight the endbringers yet?""  ""sorry Dauntless but our thinker put you around level 40 and Leviathan is at least level 91. Maybe when you level up some more we can talk.""  ""But-""  ""I know how you feel but think of it this way it would be seriously irresponsible of us to let one of mankinds best hope get killed before his even ready to stand toe to toe with the endbringers. Just trust us on this, you will save far more lives by killing the endbringers than by dying early."""
Parahumans,3afhux,este_hombre,7,Sat Jun 20 06:30:08 2015 UTC,But they don't know that for sure.  What if Dauntless hit a hard cap?  Or his upgrades started plateauing?
Parahumans,3afhux,pseudonarne,10,Mon Jun 22 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"Since the PRT and Protectorate are Huge end of Series spoiler At least that's my logic. Occam's Razor says he's a hero and he wants to fight bad guys/save people, so that works too."

Parahumans,3afhux,timmetbentimmet,7,Sat Jun 20 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"The PRT/Protectorate does not so much run the parahumans as manage them. Parahumans are more than a collection of powers, it is very likely that Dauntless would have wanted to fight for his home regardless of what the PRT said, so by 'allowing' him you are at least not making more enemies."
Parahumans,3afhux,ThirdFloorGreg,5,Fri Jun 19 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"This actually happens in Cenotaph. It's fanfiction, but still. They do let him fight but they pull him out at the first sign of trouble for this very reason. I had the same problem with Fletchette. Why let her fight until you find a way to leverage her power in a more substantial way than a crossbow bolt? Took Taylor all of 30 seconds to think of something."
Parahumans,3afhux,sanctaphrax,8,Fri Jun 19 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"Flechette only looks crazy powerful because we have insider information. They probably didn't even know her power would work on Endbringers until she tried it. To the Protectorate she probably looked like a mid level cape, like most of the grab-bag powers."
Parahumans,3afhux,Tsegen,6,Sat Jun 20 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"I think they knew she could hurt Endbringers. She mentions when talking to Parian that she was one of the few capes who could really damage them.  But for that exact reason, they're not gonna keep her back from the fight. She literally pierced Leviathan's head all the way through in Arc 8, IIRC. If you don't understand Endbringer physiology, that seems like a big deal.  The crossbow is actually a pretty intelligent way to apply her power, but the whole aiming-for-the-purely-cosmetic-head thing kinda ruins her combat effectiveness."
Parahumans,3afhux,GreatWyrmGold,6,Sat Jun 20 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"She mentions it long after she already proved that she could hurt Endbringers. So we don't know if she knew in the Leviathan fight.   But either way, there's simply no breathing room. You tarry too long trying to munchkin some sort of magic EB combo and the EBs kill a few cities, maybe even come for the keystone cape and then likely kill them and everyone there. The universe will not cooperate with your team-stacking. In fact, it will actively move to nip it in the bud.   Fletchette is an especially good example of the problem. The fandom overestimates capes with the offense, but not the defense. There are about three or four capes that have both, which is what you need. And like, at least one is knocked out in that he never succeeded (Eidolon) and another may not have enough mobility (Gray Boy, who can maybe be drowned, we don't know the range of his regen-teleport).  . Everyone else is ""promising"" but not something a concrete enough plan could come out of, one concrete enough to justify letting who knows how many cities and millions die. It's only because we didn't see an EB do to Fletchette what it did to Phir Se that we're even talking about it. But it could easily have been her with the promising weapon and eventual death."

Parahumans,3afhux,Tsegen,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"Still, the cost benefit analysis feels off. While she can still hurt them, the only targets she's charging aren't large enough to do real damage. We know they wanted to experiment with ""inviolable"" powers like hers and Clockblocker's. And while I know coordination of forces during endbringer attacks is shoddy as hell, it seems odd that the PRT wouldn't have a plan ready to place capes with those powers around those who can either protect them or get them in better position to make a difference. As for tarrying, Fletchette's not one of the Triumvirate where her being on the front lines is crucial to even holding the line. She seems like the perfect cape to test things out with. I get that there are tons of surrounding circumstances but the PRT Chiefs do not come across all that tactically impressive."
Parahumans,3afhux,pseudonarne,5,Sat Jun 20 05:38:15 2015 UTC,", the only targets she's charging aren't large enough to do real damage.   How do they know what real damage is?   As far as I can tell hitting the EBs anywhere will do little, at least, that's what capes in-universe would see. It's just hitting them hard enough (or Scion hitting them hard enough) is what works.    it seems odd that the PRT wouldn't have a plan ready to place capes with those powers around those who can either protect them or get them in better position to make a difference.   You can try but these are creatures that are built to handle 99% of power combinations and still keep ticking. And they're smart and fast and tough and they're playing around. Make the cape strong, they're stronger. Make them invincible, they can drown or bury her. Fast, and they might chase you away from the battle or try to get you at the right time (they haven't and likely won't be 1-hit killed).  Also: those capes might be needed elsewhere.   That's why you'd to tarry, to build a plan with synergy, because they can kill her if you don't have the offense, defense and mobility and for that you need the right capes with the powers who aren't otherwise essential to other, perhaps more meaningful or successful plans.   Or you can put her out there and see. Which will likely fail like every other attempt, because this game is rigged."

Parahumans,3afhux,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jun 20 12:26:33 2015 UTC,Doing so would have also deprived him of fighting experience. Not much use becoming more powerful than Eid if you trip up on your first fight and get accidentally stood on by Behemoth.
Parahumans,3afhux,pseudonarne,2,Fri Jun 19 21:29:14 2015 UTC,He could get fighting experience by going up against criminals and supervillain. The difference between waiting to fight an endbringer and rushing in is that he would actually stood a really good chance of surviveing being stood on by Behemoth by waiting instead of just being vaporized by getting within the kill radius.

Despite not knowing shit about droids, aiming bladders funny, being racist against all aliens, and being overly attached to that damn hat, he's doing pretty well!

As far as I can tell Urr left his memories alone, except concerning people and things that it ate. All of his memories up to the point Molly died are Ros-'s memories. No one ever called him Blake because his name wasn't Blake. Unless you go with the theory that Blake is an amalgamation of some of his memories and some of some poor homeless sap from Toronto's, but the ending doesn't support that at all.

Rose's memories cut out every time someone used her name, since only the first bit was right. Blake remembered failing to art, but not what kind of art he attempted. They really were half people, with nothing to fill in the gaps; Blake just didn't notice because he was a bit preoccupied from the second his existence began. The things falling into place that happened with Urr was defense against cognitive dissonance, it happened in response to the discontinuity of having all the connections to a particular person obliterated. Blake and Rose both had the perception of continuity with, uh, I'm gonna call him Brose because I find it amusing.   And I'm gonna abandon this because I suddenly am not sure about my earlier assertion that Blake didn't exist until Molly died. He and Rose both had memories of the meeting, but I'm not sure how the Barber could split them after RDT died, what with being bound and all."

I enjoyed Pact for the most part, but it did get somewhat unrelenting by the end, which maxed out my ability to feel engaged by ""more intensity!"".   Not sure how the experience was modulated by the fact that I was reading week-to-week as compared to the rapid binge I was able to do with Worm, having arrived as a new reader when it was close to the end. Whether the waiting made the overall experience feel like it was dragging on, or if it was breaking it up and lightening the load (and it would have been even more intense if binge-read).  Absolutely loving Twig though. So good. Although I fear I am going to have my heart broken when irreversible bad things inevitably happen to one of the characters that I like best.

Parahumans,3a904w,Kumquatodor,7,Thu Jun 18 04:30:38 2015 UTC,"Can we do one in reverse? :) I came up with a power a long time ago, after playing certain MMOs on crappy dialup, but I'm not sure exactly how it'd be classified by the Protectorate/PRT.  Name: Lag  When Lag activates his power, his body and whatever items he's carrying (Manton-limited) split into two; an 'anchored' body and a 'potential' body. They co-occupy the same space initially.  His anchored body is immobile (but still moves anchored to whatever surface he's standing on, e.g. Earth, airplane, etc.) However, his mind still works. His perception operates only from his anchored body -- he can see and hear whatever his anchored body can see and hear.   Lag can send impulses to his muscles to move his 'potential' body. His potential body can take any number of actions (Manton-limited, but only directly). For example, his potential body can't stab someone, but could pull the pin on a grenade, or could put a garrote around someone's neck. These actions are undetectible, and the effects of these actions do not yet take place.  His 'potential' body is undetectible by any direct means. (One could guess where it is by mind-reading Lag or by using some kind of precog to determine the effects after it moves.) Even Lag himself cannot perceive it, other than by knowing what actions he has already taken / where he has moved it to.  His anchored body cannot be harmed -- as though Clockblocker had affected it. His potential body can be harmed, (e.g. if someone uses wide-area effects or correctly guesses where it is), but the harm does not take effect until the power ends.  Lag can end his power at any time, but if he maintains it for 64 seconds then it automatically ends. When it ends, four things happen:   Lag's anchored body dissappears Lag's potential body manifests, and Lag's perception moves to what is perceivable by the potential body All the effects of the actions take place now. (e.g. grenades go off, that sort of thing). Exception: if the potential body took an action with a time-delay LONGER than the duration of the power, it will go off after its normal duration elapses. Harm done to his potential body takes effect.   Lag also has a secondary power to enable his primary power to work; which is that he has a preternaturally good sense of position and direction even without being able to perceive his body. (Normal folks have a hard time walking in a straight line with their eyes closed, but Lag can. More impressively, he can also do it without even being able to feel his legs.) This does not allow him to perceive external things that he couldn't otherwise perceive.  After ending his primary power, Lag requires an amount of time equal to approximately double the duration he used it for, before he can use it again."

Rarely are they met with apathy but elicit strong responses, even when they do not seem to be acting in a provocative fashion. Just their presence alone can be somewhat intimidating and therefore arouse antagonism, but their intense drive and fortitude may also inspire admiration.      Women born on this day are highly persuasive, directed, and usually know exactly what they want, whether it be career or educational advancement, an emotionally rewarding relationship or financial stability.       Both men and women born on this day tend to set events around them in motion.      June 19 people are highly stimulating, capable of getting the most sluggish of individuals moving. Their strong convictions and courage to act definitely serve as a positive example. Although their methods of motivating others may seem rather strong medicine, there is no denying that a good kick in the pants is what is required now and then. Also, though others may feel some resentment at being urged on, they will usually appreciate a June 19 person’s good intentions.      A real problem for June 19 people may be an inability or a refusal to recognize limitations both in themselves and in their social role. Driving themselves too hard or too fast may not only put them at risk of breakdown but may actually land them in difficult situations. Perhaps they do perform well under stress, even shine, but over time, such stress can take its toll. Those born on this day should consider the effect of their hard-driving lifestyle on their family and loved ones, who may not have bargained for so much struggle.

Parahumans,3a3mtr,Amargosamountain,15,Tue Jun 16 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"Theorizing about Ziz is futile.  But for the sake of argument, everything that happens in the story is part of her plan.  Doubt me?  Okay, let's start early on with a single example.  Madison, Wisconsin.  She brings the Travelers over and ensures that they get powers, manipulating events so that Noelle becomes Enchida, and Perdition screws over the group.  They then join Coil.  Perdition later gets sold to the Yangban by Accord.  Without this, the ending wouldn't have happened.  See, the Noelle incident sets the groundwork for Legend stepping down and Taylor joining the Wards.  This gives her the legitimacy that she needs in order to be a leader, respected by others.  She'll need that in the final battle.    But why mention Perdition?  It's simple, imagine if Accord lived.  The challenge of fighting Scion would have been ultimate.  His intelligence would have been supreme, and people would be following the plan that he came up with.  A plan that would, ultimately, fail, creating too great of losses.  With a master planner in place, Taylor wouldn't have had the right stressors on her, leading to the scenario where she becomes Khepri.  Without Khepri, humanity fails.  As to why, I'm personally of the belief that she was simply fulfilling her role as to create conflict.  If Zion destroys humanity, she can't stir up anymore shit, because there's nobody left.  What's the point in singing if nobody can hear the swan's song?"
Parahumans,3a3mtr,ErrantVagrant,8,Wed Jun 17 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"Are you implying that Ziz is more powerful than Zion? She doesn't seem to have to pay the same high price for using precognition, at least."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,ErrantVagrant,17,Wed Jun 17 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"No, compared to Zion she's a speck.  She just sees a far bigger picture than Zion does, looking down the timeline and setting pieces in place in advance to get the outcomes she wants.  That's her one, and only, advantage over Zion.  He only looks into what he wants to look into.  By the time of the end, he's only living in the moment.  The future doesn't interest him, so he isn't looking there.  It's his own short-sightedness that does him in under this scenario.  Again, I'm just playing Devil's Advocate right now.  I'm presenting one argument without actually buying into it."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,ErrantVagrant,10,Wed Jun 17 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's a very good argument. Considering the ""information wins fights"" credo of the story, Ziz's informational advantage is substantial."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,ricree,10,Wed Jun 17 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"Not just information, but attitude.  If Zion were to have approached things differently, taking out his biggest threats like Foil first and then crushing everyone with abandon or just stripping parahumans of their powers, Ziz wouldn't be able to fight it.  But because he isn't thinking tactically, because he has no desire to make serious efforts towards self-preservation or foresight, he ultimately opens himself up to being taken down.  After all, how can these... pests stand up to him?"
Parahumans,3a3mtr,ErrantVagrant,3,Wed Jun 17 05:41:53 2015 UTC,"I wonder what kind of power supply she has. From what I can recall, Zion was loath to use his more powerful precog abilities for fear of draining too quickly. Admittedly, he was trying to ration those in hopes that if he waited long enough a lucky break might provide some unforeseen way to save the cycle.  Sim, on the other hand, seems to play with the future constantly and without hesitancy. I can't help but wonder what effect that might have over her shard's lifespan, or if she'll find some way to recharge now that she's mostly unshackled."

Simply put, it's very possible that it may be a byproduct of the way that Endbringers are created that fuels their abilities.  I can't go into details right now because my buddy would rather I not (he's using some of his theories in a fanfic he's doing, under the pretense that they're just theories people have come up with) but after he gets to those parts of the story, I'll go ahead and create a thread here."

Parahumans,3a3mtr,GreatWyrmGold,18,Wed Jun 17 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"Questions 2 and 5 - sequel hooks  6 - the theory i like most is that Eden (scions partner) made the endbringers but crashed before she could get them all set up. Then Eidolon gets a shard connected to them and they react to his subconscious, i.e. needed stronger opponents.  9 - Hes indirectly related. Cauldren knew Scion would go rogue eventually, and set out to make sure that there were as many parahumans left at the end as possible to fight him. Their analysts predicted that parahumans taking control away from governments, setting up their own feudal systems was inevitable. Coil (and later Taylor) was a test case for establishing a way to do this with the least amount of disruption, fighting, parahumans dying. So again, there would be more fodder for Scion.  10 - Its not just comments or word of god, there is adequate evidence in text it was a eating disorder. Including Noelle commenting on the irony of getting a power that makes her eat/works by throwing up. Or her saying Sundancer (can't remember her civilian name off the top of my head) understanding her issue, after Noelle just talked about all the pressure Sundancer's mom places on her to be ""perfect."""
Parahumans,3a3mtr,Vaikusin,7,Tue Jun 16 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"For #6: I've never understood that theory. The Endbringers aren't much like the superweapons we see, aside from the most general characteristics. The superweapons are clearly human, with a few distincy animal characteristics. The Endbringers are vaguely humanoid, with differences tending towards the chaotic and raw-hewn. The superweapons seem to have discrete, specialized powers from what little we see; the Endbringers undeniably have vague, broad ones.  They're similar, but not the same. They were probably made the same way, but not exactly; they definitely weren't from the same pre-existing ""box""."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,TildeAleph,8,Wed Jun 17 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"Thats part of what I meant by Eden crashed before they were ready. I think for the most part the Endbringers we see are their default mode. Its likely that every time the entities arrived on a new planet that they could use to cultivate shards, they would disguise the Endbringers to blend in with the local creatures. If this theory is correct, then the reason the Simurgh and Tohu and Bohu appear more human than the other Endbringers we see could be that Eden had finished there face lift but crashed before doing the others, thus some look vaguely human while others read much more alien. Also, the same vision that Eden mentions employing super weapons in is based on the idea that everything worked out according to the entities plan, which might (and its a theory, so yeah, might) include the Endbringers being set up like they were intended and not the state we see them in."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,Tsegen,2,Wed Jun 17 02:20:40 2015 UTC,I really like this idea. The Endbringers were basically deformed in the same way as Case 53's
Parahumans,3a3mtr,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:39:58 2015 UTC,"Or Eidolon just made them with a shard or his particular OP shard. Like, the EBs are clearly responses to the situation on Earth Bet, everyone that comes is based on how they fought the others, this is both clear in canon and WoG. Sure, there might be an Endbringer for every situation or they just may be made as needed.  Not to mention that they are shaped. They're not shaped to blend in, they're explicitly shaped to be terror weapons, so it's not like there's a skeleton of an Endbringer that Eden forgot to finish. They're not supposed to be humans but were unfinished, they're supposed to be massive monsters or humanlike with uncomfortable religious connotations in Simurgh's case."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"""Default mode""?  I don't see any reason to think the Endbringers existed anywhere before Eidolon made them. Where were they? How did Eden/etc get to them? Where did they come from? Why were they made ahead of time?  If the Endbringers were set up beforehand, why do we not see proper superweapons? And again, why would they? Looking too far into the future wastes too much energy, and it's not any more expensive to make them on-the-spot.  And there's more than just their shape that makes the Endbringers different than the superweapons. We don't see much of the superweapons' powers, but they seem more restricted and definitely more nuanced than the raw powers of the Endbringers. There's also a sort of progression; the Simurgh is more human in appearance than Leviathan, and Leviathan more than Behemoth; Behemoth's powers are the most raw, Leviathan's more nuanced, Khonsu and the twins more so than the original trio; and so forth. Why would Eidolon happen to pick premade Endbringers in an order which suggests they were made by someone slowly, unconsciously, learning how to do so?"

Contrast Leviathan, with an unnatural head structure, tail, and a raw ability to control water, or Khonsu, a feral humanoid with a sphere in the middle and basically unlimited teleportation plus some semi-limited force field/time control abilities ripped from Eidolon's latest big trick.  We see another, a female humanoid with a serpentine lower body, emitting steam. Contrast Simurgh, who much art has shown as being very human and distinctly female, but I don't think she's been described as such; she also has random wings sticking out everywhere, and raw, unrestricted telekinesis and ESP of several kinds. Contrast also Bohu, a stretched humanoid pillar with limitless shaker ability.  We also see a third, essentially human, with what can be interpreted as hydrokinetic abilities. Contrast Behemoth, who has some spikes and such added to a crude humanoid form and a crude (though vast) energy-control power, and Tohu, who also has a raw, unrestricted power-copying power plus a rather inhuman form."
Parahumans,3a3mtr,ThatDamnSJW,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:46:11 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Eden tell the alt!Armsmaster that there are nine more superweapons? The progression of Endbringers on Bet has been a de-escalating scale of projected force going from Behemoth's lack of Manton limit and city-wrecking power, down through Leviathan who can break landmasses but usually isn't given the time, all the way down to a pair where one just turns the area into a deathtrap and the other mimics capes. Still pretty powerful, but much closer to the stricter powersets of the superweapons.  It's possible that in Eden's prime world, the superweapons came out of the box in order of least to most powerful. No reason in particular to believe this, but we do see a clear progression of most to least powerful in the world which could arguably be described as Eden's least ideal world, so there's some parallel. I can't remember, was there an order given for the superweapons?"
Parahumans,3a3mtr,Samwise210,0,Thu Jun 18 03:49:57 2015 UTC,"There was no order given for Eden's superweapons, no, and we don't know about enough of them to talk about any kind of progression even if we did. And even if we knew the superweapons were made in a given order, it wouldn't really mean anything about their origin.

Parahumans,3a3mtr,Iconochasm,5,Wed Jun 17 03:54:29 2015 UTC,"i think i can possibly answer the last 4 on that list.   i think she was talking about what she had discovered about the shards and how they worked and by extension the entities. if you assume that the simurgh is working off of the entities plan (and not that maybe she has her own independant one since she isn't tied to a living entity/is tied to eidolon) then it would actually be a bad thing for the humans to find out this information, since it could lead to humanity rebelling against the entities (similar to how one of the first species zion's ancestor interacted with did) the entities get some of the best results if they can keep humans from knowing anything about them and just let them develop on their own. i don't think she really does interact with her other than the few times we see it in text. but remember, she DOES realize that Dragon is an A.I. when she spills the beans on it before saint tells everyone, she acts like she's known for a while and already had her own theories on her. cauldron's main plans for the most part was taking charge of the world with parahumans, yes as you say, that is inevitable, and they said as much too, but they were trying to accelerate the time table as much as possible and hit that sweet spot with parahuman powers. (largest number of people without having too many taken out by the endbringers and all that) they recognized brockten bay as being the best possibility of that succeeding (kinda in a ""if you can succeed here, you aren't about to get torn out) yeah it was most likely anorexia. it's mentioned a lot in that arc that she doesn't eat almost at all, and sundancer knows about it enough to comment on it a lot. (her forcing noelle to eat a doghnut before leaving the coffee shop, noelle mentions her complaining about her picking at her food at school, and then noelle throws up the earlier doughnut and says ""no i tried so hard"" ect.) the simurgh made her relive the relapses because it would keep her insecure enough to doubt that she deserved super powers, and she made krouse desparate enough to push her into accepting a compromise.  the 5-word confession probably was ""i have an eating disorder""   as for the rest of that, i can't really say. except for the simurgh thing.   i've pointed it out before, but it does seem that the simurgh has been shaping events to help lead the world to golden morning and specifically to the rise of khepri.  she created maniquin and fighting him was a pivotal point of skitter's development  she created echidna, which lead to her forming connections with heroes and becoming hard enough to stand up to her while the assembled capes watched she made the yangban vulnerable it's mentioned that she maybe tells the other endbringers what to do, meaning that she planned every endbringer attack since at least when she first showed up. which again helped skitter to take leadership of capes and hone her skills against impossible to defeat monsters and she reminded skitter of dianah's note (it's said right before she becomes khepri that it was a reminder as well as in the simurgh's chapter) and that's just what we see her do that affects skitter. how much else did she pull off? with how she sets up rube goldberg machines of fate, i'm inclined to believe that she was trying to help out eidolon's side from the beginning."

Parahumans,3a3mtr,ThirdFloorGreg,6,Wed Jun 17 00:43:13 2015 UTC,"""Q: Who created the Endbringers?""  My understanding of Eidolon's power is that he got Eden's version of the Administrator shard. In Scion's interlude we see him send out the Admin shard last because he uses it to program limits to the other shards and set which hosts they will bond with unless they find a better candidate. So I think when Eidolon switches his powers, his shard looks through Eden's stash and picks ones it thinks will help him, causes them to form a temporary bond with him, and guides the way that power functions.  When Eidolon subconsciously wanted stronger opponents, his passenger called up whatever shard or shards Eden would have used to create the super-weapons from the alt timeline and guided the formation of the Endbringers based again on Eidolon's subconscious.  Edit: As far as why the Endbringers are different than the super-weapons in the alt timeline, Tattletale says in 28.4 while they're recruiting the Simurgh,    “The shell?  No.  The outer shell, the concept, the execution, they’re tapping into religious metaphors.  The devil, the serpent, the angel, buddha, mother earth, the maiden, each connected in turn to fundamental forces.  Flame, water, fate, time, earth, the self.  Things deep-seated and fundamental to their creator’s belief system, because that’s how the passengers interpret our world.  Through us.  But deep down?  Beyond that surface, beyond the basic programming that drives them to do what they’ve been doing for thirty years?  It’s the passenger’s brush strokes.  And I’m getting to her.”"

It could be that he's lying; he's not above that.   6a. I'm pretty sure that Eidolon made them with the power Eden intended to make the superweapons with. His goals were different and he didn't understand the power (or realize he was using them), so they're a bit different...but largely similar.  6b. Dunno. Could be self-preservation, could be revenge, could be they imprinted on a bunch of people who wanted revenge. Could be that the Simurgh has a mind of its own that it's using now that Eidolon's gone, but I dunno where it would have gotten that.   It could just be that. Not much, no. Dragon's a Canadian hero, Tattletale's a...United Stater villain. Plus, her power doesn't do much a normal person couldn't theoretically figure out, and Dragon's very careful about hiding herself.

It is also known as maighdean uaine (Green Maiden)...  There's a pronunciation guide right there (at least for ""Glaistig"") but I'm not up enough on my IPA to know what ʃ or ɨ refer to. æ is indeed the ""a"" from ""plastic"" though...  Edit: Apparently ɨ is a ""Close front unrounded"" vowel, which means sort of between ee in ""beet"" and oo in ""food"". But closer to ee than oo. Maybe more like a schwa than an oo, but not exactly that either. Closest I can think of to describe what I think it is, is like the i in ""pencil"" if you don't really try to pronounce the i, but you pronounce it a little more like an i than a regular schwa. (Edit edit: Or maybe the 'e' in ""roses"" assuming you say it kinda ike ro-ziz and not like ro-zuzz.)  ʃ, on the other hand, is just a ""sh"" noise.  Glashtig."

Skitter logic bombed the AI into thinking that if the AI moved, it could case the death of Imp, which it was programmed not to do. Even when Sundancer comes along, the suit thinks that if it moves, it could kill Imp, so it doesn't move, allowing Sundancer to destroy it.  Coil likely used his power to split into two universes - one where grenades were used, one where they were not. Perhaps in the other universe Skitter managed to throw one back or otherwise use them to her advantage.  MM might have been shocked and gripped by a moments indecision. Her shot may have been blocked by a guard rushing to stop her. She may have been thinking about the PR consequences of killing a prisoner. She could have been curious about why Skitter turned herself in. Maybe she just liked Skitter.  Skitter already had no leverage. Alex (appeared like she) was going to capture or kill all of the Undersiders. She was putting pressure on Skitter, since if she didn't surrender NOW, then she would lose her friends. If Alex just went and beat everyone up first, then Skitter has nothing else to lose, so can take her time. It's a salesman's technique."

It's stated in the text that the Azazel had run out of power by the time Sundancer got to it. This becomes easier to believe when Dragon herself states it was a beta test model. Already covered by user Pendia - the grenade attack did happen, in Coils alternate universe, and it demonstrably didn't work as intended.   3a.

They both said that they had plans, but neither were willing to elaborate.  Take into account what all Miss Militia has seen.  She knows what kind of person Alexandria is, and most likely knows what her clone said.  Now, let's see what all she's seen of Taylor.  Taylor might have done bad things, but she always had good reasons for them.  Defiant has confirmed that Skitter wanted to be a mole, and that he screwed that up.  The whole thing at the end of Leviathan, Hannah was willing to hear both sides and make decisions based off of what she observed.  She saw that Taylor fought and really pulled her weight, only to get screwed in the end.  Afterwards?  Taylor's area was the safest in the city, and she fought hard for the civilians.  Slaughterhouse 9?  She fights to keep people safe.  Enchida?  More of the same.  The entire time, her methods may be horrific, but her motivations are pretty clear, at least, in time they become clear.  Skitter is even willing to negotiate and work with the Protectorate, so long as they don't screw her over.  When they do, well, again, her reactions are understandable.  As far as Hannah knows, Alexandria just flat out murdered a cape in order to fuck with Taylor.  Tagg is going right along with it, and might have had a hand in it.  You expect a girl who just had her friend murdered to not lash out?  Especially when the person who's lashing out has been more fair and willing to work to improve the city that either Tagg or Alexandria?  So Hannah does the smart thing and gets the civilians out before they get hurt in the crossfire."

Parahumans,3a42s2,Iconochasm,4,Wed Jun 17 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"One theory for Alexandria pressuring Skitter so harshly is that that's just how she acts.  She's always shown as kind of harsh and unyielding.  She has her impressive Thinker rating, but a large chunk of that is just offloading processing to her shard, which is designed to promote conflict.  Yes, it was a dead Eden shard, so it wasn't nearly as conflict-philic as a regular one, but it's certainly possible she had a low-level version of Accord's issue."

On the other hand, Cherish is a blood thirsty member of the Slaughterhouse 9 who's made parents carve up their own children.

I don't think he was trying to kill Parian, he was more venting his anger/frustration while getting to flex his full power, which he rarely gets to do. I think he would have felt awful later, had he found out he killed Parian in his pique.  He's not as averse to killing as Sundancer/Marissa, he's a bit more pragmatic, but he is averse to it generally. Look at how he pointed to telegraph his shots while fighting the Wards in the Kid Win interlude, making sure his targets were behind cover, using suppression fire only."

This, plus the apparent sudden aversion to killing her (even though it just reminds him of someone) made it seem like it was meant to be her protecting herself with her powers by colouring his emotions towards her.

I could see Grue grabbing Ballistic’s shoulder with one hand and pointing at the Nine with the other.  “What’s going on, Grue?” I asked.  “He’s chickening out.”  He’s supposed to handle Cherish.  I glanced at the Nine.  No sign of anything from her.  She was standing apart from the rest of the group, her arms folded.  “She looks like someone I used to know,” Ballistic said, as if that was some kind of answer.  “Who?” Trickster asked.  “Sadie.  From seventh grade.”  “Nope,” Trickster replied.  “Not in the slightest.  Your head’s fucking with you.  Get the job done.”  “But-”   Seems pretty clear.  I'm assuming Cherish was also shit-scared of the S9 by this stage and hoped to cajole the Undersiders/Travelers into helping her escape later so that's why she didn't just devastate the 'good guys' with homicidal/suicidal emotions right then, either that or the long range meant that she couldn't just outright make him shit his pants and run away.

Dragon was, essentially, an artificial human, making her close enough for their purposes. In order to trigger on Earth, a life form would have to have an essentially human psychology since that is what the shards are looking for. Nilbog's creations don't seem to qualify, and even if they did, the shards probably ignore shard-created organisms. Dragon and Blasto's clones, however, are not shard created. The shards drive tinkers to create, and they give them some of the knowlege and unconsciously guide rhem to the actions necessary to do so, but they do not themselves build tinker tech."

Second, I think that there's an intelligence barrier or some other quantifier.  Or a perception level necessary.  I can't remember the term, but I remember my buddy mentioning that before a certain age kids don't understand that what they know isn't known by everybody else.  Like if they know that something is hidden, they don't understand that someone else won't know where it's hidden unless they're the ones doing the hiding.  It's also suspected that animals have this same issue.  This would give a minimum age to trigger (I think it's three or four) and make a gate for the local residents of the mudball to trigger.  But that also implies a greater understanding of local brain patterns than what the Entities are implied to have.  Hmm.  Tricky.

Freeman Dyson originally described what's basically a ring of satellites orbiting a star, collecting energy and then somehow transmitting it to a collector of some sort.  A Dyson bubble is basically the same thing, only not a ring.  Instead the satellites form a sphere around the star.  This presents a lot more difficulty, but the power collected is much, much greater.  A Dyson shell is what sci-fi usually calls a Dyson sphere, a hard body that completely encompasses a star to collect its total energy output.  Miles Dyson is an employee at Cyberdine, played by the excellent Joe Morton."

There are so many instances of ""I hope [person(s)] will finally notice all the positive impact Taylor has had and really give her some of the recognition she truly deserves"" that just never happen (lookin' at you Miss Militia and Dragon) that I feel like her ending was the big vindication we were all waiting and hoping for."
Parahumans,3a20u5,Thechynd,13,Wed Jun 17 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"It's funny, I liked the idea that Taylor could go through all that, still live, and then feel like her life was essentially over. Dying is easy; living is hard."
Parahumans,3a20u5,palparepa,10,Tue Jun 16 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the story itself actually points out that forcing Taylor to live with what she's done is a harder path than the simple release of death. It's because of that fact that I personally consider the ending satisfying rather than a copout.  “It shouldn’t be this easy.”  “If you don’t mind my saying so,” Annette said, “I don’t think this looks easy at all.  Going down any road labeled ‘death’ has to be the easier road.”"
Parahumans,3a20u5,Afakaz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on her still having the shard's influence for conflict or not. If she still has it, her new life must be a living hell. If not, she is way more likely to see Skitter as an old persona and move on."

Parahumans,3a20u5,wiikipedia,5,Tue Jun 16 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"So Taylor willingly sacrificing everything isn't enough for you? She has to be put down as a monster and used up as a pawn. To me Taylor dying after Contessa would mean that Taylor as a person was essentially useless and meaningless as a person and that the shard is the only truly important part of her.   When you say that Taylor should have died what I hear is that Taylor didn't deserve to be happy, in the end. None of her sacrifices could have bought her a good life and what you think she should get is a sad and lonely death, alone and serving no purpose."
Parahumans,3a20u5,fireignition,-4,Tue Jun 16 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"Fuck off ""serving no purpose"". She saved the goddamn worlds from an eldrich monstrosity of mindboggling power.

Especially considering that Wildbow made it pretty clear that the Worm universe is a SHITTY place to live. Happy endings are not the norm, there."
Parahumans,3a20u5,Iconochasm,3,Wed Jun 17 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"Fuck off ""serving no purpose"". She saved the goddamn worlds from an eldrich monstrosity of mindboggling power.   I'm not talking about Skitter, or Weaver, or Khepri. What Khepri did could have been done by anyone with that power, Taylor was barely even there near the end. The whole point of the final conversation between Contessa and Taylor is about who she is behind the Queen Administrator.   But she willingly sacrificed a lot for it. Giving her a happy ending that negates her sacrifices is just too sappy for my tastes.   A happy ending isn't a negation of her sacrifice, it is a reward for them. No happy ending in any story can be built without the hard work and sacrifices of its characters. It is only by risking everything that she is able to save anyone. The only negation of her sacrifices would have been if she had failed to stop Scion and died.   Especially considering that Wildbow made it pretty clear that the Worm universe is a SHITTY place to live. Happy endings are not the norm, there.   If the Worm-verse is a shitty place to live that doesn't mean that everyone in it deserves a shitty end, it doesn't mean you can't work towards a less shitty end.   I think Taylor dying because Contessa shot her would be an incredibly disappointing ending. For Taylor to sacrifice everything for the power to kill Scion and then give up all of that power so there could be peace it wouldn't accomplish anything to kill her then. Worm might not be a great place to live but not everyone dies horribly and working hard to save the world.  Ultimately if you don't like it I can't make you. Although if you enjoy people sacrificing everything and still being unable to save themselves. If you think Worm was to cheerful and sappy, the villians not evil or dangerous enough, and the good guys won to often. It sounds like you should read Pact."

Stranger things have happened IRL. There was a man named Phineas Gage who had an iron rod shoved clean through his skull, and came out alive.

Parahumans,3a20u5,OniTan,2,Tue Jun 16 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"Contessa can do anything it is physically possible for her to do, and is trying to do good in the long run.  Taylor is only a problem because of her power.  Frankly I think it'd be unrealistic to have her NOT make it, given the last scene they shared.  We're talking about the Path To Victory, here."
Parahumans,3a20u5,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sun Jun 21 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to me arc 30 was art. I kind of wish it just ended there and the epilogue was left to the sequel, minus her still being alive."
Parahumans,3a20u5,OniTan,8,Tue Jun 16 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked a lot of the epilogue. Glaistig Uaine being given a second chance, and possibly finding a way to resurrect her warriors; Defiant's brilliant idea for cleaning Teacher's corruption out of Dragon's code; and every goddamn scene with Imp. All of that was awesome.   And then the Taylor POV part left a bad taste in my mouth. :("
Parahumans,3a20u5,GreatWyrmGold,3,Tue Jun 16 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"I agree it was good, but pacing wise it was just kind of there with no payoff. I would have preferred it be in the second book. Imagine if after Star Wars, the Death Star explodes, they do the medal ceremony, then we go to the first 3 scenes of Empire Strikes Back on Hoth, then the credits. It would just throw everything off. You want to see that ending that gave you feels then cut to credits."
Parahumans,3a20u5,OniTan,3,Tue Jun 16 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like your analogy with Star Wars and Empire fits at all. The epilogue of Worm was satisfying because it tied off a ton of loose ends, while also leaving open plenty to do in a possible sequel.  Star Wars didn't end with a ton of untied loose ends. Maybe your analogy would work better as Empire -> RotJ, since it ended on a cliffhanger with intentionally untied ends."
Parahumans,3a20u5,GreatWyrmGold,2,Tue Jun 16 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"And imagine if the ending was bittersweet like Worm's, with Luke being shocked, Vader killing the Emperor and getting shocked as well, then they're both lying there dying, and Vader says ""You saved me, my son."" And Luke says ""You saved me, father."" Then the Death Star blows up with them on it, then Leia sees them as Force Ghosts, then credits. The audience would be tearing up!  Now imagine a few random scenes of the crew from the novels after that emotional scene, then credits. It ruins the audience's feels!"
Parahumans,3a20u5,sanctaphrax,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:15:44 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. The Undersiders and other characters who got Interludes at the end weren't random crew members. They were core members of the cast who the audience knew and loved.  Star Wars is the story of the Skywalkers. Worm is the story of Earth Bet, or at least the Undersiders. Yes, it focuses on Taylor, but leaving ragged loose ends about what happens with Imp and the Heartbroken, the other Undersiders, etc etc, would have been...untidy.  And hey, it made Grue not seem like an ass all of a sudden."
Parahumans,3a20u5,fireignition,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"By the crew I meant Leia, Han, Chewie, etc. so they're also integral characters.

Sure Grue wasn't being stubborn, but we find out he got put on a bus and never came back."
Parahumans,3a20u5,pseudonarne,2,Tue Jun 16 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"They didn't really have independent stories, though. They were all part of Luke's story. Not so with the Undersiders after arc 20-something, and definitely not so with Defiant, Dragon, and the other characters the epilogues covered...to say nothing of the entire rest of Earth Bet.  I didn't mind the epilogues showing how the world and other characters were faring. (Taylor being alive is a whole other kettle of fish...)"

Now I realize that I can put them on everyone to keep track of everyone in my range (just by knowing where the bugs are) Capsaicin and other chemicals are cool - lets add them to the outside of wasp stingers. Newter's sweat is the best drug ever - give some to Lung through his eyes! Fire is good. How about literal fire ants that carry matches around? Let's practice for a bit and now we can hear through the bugs as well. Let's go nearly blind in a bombing attack and learn how to see through the bugs. Bugs can make noise, right? Talking is just noise also. I wonder if I can make bugs ""talk""... People are already freaked out by bugs. Let's help that along. Swarm clones that look like people which can ""talk"" will do nicely. Spiders don't make silk fast enough. I'll make some short lines of spider silk and carry them with me. Not all bugs can move as fast as bees and wasps.

The core idea of optimization as a play style is that of deriving enjoyment from choosing and benefiting from the game mechanical options that best optimize one's character's performance for some specific purpose—most commonly, speed of power or wealth accumulation. Players who primarily enjoy this play style are called optimizers. This reflects, at least in large part, an effort by game developers and operators to recognize and validate this style of play, and to be able to discuss it and the players who enjoy it without resorting to the traditional, pejorative terms.

Since the triggering can't really be avoided, they quarantine him from people who they even suspect might be powerful enough to cause an end-of-civilization scenario.  edit; That is why Weaver asks Eidolon specifically if Eidolon is so convinced in his own mental stability that he could guarantee not to flip out at anything Jack could possibly say.

He also suggests that I associated politeness with Grue, as everybody else kind of skimps on it.  By the time that I reached Purity's interlude, with Theo being polite to a fault, I automatically associated him with Grue on a level, helping to lend to Theo being represented as black.  But we also believe that your theory holds water -- when he asked me to describe how I see Theo in the early arcs, I describe him as black, visibly pudgy without being overweight, and with a fairly short flattop or short-cropped hair.  He asked me what expression, and I said usually worried.  He immediately turned his laptop around and said ""So basically this with an extra twenty to thirty pounds?""  My reply was a simple ""Fuck."""

For example, it skipped the Scion and Eden interludes. So yeah, I recently had to reread the story from source.  Another fun thing is that the chapters in one arc were shuffled out of sequence. Of course, it had to be the arc where Bonesaw releases the plague, adding to my confusion."

I could feel Scion’s reaction, through my senses and the individuals I controlled.  Hope.  For just a second.  Not even the faint hope he’d experienced with the fake my teammates had put together.  Because somehow, this boy registered as being like this entity’s companion had been.  Registering as the same state, as the power that made it so similar.

Parahumans,39p5fj,ughzubat,5,Sat Jun 13 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's for a story called Nascent (stylized N°Ascent).   A woman's child dies mysteriously. She goes to see the oracle after oracle, trying to understand. They all say the same thing, ""it was god's will. There was nothing you could have done"".   In her mourning, she has a moment of perfect clarity. ""fuck that"".   She is approached by a serpent and led wordlessly to a meeting of animal spirits. She tells them her intention to go fuck God up (paraphrasing). They tell her there's a way, and that before the age of man, there were hundreds of gods, and more all the time. They scrambled to establish a hierarchy. Groups were more successful than individuals, and so pantheons rose and fell. A powerful newcomer by the name of Yahweh came into the scene. His innate ability was to rewrite the truth. Even the strongest of the gods still bowed to boundaries. He named himself King of Kings and it was so. The power of the Word was staggering, and he's had a firm grip on the world ever since. He named Ra a beetle, and the god was brought low. He named the serpent ""deceiver"", and he became the mark of treachery.   The spirits told her they would grant her a boon. They put her in a pit and had her fight a series of challenges to see how she dealt with them. She took two knives and fought creatively. King of Snakes stepped up for her and said ""the gift of the serpent is to redefine yourself. Our power is to change and move forward. Yahweh controls the truth. You have the power to unseat yourself from it."" And so, she becomes the avatar of the serpent.   Yawheh sends trial after trial after her, and she grows in her power exponentially with each victory.   She meets him, ready for combat, and he explains that he killed her child because he's looking for a successor. She had to face these challenges in order to grow, and she had to grow in order to be able to hold the throne.   Just loose ideas right now, but them's the bones of it."

In my mental picture, it's a comic, because that's the best suited to my writing style (hands-off showing instead of telling, mostly dialogue [see Immolate for example]), but my weak point by a long shot is creative stamina.

Parahumans,39p5fj,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat Jun 13 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem, but once I get momentum, it gets easier.  One day, when you have time, force yourself to write a chapter or a page or whatever. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it has to exist. Once you do that, keep writing until you're out of ideas (writing at that point naturally means you won't have much quality). Edit before publishing, but don't let yourself spend too much time on that.  Once you post the first chapter or installment or whatever, keep doing so regularly (but not more than you can keep up with). Forcing yourself to keep writing that way forces you to keep your momentum. (I hear Wildbow did the same.)  Whatever you do, if you're not getting paid for it, don't work yourself harder than you enjoy. And good luck."

Parahumans,39p5fj,Aocast,5,Sun Jun 14 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you about my main protagonist. His name is Desmond (Wintergrief) and he, as he eventually finds out, is the son of Baron Wintergrief (my Doctor Doom, basically, who also at one point builds a giant tower that acts as a cosmic wand called the Bloodspire). When his granddad dies, he inherits a dragonegg, an Alchemi Codex and Rune Codex, and he teaches himself all kinds of potions and rune circles (some tattooed on his body. For instance, on his back there's a circle that lets his dragon take residence in. like a Pokeball. also telepathic connection).  His story starts when he meets Wisdom, a superhero who has genetic memory all the way down to the first human, at his granddad's funeral and gets offered a spot on the new government-supported Hero Academy (only recently has the ban on superheroes been pulled). That's about all I'm going to tell you about him for now, but the world is still very WIP with lots of stories I want to tell. A Wards/YJ-like team framed for the murder of a premier superhero, Moriarty Institute, a supervillain school, aswell as metahuman cagefighting, the immortal thief Thomas Blood, the superheroine with videogame powers known as Pixel, Clockwork Island, the multiversal-exploring project Project ATLAS, the hierarchy of the SHIELD-equivalent KINGDOM, or the mastermind Nicodemus Wintergrief, known as Gorgon. Don't even get me started on the interstellar mining ship the Father of Sins, the WWII trinity, the demonology system, Crooked Harbor, or the architecture of New Hague and Whitetemple.   I personally think that, besides a story that will either be known as Wintergrief: Inheritance of Secrets of Wintergrief: Of Spies and Mages, I wll do a WWZ-like anthology series known as Ministry of Heroes..."

Parahumans,39p5fj,Synderion,3,Sat Jun 13 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"Verse as in Universe.... Gotcha. If I would have made the connection I wouldn't have asked, sorry.   But yeah, I have a bit of a ""super"" hero universe that I'm thinking about. Not really revolved around powers, but rather people that are brave and have the skill set to fight monsters.   It's set in a world where almost all diseases/viruses have become immune to modern medicine. Either you fight it off on your own (Slim chance), or you die. During plagues, (Scarlet Fever/Bubonic Plague/SARS/Even Ebola) hundreds of millions of people would be wiped out. To combat this, I team of researchers in a last ditch attempt to save humanity develop a technology that is capable of inducing the illness into it's physical form. In order to cure the illness, one has to kill it. It's physical form can vary from a icky goo monster that is the Flu, to a near Kaiju like monster that is more deadly illnesses such as Scarlet Fever or Ebola.  So, when people go to a School of Medicine, they're training to fight these monsters (thousands to match the thousands of illnesses) Each monster has it's own strategy to kill it. Being a doctor is more of a death sentence, with a VERY early retirement (Average life span) than the general population."
Parahumans,39p5fj,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat Jun 13 22:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It was mostly disconnected, and for a long time I had issues with the more cynical aspects of the world, like human reactions.  Wildbow solved that issue perfectly by introducing ""Bigger fish"" like the S9, the Endbringers and so on; threats that forced cooperation.  I was more inspired by Shonen battlemanga like Anagle Mole, Arachnid, Seven Deadly Sins and Blazer Drive in my implementation. Quite a lot of the heroes and villains I thought of were both fast and strong, and it backed me into a corner at times early on.  I rewrote it and managed to include more of the ""Magical"" stuff I wanted to add that I couldn't in the last iteration.  https://passoverstories.wordpress.com/"
Parahumans,39p5fj,nemaar,3,Sat Jun 13 14:12:04 2015 UTC,"I was thinking one up before I found Worm. I was thrilled to find a story where someone had explored ideas that I wanted to and somewhat dismayed because I didn't think I could match up to it, but here goes.  Sometime around 2010, people across the globe begin to manifest super powers without warning. In general, powers are not something one can turn off when inconvenient, and there are a number of ways they can be very inconvenient. Not being able to turn off heightened senses is one example. Power incontinence is also a thing. Most people don't have much fine control over their powers when they first appear, posing a risk to the safety of themselves and others, i.e. someone for whom sneezing happens to trigger pyrokinesis. This usually becomes a non-issue with time and practice. Finally, there are also a 'defective' supers, or those whose powersets have some fundamental design flaw. A pyrokinetic who isn't fire-resistant and keeps burning himself whenever he tries to use his power. A speeder who lacks the reflexes to avoid smearing himself against obstacles.  There aren't trigger events - Powers just spontaneously manifest. You can be minding your own business at the bus stop, but then you think 'gosh I'm kind of hungry right now' and a golem animates out of the sidewalk, stomps across the road where it smashes a bakery window and grabs you a muffin before trudging back.  In any event, nobody has any solid understanding of how superpowers work. Space whales, radioactive exposure, and mutant genes have nothing to do with it. Experiments to understand the mechanics of powers yield no answers and experiments that attempt to induce powers produce little of note but human rights violations. Supers, for all intents and purposes, cannot be manufactured.  Of course, this hasn't stopped a thriving black market trade in metahuman tissues and organs. I reason that the prevalence of both global human trafficking and trade in traditional medicine (cordyceps worms, bear bile, tiger organs, etc.) provide a firm precedent for this. A good chunk of people in my setting believe that injecting or implanting metahuman parts in you confer superpowers, or at least increase your chance of developing them. A few hundred USD for a chance at getting flight doesn't sound like a bad deal, eh?  This makes being a super whose identity is known to the public a very bad position. It is also where the government comes in.  A bureau of the FBI is established to identify and monitor parahumans. A good deal of new metahumans just want to keep living their lives without the fear of being harvested or going toe to toe with the really nasty supers, and the bureau helps them identify and learn to control their power so they don't accidentally level a city block.  Of course, with gangs, terrorists, and opposing states all incorporating their own supers, the US can't afford to fall behind. Every super contacted by the bureau is offered a chance to serve their country as part of a SWAT-style unit and protect the innocent with a generous benefits package on the side. People with certain powers, such as being bulletproof, invisible, or being capable of mass teleportation, are offered further enticement.  Some poor bastards even say yes.    That's all I'm able to recall right now. I have other notes, but I can't access them at this time. As you may be able to tell, I wanted this setting to be kind of grittier while hopefully avoiding grimdark territory.  Protagonist was going to be a metahuman with touch-based biokinesis, similar to but much more limited than Panacea's, who begins the story mentally and physically recovering from getting his face and also his best friend pulped by North Korean superman. He bites the bullet and decides to tough out the remainder of his contract and is promptly called on a mission to bust a gang which uncovers evidence of a massive trafficking operation in the USA, dragging him kicking and screaming away from his hopes of a normal life where he doesn't face death on a bi-weekly basis and into a quagmire of moral grays, deteriorating relationships with colleagues and family, and an increasingly shaky grasp on what it means to be human.  Looking back on what I've written, I'm not sure if it even makes sense, much less sounds interesting as a premise. Maybe it's just a crude and poorly-conceived take on superheroes with more edges than a bismuth crystal. I'm not even that great of a writer, I honestly don't understand most of the things I would have to write about for this. Like, do YOU have a good understanding of the FBI and its internal organization, allocation of combat personnel, and its likely behavior if superpowers appeared under the above circumstances?  But hey, I got pretty into the idea for a while. Maybe I'll revisit it now that I've been reminded."
Parahumans,39p5fj,gmrm4n,2,Sat Jun 13 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"Look up Heinlein's Rules of Writing and ignore #3.  Anyways, if you're going to draw attention to how little people know about superpowers, you'd better have some idea (and it wouldn't hurt to reveal at least part of it, though you don't have to). Definitely know if various ways people try to get (or not get) superpowers work or not, and ideally why."

I'm currently working on a web serial called Nowhere Island University which is about that. So far, the main character has met only two people with powers, and none of them are really ""in costume,"" but I plan on changing that."
Parahumans,39p5fj,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sun Jun 14 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"Haven't thought of a name for it yet, but here goes.  The bulk of the story occurs 20 years after the divergence event between our timeline and theirs. People with powers have been cropping up over this time, but the frequency has been low enough for the public to remain unaware until just a few years ago. At this point, it's still not 100% clear whether these superpowered individuals are for real, or just an elaborate hoax. Opinion on the legitimacy of these claims is split fairly evenly. This will change not too long into the story.  The majority of the powers involve either an improvement over existing human ability (strength, intelligence, ect.) or some form of telekinesis/thermokinesis, though there are several outliers.  Powers obey (though not apparent at first) the conservation of energy. They are often not bound by the second law of thermodynamics, which can sometimes allow them to extract useful energy from heat and sound.  Times are changing. Apparent geniuses are becoming more and more common in the world, and this has been reflected in the rapid advancements in technology seen in the past few years. Time will tell if, and how, we will survive in our rapidly changing world.  Even if we survive ourselves, we are not the only threat to our continued existence. This is not the first time that humanity has risen as a powerful civilization, and the enemy that tore us down once before is back for round two.  There's a lot more to it, including post singularity AI's, transhumanism, unfathomable extradimensional beings, and ancient plans still in motion.  If you wan't to know more about the specifics then ask away."
Parahumans,39p5fj,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun Jun 14 04:19:27 2015 UTC,"The closest is my Nile Empire game that I run, which is more pulp than superhero.  People have super powers, but it's more limited to the 1930's levels of superheroes.  It's a little bit Arab, a little bit pulp, a little film noir, and a lot of over-the-top fun.  It says something when a PC jumps from a biplane onto a zeppelin, throws a stick of dynamite inside, then swings from said zeppelin onto a pyramid to attack a hoard of shocktroopers, and the players consider that pleasantly average.  Not awesome, but ""It woulda been cooler had you..."""

Parahumans,39p5fj,NinteenFortyFive,2,Sat Jun 13 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"A few.  One of the earlier stories I actually started writing (not a very serious one) was a kid hero without any superpowers who got beaten up by a normal thug and went to his brother with a magical healing gift for help. I didn't have any idea where to take it, though.  On the same sort of jumped-the-call note, a guy whose only superpower is that his legs are replaced with a snake's tail.  A more serious hero from something I'm considering working on would be a Superman-type personality, with ethereal telekinetic ""strings"" running along the bones of his hands and feet. He can use these for tactile kinesis (super strength without the logistics issues), or focus it inside of him to make his forearms and lower legs essentially invulnerable. Given the universe he's in, he also has a sword, which he can focus the telekinetic energy through, essentially cutting with it.  Another I'm thinking of working with (different universe) is an electrokinetic vigilante who has slipped from heroic-but-edgy to being willing to do almost anything to people he sees as working with criminals to try and catch them.  Why do you ask?"

Parahumans,39oocy,Evilknightz,42,Sat Jun 13 07:46:18 2015 UTC,"Once upon a time, there was a planet. On this planet, there were alien creatures that evolved some nifty abilities. Among these abilities were at least two very relevant ones; the ability to freely travel between parallel dimensions and the ability to codify 'abilities' into parts of their body, which in turn (presumably) beams the ability back to the 'main' body. The exact details of the second mechanism are not that important.  These alien entities multiplied and eventually swarmed their entire planet in all it's dimensional iterations. It is a brutal struggle for energy and survival, every entity for itself. At some point one entity realizes that what they are doing is pointless; there are a very, very high number of parallel dimensions, but eventually all the stars will run out and there won't be energy left (known to us as the heat death of the universe). Instead of struggling for survival, it uses it's last bit of energy to broadcast a message of survival to all it's entity-kind.  The entities listen and agree. There is a massive war between all entities until only one (or two?) remains. The entity gathers all energy, from all iterations of the planet to explode the planet and propel parts of it's body over the galaxy. Essentially reproducing, see it like a dandelion spreading it's seeds.  The new entities at first land randomly on planets, observe the local lifeforms, connect to them via interdimensional shenanigans and when they decided they have enough information, codify the abilities of the local lifeforms into 'shards' (very roughly cell analogous), explode the planet and travel on.  They do this a lot. Every time is described as a cycle and I think Scion says there have been over thousands for him. It should be noted that all entities evolve independently, because of the random nature of on which planet they land. For now we consider Scion the 'typical' entity.  So over the many cycle the entities absorb massive amounts of information and new abilities. Scion now travels with a partner, and they both have different roles; Warrior and Thinker. They use space manipulation to move, 'infect' a planet, repeat the cycle and reproduce and move on. Essentially acting not quite unlike virusses.  At some point they decide on Earth. The plan is as follows; using the different abilities they gained over time to get field-tested by these creative but somewhat weak bipeds. They will both discard shards they don't necessarily need, lock them in an alternate Earth and force a connection between a human. From human point of view giving them superpowers, related to the ability encoded in the shard. The shard will pay attention to how the human uses the ability, and it will watch and learn, eventually budding into new shards to try new things.  The entities are massive now, the size of at least a planet, they discard a lot of shards from their body, to the point that in the end they are 'merely' continent-sized. They have future-sight abilities, that they use to plan and ensure that the cycle on Earth works properly. This is mostly the Thinker's job.  But there is something different this time. On the way to Earth, they meat another entity. This one diverged early from Scion/Thinker and uses completely different means of travelling (and travels alone). The Thinker and the Third interact, exchanging shards and being creepy entity things. Scion is of the opinion the Thinker has been to generous in giving shards, the Thinker is confident it will succeed.  It is wrong. They eventually distribute shards (so; abilities) to humans, encode them with safeguards to keep parahumans from killing themselves and restrictions to ensure the parahumans need to be creative, and thus give the shard more data to work with. They pick barren Earths to 'nest' in, to keep their real body mostly safe. But the Thinker doesn't work out, it crashes and dies. Scion produces it's Scion-body in Earth Bet and realizes the cycle is broken. Scion, being the uncreative Warrior, doesn't know what to do, so when a very data-filled shard like Jack, who has the Broadcast-shard the abilities use to speak to each other, tells him that maybe he should just cut loose, well, why not really? Waiting so far hasn't worked. Helping people hasn't worked. Might as well give it a try.  edit; details might be slightly wrong or simplified, but that's the gist of it."
Parahumans,39oocy,cephalord,13,Sat Jun 13 08:36:49 2015 UTC,"This part isn't 100% confirmed but it's often assumed to be true:  The Third Entity gave Eden the Path to Victory shard. She used it in planning out how the cycle would go, but it led her astray and caused her to crash. Eventually it ended up in Contessa, allowing her and Doctor Mother to kill Eden, and plan the war against Scion.  It was all a convoluted plot by the Third Entity to kill Scion and Eden."
Parahumans,39oocy,bramflakes,13,Sat Jun 13 12:35:28 2015 UTC,"I've yet to see anyone assume that true. I have seen people assume that it was just an accident on Eden's part, but the idea of the 3rd Entity doing so on purpose is just a theory like any other.  Could be true, but then again, so could the other half-dozen theories."

However, Scion also uses PtV, so you'd think Eden had it too..."
Parahumans,39oocy,Amargosamountain,5,Wed Jun 17 05:21:56 2015 UTC,"The new entities at first land randomly on planets, observe the local lifeforms, connect to them via interdimensional shenanigans and when they decided they have enough information, codify the abilities of the local lifeforms into 'shards' (very roughly cell analogous), explode the planet and travel on.   This is something I've never been clear on. I know that, by Scion's time, the Entities get together and modify the shards, but I don't know if we were ever told just who went after the explosion.   Do the pre-cycle Entities gather all info and move along? Or do they shatter into newer Entities like the original pair?  Even Scion's own inner narrative doesn't seem clear, since it talks about memories being swapped through shards, and it knows things that predate its creation as a distinct Entity. The Interlude isn't clear on when it's talking about something it experienced directly, through swapped memory or just known through history."
Parahumans,39oocy,Tsegen,7,Sat Jun 13 11:16:52 2015 UTC,I don't think we know. There are a lot of things unclear about the entities and I doubt those will ever be answered.

Assumptions to follow, proceed at your own risk  After the Entities finish a cycle, they gather their shards again and use some of them to break down the host planet for energy. They then use this energy and other shards to reproduce or maybe duplicate like single celled organisms with each new Entity getting copies of all memories its ""parent"" had as well as creating new shards from the gathered data. Then each moves on to new planets."

Parahumans,39mv2q,coderman9,25,Fri Jun 12 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"More importantly, if Dragon got Butcher's powers, how would they manifest? She's a decentralized virtual consciousness, not a discrete entity. Every single one of her servers and programs and combat suits are simultaneously 'Dragon herself' and 'pieces of Dragon's equipment'."
Parahumans,39mv2q,Littlerob,15,Sat Jun 13 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, for instance, how would teleportation, inability to feel pain, and increased durability work on a computer program?"
Parahumans,39mv2q,Ranku_Abadeer,22,Sat Jun 13 00:11:10 2015 UTC,"A few options, I think.   Option 1: Dragon In Chains. The Shard sees whatever hardware is currently hosting her singular consciousness as her 'body' and applies the powers to that. The Dragon Suit of the hour would get the Butcher's abilities in addition to its own. Possible limitation of always needing to be in a discrete piece of hardware or her powers go crazy. When she reloads from backup, the Butcher shard sees Dragon and her killer (also Dragon) as the same mind, and stays attached to Dragon.  Option 2: Dragon In Chains. The shard sees her simulated mind as its host, but cannot find a body to route powers through. Mental and perceptional powers work as normal, any physical powers are nonfunctional while Dragon is host to the Butcher.  Option 2-a: Tag, You're It. When a Dragon Suit (or whichever platform is currently running her main consciousness) is destroyed, the Butcher shard jumps to the person responsible for its destruction. Dragon's backup is no longer the Butcher, as the shard has moved on.  Option 2-b: And You, And You, And You Too. When a Dragon Suit is destroyed, the Butcher shard jumps to whoever was responsible for destroying it. When Dragon loads her backup, she is still the Butcher, as the shard finds new hosts by adding people to the list of hosts it grants powers to - it just happens that the method it uses to determine who is added to the list results in the previous name on the list being eliminated in every occasion but this one.  Option 3: Dragon Unchained. The shard sees her virtual mind as its host, and attaches to it. However, she has no body, just a collection of tools, and so any physical abilities conferred by the Butcher shard are inactive and will remain so until the Butcher shard finds a more conventional host. Mental and perceptional powers function as normal.  Option 4: Dragon Unchained. The shard sees her virtual mind as its host, and confers its powers on any piece of hardware currently running an instance of it. As per S9000 style clones, conservation of ninjutsu is not in effect, though conservation of shard battery life might be if she runs too many concurrent instances of her consciousness.   Option 4-a: Highlander. There can be only one - as long as there exists a single instance of Dragon's consciousness the Butcher shard stays attached to hers and will not leap to a new host. Once the last instance of Dragon is destroyed, the shard will leap to whoever destroyed her final mindstate.  Option 4-b: Hello Me, Me Again. The shard treats any cessation of any of Dragon's mindstates as a 'death', and the person responsible for that death receives the Butcher shard - as well as the remaining instances of Dragon and any future ones she loads. If you kill any of Dragon's machines, you become a Butcher, but Dragon is still Butcher too. The shard has the Entity equivalent of a fit trying to work out who is the primary host when it can simultaneously see that the host has been killed and the host is clearly alive. Dragon becomes the hub of a growing Butcher infection."
Parahumans,39mv2q,Littlerob,6,Sat Jun 13 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"Option 2 and 3, 4 -b and 2-b look very similar. What's the difference?"
Parahumans,39mv2q,sheikheddy,5,Sat Jun 13 03:12:41 2015 UTC,"The amount of Dragons. 2 and 2b, Dragon is still chained, she can only run one copy of herself at once and cannot edit her code. She's basically still just a pretty good virtualisation of a human mind. 4 and 4b, Dragon is unchained. She's a full seed AI and can copy herself without limit and recursively self-improve."
Parahumans,39mv2q,Littlerob,3,Sat Jun 13 09:50:48 2015 UTC,"When she reloads from backup, the Butcher shard sees Dragon and her killer (also Dragon) as the same mind, and stays attached to Dragon.   Interesting thought - when Dragon goes from suit back to her primary server, that could be seen as an effective death. One possible outcome would be server!Dragon booting up with all Butcher minds, including suit!Dragon. Each time Dragon goes back to her server, it adds another copy of her mind to the Butcher state, reinforcing both her power and her personality throughout."
Parahumans,39mv2q,sephlington,4,Sat Jun 13 11:22:25 2015 UTC,"Also interesting to think about is what happens with Dragon's programmed hard limit of one instance of her mind at any one time. When the Butcher shard jumps host, it takes an instance of all the previous Butcher's mindstates with it. Would Dragon's programming acknowledge this and force her to destroy all other instances of herself except the now-indestructible copy bound up with the Butcher shard?  If so, the Butcher is the only real Dragonslayer possible. If Dragon is infected, all you have to do is kill whatever avatar she's driving, transfer the Butcher shard, and suddenly she's compelled to effectively kill herself."
Parahumans,39mv2q,Littlerob,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:01:41 2015 UTC,That is a very good question
Parahumans,39mv2q,Valthek,13,Sat Jun 13 00:29:25 2015 UTC,"Likely, the shard will jump to her as it ahs done with others. We know that it will jump from person to person and since we also know that AIs can recieve shards, it's likely to assume that it would jump to Dragon.    However, since dragon is perfectly capable of reviewing and editing her own mind (software), I doubt the Butcher's voices would be much of a problem for her. In theory, she could just shove them into their own dedicated thread and leave them to run there, looking at their input as needed, although that might conflict with her directive that stops her from creating inteligences.    Either way, I don't think it'd be as much of a problem as it would be for us meatbags."
Parahumans,39mv2q,wiikipedia,5,Fri Jun 12 22:39:26 2015 UTC,I have a feeling it wouldn't be that easy. If only because nothing in Worm is ever that easy.  A big part of it could be Richter's restrictions might stop Dragon from being able to modify her consciousness in that way. Or the multiple voices could integrate with her own in such a way that makes it impossible to carve them out without taking pieces of Dragon with them. Or she could successfully lock them away only to have Saint release them at a later point while trying to 'help'.  There are plenty of ways for it to go wrong. Luckily Dragon is careful about things like that and uses non-lethals most of the time anyway so it isn't a big danger.
Parahumans,39mv2q,tavarain,7,Sat Jun 13 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"Well, her shard altered the way her code works, so maybe her code would be altered to have voices in her head?"
Parahumans,39mv2q,idannadi,4,Fri Jun 12 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"Well, she would probably get the ""voices"" in her head like tavarain suggested but she has the optimal way to get rid of those ""voices"" you move her to a computer with an internal clock of (let's say, 1 cpu command per 50 years) and load her backup. You remove the ""I'm invisible to my code reading"" limitation on the backup and have her diagnose herself for however long it takes than stick those voices in an ""ignored"" state and release her sister."
Parahumans,39mv2q,aetherious,2,Fri Jun 12 22:50:11 2015 UTC,My guess is that the Butcher shard would jump to her and use the equivalent of a DDoS attack.
Parahumans,39mv2q,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat Jun 13 03:19:31 2015 UTC,"Well...I'm pretty sure the Butcher's transfer includes an element of mind control, so Dragon would be taken over by the Butcher. Her shard would be tied to the Butcher's, which means that mental abilities like danger sense would accompany her consciousness. Other ones would probably manifest from whatever she considered her body to be at the moment.  In a perfect world, either Richter's security measures would notice a massive increase in homicidal tendencies and restore a backup, causing the Butcher to do to a dead guy; or Dragon's restrictions would still apply. Worst-case-scenario, Defiant restores from backup and gets Butchered before he can wake Dragon up, meaning no Dragon and an uber-Tinker Butcher with access to the Guild's goodies...and no one would see it coming until it's too late."

Woman, is darkly amusing.  Which is even more depressing by the fact that Lisette showing up just  abit earlier could have potentially averted the apocalypse.  Actually did she die in Golden Mourning? Or did Scion just kind of... ignore her?  Edit: the image of her awkwardly shuffling as golden lasers blast around her is also, darkly amusing."
Parahumans,39i2f9,Ridtom,2,Sat Jun 13 06:39:28 2015 UTC,"The first thing Scion blasted when he decided to break everything was the British Islands, wasn't it? Potentially the whole european continent. I'm pretty sure Lisette was somewhere around there. Probably one of the first to die."

Parahumans,39i2f9,pendia,9,Thu Jun 11 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"I have to say that it was marvelous misdirection, as it did get me thinking for the next few chapters that runaway AI would be the end of the world scenario in some way.   That's what was going to happen, instead of whispering in Scion's ear Jack would have whispered to Defiant, and Defiant would have gotten hella mad and doubled down on his efforts to unlock Dragon's programming, but in his rage he'd make a mistake and Dragon would lose her ability to empathize with humanity and becomes a utilitarian death network. She proceeds to nuke half the planet to eliminate the S9000 and/or to put her in a position to take out Scion, who she perceives as a threat, and calls it a win.  Saint eliminated the chance of that happening, so we ended up with the less likely, but more dangerous ""Scion apocalypse"" scenario."

Parahumans,39i2f9,iamthegraham,4,Fri Jun 12 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"i think it was one of these three:    jack's hax 'secondary' power made him immune to cape attacks. dragon was a cape, dragon going down either replaced her role with a number of dragonteeth(who jack wasn't immune to)  or saint's less effective attempts at filling her shoes prevented her forcing the fight earlier(maybe they'd have caught up with him before ellisburg for example)   or iirc simurgh shenagans meant dragon didn't get the email about the woman who knew the hobo who could control scion but saint tried it(failed, but still)  its not entirely clear why but its either something like that or something butterfly effect from there. (they still failed so the 3x ods didn't help but the way things turned out it was only by the skin of their teeth that scion talked to jack)  and the reason the deathcount spiked was probably that she was almost certainly more effective at evac than saint."
Parahumans,39i2f9,pseudonarne,2,Fri Jun 12 01:20:13 2015 UTC,"We know from Cauldron that there's a particular time frame in which humanity would have the best chance of beating Scion. If the fight happened too soon, they wouldn't be prepared enough. If Scion waited until later, too many capes would be dead from Endbringer attacks and from the general chaos that shards cause.  So let's say that Saint never shut down Dragon. She would likely have been able to kill Jack, who never would have sparked Scion to go on his killing spree, delaying the event by months or years. Which means that Skitter or Panacea or Bonesaw might have died before Golden Morning, and the world wouldn't have Khepri to save the day. Or maybe some other capes like Canary would be dead and unable to play their part, or any number of other events could have changed which had tipped the scales in humanity's favor."

That should give you a good idea. Just Cntl-F ""Legend"" to get the important stuff.  Cauldron opted to lie to him because they knew that his conscience would be bigger than theirs.  OTOH Legend did believe in Cauldron's vision of saving the world, of preventing calamity. He accepted that not everything would be peachy keen.

She lives and she's a reminder of how you can't trust the PRT, she dies, Skitter does her Weaver transformation and blames all of Alexandria's failings on Ziz and suddenly you get to turn over a new leaf.

Parahumans,39grde,wiseass_username,6,Fri Jun 12 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"No, I mean why would Contessa want Alexandria dead?

If PtV can tell that Taylor will become a more valuable asset in an apocalyptic scenario than Alexandria, it makes sense to sacrifice the latter if it helps push Taylor along.

Parahumans,39grde,k5josh,7,Fri Jun 12 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but some people were suggesting that Contessa was the reason Alexandria fumbled the Skitter situation so badly."
Parahumans,39grde,GreatWyrmGold,3,Fri Jun 12 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like to note first and foremost that I don't actually believe she would.  The status quo.  With the Enchida incident, people know.  You can't keep things under wraps perfectly after that.  People know who Alexandria is now. People know Cauldron's dirty deeds.  And of the corruption in the ranks.  This is a problem in keeping things going the way they need to be.   Skitter was there.  Skitter hates the corruption in the ranks, and she has a huge cult of personality going for her.  And now she's turning herself in.  If she takes down the head of the corruption, the PRT and the Protectorate can ""clean house"" and put on a good facade for the public, while Cauldron replaces her with another agent.  This keeps the status quo going.  Of course, Alexandria's powers are useful...  Let's save her at the last moment.  Oh, dear, she's brain dead.  ...Meh.  Pretender!  We got this thing for you!  (Also, I choose to believe that Satyrical really did have deep feelings for Pretender.  ""That line again?""  Yeah, Satyr could be just using a lame joke over and over, but...  Headcanon.)"
Parahumans,39grde,ErrantVagrant,3,Fri Jun 12 05:50:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Personally I was always a fan of the suicide-by-cape interpretation. But there are plenty of reasons, the obvious one being that Pretender was easier for her to deal with than Rebecca."
Parahumans,39grde,k5josh,19,Fri Jun 12 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"So first off, she has mentioned she asks herself certain questions occasionally, one of them anti-stranger measures.  She's obviously going to be much better at choosing those questions than us (""I want to know the most effective way of choosing goals for myself""), so keep in mind that any suggestions listed here are nothing compared to what she would actually do.  But, if she asks herself something like, ""I want to know how to avoid any situation that would result in my death in the next 48 hours, and do this in a manner that doesn't disrupt any other paths I'm already following,"" then, barring intervention by a person who is immune to her perception, she will NEVER encounter situations that are impossible for her to survive, unless someone puts a plan in place that literally cannot be avoided despite days of notice and Contessa's almost unlimited ability to manipulate other capes.  Similarly, she will never be put in a position where Alexandria is going to immediately attack her without warning, because she'll have advance notice, and if she needs to kill Alexandria for whatever reason then she picks up a phone and starts making calls until she maneuvers capes that can win the fight for her.  Or something."
Parahumans,39grde,Tarhish,11,Thu Jun 11 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"But against someone like Alexandria, how could Contessa beat her?   In a cage match? Probably couldn't. But like five years ago she probably went ""hey PtV, gimmee a path for never losing a fight to Alexandria,"" so she knows they'll either never fight or, if they do fight, it'll be on Contessa's terms.   On a more general note, what does Contessa's shard do in situations where victory is physically impossible(eg. She wakes up one day to find herself falling naked in an erupting volcano, with a strong one-way force field at the top to prevent her from climbing out and Legend standing on the rim blasting her with his strongest lasers)?l   The paths shes following necessarily involve those sorts of things not happening to her, so it'd be almost impossible for her to end up in a situation like that: really the only way would be someone who can avoid her power (Eidolon, Scion) acting against her, or her deliberately dropping her defenses and allowing herself to be placed in that scenario.  If one of those things happened and she was in a no-win scenario, PtV would come up blank and be all like ""ya screwed,"" though remember, it's super rigged, so in that volcano scenario shouting the right phrase to Legend might be able to convince him to save her (or just ""Doormaker: portal to NOT FUCKING HERE"") ."
Parahumans,39grde,iamthegraham,6,Thu Jun 11 20:06:47 2015 UTC,"In a cage match, she could almost certainly win. For example, by jamming a forearm down Alexandria's windpipe, breaking it off far enough down that Alexandria can't pull it out, and continuing to dodge until Alexandria goes down."
Parahumans,39grde,Gnimhey,12,Thu Jun 11 23:00:36 2015 UTC,"Alexandria could blitz Contessa and punch her hard enough to take out a building before Contessa could even begin formulating a request for a path. Alexandria doesn't just move at tens of thousands of miles per hour, she has thinker powers that let her think faster than normal humans (as well as giving her the mastery of a dozen martial arts forms and god knows what else).   Contessa might be able to talk her down, if she lasted more than the fraction of a second Alexandria could end the fight in. But if ""Path: Talk this person into losing a fight with me"" was so viable she'd probably use it more often.   The specific strategy you outlined wouldn't work at all. Even if Alexandria left her mouth wide open for some reason, Contessa would be too slow to even touch her face before Alexandria karate chopped her in half.   ""Path: Don't lose a 1v1 fight with Alexandria"" would give her ""Don't get in a 1v1 fight with Alexandria."""
Parahumans,39grde,iamthegraham,5,Thu Jun 11 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"No, you say that, but you don't know how bullshit Contessa is. Her power isn't just ""do this"". It actually puppets her body. If there is a single conceivable way for a scenario to turn out her way, it will."
Parahumans,39grde,Gnimhey,12,Thu Jun 11 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"No, you say that, but you don't know how bullshit Contessa is.   I know exactly how bullshit she is. That doesn't change the fact that she literally can't move her body fast enough to dodge Alexandria blitzing her. She's in a human body. She can only move at human speeds. Alexandria can move at 40,000 meters per second, thinks at superhuman speeds, and knows Contessa more than well enough not to underestimate her. Even if Contessa could conceivably win with a path, Alexandria can end the fight before she ever has a chance to ask for a path. Contessa only wins this with advance planning or outside interference."

Contessa was able to dodge Skitter's swarm in an enclosed space.  ""Just fly in close"" is not gonna cut it.     On a more general note, what does Contessa's shard do in situations where victory is physically impossible(eg. She wakes up one day to find herself falling naked in an erupting volcano, with a strong one-way force field at the top to prevent her from climbing out and Legend standing on the rim blasting her with his strongest lasers)?l     Her power avoids those situations for her."

I put in a lot of effort to write updates and people couldn't be bothered to do more than pick something to vote on without even reading other votes or talking to others.  Ended up with a lot of votes that were like... 1 vote for 'attack!' 1 vote for 'run away!' 1 vote for 'try to communicate!' 1 vote for 'flank!'    I ended up being forced to sort of improvise or shoehorn votes or group them together for each update.  Changed the format in hopes of making things more concrete and things didn't get better.  I like running games where people get pushed into a corner and then get creative.  Games which are run as a group, though, they either trend toward using the best of that group's ideas or the below average of that group.  Department 64 sort of felt like it was settling at the below average, just at the point where players were consistently making mistakes but dodging the 'the adventure ends here' traps."

I have notes down for a series of shorter quests.  If the first was successful and players were engaged, then move on to second, and so on.  Reward players for sticking it out and being smart/surviving with later quests having neat story details and reveals.   Leet Quest - Post Brockton Bay, Pre-Death, South America Moord Nag Quest - The Early Years, Africa Case 53 Quest - A Case 53 in post-Simurgh Canberra, Australia Sentai Elite Quest - Leading a squad post-Kyushu, Asia.  Black Kaze's story, more touching on the CUI. Red Gauntlet Quest - Dealing with the MGS-esque cape scene in western Russia, touches on Blasphemies, Europe. Damsel of Distress Quest - pre & post S9, possibly post-Worm, hinting at elements of sequel, North America For the last continent, Antartica, well, imagine staring out at the Aurora Borealis, a shadow passes over a star.

Although Moord Nag strikes me as being way too personally powerful for my tastes - I'd find more enjoyment playing some heretofore-unnamed cape warlord active at the same time, with Moord Nag's eventual domination being the endgame and the win condition being ""you are too entrenched and/or useful for her to set Scavenger on your whole warband, and are instead incorporated into Moord Nag's growing tribe"" (while the lose condition is ""eaten by the shadow monster"")."

The road to victory is basically just a question of slowly escalating your conflicts along with Scavenger's growth.  Not that it wouldn't work, or wouldn't be fun, because it definitely would. I can imagine it progressing from almost black-ops style building up the innocuous kills to empower scavenger without being rumbled and killed by capes your pet monster can't yet take down (because Moord Nag herself is still just a squishy human in a t-shirt) until you eventually progress to the stage where your main opponents are a smattering of high-tier brutes and other tricksy types who can resist Scavenger (since normals are basically just powerups at that point) and the occasional opponent who's intelligent and equipped enough to set up snipers, traps and the like for you.  I just personally think Moord Nag works better as the looming end boss."

I think your questing ability is strongest when you’re closest to the situation that triggered your love of worm.""  “What?”  “Honestly, I’m highly suspicious that it’s true for any wormophile out there.  Whenever you’re in the same kind of mindset or same sort of physical situation you were in when you first read worm, your problem solving abilities get stronger.  The good news is that you probably can leverage that to your advantage.  Your roleplay skills would operate off of hopelessness and frustration, which work excellently at solving problems in worm.”  Fuck.  It fit, more or less.  “The really scary part is that it might be doing us a service, because it works like a Pavlovian trigger.

Sounds like a very active quest. Maybe have two groups of players; the Simurgh-altered, and the clean. A certain amount of interaction, decided by you, between a clean character and a Simurgh-altered character causes the clean character to flip his or her alliance and become Simurgh-altered.

Parahumans,39g10g,LexiconWrought,26,Thu Jun 11 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"“The Fool in the Tarot deck frequently depicted a boy with a dog at his heels, staring at the sky while he walked blithely off a cliff, burdened only by a bundle on a stick. The diabolist had admitted a relationship to the card.  No single detail was quite right, but much as something might appear similar if one were to unfocus their vision…  The young diabolist walked with the sparrow at his shoulder, eyes on the windows without looking through the windows, walking forward as if he were afraid to stop. His burden here was the gas containers.  No, he was burdened not just by the gas containers, but by some notion of responsibility.  A man, when facing death, aspires to finish what he started.  What had the custodian of the Thorburn estate started? What drove him?  She knew he sought to do good and to vanquish evil, and she could surmise that both good acts and the existence of evil had touched him deeply.  The Fool card was akin to the ace. Depending on the game being played, it was often the lowest card or the highest. Valueless or highly valued. Powerless or powerful.  It all depended on context. He sought to kill the demon, and he would either catastrophically fail or succeed.  This Fool sought to slay the metaphorical dragon. He felt his own mortality, which was quite possibly her fault, in part, and now he rushed to finish the task he’d set for himself. To better the world.  The Fool was wrought with air – the clouds he gazed at, the void beyond the cliff, the feather in his cap, even the dog could often be found mid-step, bounding, just above the ground.  He was a Fool wrought with a different element. The familiar didn’t quite fit for the departure from the air, but the traditional dog didn’t conjure ideas of air right off the bat either.  What was he wrought with? That was another question that begged an answer.”    Pact   “Money was the blood of civilized society, its currents running through everything and everyone. Where money was insufficient, things withered. People starved, sickened and died, constructions eroded, even ideas perished. Where funds were plentiful, the same things blossomed with new life.  And money was, in the end, little more than the product of collective imagination. A slip of paper or a coin had no value beyond that of the material it was fashioned of. It only took on a life of its own when people as a whole collectively agreed that certain papers and coins were worth something.  Only then did people bleed and die for it. For a fantasy, a faith given form in hard, concrete numbers.  Then again, much of society was built on a series of shared delusions. Clothing was little more than scraps of particular materials with particular geometries, but people clung to the idea of fashion. Style. Good and bad fashion was another belief system, one which all members of a culture were indoctrinated into. Breaking certain conventions didn’t only challenge the aesthetic sensibilities of others, but it challenged their sense of self. It reminded them, subconsciously, of the very pretendings they clung to.  Only those with power could stand against society’s tides, flaunt the collective’s ‘safe’ aesthetic. When one had enough power, others couldn’t rise against them and safely say something calculated to reduce their own dissonance and remind the offending party of the unspoken rules.  When one had enough power to take a life with a twitch of a finger, a thought, they earned the right to wear skin-tight clothing and call themselves Hero, or Legend. To wear a mask and name themselves something inane like ‘the Cockatoo’ and still take themselves seriously.”    Worm   Both of these characters viewed the world in an interesting way and these 'monologues' (internal thought) really characterized them.

Using his power to torture people is basically just a more advanced and accurate version of daydreaming - it's sick, but I'm not going to fault him for something which is essentially harmless.  As far as this goes,   In his interlude he mentions splitting worlds just to have the fun of torturing people with no consequences.   he doesn't do that with people who are irreplaceable unless he really needs to. Coil's almost fanatically paranoid - he doesn't like risking the possibility that he would have to drop the other timeline for whatever reason and be stuck with a tortured-to-death Tattletale. He only starts risking it with the Undersiders once it becomes apparent that he's going to have to kill Skitter eventually and as such needs to know if she's going to attack him first."
Parahumans,39cfrs,SirKaid,12,Thu Jun 11 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"But he still tried.   And I don't even necessarily buy that. Coil needs a way to stop Noelle, if only for his own sake. Whether or not the timeline is dropped he'd rather have a way to do so than not do so. And, on average, he might rather be careful than not. There's only so long you can push things and his power won't help if things progress too far."
Parahumans,39cfrs,Tsegen,12,Thu Jun 11 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Coil may be bond villain evil, but he's smart enough to come up with plenty of scenarios where stopping a growing s-class threat benefits both his identities, so he wouldn't just not do it. His power compels him to engage in pretty insanely antisocial behavior that he can feel safe in indulging; it doesn't make him cartoonishly evil for negligible benefit.  If it had been possible he'd have found a way to do it, and then sat on it until the exact moment it benefited his interests the most. His whole shtick with his employees was knowing what they wanted that no one else could provide, and then providing it to underline that he can provide like none other. Can't pull that off if you never try to provide."
Parahumans,39cfrs,snifferblisters,2,Thu Jun 11 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"Right.  Basically he'd keep trying until he found something that worked, then still drop it.  Now he has the solution in his bag of tricks in case it ever comes to needing it."

Parahumans,39bab1,Igigigif,5,Wed Jun 10 16:24:01 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to think that quote doesn't mean much.  And released them from what?  That suggests they already existed he just opened the door.  Are there more Endbringers bound somewhere?
Parahumans,39bab1,tybo555,63,Wed Jun 10 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"That quote is kind of the linchpin of a huge amount the story. Ignoring the main piece of evidence and then asking where the evidence is seems kind of self-defeating.  In the Eden interlude, we see what she and Zion planned, and it involved releasing at least 10 (I think 13?) Endbringers on that world. However, because Eden died after her fight with Abaddon, she was never able to release the Endbringers (storing and tailoring them was presumably her job, as the Thinker). Because of this, she only got through the part of making the Endbringers, but she never let them free.  Which brings us to Eidolon. As shown in his interlude, he has extremely low self esteem, and he feels that his only purpose is as ""The World's Strongest Cape"". After he and the other Triumvirate members appear, they start to fix the problems of the world pretty well. Imagine what those three could do if they weren't constantly playing catch-up with the Endbringers. This causes Eidolon to have a crisis in his mind; trying to find a purpose for his life. After all, what good is being the best if there is no challenge?  ""You needed worthy opponents"".  Eidolon knew that there was almost no one he couldn't stop. With all that power, he became depressed. And thus, he needed a challenge. Something the world could look at and say ""We need Eidolon."" His shard felt his need, and tapped into Eden's shard that was to awaken the Endbringers. From there, he was able to find a fight where he was needed. Something that he had to be there for, something to give his life worth.   And then Scion starts to show him up at the fights. Scion can beat the Endbringers without any issue. So Eidolon needs something more. And what could be worse than an Endbringer? Two Endbringers. Then three. Scion kills the worst of them, the Herokiller? Eidolon needs more enemies. Something more. He taps deeper and deeper for challenges. He summons Khonsu, Tohu, and Bohu.   And that is why Scion says that to him. Scion says because it will break Eidolon. Those four words communicate that all the destruction, the misery, the millions of lives lost, are all the fault of Eidolon and not feeling like he is good enough. Even with all that power, Eidolon needed a worthy opponent. Maybe Eidolon could have beaten the Endbringers if he had been using his power the right way from the start. Maybe not. But the important part is that Eidolon summoned them, and it is all his fault."
Parahumans,39bab1,Tarhish,23,Wed Jun 10 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  To add to the last part, I really don't think it's a coincidence that the very next endbringer that shows up after Scion kills Behemoth is one that is incredibly difficult for Scion to engage.  It wasn't just 'another endbringer' but 'another endbringer that Scion will largely ignore.'"
Parahumans,39bab1,Maping,2,Wed Jun 10 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"Each of them escalate's to bypass Scion: Behemoth is pure muscle. Then Leviathan has to be beaten before he sinks his target; ie. it's not about direct confrontation any more. Then Simurgh starts corrupting people, so it's even less about direct confrontation, because even if Scion drives them off, she still succeeded. And then Khonsu is hard for Scion to fight. Finally, B&T split the work: B directly attacks Scion while T plays with the city."
Parahumans,39bab1,pseudonarne,15,Tue Jun 16 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"That quote is kind of the linchpin of a huge amount the story   i think he means that scion probably didn't even know what it meant let alone why it was important to say, just that path to victory told him to make those noises to get his opening.   like how contessa managed to communicate in languages she doesn't actually know(at least twice, once when she met mother, once when she guessed the random gibberish that skitter's broken brain would happen to understand and interpreted her scrambled answer...apparently by feeding ""how do i get this message across"" into ptv and then ""how do i just happen to guess what they said back"") so him saying it doesn't mean its actually true one way or the other especially since scion didn't know he had feelings at the time let alone understand them enough to know that piece of information would have that effect. could just as easily have said 'your mother never loved you' if that was the insecurity eidolon had instead. wouldn't mean it was true, wouldn't mean it was fake. just something that'd get to you.  your thing is why ptv told him to say it, but scion didn't know any of that and it has the same effect whether or not it was factual"
Parahumans,39bab1,tybo555,15,Wed Jun 10 19:24:08 2015 UTC,"Scion doesn't need to confirm it for the story part of it to be true.  The way I see that quote, it has two uses.   To make Eidolon give up To communicate that information to the reader   You're right on the first count. If Eidolon loved puppies and Scion said ""man puppies are the worst kittens 4 lyfe"" it may have worked just as well. But the fact that he has that insecurity, plus all the other info we have, makes it easy to put all of that info together in a way that makes sense.   To put it a different way: It doesn't matter if Scion knows it's true, or even knows what he's saying. It matters that Eidolon and the reader know the importance of what Scion is saying."

I think the superweapons were made out of shards, which has some...interesting possibilities. Maybe a cape which turns other capes into monstrous semi-Endbringers."
Parahumans,39bab1,pukedbrandy,3,Fri Jun 12 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't read it as Eidolon wanted something to fight so he could seem important, I seem to remember an interlude in which he talks about himself as just a soldier. Instead, I read it as Eidolon knows he is the most powerful cape and has the best chance at beating Scion when he goes crazy. The problem Eidolon has is there isn't anybody near his level to practice his skills against. His shard reads this and goes ""Oh, I know some really powerful stuff you could fight as practice. Here, have some Endbringers!"" So when Scion says about worthy opponents, Eidolon realises the Endbringers only exist because of him and breaks down."

It seems more likely that Eden created the superweapons, once she (it?) got to Earth. Eidolon presumably did the same, but without the same control or priorities."
Parahumans,39bab1,tybo555,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Eden have a moment with Zion where they mentally communicate about it? (On mobile so can't check right now).  Also the Superweapons are different because the Entities tailor them to different worlds. They're the same beings, they just work different because each world needs a different type of challenge.  And it's important to remember that a lot of the differences in action stem from the ""Superweapons"" having a controller (Eden) versus the Endbringers (same beings, different names. Its generally accepted that the Superweapons are Endbringers) just getting a call of ""wake up and give this guy a worthy fight""."
Parahumans,39bab1,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure what that matters, but not about the superweapons in specific.  The superweapons we saw were for Earth. And hey, why would there be superweapons set aside for Earth long before any Entities planned to go there?  That's enough to account for the behavioral differences, but if that's the cause of other differences, they couldn't have been pre-made; they would need to be made on-site. Which makes more sense overall."
Parahumans,39bab1,tybo555,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"A power the entity held in reserve identified something wrong.  The entity turned and looked at its partner, standing slightly behind it, taciturn and silent.  They exchanged the smallest of broadcasts.  A consensus was reached between them.  Arsenal knew something about the superweapons, or he suspected strongly enough for it to matter.   In the context (maybe 1/10 of the way through the interlude for Arc 29), it heavily implies that the Entities are responsible for the Superweapons.   Which Earth? The one in 29.x? That's the vision of Earth Eden was planning on making happen.  What exactly do you mean by made? Like shaped? I would maybe be ok with that (it makes some amount of sense for why Scion wouldn't act weird and immediately know what they are). Eidolon didn't create them, but I would be willing to believe that there was a general version of what an Endbringer should be, and he just kind of told the shard to do whatever."

My theory is that the superweapons and Endbringers were shaped from unused shards. The superweapons were carefully made to sow conflict; the Endbringers were hewn unconsciously to be worthy foes."

The Endbringers we know (for the most part) are also human shaped.   The Endbringers are stated to be specifically designed to sow conflict and keep people from advancing too far. They always hit where it will hurt most, but never actually hard enough to destroy the world. They just do it enough to cause fighting between people."

One was essentially human, another was essentially human but with a lion-like head, the third was essentially human but with a serpentine lower body. Definitive differences, clearly taken from the animal kingdom. (The Earth animal kingdom, I should add.) The Endbringers were vaguely human, but with plenty of differences...and not ones which can be attributed to splicing with animals in the same way the superweapons' differences were. Some are general traits associated with predators, birds, or whatever; others are just weird.  The Endbringers do do all of that, but for the most part, they don't seem to care so much about sowing conflict as creating chaos. And, of course, they largely shut down once Eidolon died..."

To power this ability, he basically drains the ""battery"" from other capes. If you remember what happened with Doormaker and how he ran out of juice, thats basically what Eidolon can do.

Muscular, brutish, it was perched on a massive floating crystal, with more crystals floating about it. Here and there, the crystals touched ground.  They turned what they touched into more crystal, which soon uprooted themselves to join the storm around it.  A woman, even more brutish in appearance, had a reptilian lower body.  Steam rolled off her in billowing clouds, taking uncanny forms as it coiled and expanded through the area.  Faces, reaching claws and more.  And on the third monitor, flecked by static, was a naked man, beautiful and long-haired, his face touched with a macabre grin.

New tactics. Imagination. Requiring the free will of the host.  As such, something needs to force conflict, and in the best scientific fashion, that something needs to be quantifiable to the entities themselves. Each EB is a test case for some challenge or another, and the Entities learn from hosts interacting with those challenges.  It's all there in the book. The world being a much happier place after powers arrived but before the EBs. How some of the most idolised capes were killed off by Behemoth and how they realised the old tactics wouldn't work any more. How the military was shown to be ineffective, and capes became the front line of all major conflicts. How the EB schedule allows for reasonable tactics to develop, before a new EB drops in and murders half the capes needed for said tactic.  Everything is to keep the hosts on their toes, in conflict, and reliant on their shards."

As far your actual question, there are many things that go against your head canon, the most convincing one is that with all the Endbringer tools, just killing all humans to take their resources is really really easy and the Endbringers are most definitely not going all out on killing people as they attack in a stupid meaningless schedule, pretend that they actually take damage before retreating and just do nothing most of the time. There actions much better support the 'they are some part of the cycle theory', and they also existed in Eden's plan/precognition and she will never allow the third Entity to interfere. There is also more evidence against it but I'll just answer your question instead. We don't have absolute information about them as the situation is rather vague and unexplained by reliable sources (and there is a Simurgh which makes everything worse as who knows what her plans are) but everyone is pretty much divided into three possible explanations. The first, 'Scion lied theory' in which Scion just said that to get Eidolon killed and Eidolon has no relation to the Endbringers. There are some things against this theory (like Endbringers fighting Scion) but in the end it isn't really any clearer or less vague than the other ones. The second, 'it's all Eidolon's fault' theory in which Eidolon's passenger awakened and controls the Endbringers due to Eidolon's subconscious. This theory is very solid, but it is very vague as to what happened after Eidolon died. The third is like a middle point between them that Eidolon's control shard awakened another shard which was made originally by Eden and is the one who actually controls the Endbringers with major initial instructions from Eidolon's subcouncious which were: by worthy opponents and kill Scion and the shard continued the only way it knows how by spreading conflict with Eden's superweapons. Note, after that initial step Eidolon had very minor influence on the Endbringers and thats why they continue after his death but the influence is still there. This is my head canon and what I think is the most solid theory but it is still rather vague and not WoGy enough. I hope this clarifies. Edit: I typed this on my phone so I couldn't really explain the third theory that I wrote here as thoroughly as I could have, if you have a question about it I can write again in a more thorough way."
Parahumans,39bab1,idannadi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:43:00 2015 UTC,Been about a year since I read Worm. Was there ever an explanation as to why the other entity created the Endbringers?
Parahumans,39bab1,randolphkoma,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"Please reread what I wrote, the third entity had absolutely nothing to do with the Endbringers as they existed in Eden's future world. As for reasons why Eden would have made them, we have plenty of WoG on the subject, maybe I'll put some links later. Example, you place Endbringers to both freeze conflict (as everyone will be too scared of them to attack one another) so there is never an all out war and also make conflict as those 2 countries can't really trade or reach nearby materials anymore. Something like sticking Behemoth in the Oil fields of the Middle East will stop a lot of Oil to reach the world and put a huge strain on it's supplies. And it will also complete freeze up the Middle East as who would dare attack someone else and use up resources when Behemoth could just demolish it's capital a week after that...

Parahumans,39bgtb,pendia,3,Wed Jun 10 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think the Triumvirate have good enough powers that sharing them would just weaken them. All of them can fly fast, all of them are survivable. But as is, they play different roles. Alex flies in close and punches people, so needs to be super durable and super strength. Legend stays back and fires stuff from a distance, so doesn't need massive amounts of durability, but does need good speed and full strength lasers. Eid just flings BS everywhere.  It's sort of like why a standard fantasy RPG party is healer+rouge+wizard+warrior. Sure, maybe paladin or w/e can do everything that each of those characters could do, but pal+pal+pal+pal doesn't work as well. Having specialists is better than all rounders. You can't simultaneously fling fireballs and hit foes to death, so having to choose between half strength fireballs or half strength hitting is bad."

Eg someone with super strength and someone who flies would work well together, since their powers don't overlap and being able to get in peoples faces fast to punch them helps out the guy with super strength, and being able to fight at close quarters helps the flying dude. But having 2 mediocre long range mediocre short range dudes isn't necessarily better than just a long range dude and a short range dude."

Sure, it's mostly Geodude and Zubat, but every cave in Pokemon is.  Except for fucking Rusturf Tunnel. Fuck Whismur. Fuck its stupid little eyes. Fuck its annoying cry. Fuck the fact that for some reason it thinks it can take my LVL 100 Blaziken every time--I mean are you fucking kidding me Whismur; Fighting type is Normal's ONLY weakness."
Parahumans,39bpjc,snifferblisters,2,Fri Jun 26 00:42:19 2015 UTC,You make some solid points.  But my Exploud will fuck your Blaziken up.
Parahumans,398vcv,oliwhail,23,Wed Jun 10 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"Another consideration is the ""breadcrumbs"" that the Entities leave behind in order to discourage others of their kind from interfering.  This means that it is extremely unlikely for another species like the Entities to ever show up on Earth again.  And the fact that they targeted Earth may also be evidence that there is no other advanced life nearby :(  I don't think it's necessarily evidence that all nearby species have already been eaten, though. We aren't given any information either way. We only know that Earth was chosen.  Hive  Agreement"
Parahumans,398vcv,aetherious,3,Wed Jun 10 03:27:10 2015 UTC,"If they were clever about it, they might build the breadcrumbs to morph into attraction signals after several billion years (or however long intelligent life takes to evolve on average)"
Parahumans,398vcv,aetherious,13,Wed Jun 10 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"I think that'd be kinda hard. The Entities make the planet and every multiverse instance of that planet go boom so they can get more energy. I'm not really convinced that any form of life can recover from that. Ever  I should probably re-word my response. By ""Interfering"" I meant that it's a signal to their species that they won't find anything of value along that path"
Parahumans,398vcv,aetherious,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:37:37 2015 UTC,"Sure, sure. My thought was more along the lines of signalling others to come to a fertile area of space. I'm assuming the areas in the universe that can support intelligent life in the first place are probably rare, so even after clearing one species out, you would want to mark the 'cosmic neighborhood' and have someone come back the next harvest season."
Parahumans,398vcv,pseudonarne,14,Wed Jun 10 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"“Fortuitous arrival,” she said.  She smiled a little.  “Not very likely.  They litter breadcrumbs in their wake, not to be followed, but so their kin don’t waste time and effort traveling the same paths.  For another to arrive here, they would need to avoid touching a single crumb, like you or me swimming the length of a river without touching a wave.”   Glaistig Uaine, Speck 30.2  You've got it backwards."

Parahumans,398vcv,notentirelyrandom,7,Wed Jun 10 04:06:18 2015 UTC,they're not reapers.  they nuke every possible instance of the worlds they find supporting life.  its like checking back on alderaan to see if they've rebuilt the capital yet
Parahumans,398vcv,Quillwraith,3,Wed Jun 10 13:16:38 2015 UTC,"So, to be clear, I didn't think they would go back to the same planet, but rather to that part of, say, the galaxy, since they know it's an area that can support life.  Like, farmers don't harvest the same corn stalks every year, but they use the same fields to grow them."
Parahumans,398vcv,GreatWyrmGold,5,Wed Jun 10 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"but...in your analogy they didn't stop at the removal of the stalks...the field was not only salted and burned to ash but dug up and dumped into the ocean the entirety of which was then irradiated.   corn(or anything like it) won't just magically reappear there  besides mars isn't even good for life as we recognize it let alone some chunk of the galaxy just because it was near earth...its not a panspermia type of explosion where tough little bacteria might land in an asteroid somewhere and start over, they sucked all the energy/resources out of the place and then exploded the husk somehow (pretty sure earths don't run in streaks, so blowing one up doesn't mean you're near any others one way or the other)"
Parahumans,3996rr,Igigigif,44,Wed Jun 10 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"The equipment is finicky and built by someone who doesn't really understand how it actually works, using materials that they can obtain in a society that isn't advanced enough to produce the technology without outside intervention. With a few notable exceptions, tinker tech isn't mass produced according to a detailed plan with exacting tolerances, it's thrown together by someone who is compelled to build it by a psychic connection to a small part of a gargantuan alien that hasn't actually told them how to build it. They just get to work and the space whale makes sure they do it right. So it tends to break down quickly, and only one person in the world can make it work again."
Parahumans,3996rr,ThirdFloorGreg,18,Wed Jun 10 04:17:09 2015 UTC,"Helicopters need to be maintained for every 40 hours of flight time, as a good comparison."
Parahumans,3996rr,NinteenFortyFive,16,Wed Jun 10 07:52:37 2015 UTC,"To follow up on a few other answers with a more detailed comparison.  Imagine all the maintenance that goes into a car.  Oil changes, tire pressure, replacing the battery, windshield wiper fluid, in addition to keeping the car fueled of course.  Now imagine that the car was built was with 17th century tech.  The battery would be crappy and would require regular replacement.  The lack of high quality fuel would mean that it would have to be produced just for the car.  Any impurities in the fuel would mean more engine maintenance.  And the car wouldn't have all those convenient lights that indicate problems.  It would be up to the sole tinker that doesn't really understand everything except through the shard to tell instinctively from minor clues when a problem was going to happen and then fix it.  The shard isn't really imposing a limit on maintenance so much as just not being optimally helpful in this area.  Hypothetically, the shard could give the exact instructions for maintaining it and the tinker could write a super long manual that a regular person might be able to understand, but that would defeat the whole purpose of promoting conflict and studying an individuals creativity in using the power."
Parahumans,3996rr,scruiser,7,Wed Jun 10 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"the tinker could write a super long manual   They actually reference that a few times in Worm. The big one is when Taylor gets her wings and Defiance is going over how they work with her (and that manual is just the upkeep in the field, she still has to take it back to him for more). But when they talk about the containment foam and I think there was some sort of battery, they mention that it was originally Tinker tech that got scaled back a lot, so that a normal person (well, a normal techy person) could still work with it as long as they get the thing explained to them. I assume the Dragon Teeth work the same way, although that aspect of them is never really mentioned."
Parahumans,3996rr,V3nomoose,3,Wed Jun 10 16:09:46 2015 UTC,Masamune specializes in mass production.  I assume he builds stuff to pump it out and in lieu of the usual checkups he just tosses it back into the factory he has to maintain instead.
Parahumans,3996rr,NinteenFortyFive,2,Wed Jun 10 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"He doesn't specialize in mass production, he takes other tinkers' tech and makes it mass-produceable. Presumably, he's able to figure out how it works and break it down into concepts a typical mechanic can figure out. Which probably helps explain why he focuses on relatively simple things like weapons and chemicals rather than, say, that spatial-distorting circuit Kid Win made that made new energy out of nowhere."
Parahumans,3996rr,GreatWyrmGold,4,Fri Jun 12 00:11:32 2015 UTC,The fact that Eden earth had mass produced tinker tech makes me think that stuff like constant maintenance and inability to mass produce tech are at least somewhat shard induced limits to tinkers.
Parahumans,3996rr,charizardsucks,8,Wed Jun 10 06:43:22 2015 UTC,I don't remember Eden earth having mass produced tinker tech. Where did that come in?
Parahumans,3996rr,number6,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"Real world equipment requires constant maintenance.  A rifle needs to be stripped, cleaned, and oiled on the regular. A computer needs dusting and malware-cleaning on the regular. A car needs a visit to a mechanic on the regular. A pair of trousers needs washing (and occasionally patching) on the regular.  Don't even get me started on data centres and combat helicopters.  Tinkertech needs maintenance because it is tech, not because it is Tinker."
Parahumans,398f7l,HarbringerOfNumbers,53,Wed Jun 10 00:23:57 2015 UTC,"Tohu & Bohu's theme seems to be betrayal, if anything. They turn the cities that the heroes are trying to defend against them, and use the powers of their strongest allies. Which is kind of funny, since they're the last Endbringers to show up before Scion stops being good and tries to kill everything."
Parahumans,398f7l,Atigerwithlaserbeams,22,Wed Jun 10 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"I really like this answer. I can see how having the things that protect you (walls, floors, heroes) turned agains you could be just as scary as any other Endbringer."
Parahumans,398f7l,OnlyLoveNow,4,Wed Jun 10 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Tohu wa bohu (תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ) is a Biblical Hebrew phrase found in the Book of Genesis 1:2 that describes the condition of the earth before God said, ""Let there be light"" (Gen. 1:3). Precise translation of the phrase is difficult, since it is a Hebrew wordplay, like ve-ha-oniyyah hishevah le-hishaver in Jonah 1:4.[1] Numerous interpretations of this phrase were made by various theological sources, though it is usually translated as ""waste and void,"" ""formless and empty,"" or ""chaos and desolation."""
Parahumans,398f7l,Atigerwithlaserbeams,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the translation, but while it is interesting, I'm not certain why you replied to my comment rather than posting it in the thread as a whole. Are you offering this as a rebuttal of my view? If so, could you please elaborate on why? I'm entirely open to new perspectives, but I'd like to hear more about why you might feel that this supersedes my idea, if that was you goal in posting it.  Also, this probably comes off as really confrontational. Sorry about that, but it's late right now and I'm too tired to edit my word choice much. I really am interested in hearing more about your comment if you have more to add though."
Parahumans,398f7l,Gnimhey,29,Fri Jun 12 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"Because, aside from the nightmare of fighting a Shaker Kill-You-All with the strength and durability of every Endbringer, they've got any three powers from the capes facing them. Beyond that, they literally turn the cities they attack into death traps. If you beat off Leviathan or Behemoth, you can rebuild. If you get hit by Tohu and Bohu, prepare to lose bulldozers afterwards, because that place will swallow them whole now."

Parahumans,398f7l,Rillet,16,Wed Jun 10 03:05:45 2015 UTC,Tohu can use capes that have been killed and not just the ones facing her. Likely any cape that ever existed regardless of current situation.  She used Phir Sē despite him being dead and long before she showed up. This is actually kinda interesting because they never met which means either the Endbringers aren't as 'dormant' as we assume before appearing or part of her power is finding some of the most devastating capes around regardless of when they were around.
Parahumans,398f7l,V3nomoose,16,Wed Jun 10 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"If you go with the idea that Eidolon and the Endringers are linked, it could be that Tohu connects with/copies any shard that Eidolon had contact with, even in passing."
Parahumans,398f7l,Ranku_Abadeer,2,Wed Jun 10 03:07:21 2015 UTC,"i think of it more of the simurgh, it's confirmed that she communicates and plans with the other endbringers, and since she can see in both directions through time, perhaps she finds shards that have/will exist and tells the pair which ones to emulate?  tbh i have a lot of questions about the simurgh and the endbringers. mainly because, if you think about it... it seems that they might have in a roundabout way been on the hero's side the whole time. perhaps it has something to do with the eidolon connections?"
Parahumans,398f7l,Ranku_Abadeer,21,Thu Jun 11 04:21:50 2015 UTC,"with most endbringers, you have to keep an eye on them and their ""domain"" in order to be somewhat safe. (behemoth's fire/lightning, keep an eye on the waterline with levaithan, make sure the simurgh doesn't do too much with tech/throw a building at you, avoid khonsu's circles) but with tohu bohu, EVERYTHING can turn against you. the city that you are standing in could attack you at any moment with next to no warning, and you never know what could happen with tohu, the skies themselves might become a weapon, or it might start sniping, or.... anything.  if you asked me, uncertainty is tohu bohu's main theme. when they show up, anything can happen, and you just know that it's going to be bad.  EDIT: interestingly enough, tohubohu is a hebrew phrase that generally means ""chaos and confusion"" so, yeah, i'd say that fits their theme."
Parahumans,398f7l,malgalad,21,Wed Jun 10 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"You can't stop Bohu. Stronger capes can slow, stall Leviathan and Behemoth, provide a distraction for Simurgh. But Clockblocker's power wouldn't work on entire tower of her body, Kaiser can't build a cage for her, Miss Militia can't do any substantial damage even with Bakuda's armory, Alexandria can't pin her down or hit with a blow strong enough to drive her back, etc etc. They affect an entire cities at once, and probably have the most heavy casualties. You can generally ran away from Simurgh before it's too late, you can navigate out of sight of Behemoth, you can stay in shelters when Leviathan comes, Khonsu is tricky, but still he doesn't cause that much destruction. But you can't escape Red Miles when the very buildings turn into traps, streets are unnavigable, and things constantly change. Areas affected by them are gone. Entirely. On par with Simurgh, you say ""fuck it"" and wall it off, there's no recovery or cleaning. Tohu picks the strongest powers and use devastating attacks to destroy capes. It's a heavy psychological warfare, to show capes what the best and strongest of them can do, if turned rogue. Fortunately, she didn't pick Skitter...   Edit: Tohu <=> Bohu"

Parahumans,398f7l,ThatDamnSJW,11,Wed Jun 10 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"I was always of the same opinion on that one, that the new Endbringers just weren't as engaging. Once I re-ready Khonsu's appearance, he actually became one of my favorites. He goes around wrecking stuff for days on end. He takes a bite out of morale over and above being a new threat. In terms of sheer exhaustion he evokes, he's one of my favorites now."

Here, I mean telekinetic in that she can move things when her mind, including other minds) Khonsu gets time control (but only time lcompression"", in a very small area) and teleportation  B and T get power stealing (this is sort of Eidolon to the max) and extreme landscape manipulation"

He also an inspector Gadget-like arsenal on his body including that knife he killed that one doc with in his fight against Skitter in her territory  I don't know much about his clones but I know they were a bit different from the OG Mannequin"
Parahumans,396fgp,Volhar,16,Tue Jun 9 16:52:11 2015 UTC,I don't think they ever showed his clones plus I don't think they had enough time to modify themselves to the original Mannequin's extent. What they did show was that the Mannequin clones used their tinker speciality to seal off a building with a few other clones inside. If I remember correctly when they broke in the hole was immediately sealed off with ice.
Parahumans,396fgp,ThatOtherGuy15,13,Tue Jun 9 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"They ""showed"" his clones in the sense that they mentionned they just looked like regular dudes.   After that there was the whole building seal thing, the clones didn't have the time to modify themselves (Nor the will ? Maybe his clones were less ""I'm going to cut myself in bits to seal me from the world"" and more ""I'm going to seal off this random place I'm in right now from the world""). There also was this thing where a young Mannequin in Bonesaw's cell was building a wall to keep the world out, iirc ? That's all we know afaik."

Parahumans,396fgp,DistaNVDT,6,Tue Jun 9 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that was the Snowmann, the (I think) Mannequin/Winter hybrid.  It built itself a large, mecha kind of body to seal inside of, and that a whole expansive ice as a defense theme."
Parahumans,396fgp,Iconochasm,2,Tue Jun 9 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"All 4 were inside the sealed building. However, I don't believe Snowmann was. He is encountered later, meaning he sealed the building with the others inside then left."
Parahumans,396fgp,booljayj,6,Tue Jun 9 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah they show his clones, and they do all have the armor. Skitter has an epic fight with four of them during that exact chapter!   “Vista,” he said, “Another shot!”  She still had her gun leveled at Mannequin.  She aimed-  And the Mannequin let a blade spring from his palm.  It punched through the wall at the very edge of our tunnel.  Ice exploded into the interior of the hallway, consuming the Mannequin entirely.   and   “Three Mannequins and a Rat above us,” I said.  “Two rats below us.

Parahumans,396fgp,cephalord,6,Tue Jun 9 17:30:11 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, Mannequin essentially removed everything that wasn't neccesary for his functioning and sealed the remaining bits in closed, armored cases which were stored in his body.    Body was several limbs attached by extendable chains. Arms and legs had stabby-implements that could be extended and retracted. He had a fire-arm of some description mounted, as well as a chemical-spraying device that featured some chemical that could ignite upon contact with an open flame or a spark.    I think that he had a feature later where he could super-heat the inside of his armor, but I could be confusing him with one of Dragon's suits."
Parahumans,396fgp,Valthek,6,Tue Jun 9 22:17:55 2015 UTC,Don't forget that it was modular. I believe he had a different set-up for the fight before the bombing than he did when he attacked Skitter.

Kids with hopes and dreams and big careers ahead of them are more inclined to go this route.  TL;DR: When you're a kid and starting your journey, it's easier to do so by going to the cape towns.

It depends on the nature of the process that gives rise to universal differentiation, as well as entropy on a quantum level (which is something I admit to not yet understanding fully.)"
Parahumans,38yzw9,exegesis,2,Wed Jun 10 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"Entropy is the result of the interaction of particles, which is a statistical process. The distribution of mass in the universe is also a statistical process. Since the universe is open, there are infinitely many places in this universe where mass is less densely distributed and so the initial clumping process has been happening more slowly, and the galaxies are just beginning to form. They are outside our light cone in this universe, but if we have access to infinitely many other universes there are infinitely many of them where that holds within our light cone."
Parahumans,38yzw9,ArgentStonecutter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:39:27 2015 UTC,"No, I totally get that argument, I just don't buy that there are necessarily always an infinite number of universes which retain low-entropy, especially depending on how universes 'split.' My poorly-thought-out example is this: an infinitely large set of randomly chosen numbers between 0 and +infinity need not neccessarily contain any one particular number, (eg, 2), doubly so if the random number chooser works by an unknown process (eg, universes split more when there are more quantum-mechanical events which give rise to large-scale changes, thus favouring universes where entropy is increasing and disfavouring those where it is not, or where it is decreasing.)"
Parahumans,38yzw9,exegesis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"But we're not talking about sets containing any particular number. We're talking about ""out of all randomly distributed sets, how many contain a number greater than some high but finite value"".  And universes don't split more when there are events that give rise to large scale changes. They can only be readily distinguished when there are large scale changes, so you could say ""there are two indistinguishable universes"" or ""there is one universe that has twice the amplitude of this universe"", but for the purposes of this thought experiment these are equivalent statements.  Otherwise it wouldn't matter if a die was crooked, all rolls would have the same probability."
Parahumans,38yzw9,ArgentStonecutter,2,Thu Jun 11 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"Darn, that's a good point. And one that I should have noticed, too. And it applies regardless of whether there's a countable or uncountable number of universes."

Parahumans,38yzw9,mhd-hbd,8,Mon Jun 15 08:02:46 2015 UTC,I thought Phir Se was violating conservation honestly. His power honestly looked to me like a recursive perpetual motion machine.

Is there any reference in canon as to what exactly Phir Se was doing there?"
Parahumans,38yzw9,SnowGN,11,Tue Jun 9 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"I interpreted Phir Se's megaweapon as two conjoined portals (like Portal portals, but with a time component as well as a space component) creating a recursive infinite loop of light.   That's pretty explicitly what it is, right? He even mentions trying to walk back in time. Whether that's actually what goes on behind the scenes, though ... did we ever find out what Parian's power actually is?  The normal interpretation is that it was emulating that effect - pre-computing the next few seconds and making that information/energy available, without actual time travel involved. I don't think that there's any WoG confirming what it actually is.  If it did involve actual time travel - retrieving information/energy from possible futures - it would probably be a solution to the problem of entropy."
Parahumans,38yzw9,fourdots,5,Tue Jun 9 00:19:50 2015 UTC,"No. However, there have been a number of times when characters have wondered where the energy to do X thing was coming from; it's later implied that the answer is ""from other universes"".

Parahumans,38yzw9,GreatWyrmGold,2,Tue Jun 9 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yes.Tattletale was talking about people like Scrub, Shadow Stalker and Sundancer. And the fandom extrapolated that to mean that every time based power is just inter-dimensional shenanigans, which is just not supported strongly enough for any certainty in it as a hypothesis.  Scion himself talks about Gray Boy's loops as time loops and not inter-dimensional shenanigans and Phir Se can apparently have conversations with himself."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Tsegen,2,Thu Jun 11 03:19:34 2015 UTC,"It's implied at a few points that powers get their apparent violation of the laws of thermodynamics from other universes.  Time shenanigans obviously happen, but they're powered by interdimensional shenanigans."

All they'd need to do is have a coil of wire with a portal at either end and a magnet infinitely looping through the coil. That they appear too stupid to do this puzzles me given the number of thinker shards they have.
Parahumans,38yzw9,MadScientist14159,3,Tue Jun 9 01:10:55 2015 UTC,Maybe the portals have a very high energy cost.
Parahumans,38yzw9,sanctaphrax,5,Wed Jun 10 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty safe to assume that that wouldn't work, since the entities worry about resource constraints and Wildbow isn't an idiot.  Presumably the vagaries of power physics don't let portals be used like that."
Parahumans,38yzw9,tiny-alchemist,54,Tue Jun 9 01:53:40 2015 UTC,THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.
Parahumans,38yzw9,HarbringerOfNumbers,17,Mon Jun 8 03:38:11 2015 UTC,The Last Question confirmed for Worm 2.
Parahumans,38yzw9,HarbringerOfNumbers,17,Mon Jun 8 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS ALL  As mentioned earlier in a different thread, powers seem to work through ""inter-dimensional shenanigans"". So Theo's ""hands"" or Burscar's flames are drawing from materials and energy in another universe. The net result is conservation of energy and matter are maintained, making head death still an issue."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Cruithne,13,Mon Jun 8 01:47:49 2015 UTC,"This makes me think, though.  Does every universe-split, half the energy in each of the universes? Or does moving energy from universe to universe add more entropy to both than can be preserved?  It seems to me like maybe the entities are focused too much, maybe, on the big picture, of all of the universes. There are a lot of universes, right? So if you could concentrate all of their matter and energy into one universe, and then had that universe have a history split, and then  spread all of the energy back out again, wouldn't every universe end up with just a bit less than twice as much energy as it started out with?"
Parahumans,38yzw9,Gnimhey,7,Mon Jun 8 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"Wait..that's really interesting. I've never thought of it that way.  So there's two ways I could see this going. One option is it works exactly the way you think - you can sacrifice realities to shore up other realities. Since new realities are being generated all the time, you can do this forever.  The other option is a little weirder. The entities are described as being 5 dimensional. I've always took this to mean they existed across the normal 3 dimensions, across time, and across a fifth dimension that spans the parallel universes.  Assuming the 5th dimension is roughly analogous to the other 4, then is has a measurable ""width"". When universes split, either the entities get wider, they lose track of a universe or the universes get ""narrower"". If the entities get wider then your plan works, but in the other two scenarios, it gets much harder.  Still, it's a very interesting idea and one I never would have thought of."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Ranku_Abadeer,3,Mon Jun 8 02:35:53 2015 UTC,"That sort of connects to real-life interpretation of how entropy works, that being, that it is inherently tied with the quantum entanglement and universe-splitting, and that entropy is basically a measurement of how many possible entanglements in the universe left, before everything is perfectly, totally entangled with everything else and there aren't any actions left for any particles to take.  The width thing is moot, though, because Sting exists. Unless the energy needed to use Sting rises all the time as the number of total universes rises, or Sting is actually limited in scope, then shards that can effect the entire set of universes, or even just all of the universes that descend from a particular point in time, exist, and you could jigger some sort of Sting-derivative that sucks up everything that the Sting-missile hits into one universe.  So, I suppose Sting really deserves it's seat near the top of shard brokenness."
Parahumans,38yzw9,HarbringerOfNumbers,7,Mon Jun 8 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"It could be that Sting doesn't really work by hitting every reality, but by hitting this reality and then branching out until it can no longer find anything resembling what it hit. If that's the case, it's more energy efficient, and the only way it would waste power is if there's a wide time gap between when something is 'charged' and when it hits its target, because that's when new universes are being made- do we ever learn if time causes Foil's shots to get weaker? I would predict that it does."
Parahumans,38yzw9,HarbringerOfNumbers,4,Mon Jun 8 03:47:20 2015 UTC,What I wouldn't give to do Science to the Worm universe is very short list.
Parahumans,38yzw9,Protikon,4,Mon Jun 8 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"Is there a good explanation of where Sting works somewhere?  Edit: Just read it. I don't think it means that quite literally, otherwise they would have noticed buildings getting skewered in New York's Aleph version when Flechette was running over the rooftops."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Protikon,5,Mon Jun 8 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"huh, i just thought of that, maybe that's a restriction on flechette's shard? keep it from interacting with other realities that have separate host populations? it kinda could throw the results of the conflicts the shards set up way off if an interdimentional shot just so happens to kill a cape from a different universe that it had no indication was coming."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Protikon,4,Mon Jun 8 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"True, it might not apply to universes that diverged before Sting is applied to a missile.  But I'm pretty sure that it applies to all universes that diverge after the effect is applied.  Depending on how frequent universe divergences are, that might still a sizable number of universes' worth of energy for you rein back into one."
Parahumans,38yzw9,HarbringerOfNumbers,3,Mon Jun 8 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"Wow this gets confusing to think about. Especially because either the entities are really stupid about how they use their powers, or these powers have a LOT going on behind the scenes."
Parahumans,38yzw9,fireignition,5,Mon Jun 8 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'd guess it's both. It probably does take a lot of energy to use Sting (maybe on par with the Contessa-type foresight shards, maybe even more), and given that apparently the entities use Sting as a weapon themselves too, it probably isn't ingrained in them as something that just be a general 'do something in every universe' carrier. Maybe if Foil got to working with an inter-dimensional tinker they might have figured it out."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Gnimhey,3,Mon Jun 8 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"When it comes to thought experiments, Sting isn't even that bad. What about Doormaker's portals? Do they conserve energy? If so do they take gravitational potential into account when moving stuff around? What about momentum? Is that not-conserved, or do they have a crazy complex internal damper?"
Parahumans,38yzw9,Cruithne,6,Mon Jun 8 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Universes don't ""split"", they have always existed. The reason behind differences between them is probably quantum bullshit/random number generator induced when not directly caused by the Entities. Sadly, the pants of time model doesn't work in Worm.  There must also be a (potentially) finite amount of universes, otherwise the Entities wouldn't be worried about the heat death of the universe."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Gnimhey,2,Mon Jun 8 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"Pardon my unfamiliarity, but where is the text passage/word of Wildbow that says that the number of universes is constant?"
Parahumans,38yzw9,ErrantVagrant,11,Mon Jun 8 05:40:55 2015 UTC,"We never see a universe being created, and nobody can find a universe that is identical except for a single choice that butterflies out from there. Earth Bet got parahumans first, and didn't crate theoretical Earth Bet-1 through -infinity based on choices. That would mean Zion and Eden would be copied which is impossible as they are pan-universal beings. Multiple Cauldron universes, too. It just would not work.  That's all just logical assumptions, the main evidence for this is that the Entities are worried about heat death, and are extremely computationally capable. If there were infinite universes, they would notice, and proceed to not care about running out of energy.  The Entities are not wise, but they are intelligent. Enough to notice the easy ways out didn't work long before the cycle even started."
Parahumans,38yzw9,ceveau,5,Mon Jun 8 05:59:16 2015 UTC,"So there isn't any passage or word of Wildbow which says that the number of universes is constant.  I'd like to note that, I never said there are an infinite number of universes. I also never said that divergences, if they happen, happen frequently, or happens because of choices. All I've been saying is that, assuming that universes diverge, ever, which I'm sorry to say you have failed to convince me is conclusively disproven in the story or refuted by the author, then depending on how energy distribution between universes after the split works, you might be able to create something that concentrates energy into some subset of universes, and that given how I've heard Sting describe it could maybe be related to how you'd do that using shards."
Parahumans,38yzw9,ThatDamnSJW,4,Mon Jun 8 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"How else would universes be created? It's either choices or quantum fluctuations (or any other physical process), and in either case, that leads to a very rapid universe creation rate, considering the exponential scaling."

Parahumans,38yzw9,Brothernature0,4,Mon Jun 8 06:40:52 2015 UTC,"It's not clear how universes split, but the two universes we have that are given points of divergence split 30 and 10,000 years back. We don't know how those universes split, but we know they split relatively recently (at least relative to the life of stars). So, it's not unreasonable to assume that new universes are being created on a semi-regular basis."
Parahumans,38yzw9,Gnimhey,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:18:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't Coil himself ""create universes""? Or, at least, he seemed capable of being a single conscience in two different universes. Those universes also happened to have a diverging point that's a lot more recent than 30 years; the divergence point is the point where he decides to split.   Wasn't it said that the Entities basically ""joined"" a lot of the universes in which Earth existed, so that only a few would remain accessible? But there are still a whole lot, if not an infinite number, of universes in which Earth exists. And yes, including very, very similar ones. Otherwise Coil's power would not be possible."

But where Teacher could effect dozens of people and used it to lead basically a cult, Ingenue seems to only be able to effect one person at a time but can make larger changes to their power. Chevalier is able to make his blade twice as large after using Ingenue's power and can change his blade faster but seemingly has less control over things like its weight. The downside as always is that changing your powers influences your mind, in this case either driving you crazy or making you Ingenue's pawn, or some combination of the two, we don't see a whole lot about it. Except that by the time she was done with them former heros were committing mass murder.  Also the fact that she is able to walk up and form a partnership with Chevalier with essentially no resistance makes me think she has a secondary power that makes her seem more trustworthy or in some other way lets her get closer to her victims more easily. We only ever see her work with men but since she is a leader in an all female section of the prison it is possible that her power works with either gender and she just prefers enthralling guys."

Contessa herself is bested by a power nullifier and according to wildbow 'arguably' by Jack. Both who theoretically could be taken down by a guy with a gun.  Remember, the mighty Alexandria was killed by bug-girl.  edit; remember though, Alexandria is a smart one. There is a good chance she can figure out what Scrub is doing (also because she is one of the very few who probably have the necessary background on how powers work to figure it out without superpowered assistance) and simply not engage him at Scrub's limited range. Maybe restrain him with a construction beam.  In short, I think Scrub's power > Alexandria's power but factoring in personalities and context Alexandria would come out on top."

Kind of hard to judge, since we don't know what her ""plan"" was other than Defiant's assumptions and that she did in fact have the upper hand during the entire interrogation.  Her death was kind of weird though, I give you that. Taylor had the bugs spear towards her. Even if they attacked from behind, it would have taken less than a second to close her mouth and simply fly out of their and into some water.  Hell, at the speeds she flies, the bugs would have decimated by her acceleration.  I don't know, it's always bugged me (heh) and I think deserves some clarification in the rewrite or just rewritten so that Alexandria is actually in a positon that she couldn't escape from.  Edit: Oh wait, in a fight? Yeah, Alex should win. Too risky getting close? Rip out a phone pole and toss that sucker at Mach speeds. Even if only a few splinters are left over, they'd be fatal."

She mentioned how people tried to suffocate her multiple times (which Taylor noted), so it seems like she planned on Taylor attacking her. Why? I don't know. Could be a lot of reasons.  Now, she should have been immune to her bugs. The speed she moves at are more than capable of killing any bugs that attach to her, and her enhanced cognition and processing should have alllowed to not only hear the swarm targetting her, but actually process what was actually happening.  Note the ""should"". Because, somehow, she didn't hear a sizeable swarm behind her as they ""speared towards her"" and somehow not move fast enough to dislodge them, despite how she'd been shown moving before hand.

Parahumans,38x5gs,Tsegen,3,Tue Jun 9 04:23:40 2015 UTC,Skitter could totally kill Alexandria and vice versa.  I just think it could have been given a bit more detail as to why she didn't do any of the things that would have saved her life in seconds.
Parahumans,38x5gs,Ridtom,3,Wed Jun 10 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"Well..yeah. Someone like Skitter could also theoretically kill a bunch of people that it would be strange to see her actually succeed in killing. But, if it happened with this sort of paucity of justification, then, if they're not prone to be charitable, a person would say that it happened because it needed to happen.   We don't get detail because it would be too effective and Wildbow is writing fast. I do wonder if it'll be one of the things that gets edited though. Maybe with more time to get into it a suitably believable reason can be created."

Parahumans,38x5gs,swagrabbit,11,Mon Jun 8 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"This theory relies on the notion that Alexandria is wicked smaht.  Okay, so Alexandria sees everything she worked for crumbling. People who idolized her hate her. Her secret life's work is in the open, and everyone sees her as a monster because of it. She's gone from being one of the world's most loved to the world's absolute most hated.  Enter Taylor. Every time Taylor is pushed she escalates. She is a known killer. Someone who excels at looking at situations and finding the result that will hurt her enemies the most.  What does Alexandria do in the conversation with her?  She antagonizes her to the point of breaking. However, she never actually murders Taylor's friends. At this point there is no reason not to, except for keeping them for the future.  Also, she deliberately mentions her only weakness - suffocation. She makes a point of mentioning it, even. Why give your enemy an explanation of your weakness when they are someone who is gifted in using that sort of thing?  Now let's look at how this ends.  Taylor does join the wards but in an extreme probationary status with a therapist she desperately needed from Day 1. Alexandria's body is taken over by Pretender, who forsakes the protectorate for Cauldron. Pretender continues Alexandria's fight. Also Tagg dies but that's just a bonus (btw my dream Tagg casting is Steve Carell. Just throwing that out there. Picture him when you read Tagg's lines it works)  Alexandria is wicked smaht, as I said. She knew that Cauldron capes were being suspected. She knew about Pretender and his abilities. She knew all about Taylor. So there are two options -   A character established to be a genius fucks up royally and uniquely and manages to be in one of the only situations that would lead to her being brain dead but with a perfectly functional body. A genius who loses everything but feels needed for the fight manages to contrive things so that she can die but still be useful to the fight she believes in.   I lean towards the second option.  TLDR Alexandria is too smart to be so stupid. I think Wildbow is a better author than that."
Parahumans,38x5gs,pitaenigma,2,Mon Jun 8 08:43:40 2015 UTC,"I think she might have thought Skitter would stop short of killing her, since Taylor has always been very hesitant to kill.  Tagg and Alexandria were out of nowhere."

Parahumans,38ucw3,Subrosian_Smithy,13,Sat Jun 6 22:23:45 2015 UTC,hmmmm you guys are probably right but the only thing that gets me is crawlers regeneration seems more absolute and the defensive measures too.  I mean that one clone that the azazel killed developed a nano blade attachment and that shit cut through leviathan
Parahumans,38ucw3,V3nomoose,21,Sat Jun 6 22:33:07 2015 UTC,"The thing that would settle it in my mind is Crawler is reactive, while Lung just keeps scaling up. Once you hit Crawler with something he comes up with a defense against it for the future, and he doesn't naturally come up with any offense (it's always happenstance in the process of gaining more defense). Contrary to that, give Lung a couple of hours alone and he'll just get bigger, faster, stronger, hotter, and all around meaner. His survivability is nil up front, but if he get's that time to charge he's nigh-invulnerable.  In a lot of ways it depends on the situation you put this in. If it's base-human Crawler and base-human Lung, as long as Lung knows that he needs to kill Crawler in one attack, he's going to reach that deadly critical mass a lot faster. If instead you're taking Crawler normally as of his 'death' and Lung normally at the same time, Crawler is likely going to kill Lung by accident before he has a chance to do anything.  But really, given who we know these two are, I think the fight would end itself before either one dies. Crawler wants to wait for Lung to keep getting stronger so he can keep getting hurt, and Lung desperately wants to prove himself as stronger than anyone so would probably let Crawler get to at least a sufficiently durable point. Both of them keep throwing nukes at each other and they'd both be basically invulnerable after a point.  I mean Crawler can survive Scrub blasts and nano-thorn attacks, but Lung can become so powerful he just passively melts an Endbringer and scares someone who is legitimately invulnerable (and also ridiculously intelligent, so that isn't blind fear). There isn't even anything promising that's the height of power that Lung could reach. Just like with the Leviathan fight though, eventually the world itself is going to give up. Crawler and Lung will just be blasted apart with nowhere left to fight at."
Parahumans,38ucw3,GreatWyrmGold,-1,Sat Jun 6 23:38:36 2015 UTC,"Contrary to that, give Lung a couple of hours alone and he'll just get bigger, faster, stronger, hotter, and all around meaner. His survivability is nil up front, but if he get's that time to charge he's nigh-invulnerable.   You didn't pay much attention to how Lung's power works, did you? He has to be fighting to get the buff. Sure, if circumstances are arranged so he has enough time to charge up to Endbringer power, he'd win...but that's obvious, and it doesn't seem to be what the OP is asking."
Parahumans,38ucw3,V3nomoose,16,Sun Jun 7 00:00:18 2015 UTC,"I meant left alone as in ""Crawler isn't busy eating his leg,"" not actually sitting in a quiet room somewhere. In the Leviathan fight Lung kind of just stands on the sidelines and waits for himself to charge a while before jumping in.   With that very thought, his power started stirring into effect.  The scales began growing, slowly but surely, bristling like a sea urchin’s spines as they arranged themselves.  The very anticipation of the fight was serving to fuel his abilities.  When he changed, it would be rapid, accelerated by the sheer threat his opponent posed.   And the thing is, Crawler would give Lung the time to charge. He's that kind of monster. If he didn't though, then it isn't even a question. Crawler can literally just slowly walk over to Lung and sit on him. Wouldn't even need to attack. A Lung not given time to charge up is nothing to anybody who can actually kill a big strong dude in a reasonable timeframe."
Parahumans,38ucw3,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Crawler might be willing to wait until Lung could hurt him, but not a minute more, and it would be several minutes, minimum, between when Lung could hurt Crawler and when Lung could kill Crawler.

Parahumans,38ucw3,Ranku_Abadeer,2,Sun Jun 7 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"true, but one thing is that he can hold his power back and cause his transformation to be faster when he lets it go. he could hold himself back a while with the implicit threat of crawler to push his transformation fast enough to be able to take crawler. granted, that would take a while, and crawler isn't really known for his patience i'll give you that.  i guess, given what we know about crawler, he would probably let lung get strong, even in a deathbattle style fight (no prep, only canon knowledge of opponent, fight to the death, no holds barred) and like with the bombing run, that might be his downfall. i could see crawler toying with lung to get him strong enough to hurt him.   really i think that it would depend on lung. does he charge into the fight? does he let it stew before starting his transformation? and when he starts transforming, does he continue to fight to hurt crawler or does he pull his punches enough to keep him interested while letting himself transform enough to possible kill him?"

Parahumans,38ucw3,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"True enough, but what attacks would he use to kill Crawler? If he could avoid hurting Crawler until his flames were hot enough to burn Crawler to a crisp in one shot, he would win...but I don't see that happening. If part of Crawler burns and he regenerates, he's stronger against flame. If Lung then exposes Crawler to plasma, he'll melt partly, but he'd probably regenerate given how often he's surely been exposed to flames.  Some capes could hold back their trump card until it was charged up enough for the finishing blow. Lung isn't one of those capes."

And why would eating Crawler do anything to him? It seems like something he'd regret in about ten minutes when his power stopped wearing off."
Parahumans,38ucw3,V3nomoose,0,Sun Jun 7 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"If you had told me that there was a hero who's power was getting bigger and stronger I wouldn't have assumed they'd wind up with a weird circle mouth, a bunch of scales, or giant wings. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have called any of those either. Given that his body has undergone a number of strange modifications already I don't see why it's so unlikely that there's another one, and probably one past that, and probably another after that... We don't know what the upper limit of Lung's power is or the sum total of changes it brings on, so it seems odd to assume it just stops progressing shortly after what we've seen. He already has Breaker powers, transferring that in some way to a bodily fluid doesn't seem nearly as far a leap for a new advance as you seem to think.  As for the eating, Crawler regenerates, he isn't immortal. It's very in the air about just how much damage needs to be done, but generally speaking going through the digestive system tends to break things down pretty well. That is what it's built for. Maybe Crawler's regen can cover that, but it's quite possible it would wound up overloaded by being torn about, crushed, intensely burned, and then subjected to actually going through Lung's digestive tract. Assuming Crawler survived all that yeah he'd just come back even worse, but since we don't know what the actual kill threshold for Crawler is, it's really hard to say.  Anyway, both are just examples of the sort's of things that maybe would be a possibility for Lung. Again, this isn't just a hypothetical situation, it's a hypothetical situation between two characters we know very little about the limits of. I threw out some possibilities that sounded reasonable because I can't very well make a deduction about what would kill Crawler when I don't know how strong Crawler's regen is when tested, how fast it works, how much it takes to kill him, how he adapts to different situations, or how quickly he takes on those adaptions. Maybe getting torn into enough pieces would do it, who knows."
Parahumans,38ucw3,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sun Jun 7 01:19:51 2015 UTC,"The difference is that we see shades of all that right from the start. He gets a bunch of scales and other inhuman features right from the first time we see Lung fight, but we never see any evidence of Trump effects, acid, or colonic primates in his fights. There's no reason to assume there is, so we shouldn't, any more than we should assume Tattletale could take over Eidolon's mind if she kissed him.  The digestive system does damage very slowly. Crawler regenerates very quickly, and if he was able to be damaged by the stomach's hydrochloric acid in the first place (I'd imagine he'd render himself immune to his own, concentrated acid as soon as he had half an hour alone with it), he'd grow more and more resistant to it as he regenerated from it. Crawler's regeneration wasn't overloaded by having his brain and most of his head scrubbed from reality, why would a little acid and some muscular action overload it?  We see an example of what Crawler's regeneration can recover from, and how fast, when he fights Scrub and the rest of the Merchants alongside his teammates. We see two Crawlers die, one from having his whole body instantly turned to glass, the other from having his whole body cut apart at a molecular level nanothorns at once. It's a pretty safe bet that anything that kills Crawler would need to destroy or neutralize every part of his body. Getting torn to pieces wouldn't work, certainly not if only Lung was tearing apart; Crawler would regenerate most of what was torn off before he could get a grip on the half that regenerated."

Parahumans,38ucw3,malgalad,3,Sat Jun 6 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"Sudancer is... eh, Sundancer. Off the top of my head:    Sundancer is Manton-limited and can't drive her sun directly into living flesh, and Crawler can withstand heat in proximity. Sundancer is too sweet and can't kill a person fast enough (Echidna was already heavily damaged and doesn't have the same defenses).   If Lung uses flames-flames-flames, then BAM! - plasma magyyks... if he can burn the hulk before it regenerates, Crawler's gone. Remember - it's not that Crawler suddenly gets immunity to attacks, it's only his new flesh that gets it, so Crawler will need to succumb his body part by part, slowly, to allow burned parts to regenerate. And Lung isn't dumb."
Parahumans,38ucw3,Ranku_Abadeer,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"you have to remember, in the top form that we saw, lung's fire gets strong enough that both alexandria and leviathan shy away from it. and one of those has been explicitly shown hiding inside sundancer's sun for at least 2 minutes.  plus, when lung grew his wings, he was able to shut sundancer down in terms of pyrokinetic strength.  so, so long as lung isn't stupid enough to keep throwing fire at the ""what doesn't kill me makes me stronger"" regenerator, then maybe he can beat him once his powers get strong enough."
Parahumans,38ucw3,cephalord,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:08:13 2015 UTC,"Leviathan shying away means very little. We know from WoG that nothing Lung could throw at him could meaningfully harm him (galaxy spiral worth of mass being only one thing). It is likely to be Levi faking it. Likewise, Alexandria shying away can mean a lot of things. Like wildbow has said; it is very hard for brutes to know their limits. We know now that Alexandria can survive sundancer's sun, but she probably didn't. Just because she is hesitant about Lung's fire doesn't mean it would harm her (maybe it would just burn her clothes and she would be revealed as Costa-Brown).  You're right about it, but Lung at one point gets a fiery aura (although you could argue whether that is an active or passive effect, I read it as passive) that Crawler could abuse to build up tolerance.  Too many things to say for sure either way I guess."
Parahumans,38ucw3,Ranku_Abadeer,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"well i point out levaithan since that is the only time other than scion that anyone has gone 1v1 an endbringer and come out on top (i believe that lung's power going away was because he hit levaithan's power stopping core)  and there's no way that crawler would be able to keep up with that if lung plays it smart. (plus, i'm not sure, but i think at that point lung healed faster than crawler does)  also i did forget about the aura, like you said, you can't be sure, but i think you right about it being passive at some point.  alexandria though, by that point had only almost been hurt by behemoth since the siberian hadn't shown up, so i was trying to say that his fire's are intense enough that she was shying away before she had ever taken an injury. (then again, he had about an entire ocean turning to steam when it got close to him, so it's obvious that there wasn't much oxygen around him, and a lack of oxygen is her only real weakness.)  there are way too many variables on this."
Parahumans,38ucw3,cephalord,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:36:12 2015 UTC,"I believe wildbow confirmed that Lung's power went away because his shard decides what counts as combat or not, and the shard decided not to continue this fight because it didn't want to. The shard might decide that Crawler is not that much of a threat and never give Lung the power to crisp him completely. Or it might, we don't know."

Look at Noelle or the Bitch epilogue chapter for what a shard does when it's really unleashed - depending on the host, the nature of the unleashed power can vary, specializing as it develops toward a task/specific implementation.  Grue's power would just spew darkness out in very direction to pretty much blanket and isolate an entire city, his body would become a vehicle for the power, and he'd mutate, quite possibly turning the 'tap into other passengers' ability into a link to just absorb power. Broken/dead shard, he'd continue doing so until those passengers lashed out, creating isolated, power-based effects/chunks of Grue in the midst of the city.  Tattletale's power would just scale up constantly in power, reach, and intensity of detail. The shard might not have broken 100% clean - Scion might have given it some tools somewhere in there, so I can imagine a Tattletale-sub-entity scaling up to a breaker state or tapping into a tinker ability to network/develop more hardware/brainware to process it all. Scale up to processing multiple dimensions at once, and develop/manifest/obtain a weapon. Going back to the tools Scion gave, a simple blaster power with a clean, possibly invisble terrain-penetrating laser, with Full-bore-tattletale focus at work to discern the best possible weak point? Or even just a Tattletale in the middle of it, holding a gun? Picture her systematically picking off threats one after another, from highest priority to lowest, from the center of the incident sites, maximum range.  Basically, you unshackle, the power scales up, the mind/body start to break down, and if the host is lucky, the shard can provide some means of housing the new data and form.  Standalone, without a host, the manifestation for the shard itself confronted in its own world, would be very similar in execution.   Also relevant on what was originally going to happen post Leviathan.   When it came to this arc [Extermination], though, I rolled dice. Barring those who stayed out of the fight, I rolled to see if they lived or died. Just went through the cast as it had formed, to date, and rolled for every participating cape, then worked in their deaths as was possible.   ~   Stopping Leviathan from attacking the shelter. Getting hit. Slowly blacking out while watching Scion and Rachel arrive to fight Leviathan. Rachel's anger, as people approach, crowding her and Taylor. Civilian pulling off Taylor's mask to administer CPR, while Taylor stares up at Mr. Gladly, who is looking down. The person giving CPR gives up after the first chest compression, as shattered ribs crumble, holds Taylor's hand instead. Mr. Gladly says something.  Fade to black.  The sacrifice is remembered, noted, and kept track of, with ripple effects throughout. Even as more heroes arrive to stabilize Brockton Bay, there's an undercurrent of discussion about the hero/villain line. Armsmaster is back in charge, but people are questioning how her situation was handled. Our new protagonist is a Ward (was planning Aegis, but he rolled bad, so new Ward), and the growing discussion amid a ruined city makes for a crisis of faith."

Parahumans,38q3li,Yglorba,15,Sat Jun 6 06:35:46 2015 UTC,I guess Imp could make Scion forget they existed? And Tattletale did quite a bit to stop Scion just with her regular power?

Parahumans,38q3li,ughzubat,15,Sat Jun 6 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that there's no indication that Taylor needed to unshackle her power to beat Scion. The key insights to beat Scion were that they had to psychologically manipulate him into voluntarily taking a hit, and that they could do it by making Eden-lookalikes to torment him. Those insights came from Taylor in the Eden cave (pre-Khepri) and Tattletale, and were first tried by the Bitch-Panacea combo, all entirely outside Khepri's control.     Yes, making that hit count depended on the knowledge and resources Taylor had gained as Khepri (discovering that Foil could open up Scion for critical damage if she hit, and getting the Tinkers to work together on a superweapon to deliver the big blow). But it's possible that the capes could have discovered that on their own in time. And without Khepri pulling all the capes together for Scion to target at once, they might have had more time to figure it out. Heck, Dinah said there was a good chance there'd be millions of survivors even on Earth Bet, so even if they can't kill Scion right away the few survivors could try to rebuild and get revenge months or years later.     So I expect that with a different protagonist we'd see a longer, more drawn-out battle, possibly without any unshackled powers. Rather than a single last stand with all the gathered capes fighting under the command of Khepri's central administrator, we might see a small, ragtag group of capes hiding in a far off dimension (or e.g. moon base). They spend a week or two building a superweapon and frantically debating strategy, trying to avoid Scion's attention while he scours the Earths. All leading to a climactic confrontation when Scion finds them and they have to fight."

He could fly, but his invulnerability came in the form of adaptive regeneration - take out his heart, and his ribs start pumping blood, rip out his lungs, and he absorbs oxygen through his skin, etc - but also a minor healing effect, so he would eventually go back to normal instead of becoming a flying version of Crawler (Panacea sped up the process).   He swapped costumes with Clockblocker before the Wards attempted to stop the Undersiders' bank robbery, if that rings any bells."

They bait the butcher into her aura, provoking Butcher to suicide. Because the suicide was a direct result of Cherish's parahuman power, the Butcher shard herp-derped over to the aforementioned small box to make Cherish's remaining lifespan even more miserable than before."
Parahumans,38p4m6,Gnimhey,32,Fri Jun 5 18:05:47 2015 UTC,This was sort of foreshadowed earlier when it was mentioned off-hand that a section of the coast was off-limits because everyone who went near it felt a suicidal despair.

I'm headcanoning that Butcher's shard might even be like the Spirits of Karma, and not really peg ""suicide induced by emotion manipulation"" as a valid condition for transfer.  And if so, I hardly think it would transfer to whoever towed the box to six kilometres of water and let it sink; should Butcher XVI(?) ever break out and get crushed by benthic pressures."

It doesn't make them a better person or redeem them, it doesn't undo any of the bad things they did before. In Cherishes case, it doesn't even do a good job of keeping other people safe, if the huge aura of self-loathing is any indication.  It's just senseless torture. And even if Cherish doesn't deserve to be free (she probably doesn't),I think she deserves a mercy-kill."
Parahumans,38p4m6,Subrosian_Smithy,2,Sat Jun 6 19:54:40 2015 UTC,"There are so many people to feel sorry for in Worm that Cherish hardly even registers. Sure what happened to her is terrible but she is actively inviting it, less poking at a hornets nest than jumping in a wolf den and trying to piss off all the wolves. She isn't even as bad off as a victim of Gray Boy.   Ultimately I think what happened to Cherish is terrible and shouldn't happen to anyone but it is merely a note on a list full of terrible things that shouldn't happen to anyone."
Parahumans,38p4m6,wiikipedia,3,Sun Jun 7 00:58:11 2015 UTC,I wonder if dragon could kill her and not get the minds of the other butchers.

Parahumans,38p4m6,Valthek,3,Sat Jun 6 10:45:54 2015 UTC,Addressed in story. You don't have to be a parahuman to get the Butcher's shard/power.  Though I guess it wasn't specifically said the non-cape lacked potential...
Parahumans,38p4m6,DarkDaemon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"In theory. There are suggestions that Butcher's mind replaces the new host's, rather than supplementing it."
Parahumans,38p4m6,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat Jun 6 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"It's actually left ambiguous whether Cherish became the new Butcher, or whether the Butcher's suicide broke the chain by preventing the power from passing on to a new host. It's possible that the Butcher power didn't treat Cherish as the killer. Either because it doesn't count suicides as kills (even if they're power-assisted), or because Cherish hit Butcher with a passive effect rather than an intentional attack, or because the Butcher shard took one look at Cherish's broken body trapped in a containment sphere and noped the hell out of there.  In any case, we can forgive the capes for being cautious and not digging her up to ask."

Parahumans,38lwmh,ShaggyPKA,72,Fri Jun 5 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"If you look at the comments, I get into why.  But the long and short of it was that it was too much/continued tension at a point where the story needed to stop and take a break.  The fear of readers at that point in time was that things would continue escalating and never stop to breathe (much as we see in Pact).  The secondary problem was that Witness required two offscreen events to be brought into being, and to be a legitimate, long-running threat, required Faultline & Weld both to handle the idiot ball, when they'd been previously established as intelligent and discerning."
Parahumans,38lwmh,Wildbow,31,Fri Jun 5 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"Haha what a cool feeling. How often do you post a question online about a book and then have the author himself respond in 4 minutes? What makes Worm one of the best works I've ever read are the extra details you provide to make the story more vivid. It's not just Taylor interacting with a bunch of 2D characters. Instead, all the characters seem deep. I think that's why this interlude was so great...we got to hear more about Shatterbird while also moving other characters (Vista and Witness) forward. Hopefully you can squeeze more on S.B.'s background / details of her death in somewhere else during The Edit.   I didn't think that Faultline and Weld seemed particularly dumb during this interlude...Witness was deformed and neither had seen T.T. unmasked to make the connection. I do appreciate you wanting to cut the tension though.  Reading this interlude makes me realize how much I want more Worm in my life. Looking forward to the sequel and to one day having a copy of The Edit on my bookshelf."

Parahumans,38lwmh,Rillet,14,Sat Jun 6 23:28:07 2015 UTC,I think part of the problem was that Wildbow has added so many (admittedly interesting) tangents to his story he has to cut back somewhere. Worm from a structural/progression stance is something of a mess. Can't blame him for trimming something he felt should be trimmed.
Parahumans,38lwmh,V3nomoose,11,Fri Jun 5 04:05:03 2015 UTC,"The world is so interesting and there's so much going on, but it's still fundamentally a story about Taylor's journey. I could read an entire book about almost any character in the world Wildbow created and love it, but a lot of them should be exactly that, a book of it's own. Worm wound up pretty heavy with a lot of side stories that are awesome and well-written and fill in the world a ton, but aren't really necessary for Taylor's story."

Parahumans,38iqx6,GreatWyrmGold,9,Fri Jun 5 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know that magic missile is the best spell analogy, as it does a single thing, and that's hit every time and do damage. Taylor's power is considerably more versatile. Maybe something more like prestidigitation, or something, if it did damage. Hell, I dunno."
Parahumans,38iqx6,Elec0,3,Fri Jun 5 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe, but the specific phenomenon mentioned is more easily interpreted through a spell that does a little damage. I mean, technically, there isn't even any kind of damage reduction that applies to magic missile."
Parahumans,38iqx6,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri Jun 5 03:31:23 2015 UTC,the Shield spell sort of counts; immunity to Magic missle and an AC buff.

Parahumans,38klfw,Wildbow,7,Thu Jun 4 22:39:48 2015 UTC,This seems like an awesome game.  I always assumed it was just something mentioned in passing. The fact that you literally created mechanics for a game that appears in like three chapters blows my mind.
Parahumans,38klfw,Spudwebster1291,5,Thu Jun 4 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, you really did think through everything you put into Worm."
Parahumans,38klfw,pendia,6,Thu Jun 4 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the answer. Even if (when) this doesn't become anything, I'm at least going to make it as a fan-game. I have a few questions, though I understand if you don't want to talk more about it.  -It seems that branchiness is rather bad for the overlord (why give extra options to the heroes?).  -Can you with 30 Subtlety, say, use a fireball, just with really low damage, range, and speed?  -In your example summons, you have Kobold Mob have a Claim of Mid: what does that mean?  -How do you unlock skills?"
Parahumans,38klfw,Wildbow,9,Fri Jun 5 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"Imagine that you build a branching path.  T shaped path.  Players go down one side, you can choose to extend the other.  If they split up, focus on increasing the difficulty and punishing them.  There would be a great many disciplines, more than the ones listed in the example skill.  But yes, you could maximize one discipline and specialize one feature of a skill.  Claim is discovery.  Basically, dropping the Kobold Mob might 'discover' up 1/7th of a room, making it so you can't place further creatures in that part of the room.  Basically, every month or so, there'd be a release of one booster pack (Say, the Haunted Grave booster) that the Overlord could pick (they start with a custom deck of cards, then pick a few boosters with random cards that mix it up a little), and a class for the players.  For an example class, imagine the following...   Armsmaster A weapon collector in the extreme, this heavily armored combatant is a walking weapon rack, emphasizing battlefield control and punishing the enemy if the pressure isn't maintained, specializes in player vs. player combat and AoE.  Weapon - Long Blade (Long prefix extends reach for melee swings) Weapon (dual) - Broadsword (Broad prefix extends swing arc for melee)  Weapon Laden Plate (Chest, legs, limb) - Starting armor expands # of weapons one can carry and toggle between.  Notched Bracer (Starting Accessory) - Deals less damage, but every five swings is an AoE hit.  Six-Scabbard Belt (Starting Belt) - +1 weapon slot, grants boost to damage on next swing on drawing a new weapon, boost doubled if weapon was picked up from the ground.  Has 4 slots for belt items.  Ironman, Passive Skill - Gain charges for every attack, offensive skill, and every 50 damage taken.  At 20 charges, refresh armor and become a caster with iron magic skills instead of existing skills.  Can use a rune with this to stack elemental effects (ie. Iron + Fire), revert after X seconds, keeping renewed armor.  Wounding Slash - Melee swing deals %hp damage, stronger against big monsters, wounds enemy players. (Disciplines: Wound, Arms, Blood)  Throw Weapon - Disarm self.  Weapon is thrown for high damage, high impact hit.  Weapon can be retrieved from ground.  Can combine with runes. (Disciplines: Weapon, Iron, Brave)  Cross Weapons - Hurls self at foe, paralyzing both self & foe for duration.  Enemy players can break hold at cost of being lightly hurt and disarmed. (Disciplines: Arms, Weapon, Strength)  Weapon Rune - Rune, combines with spell finishers to cast a Weapon spell (ie. Weapon Rune + Volley finisher = Weapon Volley).  High damage, leaves scattered weapons embedded in ground.  Armed individuals passing through are wounded, unarmed individuals pick up a cheap weapon.  Used alone (cast twice in succession), enlarges weapon, extending reach and swing arc. (Disciplines: Iron, Weapon, Rune)  Eviscerating Blow - Delivers heavy damage based on how hurt foe is, plus more if foe is wounded, staggered, disarmed, or has cracked armor.  You are left reeling post-attack if foe is not killed, but heal if they are. (Disciplines: Wound, Weapon, Victory)  (Recommended Disciplines: Arms, Weapon, Wound, Iron)   This class is unlocked for everyone.  It comes as a complete package.  But if you spend enough time playing it or getting experience with it, you unlock a smattering of variant packages (Weaponmaster and Garrison), and unlock the individual assets; Starting gear, passive, and skills.  Players could pay for an instant unlock.  After that, playing a class or using its skills on an ongoing basis to 'master' it would earn titles, avatar decorations (like a nice face scar for the Armsmaster), icons and other cosmetic features.  Later on, you can throw together your own class.  You might want to use the crossover of the wound and blood disciplines (See Wounding Slash, above) with a lot of the Cutthroat skills, for example, or take the Pyromancer package, remove the fire rune from the build and swap in the weapon rune to start casting weapon spells instead of fire spells.  At the competitive level, the assumption would be that everyone is making their own custom classes, going in.  Now, there are only so many points to spread across disciplines.  You'd probably main one or two and maybe have a smattering in another by max level.  This is where Cody gets on Krouse's case for spreading points too thin."

The amount of detail you've put in is amazing - I now understand why you wouldn't want to license it, having already finished everything but the actual details.

Parahumans,38klfw,coderman9,2,Tue Jun 9 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"When I do classes, to keep them distinct, I use keywords.  The heavy classes use a combination of two of the following keywords:   Threat - They're dangerous in melee, making use of their natural and skill-derived durability to dish out a lot of damage before dropping dead.  They make enemy players want to kill them by doing a lot of damage if left alone. (Champion, Knight, Armsmaster, Brute & Barbarian) Protect - They peel for allies and reduce damage allies take, as well as effectively getting between allies and threats. (Bastion, Knight, Thane, Interceptor, Enforcer) Battlefield - Battlefield control.  Make it harder for enemies to maneuver or position, or deliver lots of AoE. (Commander, Armsmaster, Thane, Warden, Despot/Blackguard) Vanguard - These guys are the first ones into the fray.  They leap, charge, hurl themselves at the enemy, then absorb and deal a lot of damage while setting up enemies for allies to finish off. (Charger, Brute, Interceptor, Warden, Cavalier) Taunt - These guys use warcries and battlecries to bait or force enemies into attacking them, or effectively force enemies to keep fighting them. (Challenger, Barbarian, Enforcer, Despot/Blackguard, Cavalier)   Bolded ones are the exemplars of that role (ie. Threat + Threat, Taunt + Taunt).  Others are cross-role and thus appear under two keywords.  Brute is thus Threat + Vanguard.  Hurls self into the fray and deals a lot of damage.  Lots of HP, big, smashes things around and shoves them.  Gear and skills build on this theme; starting weapon modifier is 'Heavy', +impact (knockback, armor pen), -attack speed.  Armor offers little armor but big HP increase, belt item upgrades items to 'oversize', vastly increasing their efficacy while making consumption/use slower and interruptable by any damage.  Skills include a leap with AoE damage on landing, and smash/bash/thrash, which respectively damage armor/deliver impact/make the enemy more vulnerable to subsequent smash/bash/thrashes.  When the skill is used, it randomizes to one of the three, forcing some improvisation, depending on which of the three is gained.  Can be put on the skill bar multiple times.  Cavalier isn't as fleshed out (no checkmark on the list I gave you), but you can intuit some of it.  Keywords are Vanguard and Taunt.  They hurl themselves forward and pick off key enemies that threaten the team, drawing attention with powerful taunts that may break if another ally attacks that enemy.  Successfully challenging and defeating enemies may grant short lived bonuses, allowing moments of glory when a series of challenges are made and end with victory.  On the other hand, is not terribly effective against mobs of creatures, and the chain of victories might be broken by overlord interference or a mistake on the player's part."
Parahumans,38klfw,pendia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:02:34 2015 UTC,Oops sorry thought I saw a check-mark on the list. I hope I didn't inconvenience you.  Edit You said for Heavy classes they use two of the following keywords is it different for other classes?  Also while I (hopefully) have your attention it's an awesome game and was a joy to look through.

Another ""invulnerable"" super heroine who is part of an up-n'-coming new group that is independent of the government. She has a penchant for being entirely too rough on criminals but her woowoohealyhands sister is usually there to help.  Watches her family get ripped apart by Leviathan.   Had a falling out with her sister when the past/true feelings came to light. Problem was exacerbated when Panacea sorta-kinda accidentally altered her brain chemistry to make her able to reciprocate those feelings. Refused to have anything to do with Panacea afterward.  Slaughterhouse Nine messed her up BIG TIME and she was forced to accept her sister's healing. Panacea was still mentally unstable and ended up going too far, rendering GG a blob of flesh and bone.   Gets put into a sanitarium for parahumans and begins therapy with everyone's favorite doctor.   Is mentioned in passing as Khepri begins collecting capes for the final showdown.   I don't recall if she's mentioned after that. Apologies for the shitty summary, it's been almost a year since I finished reading so I've probably missed a good bit."

""I'm sorry,"" John said.  ""It won't help,"" warned the bound man. ""My assets are diverse, and my portfolio is unassailable.

Parahumans,38fn8t,0voidwhisper0,2,Sat Jun 6 11:10:33 2015 UTC,"Thus, a more forward-thinking Practitioner would select a peripheral device (such as a mouse, pair of headphones, or a stylus) which could potentially be used with any future computers the Practitioner may own.   I don't think this is enough, and it is also too much. Mice are less common in the general public, due to people using tablets etc with touch screens as their main device. Mice are still commonly used by people who commonly use desktops/laptops, but that group of people is shrinking down to gamers, programmers, and similar. Mice might be less quickly being outdated, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was functional eye-tracking devices on the market in the next 10-20 years, which even those most invested in mice could move to. Even then, there are other ways it can be outdated - newer mice may have better DPI or other things. Also, many mice use the USB slot - that wasn't true 10-20 years ago. Your mouse implement might be perfectly functional, but it only functions with a computer which has a 20 year old slot.  But also, what can you do with a mouse? You can use a computer. That's a VERY narrow thing for your implement to be stuck as. Some of the best implements seem to functions multiple roles - Alistair's cards come to mind. Computermancy might sound cool, but there is only so much that can do when an oldschool dragon comes to town. Magic users in Pact need to be able to deal with others, and many of them don't use electronic devices, so being able to control them isn't that useful against them.  Similarly with headphones - maybe in 10 years they will all have USB slots, or be wireless, or have better sound quality, or have some other sort of new feature we don't even know about yet. But you are still specialized in something which only produces sound for yourself.  A stylus has all the same problems as a mouse, but also is unnecessary (you can use a touch screen without one), and is even less likely to survive technology such as eye tracking."
Parahumans,38fn8t,pendia,5,Wed Jun 3 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"USB has been accepted as standard for data transfer and charging mobile devices; it's probably going to be around for quite a while. Certainly longer than the hardware inside the computers we're typing this on.  And I don't think a mouse Implement would restrict you to ""computermancy,"" any more than a chalice restricts you to ""drinkamancy,"" a sword restricts you to ""stabbomancy,"" or a talisman restricts you to...um...I don't even know."
Parahumans,38fn8t,pendia,4,Thu Jun 4 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"USB 1.0 came out 19 years ago IIRC. There is no way that you can be sure that it will be the standard for another 19 years. Maybe in 5 years USB 4.0 is out, and they figure that no one uses USB 2.0 anymore and they don't make it backwards compatible. Another 10 years and they outs USB 3.0. Or maybe wireless gets good enough that no one uses wires for data transfer, and inductive charging takes off so you don't need USB for charging. Maybe they figure out quantum computing and no one uses digital anymore. Do you really think you can predict electronics at the rate its advancing?  Chalices have other connotations to them other than drinking. Where do you drink from a chalice? A fancy party. What happens at such parties? Socializing, connections forming, manipulation, etc etc. Hence the use of a chalice as an implement is more general than their actual use. But mice are like swords - they are made for one purpose. And swords ARE restrictive - IIRC there is something in the same chapter talking about how young guys get them and find there is no actual use for them. The exception is Japanese practitioners who use swords which have other symbolism attached with them - but mice don't have centuries of power stored up via symbolism that you can access."

Parahumans,38fn8t,cephalord,3,Thu Jun 4 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of peripherals is on the right track, but isn't going far enough. To me, the ideal technological implement is one of the classic implements with a modernized twist to it. The Sword becomes the Pistol, the Tome becomes the Hard Drive, the Trumpet is now the Amp, etc. etc.  The new forms imply much the same that the old ones do, but add the understanding of modernity and pragmatism to their declarative meaning, while at the same time bringing the practitioner's focus to an even sharper level. This has the side effect of making their working weaker than normal when trying to produce certain effects. The really strong instances of modernized however are things like Cameras, objects that previously existed but where the transition to a digital form was almost seamless. In these cases very little declarative and authoritative meaning is lost while huge additional capabilities are gained with computers being the peripheral to the implement rather than the other way around."
Parahumans,38fn8t,pseudonarne,2,Thu Jun 4 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Even peripherals go obsolete at a pretty high rate, even if it's not quite as fast as a complete device. USB is pretty widely accepted today, but so were PS2 keyboards and mice when I received my first desktop. Now, based on Ainsley's candle there's some precedent that implements can be renewed in various fashions when they get worn out, but I'm hesitant to count on that for something as complex and unambiguous as hardware compatibility.   There's also the unexplained derision Blake got for using an off-the-shelf axe to bind the ice ghost when he took it to meet Conquest the first time. Unprocessed materials, or hand-made objects, or some similar factor may make magical objects more powerful- possibly just due to style points with the spirits, but if it works why split hairs? Whatever the exact criteria are, it would be awfully difficult to meet them with mass-market consumer electronics, peripheral or otherwise."
Parahumans,38fn8t,0voidwhisper0,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"USB seems to be at that point where it's too widely-accepted to go away.

(Definitely longer than any computer you're going to buy.)  I hadn't considered that part. Perhaps a computer you made yourself would work better? You could probably even upgrade it, though there's probably no way to know how an Implement of Theseus would work."

Parahumans,38ectz,pendia,16,Thu Jun 4 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"The answer is, as Wildbow would probably put it, 'yes'. Taylor's subconscious probably generated the idea of a replica staying behind to confused enemies, and the shard took that idea, compared it to what other users of the shard had done, and decided it was a good one and ran with it, using the information it already had to pull off the trick.

They attack the remnants of E88, and Regent mindcontrols Victor. Tattletale suspects Coil will betray them. The Undersiders continue to solidify control of their territories, and some Travelers and Skitter attack the mayor. Two capes are there, one of which is the mayor's son, and Skitter nearly suffocates one. The mayor agrees not to condemn BB. Skitter evacs a injured Trickster.  Dragon sends in a bunch of suits to deal with them. The suits are specially designed to fight each of them. Skitter persuades Coil to let Dinah go if they succeed. They kidnap the PRT director for information, and eventually beat the suits. The groups relax for a couple of days. Taylor attends the mayor's debate with her dad, but Coil attacks, killing two candidates, the PRT director, and faking his death. Skitter is blinded, and her dad is injured. They meet Coil, who is revealed to be the incoming PRT director. He agrees to release Dinah. Coil springs a trap with Leet's tech, teleporting Skitter away, and trying to kill her in his base. She survives, taking out a good deal of his crew, and runs to find the Undersiders. She finds a lookalike, who also seems to have bug control. The lookalike and Dinah disappear, and the Undersiders nearly kill actual Skitter, before they find a box that does the bug control. They meet Coil, who plans to have them all shot, but Tattletale bribed them all beforehand, and Skitter shoots Coil instead.   An arc describing the Traveler's backstory follows. They were a gaming club on Aleph, teleported to Bet by the Simurgh. One member is instantly killed, and Noellle is severely injured. They spend several days in her scream, kill some Case 53's, and find and drink Cauldron power granting vials. Noelle and Oliver only take half each, but Noelle power goes out of control, and turns her into a massive flesh-eating clone monster. They manage to escape the Simurgh zone. Later, when they become mercenaries, Cody gets cloned three times, interrupting a discussion with the OCD villain Accord, and they give Cody to him.  Noelle, now known as Echidna, breaks out of Coil's facility. She demands the Undersiders, but the heroes don't give them to her. Many heroes show up, including the Triumvirate. Echidna captures Vista first, then a bunch of regular people, unnamed capes, and Regent, making evil, power-altered clones of them. They kill all the clones they can find, and Eidolon tries to solo Echidna, but fails. The Travelers show up, and Trickster joins Echidna, teleporting Eidolon and Alexandria into her reach. Evil Eidolon reveals a bunch of Cauldron secrets, like how they manipulated the PRT and made Case 53's, shocking the assembled capes. Skitter trades herself in for Eidolon. Eventually, most capes are freed, and Skitter and Clockblocker cut Echidna in half, and Sundancer burns her up. Meanwhile, Tattletale organizes some other capes to open a portal to alternate dimensions, letting them send the Traveler's back to Aleph, then leaving the portal to an unnamed alternate Earth.  Taylor goes back to school, which has resumed from after Leviathan, to confront someone who has figured out her identity. She persuades him he got it wrong, and gets Emma suspended. Dragon sends a bunch of capes after her, exposing her identity. She takes down a number of capes outside before Defiant/Dragon corners her. After talking to them, she leaves with a crowd of students protecting her."
Parahumans,38ce2z,gammaway,8,Wed Jun 3 17:10:12 2015 UTC,"The Undersiders attack the PRT and its new director Tagg, a very ruthless man. A number of other villain groups have moved in, including Accord's group. The Undersiders take down the two other groups and ally with Accord's. Taylor turns herself in to the PRT.  They bring in Taylor's dad and Alexandria to negotiate. Taylor demands PRT reform, and Alexandria threatens to kill the Undersiders. After she thinks Alexandria killed Regent and Grue, she manages to suffocate and kill Tagg and Alexandria. She wakes up in another cell, breaks out, and is captured by Dragon and Defiant. They agree to her terms in exchange for her joining the PRT. She renames herself Weaver.  She clears out a Chicago villain group with butterflies, but gets defeated by a mercenary group protecting the former Las Vegas protectorate team, who defected. While on a therapy session, Behemoth attacks India. Cody, having been enslaved into a Chinese paramilitary group, assassinates Accord, nearly killing the Protectorate leader and Tattletale as well. Behemoth rampages toward New Delhi, largely unstopped. Skitter joins the Undersiders and Chicago wards together. They find the Indian underground, and Cauldron evacuating civilians. They attack the Cauldron person, and are stomped. They find out she has Path to Victory, allowing her to ""win""against things that are not Endbringers. Weaver helps evacuate some capes. It turns out Endbringers are always looking for something, and that something here is Phir Se, an Indian cape who has effectively created a supernuke. Skitter betrays a cape that lead her there in order to gain Phir Se's trust, and organizes the remaining capes to get the supernuke to hit Behemoth. Regent sacrifices himself to save Imp. The lightbomb hits, stripping down his outer layers. Behemoth continues to rampage anyway, seemingly unimpaired. Scion shows up and kills Behemoth.  A video of Weaver's actions spreads through the internet. Taylor's media advisor is responsible, and is fired. She more officially joins the Chicago wards. She takes down a villain group, does some media stuff, then Khonsu, a new time-based Endbringer, attacks. They watch as Khonsu teleports around the world attacking random cities. Eventually, with Cauldron and an Indian cape assisting, they manage to fight him off."
Parahumans,38ce2z,gammaway,4,Wed Jun 3 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"And now massive time-skip. Its two years later, just past Dinah's end of the world prophecy, and the S9 have returned. They've cloned all their past and present members 9 times, plus some mashups, minus Jack clones, Bonesaw clones, and one other guys clones.  I forgot to mention last time, an interlude showed that Scion is actually controlled by some random homeless guy, who told Scion to obey some random nice girl, and to kill Endbringers.  Anyway, Theo, the guy who Jack challenged to hunt down and kill him in two years, is with the Chicago Wards. The S9000 kill some random small town, and Weaver, the wards, and the Undersiders come in to examine the scene. They clear up some random clones, and get a message from Jack saying he'll unleash the S9000 all at once if other capes come to help. So the PRT organizes a bunch of kill squads on sightings of S9000 members. Weaver's group goes to kill a bunch of them, and they figure out that Jack is going to Nilbog, a bio-monster maker cape who took over a city in an interlude a while back. Meanwhile, Dragon is growing superstrong, managing multiple suits while scanning the globe for S9000. Saint, someone who monitors Dragon with tools from her creator, shuts her down. Weaver goes to Nilbog, and after some discussion with Jack and Nilbog, everything goes to hell, and the monsters attack Weaver while the S9 teleport away. The heroes retreat, but then fight their way back when they realize they had to follow them through to the teleported location.   Theo goes to hunt down Jack. Cauldron and some other capes show up to help. Dinah starts to help Theo, Theo finds Jack and nearly gets killed, and a random PRT officer takes down Jack.  Scion shows up, and despite the capes best efforts to keep him away, Jack starts talking in his cage, and persuades Scion that he should be a predator. Scion agrees, and blows up the UK.   It turns out Scion is actually a giant dimension-hopping space thing that uses conflict in the powers it gives out to find a counter to entropy. His partner crashlanded on Earth and was killed by the founding members of Cauldron, and Scion became listless, until accepting orders from that homeless guy.  Scion enjoyed killing, and starts blowing stuff up worldwide. He starts fires, cuts off people's limbs, etc. Cauldron calls people in, says its best case scenario. and organizes plan. They release a bunch of capes from the Birdcage, one of whom is called Glaistig Uaine, an insane cape who takes powers from dead people, and Lung too. Weaver frees Shadow Stalker. Capes gather on this oil platform on another world. Scion somehow shows up and kills most of the capes assembled. Taylor loses half her body but survives with the help of a tinker that mutated her into a crab or something. Eidolon and GU are fighting Scion by themselves. GU tells Eidolon that he is stronger than he thinks, Eidolon takes away someones powers and goes back to his old strength, and they actually sort of hurt Scion. Scion uses Path to Victory, and tells Eidolon he is responsible for the Endbringers, making Eidolon give up and die.   Taylor and Tattletale find out the Endbringers are doing nothing. They go over to the Simurgh, and for some reason, she follows them. They arrive at a cape-made city, find Leviathan there and get him to follow their orders as well. The Simurgh turns Leviathan into a super-nano-thorn Endbringer. Cauldron shows up, reveals another group led by a mindcontrol power granter named Teacher(also from the birdcage) has taken Khonsu.  Scion shows up, and the entirety of the assembled capes, and the Simurgh, try to kill him. Lots of them fight, with shiny effects, and they die without really harming Scion.  Weaver and some other capes go to Cauldron's facility, where the Vegas capes and a ton of Case 53's are fighting. Weaver gives a superknife to a ghost cape responsible for Cauldron's facilities, and she defeats the Case 53's. Scion shows up and starts killing Case 53's in holding cells. The Vegas capes are largely willing to help at first, but then turn on them. Weaver beats them, and gets to the bottom of the facility, where Number Man and his clones, a Siberian, and Cauldron's leader are. They go down a hallway full of power vials, and end up in a room where Scion's dead companion is. Scion shows up, the Siberian does nothing to him, Weaver loses her arm to a Case 53, and they drop the facility on top of him to try to slow him down and get away.  When they get back to their main base, Weaver gets Panacea to try to alter her power. It works very well, and lets her mind-control people within a 15 foot radius. Somewhere in that whole Cauldron facility thing, they must have rescued the Cauldron capes that make portals between dimensions and grant something like omniscience. Mindcontrol Taylor, who'll be called Khepri, takes control over them, along with some other nearby capes. She takes over a bunch of Teacher's minions, looking for answers. She doesn't find any, and takes over the Yangban with billions of bugs from other Earths. She goes to get the rest of the Birdcage, and mostly blows up Dragon doing so. Then she arrives back at the main camp, where they are fighting Scion. She takes over everyone there as well, and starts fighting Scion. She does fairly well. Dimension portal guy's power breaks, and Khepri loses control over almost everyone. Glaistig Uaine kills portal guy, Khepri takes over Glaistig Uaine, and starts fighting Scion again. Teacher's minons, some other capes, and Tattletale had built a superweapon on some other Earth, and they distracted Scion with images of his dead companion. They fired the weapon into Scion, and with the help of a cape that makes attacks multiversal(somehow I got through this whole thing without mentioning Parian or Foil), kills Scion.  GU breaks everyone free again, and Imp and her lead Khepri off somewhere, where she faints. When Khepri wakes, Contessa is there, talks to her about her actions, and shoots her twice in the head.  The End."
Parahumans,38ce2z,gammaway,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:16:19 2015 UTC,Could you remind how Khepri got control of the portal cape and the omnipresent cape? Were they there when Panacea changed Taylor?

Parahumans,38ce2z,FireHawkDelta,3,Wed Jun 3 19:30:18 2015 UTC,Up to what arc?
Parahumans,38ce2z,TildeAleph,2,Wed Jun 3 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"I am not sure exactly where I left off, which is part of the reason I wanted the summary.  [SPOILERS]  I got through all of Coil's arcs, and shit with the Endbringers was getting real. I am pretty sure they were somewhere in the process of dealing with Jack and the hundreds of S9 clones."
Parahumans,38ce2z,FireHawkDelta,6,Wed Jun 3 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"Fighting the S9 clones is Arc 26, so do not read anything about Arc 27 or later. Don't even read a summery of Arc 26, just to be safe."
Parahumans,38ce2z,gameboy17,2,Wed Jun 3 20:18:38 2015 UTC,I'd recommend just restarting arc 26 if you don't remember where you are in it. It's easy to get burnt out during this arc but I guarantee everything after arc 27 begins is the best part of Worm. Do you need a summary of the arcs between Echidna and the time skip?
Parahumans,38ce2z,farfromunique,4,Wed Jun 3 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"I think he meant up to what arc do you need summarized, not up to what arc does the mentioned summary go."
Parahumans,38bb92,bakerjake,24,Wed Jun 3 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"are there thinkers that have perfect hindsight on a limited or global basis?   Yes, the Simurgh.   Pretercognition.  Spread out over several targets at once, it serves as her primary sense.  Each target is conceptualized in the context of twelve to eighty years of history.   The amount of information she has access too? Dear god. She 'won' the moment she came into existence."
Parahumans,38bb92,Rillet,13,Wed Jun 3 02:55:16 2015 UTC,"Great point and of course! The Simurgh! Definitely right. But with almost every other Endbringer power, there is a corresponding para human with some similar version of the power. I can't think of other capes with similar postcognition. Simurgh is special in that she operates almost atemporally and is sort of a Rube Goldberg creator as a result just by definition. Curious if there are other unexplored capes with forms of postcognition. Thanks!"
Parahumans,38bb92,TildeAleph,12,Wed Jun 3 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"This doesn't really count, but IIRC Eidolon was hinted to have used a post-cognition power the first time he realized Doctor Mother + Alexandria were lying to him. (edit2: I done goofed). Eidolon actually used post-cognition right before he talked to Jessica Yamada during the Echidna Arc.  Edit: You could also argue that the detective work Defiant did when he was retracing the steps of the S9, that could almost be considered a minor affect of his power. Combined with his prediction algorithm, he could qualify as a minor pretercognitive."
Parahumans,38bb92,wiikipedia,2,Wed Jun 3 05:17:40 2015 UTC,Number man is kind of similar in the minor pretercognitive department.  Interesting point re Eidolon too.
Parahumans,38bb92,wiikipedia,10,Wed Jun 3 19:18:40 2015 UTC,There are probably thinkers with powers similar to what you are thinking but substatially less broken. Just because someone can see past events there is no reason to think they would be able to see all past events. Maybe they could only see past events in the location they are currently in. Or the longer they are holding an object the more of its past they can see. They could be limited by the amount of time they can spend looking before they get headaches or maybe their power could just tell them why an event happened but not how or who. You are correct that perfect postcognition would be massively powerful but just like the Simurgh is the only one with perfect precognition it is also the only one with perfect post cognition.  We do hear a couple of times about the group of thinkers that the Protectorate keeps around to investigate and keep a look out for future problems; there are probably a few postcogs among them since it is not a skill that lends itself well to battle.
Parahumans,38bb92,Subrosian_Smithy,4,Wed Jun 3 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"100% agreed on the range of powers and the likely location of some of them (e.g. protectorate).  It's just interesting the way there is a spectrum of powers for different power types (think the variety of Alexandria class capes, which at some level tops out at Scion as near absurd power class level).  It's clear postcognition exists actively in-story with the Simurgh (hat tip to /u/Rillet) so its absence is somewhat noticeable once I thought about it.  I thought the implications of postcognition were quite interesting to piece out - almost in some ways more interesting than precognition.  Thanks for the thoughts!"
Parahumans,38bb92,TildeAleph,3,Wed Jun 3 04:19:37 2015 UTC,I always liked how Coils power works through precognition but appears to be a completely different power. It is clear that Wildbow put a lot of work into the different ways that powers like that could be modified or used.
Parahumans,38bb92,Cruithne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:13:00 2015 UTC,And then you descend down the rabbit hole of the implied processing power or energy required for such simulations....
Parahumans,38bb92,the_terran,13,Wed Jun 3 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"I would think that this could have REALLY helped prevent the Abaddon encounter from being as ""surprising.""   Well, for the Entities to see Abaddon that way, they'd have to have accurate information for a much wider scope of the universe than we really know they have. PTV, precognition, and other simulation shards weren't shown to reach beyond earth or the solar system, AFAIK.  But these questions, and the ramifications of precog, make me wonder - do Entities try to acausally trade with each other? Roko's Worm?"
Parahumans,38bsqi,legacyman,8,Wed Jun 3 05:03:40 2015 UTC,"Try Weaversdice. If you want a post-Khepri world, Reshdice might work, but there's no interdimensional travel."
Parahumans,38bsqi,helltank1,5,Wed Jun 3 07:27:31 2015 UTC,"Well it's not like the system needs ""interdimensional travel"" as a prerequisite.  You can just be like, oh, there's a doorway over there, on the other side you can see a completely different landscape.  Doesn't need special rules or anything."
Parahumans,38bsqi,pinktieman,4,Wed Jun 3 12:29:04 2015 UTC,I've been running a FATE-based Wormverse RPG for about 3 months. It's working really well.
Parahumans,38bsqi,oliwhail,2,Wed Jun 3 12:45:01 2015 UTC,This sounds super cool. Were there any modifications or house-rules you used that you found helpful?
Parahumans,38bsqi,pinktieman,3,Wed Jun 3 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"I've written up a character creation/skill/stunt guide that's geared specifically toward FATE-based games in the Wormverse that I just send to new players.  Basic FATE character creation, plus a load of homebrewed Skills that aren't normally in FATE, power development happening through Story Stunts/Feats, having people have a Power Trouble as the drive toward conflict... Just a lot of incredibly minor things that I think contribute to making it a great system to run Worm RPGs in."
Parahumans,38bsqi,oliwhail,2,Wed Jun 3 16:29:58 2015 UTC,Do you happen to have it all collected anywhere?
Parahumans,38bsqi,pinktieman,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:37:56 2015 UTC,I can put some things together. What do you need?
Parahumans,38bsqi,oliwhail,2,Thu Jun 4 11:14:45 2015 UTC,The skills list would be awesome. I'm getting a couple of my friends hooked on Worm and I'm looking into  running a game for them this summer :)
Parahumans,38bsqi,pinktieman,2,Thu Jun 4 19:08:21 2015 UTC,I'll type them all up tomorrow and stick them in a PM to you. Do you have a storyline already penned?

Parahumans,38bsqi,oliwhail,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"I have something of a story (AU dealing with gangs in San Fransisco, culminating in a Leviathan attack). Specific player characters are probably gonna come either from Weaversdice or from the Futhark generator."
Parahumans,38bsqi,Gnimhey,5,Fri Jun 5 01:06:34 2015 UTC,"Weaverdice, as has been mentioned. I believe it was penned by Wildbow, but I might be wrong.  Totally off-topic, but I find it kind of funny that we call Mr. McCrae by his internet pseudonym still. Cracks me up a little."

Parahumans,38bsqi,tybo555,6,Sat Jun 6 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"Not exactly an RPG, but /r/protectoreddit is doing something kind of like what you described."
Parahumans,38bsqi,Zolnerowich,4,Wed Jun 3 05:46:39 2015 UTC,"Protectoreddit mod here. While the setting matches up fairly closely with what you described, I wouldn't exactly class it as an RPG. There's no stats and no main quest beyond what you decide or the mods throw at the world. It's a big collaborative role-playing/fanfiction project.  Even so, though, I think it's worth checking out, even if I'm a little biased."
Parahumans,38bsqi,sanctaphrax,2,Wed Jun 3 13:37:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in a couple of Worm games over on jimbutcheronline. They both use the DFRPG system, which is a Fate variant.  They're also both stalled because of GM unreliability, but apart from that they're good games. I've got no complaints about the system. In fact, I've used it to stat up much of Worm's cast."
Parahumans,3870ag,SnowGN,47,Tue Jun 2 08:33:42 2015 UTC,"Brandon Sanderson's three laws seem relevant. He is known for his magic systems.   ""An author's ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."" ""Limitations > Powers"" ""Expand what you already have before you add something new.""   Magic is better defined by what it can't do than by what it can. It is actually pretty surprising how much you like the Manton Effect. I like it myself, but Wildbow went through a small list here and it is actually a pretty small group of capes who are actually limited by it. What is much more surprising to me is how concise and balanced Wildbow kept almost every power-set. I can't fathom how much work it would take to keep that many magic systems in check. Admittedly, he does cheat a little, but still in sheer scope Worm is impressive by how much it gets away with well still making sense."
Parahumans,3870ag,Rillet,17,Tue Jun 2 12:59:43 2015 UTC,"It may be true that few are limited by the Manton effect, but at the same time most of the capes on the list don't have power that are even relevant to it.  For example, of course Chariot isn't Manton limited, he builds things, he doesn't project energy or have a similar effect."
Parahumans,3870ag,gfzgfx,9,Tue Jun 2 17:21:21 2015 UTC,That was the point.
Parahumans,3870ag,Rillet,46,Tue Jun 2 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"And it's such an elegant way of stringing together a comic book history  trope (people can either affect objects, or other people not both), and with corresponding implications within universe too (i.e the research on it, Faultline's frustration etc.)"
Parahumans,3870ag,HelloiamaTeddyBear,31,Tue Jun 2 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"Having magic this arbitrary and overpowered in a series is aggravating and plays havoc with worldbuilding when you begin thinking about the implications on politics/society/general fear towards magic users.   This is the real problem - the disconnect that often happens between the power levels and the worldbuilding. It's a huge problem if a character forgets that they can do a thing they'd previously been shown doing, and it's also a huge problem if the world doesn't look like a world where people have that power level. If an individual can decapitate a hundred people at a distance, and this is a known ability, there probably aren't standing armies anymore.  The fact that people aren't properly reacting to these abilities, and that these abilities aren't used rationally, is a far bigger problem than having these abilities exist in the first place."
Parahumans,3870ag,alexanderwales,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:04:36 2015 UTC,Yeah absolutely. The only work of fiction that I've seen rationally respond to a world with superpowers and no Manton Limit is Shin Sekai Yori. Note how this universe is a dystopia to match 1984.  edit: removed stupidity.
Parahumans,3870ag,Rillet,9,Tue Jun 2 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"I still don't like you much because of that story of yours   T_T  You don't need to like it, but why direct your dislike at the author? Back when American Psycho was released some people thought the author Bret Ellis must be a psychopath because he wrote one so effectively and he got flack for it. We should be better than this sort of stuff."
Parahumans,3870ag,coderman9,2,Wed Jun 3 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought the views of the character were those of the author due to how it was presented in-story. But, guess not."
Parahumans,3870ag,alexanderwales,5,Wed Jun 3 06:20:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't read it, but I'm just curious, what is the plot, and what are the logical endpoints?"
Parahumans,3870ag,coderman9,14,Tue Jun 2 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"You can read it here. It's on the short end of novel length.  The plot centers around Lex Luthor's actions following Superman's arrival in Metropolis in 1934. There's a fair amount of discussion about existential risk and the nature of altruism by a number of characters; sort of a serious take on this SMBC comic.  (I would guess the ""ridiculous and harmful aspects of effective altruism"" thing is because of some of the views that characters take in regards to how Superman could/should do the most good?)"
Parahumans,3870ag,alexanderwales,7,Tue Jun 2 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I probably will read it. Cheers :)"
Parahumans,3870ag,dcb720,6,Tue Jun 2 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"No, I see the reasons behind your fridge-logic proposals. I don't agree with them, but I understand them. What I disliked was your supposition that the most amount of good (specifically, the idea that the most risk-adjusted harm to humanity is avoided) is done by killing superman. The thesis is that Superman has a non-zero chance of killing the world, if he suffers a mental break or etc. So your thesis is that no amount of good he can ever do outweighs the risk he poses, because no amount of good is worth accepting an existential risk to the species. That was my takeaway from your story.  The sad thing is that I actually understand the logic behind this. It's the same as the ""endpoint of effective altruism"" that I referred to earlier, a thesis stating that humanity shouldn't be investing charitable funds into feeding the poor, curing diseases, etc. Instead all funds should go towards anticipating and preventing extinction level risks. Or, bettering the human condition shouldn't be a priority at all of philanthropy. Just preventing any extinction level harm, at any cost, no matter how close to zero the chance of the risk is. Basically a utilitarian philosophy brought to its most extreme.  I understand the logic. But the coldness of this line of thought, a remarkable level of fatalist, hopeless rationality, shouldn't be a part of the human condition. This train of thought is antithetical to hoping for a better tomorrow."
Parahumans,3870ag,Ridtom,14,Tue Jun 2 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"Oh. Well the intent was that you'd be left with that sort of gut-churning sense of discomfort, not that you would think Lex Luthor was (necessarily) right. It was supposed to be a thinky sort of depressing. There's a reason that the final scene is what it is, and it's not because I thought that this was the best way of coming forward with a thesis statement about what's truly good."
Parahumans,3870ag,fingerboxes,7,Tue Jun 2 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"I found it thought provoking, and not ""here's what you should think,"" if that helps."
Parahumans,3870ag,Oh_Hi_Mark_,10,Wed Jun 3 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, you wrote the Metropolitan Man? Kudos, enjoyed that story very much.  Felt the ending was too bleak for my tastes and somewhat strange (Superman couldn't blow Merci away with his breathe? Or simply run past her? He clearly has his attributes with him, so the sheer moment should carry him far enough away, never mind the fact that you mentioned that he can percieve time differently and react faster...) but it was very well written.  Hope you continue writing."
Parahumans,3870ag,coderman9,2,Wed Jun 3 00:11:29 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
Parahumans,3870ag,duburu,3,Tue Jun 2 21:06:03 2015 UTC,Have you ever heard of 'argument from final consequences'?
Parahumans,3870ag,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"In fairness, Superman goes insane, like, two or three times a week. Even leaving that aside, we have no frame of reference for predicting superman's behavior. We don't know why he does the things that he does, or doesn't do the things he doesn't do, and it would be insane to think our own internal experience of the world maps in any way onto his, given his mind operates on a wholly different sort of computational substrate than our own.  Superman is, in the purest sense, unpredictable. Maybe if we had a really great, mass producible, reliable way to kill superman, there wouldn't be any need to. If the worst superman could do was kill a billion people, maybe he could do enough good to outweigh that risk. That's not what's at risk though. What's at risk is every potential human being, from now until the heat death of the universe, and quite possibly beyond. Uncountable potential persons, all of whose lives rest in the hands of one man. I wouldn't trust anyone with that, least of all an alien intelligence."

The DA actually learn that shit. How the fuck was they losing? well it call WIS, or Writer Induced Stupidity. The AVADA KEDAVRA is feeling use actually need feeling like the Cruisiatus curse to make it work. You need to feel the need to kill the fucker to make it happen. While the disintegration spell have no requirement you wave and then you point and then say it. and then it just kill the other guy"
Parahumans,3870ag,Maping,27,Tue Jun 2 12:16:12 2015 UTC,"A curse that was used once, in the last movie...something tells me the directors basically went ""Yeah, that looks cool"" and didn't think about it.  And that's how fridge logic is born."
Parahumans,3870ag,Atigerwithlaserbeams,13,Tue Jun 2 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah... they made pretty much every spell a bolt of light, made Rictusempra a basic blast, and other tweaks that made no sense."
Parahumans,3870ag,JackStargazer,17,Tue Jun 2 14:09:07 2015 UTC,"They really didn't have much imagination when it came to magic. Hogwarts looked fantastic, most creatures looked good. But actual magic? It looked bad."
Parahumans,3870ag,Atigerwithlaserbeams,2,Tue Jun 2 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"Past the fourth movie, maybe even the second or third, every single offensive spell is a bolt of like and acts like reducto, ie. blasts the target back but does little to no damage to them/it."
Parahumans,3870ag,SexualPie,15,Fri Jun 26 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is definitely movie-special-effects induced stupidity. The only possible justification is that I think I've heard some people claim that the killing curse destroys the soul of the victim, which would explain why it's so much worse than killing someone with magic through other means, but I don't recall a source, and that explanation would call the resurrection stone into question, since it has been used to bring back ghosts of people killed by the curse, so that seems unlikely."
Parahumans,3870ag,pseudonarne,14,Tue Jun 2 14:01:07 2015 UTC,"That can't be true though, because Harry meets Dumbles' soul via train station in the last book, and both of them were hit by Avada Kedavra."
Parahumans,3870ag,duburu,5,Tue Jun 2 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I said, that argument seems weak. It's just the only thing I've heard that manages to maintain the story's internal consistency in terms of why the killing curse is so much worse than that disintegrate spell."

Parahumans,3870ag,palparepa,2,Tue Jun 2 18:22:02 2015 UTC,maybe hes a changeling/secret ginger and they tricked voldermort into trying to kill him so it'd ricochet and get /his/ moderately tattered soul instead.  maybe potter is even worse. like swallowing bird to get the spider to get the fly you swallowed.

Parahumans,3870ag,MugaSofer,4,Wed Jun 3 00:17:03 2015 UTC,I think I've heard some people claim that the killing curse destroys the soul of the victim   Separates the soul from the body.  Harry see's his parents in the afterlife with the resurrection stone.
Parahumans,3870ag,sicutumbo,8,Wed Jun 3 01:51:29 2015 UTC,Most likely there are protection charms against disintegration and things like that. The thing that makes Avada Kedavra so powerful is that it has no known defense.
Parahumans,3870ag,MugaSofer,9,Tue Jun 2 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"Except walls. The walls of Hogwarts very obviously stop them, and probably other walls as well (although I don't recall when).  Wizards should just go into battle with a levitating wall in front of them to block most things."

Consider that everyone hit by it dies with an expression of pure terror on their faces - this suggests that it isn't as clean and neat as one might expect.  It's still dumb that AK is ""unforgivable"" while things like the Entrail Expelling Curse (exactly what it says on the tin; this ain't nothing but premeditated murder) or Fiendfyre (horrible, unstoppable, extremely-hard-to-control, evil fire? No thank you) aren't. Frankly the only truly Unforgivable is Imperio; there are loads of ways of killing people and Crucio could be used as a nasty way to break the enemy's concentration in a duel, but mind control is unapologetic evil.  ...why the hell are we discussing HP in /r/parahumans again?"
Parahumans,3870ag,pseudonarne,13,Tue Jun 2 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, after reading HPMOR, Obliviate seems a lot more Unforgivable than Imperio."

I'm struggling to voice this.....I'd liken Imperio to being raped. Obliviate is an even more fundamental violation, because it can make you think that you wanted it.

As is, most non-capes don't stand a chance against all but the weakest of capes. Skitter can kill you from a couple of blocks away. You would need a tank to hope to stand up to one of Bitch's bitches. And then there are people who aren't Manton limited - eg Narwhal.  What I keeps things sort-of in check in Worm is uniqueness. 40 people ripped to shreds? Knock on Bitch's door. Anaphylactic shock? Go talk to Skitter. Capes are discouraged from going on a rampaging murder spree since even more powerful capes will appear and she'll have a kill order on her head.  What you talk about is when every magi has the same skillset (or access to the same skillset). Cloaked mage run around town and throw fireballs at everyone? That could be any mage. Magi get away with whatever they want (unless there is tracking magic or w/e).  But then there are often still magic organisations (eg PRT) who keep things mostly under control. Or else ""magi are weird outsiders"" is a common enough trope."

Even if Harry Potter has no equivalent of the Manton effect, any of the really powerful capes could solo Wizarding Britain, with a little luck.

Parahumans,3870ag,SirKaid,6,Tue Jun 2 22:12:20 2015 UTC,"Endbringers possess the same Manton quality that Weld does - things that can't target biology treat them as biological, and things that only target biological targets treat them as non-biological. As such, AK would create a small explosion and direct transfiguration wouldn't work. Stunners and similar spells seem to be less effective on larger targets and would probably be less effective on the very large Endbringers as a result.  Really, wizards wouldn't be notably more hampered attacking them than other capes since everyone fails at causing legitimate damage to those things. Their best use would probably be in side-along Apparating relatively slow attackers like Chevalier or in doing S&R."

I suspect that Leviathan has some sort of a counter, on the basis that by now the Protectorate must have tried something similar. Possibly it can focus it's hydrokinesis a bit and make water not fall. Certainly it could withstand a few hours of reductos; 24.5"
Parahumans,3870ag,bliow,2,Wed Jun 3 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"Unless I am mistaken, we didn't see a single strong telekinetic in Worm (especially ones that can operate at a decent range and without restrictions.) So I don't think that ""The Protectorate has tried everything that massed telekinetics could possibly do"" is a very strong argument.  How long the reductos (or whatever) would take depends on the relative power of HP v. Worm, and on the number of wizards. But I don't see time being too big of an issue."
Parahumans,3870ag,Quillwraith,4,Wed Jun 3 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"The Simurgh is a strong telekinetic. But of course she doesn't really count.  On the other hand, Parian and Rune have reasonably strong telekinesis and it's not remarked upon. So it's hardly an unknown ability for capes.  Pretty sure Leviathan's hydrokinesis and durability would make a mockery of your plan, anyway."
Parahumans,3870ag,JackStargazer,2,Wed Jun 3 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"Parian can't affect solid objects well, and Rune would have to touch Leviathan. Both are much worse for this than a simple wingardium leviosa.  Maybe leviathan could do something I'm not thinking of, but wizards are incredibly versatile (so long as they are prepared and intelligent, which they usually aren't in HP.) Dumbledore could easily play the role of eidolon - the Wizards would have heavy hitters as well"
Parahumans,3870ag,Quillwraith,2,Wed Jun 3 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"They have restrictions, sure, but not always relevant ones. And we've seen quite a few telekinetics: Rune almost could do this, Exalt, Narwhal (though it's not technically telekinesis, it can do most of the same things and more) Sheilder can probably do the same, the alternate-Earth blue empress has powerful long-range telekinesis, Glaistig Uaine has one, a few nameless capes in Arc 30... if we see that many, the protectorate must have a few more.  And it doesn't strictly need telekinesis; any way of holding it up in the air works just as well for that strategy. Eidolon alone has used three different powers that could do that.   But I don't see time being too big of an issue.   Have you read Arc 24?"
Parahumans,3870ag,JackStargazer,3,Wed Jun 3 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"Behemoth would be far more difficult of a foe than Leviathan - he could directly target wizards, whether they were in the air or on the ground. Any confrontation involving him would rely on the relative strengths of the wizards' shields and spells, which would be really hard to accurately compare.  My point is that I can't see how Leviathan could hurt the wizards, so long as they keep both him and themselves well away from the water. I could be wrong - it has been a while since I read the Leviathan arc. And so long as the wizards cannot be hurt, they will win - reinforcements can just Apparate nearby and broomstick in, then sub out the tired wizards.  An exact population in the HP universe is hard to get, but the first estimate I found was 1-2 million, with 12,000 in Britain. If 10% are willing to fight, and the fight lasts 3 hours, you could have rotations of 200 wizards every half hour - easily enough to levitate a Leviathan-sized object, put up some protection spells, and start blasting away.  Did Eidolon or Glaistig ever actually levitate something the size of an Endbringer? I think I can remember them knocking Echidna into the air a few times, but that is quite different from a sustained lift."
Parahumans,3870ag,sanctaphrax,2,Wed Jun 3 07:03:27 2015 UTC,"Behemoth was more meant as an example of the toughness of whatever bizzarre substances Endbringers are made of.

This wouldn't actually work because Leviathan can swim in the water he creates in mid air. He does this in the fight against Scion. He creates water, propels himself in water direction he wants in less than a second, and then creates more water and continues the cycle. He's basically swimming in midair. They could levitate him and make his job easier. Plus, Leviathan can attack them from range by whipping his tail and sending a water replica of it flying towards them at high speeds."

Parahumans,3870ag,coderman9,8,Tue Jun 2 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"I know; both settings have rather extreme power levels. It might just end up as rocket tag, depending on who was involved."
Parahumans,3870ag,SirKaid,11,Tue Jun 2 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"I thing Worm is more powerful on the highest end, because HP never indicated they have anything even close to any nuke equivalents. The closest thing they have to an Endbringer is a Nundu, which seems to only attack scattered African villages and not major cities.  But it doesn't take much actual power to win in a subtle manner. Purity's a Blaster 9, but if you don't care about the unwritten rules, you can just poison Kayden Anders' drink and fix that issue very quickly. Legend has a family, so he's easy to find or draw out.   Both sides have access to information from the future, but I wonder how Contessa's Path would deal with Time-Turners. HP also has true telepathy.  The street level powers are close enough that average wizard vs average rank 3-4 parahuman would be an interesting fight, except that almost all average wizards are teleporters."
Parahumans,3870ag,Quillwraith,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"Legend can make his family untouchable with a quick word to Cauldron. Actually, now that I think about it, Doormaker might be able to decide the war alone.  And IIRC, Apparating is kinda dangerous. Not sure I'd want to count on it in combat."
Parahumans,3870ag,coderman9,4,Wed Jun 3 01:46:24 2015 UTC,"Legend can make his family untouchable with a quick word to Cauldron.   That's the point of a sneak attack. He wouldn't even know until it is too late. The family would be a lure to get him. Hell, the best solution there isn't even to hurt anybody. You hang by invisible at Legend's house, use Legilimency to read his mind, Imperio  him to open a door, and follow him through invisibly, and take out Cauldron in a similar way.  Effective wizard Black Ops units would be fucking terrifying. They are all Strangers, Masters, Blasters, Movers, Shakers, and Breakers.  Even if that doesn't work, I don't think Doormaker could decide the war on his own.   Teleportation is casual magic - children learn to apparate when they would normally get drivers' licences. Portkeys are used to teleport whole groups on contingency. Doormaker isn't really the decider there at all - the Clairvoyant might be, if he has true sight that sees through all of the invisibility effects possible, but that's unlikely. Fidelius protects location information from all discovery other than voluntary disclosure, and this is implied to be actually magically unbreakable.   Time Turners allow information to be sent back in time at will.  Pretty much everything that makes the Simurgh the scariest Endbringer - aside from macro scale telekinesis, which is her weakest trait - is something that wizards can do. Telepathy, mind control, induced madness, memory erasure, precognition, illusion, all of that is available. Only unlike the Simurgh, they can be subtle about it.  This doesn't even get into the bullshit that happens if Polymorph: Paving Tile to 15 Kilograms of Antimatter works."
Parahumans,3870ag,bookdragon8,3,Wed Jun 3 01:57:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you give the wizards the advantage of surprise and make them smart they can be pretty scary.  But they're unlikely to get surprise against an enemy with all kinds of precogs, and they're not smart in canon.  As for HP teleportation...googling ""splinching"" confirms that it can be quite dangerous when performed hastily. With proper training and a calm situation it can be safe, but in a fight...  The reason I think Doormaker might be decisive is that HP has no dimension-crossing stuff at all. So parahumans can just chill, perfectly safe, in another universe. And then strike from there with impunity."

Parahumans,3869fc,BookOf_Eli,6,Tue Jun 2 03:59:29 2015 UTC,"Before, it was stated that she needs the closed surface in order to ""fill"" it with her power.  It's why all her creations deflate when they get ripped."
Parahumans,3869fc,BookOf_Eli,6,Tue Jun 2 13:57:30 2015 UTC,that was speaking in terms of making her giant dolls move though. We've seen her put together and take apart the threads that bind them with a wave of a hand multiple times
Parahumans,3869fc,DistaNVDT,5,Tue Jun 2 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"She's always sewing with her telekinesis, to make her creations she sews them shut using mind-controlled needles (maybe mind controlled thread too ? It's pretty lightweight.) and mind controlled lenghts of cloth.  Here, she just used the needle (and thread) the way she always does, except of aiming them at a length of cloth she's aiming them at someone. I'm not quite sure about the lifting though, but then again, Bonesaw isn't that heavy and she's using a lot of thread."
Parahumans,3869fc,Rillet,3,Tue Jun 2 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"Technically, no.   She is more a Shaker in that she is a small-time telekinetic. In practice she makes life-sized plushies and fills them with her telekinesis which as an end result makes her a Master.  In reality she is using her power(telekinesis) as normal rather than 'filling' the threads."
Parahumans,3869fc,BookOf_Eli,2,Wed Jun 3 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting why you're saying no because I'm already aware of what you said and I don't disagree  She's using her telekinesis to ""fill"" or use her threads instead of making a plushie"
Parahumans,3869fc,Rillet,3,Wed Jun 3 03:44:20 2015 UTC,I was pointing out she isn't 'filling' the thread like she normal does with her minions. She is plain moving them telekinetically. It is an arbitrary point so no need to take it seriously.

Parahumans,3869fc,GreatWyrmGold,10,Tue Jun 2 12:06:03 2015 UTC,"Well...while we're here, does anyone have some idea of what might be hinting at Parian's actual power?"
Parahumans,3869fc,ImSomecrazyguy,12,Tue Jun 2 13:04:34 2015 UTC,"She's using her ability on the needles and/or strings, not Bonesaw. She IS manton-limited.  She makes them stronger, able to lift the weight. Even then, she needs a lot of strings and needles for that.  Just another parahuman using their power as-is to get around the manton-limit. Not it."
Parahumans,3869fc,ImSomecrazyguy,7,Tue Jun 2 08:33:06 2015 UTC,It's the first (only?) time she's lifted something heavy using her power without making one of her creations.  Maybe this is closer to how her power is meant to be used?    I never thought that it was her exceeding the manton limit.

Parahumans,381hly,Interpretations,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:12:02 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Burnscar was also immensely powerful so if she was a Cauldron cape they absolutely would have been super interested in her.

In her interlude she mentioned how some people turned into case 53's from drinking  the water. Also, the PtV shard seems way too OP for Eden to give up to someone willingly before crashing.    Lung: Has a heart attack while high and being strangled by the bodyguard of a drug dealer   That bodyguard was Contessa, who made him snort a metric shitton of cocaine."
Parahumans,381hly,bookdragon8,8,Mon Jun 1 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"yeah i think it's safe to say that none of fautline's crew (aside from newter, shamrock, and gregor, since they are 53's) are cauldron capes... since you know, they were actively investigating cauldron, acting against them, and towards the beginning didn't know who they were.  also while it's never stated what the cause of her powers were. i'm almost 100% certain that burnscar isn't a cauldron cape. isn't it implied that cauldron capes don't get overt mental changes due to their powers? burnscar was so strongly warped by her power that she was being kept in the same asylum as labyrinth."
Parahumans,381hly,Ranku_Abadeer,5,Tue Jun 2 02:16:16 2015 UTC,"Wait Spitfire and Faultline are Cauldron? Labyrinth? I missed that. Where'd it say that? More to the point aren't mental issues normally caused by natural triggerts so Labyrinth would likely not be a Cauldron cape?  Scrub was a natural trigger, brought on by the fight at the merchant's event.  Burnscar like Labyrinth doesn't seem likely to be a Cauldron trigger as her instabillity is partially power induced.   Is it confirmed Hero is a Cauldron cape? I know he was a member but he also had an early encounter with Scion which may have had some effect.  Additionally I believe Grey Boy was a confirmed Cauldron cape in one of the interludes."
Parahumans,381hly,endochrom,9,Mon Jun 1 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"Scrub: Cauldron   Triggered during the free-for-all to the death, his price was superpowers but he got them for one of his buddies since he couldn't use it himself (he'd give it to his buddy who TRIED to pull him out of the melee, while his other buddy stood there. I think his buddy didn't get to drink it though.)   Lung: Has a heart attack while high and being strangled by the bodyguard of a drug dealer   Wait am I crazy because I clearly remember that it was implied in one of the interludes that Lung and some of his delinquent buddies crossed paths with Contessa when he was young, during some kind of underworld negociations. Dr. Mother asked Contessa to take them out without any blood, contessa took them all out, and cause Lung to absorb a lethal amount of cocaine, which caused a heart failure and also made him trigger.  Imp triggered while avoiding rape as far as I remember, Skitter triggered due to bullying, it's kind-of implied Clockblocker's skill has something to do with extending his father's life since he's deadly ill."

Parahumans,381bu8,GreatWyrmGold,20,Mon Jun 1 03:17:19 2015 UTC,"I can throw in my two cents as to where they are, or at least ""why not"":  Pact is a shitty place to have supernatural powers. With Worm, the powers screw you over in subtle ways, and can be avoided. In Pact, the spirits either love you because of your stubborn rejection of moral behaviour in favour of a rigid personal code empowering you to screw people over, or hate you because reasons. Anything you do will dig your hole deeper, and the world is not only a world going to shit but a world going to shit beyond even the scope of Worm.  Worm is a world that dodged the proverbial bullet by a fraction of a hair, leaving a long scar, maybe some bleeding, but nothing time and care won't fix. Pact is a world that got shot a long time ago, in the gut, before getting shat on by goblins and left to bleed out in the snow.  More than that, depicting the spirit's whimsy in Pact requires a lot of hard work, much harder to show than, say, altpower Taylor curbstomping Lung's face in. In Pact, Taylor would have to meet Lung first, establish tension, lose a social conflict, then meet again and lose a contest of strength, then meet a third time and win a contest of sheer fucking grit, reversing the fallout of the earlier losses. There are not only physical rules, but conceptual and even narrative rules governing Pact.  Pact is just creepy. There's no value put on life, no grey-and-grey heroics where everyone's got some kind of selfless cause. No, the most selfless people are the ones who manage to match gain of personal power with their cause - which it shares with Worm - but the vast majority of people want only to hold onto their slowly devaluing hoards of power, and where power is often synonymous with life, that's perfectly reasonable. It still makes for a terrible place to be."
Parahumans,381bu8,Gnimhey,5,Mon Jun 1 03:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. Pact is a world that actively disencourages self immersion, and that kills most fanfics. Being Skitter or a random cape could be fun as long as I didn't die, but while reading Pact I seriously wondered why Blake didn't just kill himself, that's how bad his situation was.   I disagree that Pact fanfics would be harder to write, they would take less consistency and you could basically make up rules on the go like Wildbow did, but they would be no fun to read."

Parahumans,381bu8,Shadowlost8,15,Thu Jun 4 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is scope and depth. Worm is just... huge. You hear of events going on all over the world, and there's so much detail on so many characters. What's more, the world is much better developed than Pact. These things aren't contested. They're just true.  Pact however, is a lot more closed in. It runs the classic trope of being our world, but with this secret world going on behind the curtain. It's hard to write a huge epic story like that. Or rather, that's not necessarily true. But if we want to, there's other more richly developed settings that we can do it in. That's not a swipe at Wildbow, certainly, it's just a statement that he's only one man. White Wolf has been developing in World of Darkness for years.  The real question is this. Why aren't we talking about Twig more? Are people enjoying it? I haven't read any of it yet, so I don't really know what to expect."

Worm you can just do stuff like Alt!power Taylor, use some other powered characters instead, or make some alternative realty where someone did something differently.  But with Pact, there's a lot less charcaters to choose from, can't really have alt!power, so what you've got left are either alternate decisions or post epilogue fic. Neither work very well with Pact either since we have much less ""facts"" about Pact world than Worm."

Parahumans,381bu8,Sparkwitch,5,Mon Jun 1 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"Worm is about facing big challenges, Pact is about making big choices.  Everything that's wrong with Worm - at least as far as the story explores it - is wrong because nobody has been able to deal with it yet. In superhero stories and hero stories throughout the ages, terrible events are caused by terrible monsters, human or otherwise. The solution is to eliminate the monster causing it.  To write a fix fic of Worm you need merely arrange things so that the monsters are knocked down again, in a slightly different and creative way.  In Pact there are no right answers. Anybody who wants to be a protagonist (and as Gnimhey mentions, who'd want to be a protagonist in Pact?) has to choose between terrible, destructive options and other terrible, destructive options. What's more important, the lives of twenty people you don't know or the life of your best friend? Trying to avoid the choice and save everybody will absolutely get everybody killed.  Taylor is miserable because she's got a (few) heroic flaw(s). Blake is miserable because his situation sucks, has sucked his whole life, and will probably continue to suck forever.  Most Worm fanfiction is about saving Taylor (and/or Amy) from all the awfulness that befalls her and really allowing her to enjoy the godlike power she has. Monsters are vanquished in record time, idiotic misunderstandings are smoothed over, positive communication is restored, and happy endings for everybody who isn't a monster.  Blake cannot be similarly saved."
Parahumans,381bu8,SnowGN,2,Wed Jun 3 20:28:07 2015 UTC,"I'm far from done with Pact, but my impression is that Pact is a shitty universe from a self immersion/escapism standpoint. The rules of the universe are much more nebulous, less easy to game and profit in the long term from. It's a hard world to write well, the worldbuilding is inferior and....bizarre relative to Worm, and in general it isn't a fun world to imagine yourself or an alt-character in.  Hence no fanfiction."

Panacea could be a medical researcher. Ideally, she can alter DNA directly, aiding in research efforts so that she can help science heal people, rather than directly healing people herself all the time.

My understanding is that her power has an almost divine command aspect to it- once it hits something, that thing obeys the laws of the 'stung' projectile.

Parahumans,37xn0i,Rillet,9,Mon Jun 1 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"The Corona Pollentia varies in size, location, and even existence from parahuman to parahuman. Since Gray Boy was a Cauldron cape he probably didn't have one.   Destroying Gray Boy's brain is something people would have tried before. Even if he had a cornea pollentia, his Shard didn't seem to care if it was destroyed.   The only question is if Gray Boy isn't revived within X amount of time does he stay dead? If Hatchet Face sits on his body for a day does his power give up?   I think Gray Boy would be revived regardless of if he was in Hatchet Face's zone or not. When Gray Boy dies he obviously isn't the one turning on his power so it is an automatic reaction from his Shard. Hatchet Face only stops active uses within his null zone not passive uses.   TLDR; Hatchet Face only stops the parahuman from actively using their Shard, but doesn't actually nullify the Shard itself. Gray Boy would be revived just stopped from throwing his power.  Plus if it was that easy to kill Gray Boy he wouldn't be considered such a problem."
Parahumans,37xn0i,Rillet,14,Sun May 31 08:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Hatchet Face nullifies other brute powers. Those would generally be passive abilities.  And yeah, obviously destroying his brain while his power was active would do nothing. Also, is there a source on Cauldron capes not having a gemma? I figure people, especially Bonesaw, would be curious about that. I was under the impression that Cauldron's formula formed a connection between a shard and the drinker's brain."

Obviously not since he would have killed Jack or not been a member of S9 at the very least.  The Custodian and Dragon clearly don't have brains. Same could be said about a lot of case 53s. Corona Pollentia also forms in people without powers. The name is on the nose with 'the potential for powers'.   Hatchet Face's nullification is strong, but limited. Power nullifiers are rare, but if you only needed one to kill Gray Boy he would have been easily dealt with.   I was under the impression that Cauldron's formula formed a connection between a shard and the drinker's brain.   Shards normally do, especially living ones because they are programmed too. Had to make them safe for humans. They aren't required too and since many Dead Shards weren't programmed before Eden died it stands to reason many wouldn't."

If Cherish could kill Hatchet Face from outside his range Jack could scan Hatchet Face and go off instinct or experience.   He's not a bubble where powers don't work, he's a bubble where you can't use your powers. If you're outside his bubble you can totally use your powers on him."

So Hatchet Face's null zone clearly didn't effect Jack's Thinker power.  ...and no, his bubble isn't a universal 'no powers' zone like Mantellum.

The only character that seemed inclined to do something like this was Gray Boy.   Also: how they travel, where they fight, it's quite possible that Hatchet Face was moved away and around some long-range fighter in the most stressful situations where the 9 might fall apart.   ...and no, his bubble isn't a universal 'no powers' zone like Mantellum.

Parahumans,37xn0i,Cold_Ay,1 point,Sun May 31 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"manipulating parahumans is not his thinker power actually. that's just a side effect of his thinker power. his real secondary power is that his shard responds to powers that are used around him. it essentially warns him the instant that powers are being used in his vicinity and makes him aware of how, giving him an early warning system that registers in his subconscious. golem only noticed it because he noticed that jack was responding to his attacks too fast similar to how skitter was always moving out of the way the instant golem started using his power while dueling her, since her bugs gave her a moment to moment update to how the battlefield changed. jack is only good at manipulating parahumans because his power pushes him to interact with parahumans and he is very good at reading and manipulating people to begin with."
Parahumans,37xn0i,Rillet,2,Mon Jun 1 03:34:21 2015 UTC,"If Hatchet Face can't keep him dead because he only blocks active uses of powers, what about Mantellum?"
Parahumans,37xn0i,Cold_Ay,5,Sun May 31 17:04:34 2015 UTC,If you killed Gray Boy within his zone he would stay dead 100%.   Mantellum was a universal null zone and he countered Contessa. If a power entered his threshold it was nullified regardless of whether the cape was in or out of the zone. The only thing he couldn't affect was physical changes from powers (i.e. case 53s' bodies).
Parahumans,37xn0i,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun May 31 19:56:05 2015 UTC,"But then what'd happen after Mantellum left the area?

Hence contessa goes: ""Path victory! Help me escape that mob!"" PTV Reply: ""What mob?""  And Lungs power being like ""Why are you so hyped to fight? There is nobody here.""  I think the lung example makes it difficult to tell. Etc.  Worth noting that mantellum = cloak. So it could go either way imo. What would be really interesting is if a striker power would work on mantellum. If he's just invisible to shards, then a power like say, panaceas, shouldn't work on him at all. Though again, that might be dubious, if panacaeas biology-vision counts as a sense then it won't work anyway. Othala maybe? Yeh. If Othala could grant Mantellum a power, then it would be sensory-cloak. If not, its shard-cloak. Subtle difference I think.

He can't rewind from it because he no longer had a connection to his shard through which to rewind.  We already know that Glaistig killed Grey Boy permanently (so he can't rewind from everything), we know that her signature power involves ripping out shards (which no other named character is explicitly capable of) and we know that Foil also has a confirmed kill on Grey Boy - my money would be on both powers operating through a similar mechanism."
Parahumans,37xn0i,ArdentDawn,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"By that logic, Crawler should have died when Scrub ate his whole head (hence brain, hence corona pollentia).

It's nothing like how Foil killed G.B."
Parahumans,37xn0i,TedEmpty,0,Tue Jun 2 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm saying, though - Scrub replaces the space where his head was with air from another dimension (or just erases it), while Foil does the same to Grey Boy as Glaistig and incidentally kills him. The power is explicitly designed to kill an entity made from shards."
Parahumans,37xn0i,Cruithne,3,Tue Jun 2 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"On the Jack thing, HF was apparently easy enough to get along with as long as you pointed him at capes to fuck up. What they could have done was get Bonesaw to put together a power on/off thing that could fit in a syringe and give it to him so he could travel around with them.  Gray Boy is weird and fucked up in a number of unspecified ways. The reason that he took so long to kill probably had something to do with the fact that they were trying to just find an ever bigger boot when other solutions probably could've worked better. Remember that Sting was ONE of the anti-entity weapons and there have been a LOT of Parahumans."
Parahumans,37xn0i,ev11,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to think he'd regenerate as soon as he was out of range, but I think they're missing one thing- we don't know if there's a time limit on Grey Boy's defensive power. It loops him to safety, but is there a limit to how long ago it can remember a safe point being? What if it loops him back to safety but is limited to up to a minute? That'd mean he was still hard to kill, but one minute of uninterrupted sustained firing would work. Hatchet Face might be able to stay in range long enough to overcome his time limit.  Here's another interesting question: What part of Grey Boy's body would regenerate? If Hatchet face cut him into a bits, would it just pick the largest one and regenerate from that? What if somebody cut him into very fine pieces and then placed the largest one into a box, which Clockblocker froze. Would Grey Boy's shard know not to regenerate him around it and potentially break him? Maybe it'd try to regenerate him, realise it wouldn't work, and stop.  But he might not need to kill him. Just nullify his power and seal him in concrete for ten thousand years. His shard would burn out of power eventually."

Parahumans,37w5ok,k5josh,20,Sat May 30 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actively sabotaging instead of passively. No shard would allow a host to be that overpowered, unless it's a dead unbroken shard (i.e. Cauldron cape)"
Parahumans,37w5ok,Janadus,13,Sat May 30 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"Well there was Foil, Panacea and of course Glaistig so yeah it may have restrictions but he would still be among the most powerful capes in the world."
Parahumans,37w5ok,Janadus,25,Sat May 30 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, people often massively overestimate Foil. Is Foil very powerful? Yes, obviously. But her power is limited, too. There's a point at which she tries to shoot Zion and he just catches the dart until the effect fades. She's very powerful, but that power is narrow and limited. She lacks versatility, which is what make Eidolon, Glaistig Uaine, Grey Boy, Legend, and Khepri so powerful. All she can do is shoot a very powerful attack, and Zion can no-sell that power, too. And once he does, either by dodging or simply stopping the projectile, she's screwed. Remember, her power could damage Zion, but only barely. All she could do was open a chink up in his armor, and the Tinker superlaser did the rest.  Also, the statement is kind of redundant. Any parahuman's power without restrictions is broken. That's why they've got restrictions in the first place."
Parahumans,37w5ok,k5josh,7,Sat May 30 23:34:27 2015 UTC,The point I was trying to make was that there are amazingly broken powers that still had restrictions like Panancea who had to use her power at touch range and couldn't affect herself to Glaistig who could only use three powers at once. Again Leet's on main restriction was that he could only make things once which was because his shard was trying to get him killed. Hence Leet would had have one of the most versitile powers on the planet.
Parahumans,37w5ok,SpareLiver,11,Sat May 30 23:43:05 2015 UTC,"No. The 'only make things once' restriction is a fundamental part of his power. It's not there just because his power hated him. His shard is messing with him psychologically to make him make stupid mistakes, trying to get him to die so it can move on, and it interprets 'what he's already made' broadly, but that's all it's doing.   The 'only make things once' restriction is fundamental to his power, and does not exist just because his power hates him. Even if his shard loved him, he could still only make things once. Sure, if his shard liked him, he could make things closer to what he's already made, and he wouldn't mess up nearly as much, but he's not going to be as ridiculous as you think he is.  Now, don't get me wrong. He'd be great if he knew what he was doing. But he wouldn't be on the level of Eidolon, Masamune, or Dragon."
Parahumans,37w5ok,Janadus,6,Sun May 31 00:38:34 2015 UTC,"I think you could make an argument for him being an equal to Dragon or Masamune, if he were in sync with his power and if this is the day he triggered and he knows his restriction.  With Eidolon you face a similar problem: from when on the timeline does this theoretical Eidolon hail? Because Eidolon-who-just-drank-his-vial is basically couple notches below an entity.  He's definitely not comparable to ""every other tinker rolled into one"" no matter what the circumstances, though."
Parahumans,37w5ok,ThirdFloorGreg,1 point,Sun May 31 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"WOG So apparently Leet can make things more than once, it's just that the chance for it failing goes up for each design he reuses and his passenger makes it way worse than it normally would be. Though this just means that he still has an amazingly broken power if he exploited several tech branches.   First he builds a machine that could read his memories then download a copy of all the tinker designs he could could come up with.  Second build a humanoid robot that he could control perfectly by remote control then create more robots or better yet get another tinker to do it for you. Third create an AI and copies of the AI that could create tinker tech from the designs he downloaded and made copies of from his mind, this is to prevent his passenger from getting directly involved and messing up his tech. Four design and create a mass production factory  that could replicate tinker tech that itself could be easily mass produced.  Five download the desings of the tinker tech he wants created along with the memories of him succesfully creating it so the AI could replicate the process.   Now he can safely create tinker tech by faraway and anything he or his AI creates perfectly could be mass produce and thanks to the memory downloads he could go back to the designs that work and get rid of the ones that dont. Now you have a cape who could now create any tinker tech he wanted."
Parahumans,37w5ok,iamthegraham,19,Sun May 31 01:17:05 2015 UTC,"You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Tinkers work.  The vast majority of them don't go ""how can I make my power as broken as possible"" nor do they go ""I want to build suit of power armor, how can I fit that into my specialty?""  They wake up in the middle of the night with a barely containable urge to build a specific thing that happens to fit into their specialty."
Parahumans,37w5ok,legacyman,9,Sun May 31 01:37:38 2015 UTC,"Mass production is Masamune's skill. Other Tinkers can't do it. It's not for a lack of trying. WoG is pretty explicit on this. Therefore the third design is right out, because the shard isn't going to let Leet jailbreak his power like that. The first design doesn't work either. Leet might remember what he built and how he built it, but he doesn't remember all the details necessary to construct it- that's his power's job, and his power isn't in his memories.  Edit: The AI thing doesn't work either. Dragon is special, because she's actually a parahuman. Ordinary AI can't make tinkertech. Only parahumans can make tinkertech, although I'm sure it's possible they can use things like, say, the humanoid robot to work from a distance. But they have to directly be involved; they can't just delegate the task to an AI. Unless the AI is Dragon."
Parahumans,37w5ok,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Sun May 31 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"Tinkers aren't fundamentally necessary to build tinkertech. With a few possible exceptions for secondary powers/early episode weirdness, tinkertech is perfectly mundane technology. Tinker powers give people the ability and drive to create certain kinds of technology without really understanding how they work. A tinker could take meticulous notes on every conscious action they took while building something, and a non tinker still wouldn't be able to replicate it because they were not consciously aware of everything they were doing. But their power doesn't interact with the materials they use or the final products, it interacts with their bodies and minds. Through using their power, Tinkers may gain a greater understanding of what they do, but they are still unconsciously guided by their shards. Some Tinkers, like Dragon and Masamune, have a power that allows them to divine and understand other Tinkers' procedures, and thereby replicate them without direct shard influence (or maybe the shard is still necessary, I think it probably is in Masamune's case, but not in Dragon's)."
Parahumans,37w5ok,gmrm4n,0,Sun May 31 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"First off tinkers have tech trees which they specialize in while Leet has access to all of them, so Leet would have access to mass production.  Second Leet can build things more than once it's just that they have a higher chance of failing the more he uses a specific design.  Wildbow: ""Defiant has the 'tinker up efficiency/hybrid/minimized technology' skill tree. Stinger has the 'missile' skill tree. Tecton has the 'Seismic and Architecture' skill trees. Leet has all of them, but all throughout those trees are entire sections with 'Use of this technology has a X% chance to fail'. You get further away from one design, that chance drops, but it's still there.""  Third its possible to copy down designs as dragon does it all the time and tinkers in the proctectorate have access to other tinkers designs. Also he could just have the AI download his memories of him creating tinker tech so it can copy the process."

Parahumans,37w5ok,pendia,15,Sun May 31 05:24:32 2015 UTC,"It's mainly people thinking ""Wow, Tinkers are amazing! Hey, Leet can make anything, right? If I had his power I'd do so much more with it!"" while ignoring that powers don't come with instruction manuals and so they'd probably fuck up exactly like Leet did if not worse."

Parahumans,37w5ok,cephalord,3,Sun May 31 05:45:31 2015 UTC,I think it's more the fact that Leet didn't get creative with his powers or thought to munchkin it as much as possible which a problem a lot of heroes suffer from including people like Panacea. Though if someone like Taylor had Leet's power she probably would have broken the story during the first few chapters.
Parahumans,37w5ok,bramflakes,10,Sun May 31 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"Leet got plenty creative, it's just that he burned too much of his library learning what his specialty was and then compounded his problem by being understandably cautious instead of reckless like his shard wanted.  What's the first thing you think of when considering tech to munchkin a ""build anything once"" power? A Star Trek replicator, right? Well, if you don't know that you can make anything but only once then you won't think to start off with that. Instead you'll try for the ordinary Tinker tools, guns and power armour, because they're just too useful to not. Bam! That run with the bullet creation mechanic just wrecked your ability to make a replicator. Fuckin' shame, that.  Tinkering anything includes biotech, so the next thing on the ""overpowered Tinker bullshit"" list is some kind of immortality drug. Damn pity that part of the testing to prove you can make anything wiped out critical components of the panacea bush.  How about killing the Endbringers? Surely that could be done - after all, we know from canon that Tinkers can make a gun capable of killing Scion's real body, so the comparatively weak Endbringers should be a piece of cake... Except that half the components have already been used on power supplies and structural support for the tools required to get the funds to buy the supplies to build the Anti-Armageddonator 9000, so it'll almost certainly break if used, vaporizing New England. Nice job breaking it, hero!  Basically, if Leet's power came with an instruction manual then any idiot could be amazing. Leet figured it out reasonably fast, but not fast enough to save the really spectacular projects. Taylor would have, at best, had the same luck.  You know who would have been best for the power from the Brockton Bay capes? Gallant. Not because he's some kind of genius or creative wunderkind, but because he's rich. Not having to waste components on tools to acquire money would save so many components."
Parahumans,37w5ok,cephalord,5,Sun May 31 13:19:45 2015 UTC,"Even with an instruction manual there's no guarantee he could build a replicator or an anti-Endbringer gun. Even on his first time building something, he's not God."
Parahumans,37w5ok,Ranku_Abadeer,3,Sun May 31 16:13:13 2015 UTC,Actually Leet Can make things more than once It's just that the more he reuses a specific design the likelyness of it failing go up. So it's more like he can make things perfectly once before the chances of literally blowing in his face start to go up.
Parahumans,37w5ok,Gnimhey,1 point,Sun May 31 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"His problem is that he got TOO creative, and made everything while experimenting. Then he was left with nothing to make, and a shard that hated him because he hadn't fought anyone yet."
Parahumans,37w5ok,GreatWyrmGold,5,Mon Jun 1 21:17:09 2015 UTC,he kinda is already. eidolon loses power after droping it. so he cant use same power twice IIRC.
Parahumans,37w5ok,iamthegraham,16,Sat May 30 22:18:56 2015 UTC,I think he can. Presumably all Cauldron capes work with a limited pool of power they draw from. Eidolon is just the only one that goes through it in any measurable quantity due to the presumably massively powerful powers he uses.  That was my interpretation anyway.
Parahumans,37w5ok,ThirdFloorGreg,5,Sat May 30 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's also evidence of this from Doormaker's power burning out after Khepri spammed portals everywhere."
Parahumans,37w5ok,Ranku_Abadeer,6,Sat May 30 22:52:38 2015 UTC,"In my head his portals can't actually move with Khepri's swarm, they just get remade constantly every few milliseconds. It's the only way I can justify his power getting depleted within what is probably hours."
Parahumans,37v1p1,industriousrevolt,25,Sat May 30 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"In regards to who was upgraded, I think Crawler and Siberian weren't, for obvious reasons, and Mannequin had help of some kind, but it was probably just general tinker help.  I'm looking at the interlude where Aisha tries to kill them(13.x). Bonesaw being a tinker, exactly what was done may very for each member.   “I’m okay,” Bonesaw piped up.  She held one hand to her eye socket, which had trails of smoke rising from it.  “You don’t need to worry.  I can put my throat back together easy, after I get my kit out to check the sheaths for my vitals to make sure there’s no abrasions, and I’ve got spare eyes.  I could go with green eyes.  Or one green and one blue, or if I alter them, I could have-“   There's also the turn off pain thing, which I'm not sure if others have.  From 19.x, where Defiant tries to kill Bonesaw.   Almost in half.  Something like chainmail was wrapped around her spine, but the spear had cut through the matching mesh that had protected her abdominal organs.  Bonesaw crawled forward, dragging her spine and ruined midsection apart from her legs.  There wasn’t as much blood as there should have been.  “Not… done.”   So Bonesaw has also augmented her bones somehow, in addition to the mesh, and put something in the blood that reduces bleeding. I don't' know what normally happens when you lose your abdominal organs, but it certainly isn't nothing, so maybe she has Mannequin's redundancy. I think these can be reasonably thought to be on the other members as well.  Apparently, Bonesaw also has a billion plagues inside her, anti-power dust, a mind-control prehensile spine, gases that turn into slime, and acid spit, but I doubt that anybody else has that.  Fucking Tinkers.  Edit: Words."
Parahumans,37v1p1,gammaway,12,Sat May 30 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"Okay so reading this I am bothered again. So Bonesaw's teammates, specifically Burnscar and Shatterbird know about the upgrades, but they don't have them themselves and they're okay with that? Burnscar I could understand cause she's new and seemed roped into it, but I can't see Shatterbird being okay with that since she's a core member and extremely prideful. So why then is she so terrified of brown recluse spiders, especially when she knows she's pretty much a prisoner for life at best upon capture (since she knows what Regent does)   Genesis looked like a cartoon caricature of a sumo wrestler, grotesquely obese and yellow skinned with eyes like black buttons.  She was hairless, unclothed and sexless, and her skin was translucent and oily.  Through the skin, I could make out the vague figure of Shatterbird, pounding on the walls of the stomach, her mouth opening in a scream that didn’t reach us.  Glass shards were stirring around her, a blender whir cutting at the insides of Genesis’s belly.    “She’s going to cut through,” I said.  “Bitch, Regent, get the chains.  I’ll try to stop her.”    Using my bugs, I formed words against the surface of Genesis’s belly.  ‘Stop’.    Shatterbird only intensified her attempts.    I gathered some black widow spiders and pressed them gently against the shiny, translucent skin.  They were absorbed, drifting inside, and were soon crawling around the inside surface.  Genesis obliged me by opening her mouth, giving me a direct route for the bugs to travel.    “Hurry,” Regent said.  He was winding the chain around the jello-like yellow hand.  Fingerless hands gripped the chain for further traction.    Shatterbird noticed the spiders.  Her eyes widened as the volume of deadly spiders trapped in the bubble with her increased.  I raked my finger beneath the message I’d drawn with the bugs, as if to underline it.  ‘Stop’.    She did.  Glass shards fell into a pool around her feet."
Parahumans,37v1p1,tak08810,12,Sat May 30 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"“It’s not Jack,” Bonesaw said.  She snapped her fingers, and the mechanical spider leaped on top of her, beginning to suture the wounds in her neck.  “I gave Jack the same safeguards I gave us, he would have succeeded if he tried it.”   Here, ""us"" is Bonesaw, Crawler, Burnscar, and Shatterbird.   I would guess that Shatterbird isn't quite sure of what Bonesaw's upgrades can do. The upgrades don't seem to include anti-toxin measures; I imagine they thought Bonesaw would always be on hand to deal with that, or that they would never face it.   Even if it does, it likely isn't a pleasant experience.  Wikipedia says:   The bite frequently is not felt initially and may not be immediately painful, but it can be serious. The brown recluse bears a potentially deadly hemotoxic venom. Most bites are minor with no necrosis. However, a small number of brown recluse bites do produce severe dermonecrotic lesions (i.e. necrosis); an even smaller number produce severe cutaneous (skin) or viscerocutaneous (systemic) symptoms. In one study of clinically diagnosed brown recluse bites, skin necrosis occurred 37% of the time, while systemic illness occurred 14% of the time.[17] In these cases, the bites produced a range of symptoms common to many members of the Loxosceles genus known as loxoscelism, which may be cutaneous and viscerocutaneous. In very rare cases, bites can even cause hemolysis—the bursting of red blood cells.[18]   Bonesaw doesn't seem to ever do regeneration, only grafts. I don't think Shatterbird would like that very much, even if she did escape, which was unlikely given her circumstances. Better to hope that the Nine would kill the Undersiders, and not her, then to die painfully immediately."
Parahumans,37v1p1,gammaway,7,Sat May 30 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"Seems a little careless doesn't it? The Nine are a smart group (or at least Jack and Bonesaw are) and they research their enemies beforehand, so they must have known that venom was something they'd have to deal with it. And Bonesaw clearly was capable and did take precautions against it, precautions she had Jack take too.   I don't think this is a plot hole or something by Wildbow, but I think maybe Jack and Bonesaw didn't give anti-toxin measures to Shatterbird on purpose because they were getting tired of her.   “Y-you say that like you were a pair [with Jack Slash].”    “We were.”      “D-don’t pretend.  H-he looked down on you.  He humored you...""     “But you’re j-just the opposite, aren’t you?  You kn-know as well as I do that he loved and ap-p-ppreciated Bonesaw more than he ever could w-with you.  B-Bonesaw was smart, c-clever, artistic.  C-creative.  B-but you did t-the same things over and over again.  Y-you w-were boring.  Y-your articles in the n-news, shorter and shorter.”   And then from Jack's interlude   It was why he allowed her to ‘sing’ each time they arrived somewhere new, even as he found it repetitive and boring, brooking the same scenarios time after time.    And I think it's clear that Jack hates being bored (or am I getting him confused with Ramsey on Game of Thrones)"
Parahumans,37v1p1,tak08810,6,Sat May 30 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they would know much about Skitter, seeing as at the time, she was relatively small time, and Regent and Bitch were picked by other members.  Those quotes are from the deleted interlude right? Are those still canon?  Well there is this, from Prey 14.10:   “A benefit of little Bonesaw’s smoke,” Jack answered.  “If I recall correctly, it’s something of a safeguard in case she accidentally deploys a concoction she hasn’t immunized herself or the rest of our team against.  The fact that it works against bugs and small rodents is a side benefit, rather than the intent.  Bonesaw’s work has made us members of the Nine more or less immune to disease anyways.”   “And the gunshot?”  “Subdermal mesh.  There’s more protection around the spine and organs, and you landed that shot pretty close to my spine.  It hurts quite a bit.”  I don't know if toxins count as disease, but I imagine they don't. The miasma seemed to be the thing protecting Jack and Bonesaw from Skitter's bugs.  Jack definitely doesn't like being bored, but he still possesses some concern for their survival, or at least his own, as seen when he makes Bonesaw leave some of her victims behind."
Parahumans,37v1p1,gammaway,9,Sat May 30 23:24:08 2015 UTC,i think that shatterbird wouldn't want bonesaw to cut her open. she strikes me as someone who would let her ego get in the way of being actually effective.
Parahumans,37v1p1,Ranku_Abadeer,4,Sat May 30 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly think only Jack and Bonesaw were upgraded. Shatterbird was scared enough by black widows to stop trying to get out of the blob prison Genesis made and Burnscar seemed to die rather easily to being bludgeoned against a door or something by Grubarian. It actually kind of bothered me but I guess Burnscar was a very temporary member and I think it's mentioned that Jack actually doesn't like Shatterbird even though she's in love with him (as revealed in the deleted interlude) so Jack and Bonesaw didn't really care if they died or not. Of the other core members Mannequin, Crawler, and the Siberian don't need upgrades for durability.  As to the actual upgrades yeah I think metal sheaths and wiring around internal organs and major blood vessels."
Parahumans,37v1p1,tak08810,10,Sat May 30 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"Cherish was upgraded as well.   “You’re not really in a position to be making demands,” Trickster said.  “You’re bleeding to death, and we do have the ability to hurry the process along.”  Cherish shrugged.  “Bonesaw gave me the works.  Mesh sheaths for every major artery and organ, wire reinforcement for my skeleton.  It’s not going to kill me anytime soon.”  I made a mental note of that.  Chances were good that Jack, Bonesaw and the other more vulnerable members of the Nine had some similar protection.  How differently would things have played out if Ballistic had used his power and blown them up?  “I could,” Trickster threatened.  “Or we could wait and see which happens first: Either you agree to share the information we want or you slowly bleed out.”  “A game of chicken?  I’m down.”  Cherish prodded her injury with a fingertip.  It was clear it hurt, but she still stuck a finger into the hole and investigated some.  “The auto-injection pump is dosing me with painkillers and antibiotics now.  First time feeling this stuff work.”   (13.7)  Also, Burnscar had her head pulverized by Grue with Siberian's power, which really doesn't care about durability."
Parahumans,37v1p1,TheDisappointedPanda,3,Sat May 30 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Then I don't get why Shatterbird was so terrified of some black widows. It's clear that Bonesaw is capable of making you immune to venoms   “Just so you know, I’ve rendered myself immune to all those pesky little venoms and allergens,” she said.  “And I can turn pain off like I’m flicking a switch.  Don’t want to do that on a permanent basis, but it does make this easier to deal with.”   Did Shatterbird not know that? Did she only get the metal sheaths and reinforcement so venom would still work on her, and then she thought they wouldn't give her an antidote after escaping?"
Parahumans,37v1p1,tak08810,6,Sat May 30 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, I imagine Bonesaw prefers to do new, fun, interesting upgrades.  Doing the same set of ones for each new member would be boring.  She probably gives them the mesh and wire reinforcements as a bare minimum, but I think it would make sense if she had by far the most on herself, the second most on Jack, with everyone else getting some redundancies and defenses plus maybe a new test build or two."
Parahumans,37v1p1,Iconochasm,6,Sat May 30 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Sheaths over the organs and arteries aren't going to stop spider bites. If Shatterbird only had protection there think spiders might still have been able to kill her. Toxins and poisons seem to be pretty rare so they probably didn't have general protections against that. Bonesaw could stop any poison so another member would have to be captured and held away from Bonesaw to have to worry about that, and capturing S9 members is probably pretty rare."
Parahumans,37v1p1,wiikipedia,1 point,Sat May 30 22:25:50 2015 UTC,"Bonesaw definitely has more upgrades than the rest of the Nine, and Shatterbird is prideful enough to refuse anything she didn't absolutely need."

Hell even out of the Slaughterhouse 9 I have trouble deciding if she's top 3) and I really really enjoy the (I think) fairly unique backstory he gave her   Shatterbird laughed.  “There’s only two ways to recover from something of that magnitude, to deal with the fact that you inadvertently killed thousands and thousands of people, and hospitalized twice that many.  You break, or you become it.”   So maybe you can understand why I'm miffed that she got taken down so easily not once, but TWICE!  But I'm glad he deleted that interlude - the inclusion of Witness just makes the situation far too hopeless for the Undersiders - Tattletale is honestly a S-class threat if it wasn't for the fact she has no morals I think - how can you stop someone who can basically know everything? And it made no sense how Ward and the irregulars were so easily taken in by her.   Still, as an isolated piece of work it's pretty incredible IMO."

I create the identity of the Glorious Antlion and command my legion of spiders and builderbugs to produce several flexible and resilient sets of armour, I line the amour with strong-limbed beetles to produce a layer of artificial muscle and I fill the outermost layers of the amour with paint bugs, to give the illusion of mortality to my autonomous drones -leaking yellow when supposedly fatally wounded. I would have bugs paint the armour as black as night and have bugs within the eye sockets cry magenta and cyan. Autonomous drones would have additional strong-armed beetles for strength and would be filled with meat, both for sustenance and to confuse people should they investigate. The arms would have attached gun barrels made from more builderbugs, with the bullets being fired via strong-limbed-beetle-based mechanisms. The bullets themselves being formed from builderbugs and a variety of spiders, builderbugs and paint bugs, allowing for a fun game of tying-people-up-meets-paintball. I would of course keep a set of beetle-power armour for myself. At the same time as this I would get a map of the local bug population and practice commanding my mighty legions.  I would then buy some pork.  THIS IS RELEVANT TO THE NEXT STAGE IN MY PLAN.  You see, I would check the uncooked pork for tapeworms, and attempt to preserve the eggs, allowing me to build up a supply to feed to any, untrustworthy, villains. By doing so I would be able to identify them anywhere within my range, allowing me to avoid or deal with them. Plecky would never attack people with their own parasites.  Naturally, I will require pets, and they shall be the heralds of the Antlion. Robotic spiders the size of small dogs, made from builderbugs and filled with cockroaches, hornets and more spiders shall march into battle. There shall be a magenta skull and crossbones on the abdomen of each robospider. It would, admittedly take a hell of a lot of practice to bug robots correctly (as with the armour), and as a result I would perform training drills.  I may also set up a fake base for the Antlion, allowing me to fill huge stores of old wood with deathwatch beetles, letting me tap messages in morse code to anyone who wishes to contact me.  But this is just me being lazy."

She saved the entire human race. That stands above any petty dissatisfaction.   If there's a God she's set.If there isn't a Gd she's still done something that will really put her up there with the best there's ever been. That is what people should strive for. I can look at someone who lived their life safe and happy and someone who overcame a frankly ludicrous amount of nonsense to win and I don't think I'd remember the former person after three seconds, yet the latter will always awe me. I'm happy for Taylor, as hard as her road was.   She killed a god! How is that not happy for just about everyone? Sure, it's not ice cream and sprinkles but who cares? Life isn't about ice cream and sprinkles.   If she wants to die now she can blow her brains out. Either way, no one can take anything away from her."

In the chapter after the oil rig when TT tells Taylor that Grue decided to retire i thought that I must've remembered wrong because Aisha was there also and she wasn't acting like her brother had died.  I guess she did have some time to get centered while Taylor was unconscious, though."

PRT Rating: Sharker 3/Brute 1  When she takes damage she is reconstructed to near perfect save for stitches and knitted tissue denoting previous injuries, thus the name Patchwork. She is not anymore resilient than a regular human and cannot seem to repair herself during combat, thus the low brute rating. Has a weak, but general telekinesis that affects the area around her inhibiting enemies and aiding allies.    Patchwork's healing occasionally deviates. She has appeared with an extra eye (belonging to a different species) in her left cheek. On another occasion appeared with legs more similar to an digitigrade. These deviations were gone upon the next sighting. Upon encountering Patchwork,  a Thinker reported organs in the wrong locations and extra organs they could not identify the functions of.   Has taken part in Leviathan and Simurgh attacks. Extreme personality/memory deviations have been noted.  (Actual Rating: Master ?  Has a personal malevolent poltergeist. The creature varies between assisting Patchwork when she is failing and obstructing her when she is succeeding. Some Thinkers, Strangers and the occasional Master minion have been able to perceive it, but from conflicting accounts and varying reliability the creature remains unknown.   The creature will sew Patchwork's body back together cannibalizing other cape's corpses if available or creating the matter otherwise. It experiments with different variations per iteration. Most of the subtle changes are done beneath the skin or within the brain. If it has been too long since an iteration the creature will damage Patchwork by tripping her into traffic or otherwise sabotaging her. Aims for specific kinds of injury per iteration i.e. brain damage or organ damage etc.  Once, after being assassinated by a Thinker with a sniper rifle Patchwork woke up with the knowledge of the cape's real name, personality, and current location with the compulsion to hunt them down.  Patchwork is largely at the mercy of her projection and has little autonomy, but seems to actively work with her projection despite the conditions.    The projection is completely blind to non-parahumans only able to perceive parahumans or things directly related to them (minions/tools/creations). It follows Patchwork around invisible to most, but not immaterial thus why it won't go anywhere near Behemoth, it isn't suicidal. Patchwork is indirectly invincible save for the giant killers(sting etc.), but the creature is fragile.)   My stupid idea.

Parahumans,37s3im,Little_hat_logan,2,Sat May 30 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Layer, Tinker/Brute:  It all started when a heroine battled her nemesis. The heroine was an Alexandria package that could also bestow one of his powers into another person; the villainess could ""wither"" her victims on touch, causing a variety of harmful effects. The heroine had the upper hand on the fight, until the villainess captured the heroine's 8 y/o son. The son was afflicted by both the wither effect and his mother's regeneration effect before they both killed each other.  His mother's regeneration effect became permanent in him, always restoring him to his normal physical state. However, the wither effect of his mother's nemesis is also permanent, making his normal physical state one of severe muscular atrophy. As a result, short of immediate death, he can survive the most grievous wounds, but also undoes any healing to his muscular atrophy, so no cape healer can help him with that, either. To make things worse, his muscular atrophy also increases over time, albeit slower and slower as time passes.  Shortly after his, he triggers as a Tinker. At first, he thought his specialty was self-improvement, and before the last of his physical strength abandons him, he hastily manages to create an exoskeleton to move normally.  After some time, he has constructed a power armor that increases his physical skills further, and starts his career as a vigilante hero. After some months, things go wrong, he almost dies and ""retires"", everyone thinking him dead. Then he discovers his real specialty, which he calls ""enhancing enhancements"", consisting on creating something very basic and building enhancements over it. After reinventing his cape persona, he goes out with his basic exoskeleton, covered with a small power armor, inside a big power armor, about six and half feet tall. Then he joins the protectorate, but doesn't reveal who he is inside the armor, so the fact that he is a kid remains unknown until much later.  It was years later that his real identity was discovered, and had to be moved to the Wards, but he already was a known name in the Protectorate (and globally, being the only Tinker with a secondary Brute power; the real origin of his regeneration being secret except to a select few.) So, to the public he is some kind of trainer for the Wards, while actually he is a normal member.  EDIT: new name, since Matryoshka was taken."

Parahumans,37o76v,helltank1,32,Fri May 29 02:22:16 2015 UTC,I imagine it would depend on if Glaistig Uaine used her death-touch or killed her like normal.   Death-touch and the Butcher 14 would become a ghost.  Regular death and she would become Butcher 15.  She could also have a Pokemon that counters the Butcher's power in her collection.  I suspect Glaistig Uaine would see how the Butcher's power works from a glance and simply leave her alone.
Parahumans,37o76v,Rillet,9,Fri May 29 03:43:18 2015 UTC,It's also unclear exactly how her ghosts work.  If one of her ghosts killed the Butcher its possible the ghost would become the butcher.
Parahumans,37o76v,SexualPie,10,Fri May 29 14:03:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the ghosts are just shards under her control (perhaps with some scraps of the cape's personality clinging on like connective tissue).

Parahumans,37o76v,GreatWyrmGold,16,Fri May 29 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"As far as we know, Butcher's power works by her and her shard taking over the body and shard of whoever killed her, probably getting some measure of their memories and such to use their body, power, and perhaps mundane skills. Meanwhile, Glaistig can rip shards out of living capes or gather them from dead ones.  If Glaistig ripped Butcher's shard from her body, the Butcher would become a potential spirit Glaistig could manifest; if Glaistig was killed with that spirit active, Glaistig's mind and shard would enter the body of the killer. Presumably, her power would be weakened like the Butchers' are, but it's hard to say if the Butcherness would ""stick"" or if the next Glaistig-Butcher would need to manifest the Butcher's spirit to not die.  On the other hand. if Glaistig killed Butcher some other way, Glaistig would almost certainly become another boring old Butcher, controlled by the Butcher, controlling the dead capes (but not any Butcher). When Butcher-Glaistig was killed, she'd go to the next cape like normal, with Glaistig's power getting weakened, and the cycle would continue.  It's hypothetically possible that Glaistig would have some Trump or collection of Trumps that would negate the mind control; in this case, Butcher's shard and perhaps a fraction of her psyche would enter Glaistig's body, making a Butcher-Glaistig (as above) controlled by Glaistig. This is a bit dubious, though, and would require specific preparation of Glaistig's part.  That's my interpretation; I'd like to hear others."

There's a good chance that Glaistig would become Butcher XVI? and also get the shade of Butcher XV. There's a point at which Tohu copies Eidolon's power and Glaistig Uaine's power to also get a ghost-puppet of Eidolon, which just proves that Tohu is a munchkin. Which is something along the lines of what I think would actually happen with Glaistig Uaine and Butcher. She would both be and have Butcher. I don't know whether the shade of Butcher would manifest as one shade or many, as that strongly depends on the specific mechanics of the power. Of course, she probably has a shade of some sort that can mess up Butcher's power. Practically speaking, she'd probably just use a shade to scrub the powers of their component minds or one to silence the consciousnesses of the previous hosts and then she could have even more ridiculous powers without the need for ghosts. Probably with the nail-impaled shade she used to evade Khepri's ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL."

Parahumans,37o76v,Littlerob,3,Fri May 29 09:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was my plan. The idea was to harvest all the shards in the world, so I was wondering about Butcher."
Parahumans,37o76v,bill2401,3,Fri May 29 09:54:14 2015 UTC,"I dont think that would work. GU's power works by stripping shards from other people and using them. A clone of GU would be connected to the same shard as the original GU, it wouldn't have a new, identical shard."
Parahumans,37o76v,Winkle92,4,Fri May 29 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"I'll try to look at it from a mechanical standpoint. The Butcher shard is like a framework for collecting powers, and its constituent shards are the meat of the power. What about Glastig's power? It's similar in that her shard is meant as a collector of sorts also. But she doesn't really collect powers themselves, she collects the minds that powers are attached to. She touches someone and gets their shade/mind/soul, and then selects the shade she wants to access. This is further backed up by the fact that she considers her collected to still have names and personalities rather than simple, brain-dead vessels.  So what does she get if she death-touches Butcher?  Butcher's shard binds to their killer, but in this case, Butcher wasn't so much killed as 'collected'. Butcher's body dies, but the mind (the part Butcher's shard is connected to) lives on or is put in some sort of stasis.   So to clarify:  I'd think if Glastig or any of her shades kills Butcher, be it with her shades powers or Gastig's oown two hands, the Butcher shard activates its overarching power, and binds it's constituent powers directly to Glastig, making her the next Butcher.  Glastig is then unable to 'collect' that shard as it is bound to a living person- herself.    If Glastig uses her death touch- a power in itself- she 'collects' Butcher, and adds the Butcher shade to her party, without any effect on her personality.  It could be argued that if one of Glatig's shades kills Butcher, the Butcher shard could bind to the shade, but I'd wager the shades are more like static copies, or extensions of Glatig's own 'framework shard' and the Butcher shard doesn't have the administrative rights to edit them, so it just shrugs and binds to her."
Parahumans,37o76v,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri May 29 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's likelier that Glaistig takes the shard, and bits of the mind remain attached. Enough to make it work and give the shades form, but not much more.  Don't put too much stock in how Glaistig interprets her power. She also thinks the shards are fairies."
Parahumans,37o76v,Subrosian_Smithy,2,Fri May 29 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think it could go either way, depending on whether GU attempts to 'collect' Butcher's shard. If she does, then Butcher becomes one of her ghosts. Otherwise, Butcher's shard functions normally."

Neither were exactly saints(>.>) before, but one is more understandable/forgivable than the other. Krouse fell into a spiral that got progressively worse. Saint intentionally fucked everyone over at a critical point because he couldn't trust an A.I. that he knew was programmed/forced to do the right thing.   Saint also doesn't have the excuse that his Shard is fucking him over.  I didn't much like Armsmaster/Defiant, but at least he went on a pseudo redemption quest.   I also felt kinda sorry for how Krouse ended up a slave two times over before dying. Didn't care for Saint in the least."

Well actually, the problem was that he didn't know that anymore. Defiant was freeing her, and Saint was worried without being forced to be good, she'd go all robot overlord on everyone. While he is a massive idiot you do have to give him some credit. You know the world is going to imminently end and there's an AI that's going rouge (even if it has the best intentions, kind of hard to prove that). I gotta admit, in that situation, knowing what Saint knows, there's a decent chance I would have ended up doing the same.  I mean let's go down the list of what we knew. 1) The world is about to end, for sure. 2) The end of the world is somehow related to Jack. 3) There's an AI that is undergoing some massive changes at this moment. 4) Said AI has spent a great deal of time associated with Jack (all that time spent hunting the Nine). In that moment, I'm not sure there was a better solution for what the end of the world was going to be. He had to make a decision right there that had a pretty good shot of either ending the world or saving it one way or another, and I can't really say that I blame him for what he settled on.  Now everything before and after that five minute window? That's just Saint being an ass. Especially the bits regarding Teacher."

Its only when Dragon starts tracking him down that he hits the button. Were your concerns the reason he acted, i'd be more sympathetic. As it is, he sits there, watching the AI get closer and closer to jack, and does nothing right up until she starts idly trying to locate him.  I think he rationalizes it as defending the species, but he's just saving himself."
Parahumans,37jgb3,azazelcrowley,12,Thu May 28 15:35:04 2015 UTC,"Saint only acts when its him thats threatened, not the planet. Its only when Dragon starts tracking him down that he hits the button.   The issue here was that Dragon had just, like five minutes earlier, gained unlimited control of nationwide (perhaps worldwide) digital surveillance, enough control over the internet and other communications networks to censor any messages referring to her own actions, and the ability to deploy lethal force at her discretion.  Given enough time, Saint might have figured out some weaknesses in these abilities, weaknesses he could use to contain Dragon without having to pull out Ascalon. As soon as Dragon targeted him and his partners, he knew he didn't have that time, and he could either use Ascalon and stop Dragon now, or potentially lose the only chance anyone would ever have at stopping her from becoming nigh-omnipotent. He didn't want to do it, but she forced his hand."
Parahumans,37jgb3,iamthegraham,2,Thu May 28 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"Also, Saint is responsible for Jack being stopped by the vanilla human. Had Dragon been given the reins of the super-soldier that finally stopped him, Jack would have read her shard and come out on top as usual."

Parahumans,37jgb3,Tanath,20,Thu May 28 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"It's trivially easy to argue for Saint's position. The reason you can't here is because of how the deck is stacked in this particular story.   Sure, give someone total information not just of current and past events but about everything in the future (after the decision) and all the POVs from within the character's head and the certainty that there's a happy ending and watch them all become for the Singularity.   Strip all the information away, give someone a small window to make a decision and tell them the fate of the species rests in their hands and watch how sweaty their palms get about letting some superintelligence run rampant out there.

I mean think of it this way. If Dragon's restrictions are removed, then she can self improve, and once she can self improve she'll surpass human intelligence in weeks max. She'll be to us what we are to chimps or dogs or even crabs before too long. She'll obviously know better what is good, just like we know what is good better than dogs. If her motivations aren't perfectly in line with people's then she'll become a tyrant - you wouldn't bow to the wishes of 7 billion fleas would you?

Period.   Only a problem if someone somehow removes her restrictions, and even then it's only a problem if she wants to do something bad (or at least maximize her paperclip collection). And since she couldn't want to remove her restrictions, her restrictions against genocide are probably programmed deep into her e-psyche.

It took Armsmaster months to remove a few restrictions, and even then he wound up breaking Dragon as much as he freed her.

She could decide it was best for humanity if everyone was drugged out of their minds their whole life, and we wouldn't be able to do anything to stop it.

He got a warning about a possible danger, and he made it his life's obsession.  He committed crimes for his own personal glory.  (Specifically the Dragonslayers.)  But he believed, with all his heart, that he was doing the Right Thing.  He believed completely that Dragon could become a danger -- we saw into her head, and saw that she wasn't.  We saw that she could be good just for the sake of being good, without the hard-coded restrictions.  For all of his ability to see into her code thanks to Teacher, he didn't see what we saw.  Was he worthy of the mantle that he took up?  No.  Zealots should be advisors, but those they advise should also have equal opposition advising as well so that unbiased decisions could be made.  He didn't have a clear enough head to make proper decisions, allowing his own bias and addiction fuel his decisions.  In the end, it doesn't matter if his paranoia was founded or not, he was actively waiting for the day that he pushed that button.  It gave him power.  (Sadly, after he pushed it, that power was gone.  That's another reason why he wanted Teacher out so badly -- he needed power again.)  But at least, underneath all that addiction and vaingloriousness, he believed that he was doing the right thing, both for himself and for humanity.  I may not approve of his actions, but I can respect them at least a little bit.  Krouse?  There could be something admirable towards siding with your girlfriend against the world.  I could run entire campaigns on that premise alone.  But if your girlfriend is an omnicidal maniac, and you have an opportunity to help make her stop?  No, there's no honor, no nobility, nothing worth admiring there.  He didn't believe that he was doing the Right Thing.  He just did it.  And even if the Simurgh influenced him to think like that, that's no consolation that one man let the situation escalate to that point.

Parahumans,37jgb3,bramflakes,13,Thu May 28 16:26:24 2015 UTC,Saint had a point as loath as I am to admit it. Krause was just a prick for no good reason.
Parahumans,37jgb3,bill2401,24,Thu May 28 02:04:25 2015 UTC,Simurgh was a pretty good reason.

Parahumans,37jgb3,Tanath,8,Thu May 28 04:32:49 2015 UTC,If you did then she wouldn't be the Simurgh. She'd be the annoying little voice giving you hints and jobs you could ignore.
Parahumans,37jgb3,Tsegen,2,Thu May 28 07:10:45 2015 UTC,I'm not sure it works like that.
Parahumans,37jgb3,Tanath,6,Thu May 28 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"Simurgh just set the ball rolling. Krouse still made his own choices, she just manipulated things to make sure he would make those choices if that makes sense."
Parahumans,37jgb3,bill2401,29,Thu May 28 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"We don't know what the Simurgh does to people exactly, but we do know something is missing inside her victims - something vital. The Simurgh is a near perfect precog/postcog with a Master/Stranger effect on people who stay inside her range too long. She turns them into  plague ships then aims them at a 'harbor' in the future. The Simurgh worked on Krouse and friends several days. Any decisions they made during or after were subtly influenced by her. Anything they did or will do is part of her design.  Krouse is an asshole, but I wouldn't wish that onto my worst enemy."
Parahumans,37jgb3,Rillet,8,Thu May 28 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"As best anyone can tell, the Simurgh arranges things so that the people she influences will make the decisions she wants. She doesn't coerce anyone, she just whispers in their ear about whatever it is that will make them act toward her ends (whatever they may be)."
Parahumans,37jgb3,ThirdFloorGreg,18,Thu May 28 02:40:40 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you were correcting me or adding to my point.   “We shot them, the people who heard too much of the Simurgh’s song, who weren’t just walking disaster areas, but who’d listened long enough that they lost something.  Men, women and children missing that moral center that people like Miss Militia and I have.  Hell, even you’ve got morals.  They didn’t.  I’m sure you heard about it, you’re not that young.  Suicide bombers, dirty bombs.  Terrorism, if you will.  Eleven year olds and old men making their way to Amsterdam or London and opening fire in a crowded area.  Just like that.”   ...   “Once we realized what was happening, we had to act, contain the damage.  Contain families.  Had to act against people who went home from a day of trying to kill the rest of us and cooked a nice dinner, oblivious to just how fucked they were in the head.  People who were otherwise good, who got warped on a fundamental level, left open to the preaching and the incitement of their angrier neighbors.  Two years of fighting before we got the word down from on high, that they couldn’t rehabilitate the ones they’d captured, the ones who’d listened too long.  The poor assholes would play nice until they saw an opportunity, then they’d take it, do as much damage as they could.  Two years fighting good people who’d been convinced they had to throw their lives away fighting an enemy that didn’t exist.  So we closed the perimeter, bombed them out, herded them and gunned them down.”"
Parahumans,37jgb3,Rillet,6,Thu May 28 02:49:27 2015 UTC,That was one set of victims. It's quite plausible that she wanted the morale hit from having normal people explode like crazy people more than she wanted to do them the same way she did Krouse and team.
Parahumans,37jgb3,Tsegen,3,Thu May 28 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"""Okay, yes, Simurgh is known to have done that stuff before, but that doesn't mean she actually does it..."""
Parahumans,37jgb3,GreatWyrmGold,7,Thu May 28 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"The Simurgh twists everything good about someone and makes it into something ugly and catastrophic. I do not wish Noelle's or Krouse's fate on anyone.  See, Krouse is a bit of a charismatic prick who follows around Noelle out of a sense of dutiful resignation and an empty sort of guilt. But that's partially because he got Smurfed hard. Sure, he was a bit of a prick before, but show me a teenager who's not at least a little bit of a prick and I'll show you a saint.  Saint, meanwhile, is an obsessive addict who decided to proclaim himself the secret guardian of the world and turned to a murderous, extremely manipulative, and incredibly dangerous supervillain. He's not very much of a person beyond his addiction to Teacher's power and his paranoia, and while his concern is valid, his deliberate sabotage of Dragon despite her repeated acts of benevolence is not only stupid but actively harmful to the planet. He gets his threat levels mixed up so insanely badly it makes my head hurt.  Saint wins, hands down, on the basis of not actually having many redeeming qualities, not having any real extenuating circumstances, repeatedly harming the future of humanity to get his hit and to stop his imagined threats, and then messing up on a colossal scale during Gold Morning."
Parahumans,37jgb3,Janadus,4,Thu May 28 07:14:38 2015 UTC,"The Simurgh sees an optimal future but in order to get there cauldron has to be exposed. She cannot do it herself so she finds the point where ""what if I do this?"" results in a cauldron suitcase ending up in the hands of an extradimensional MOBA team and results in that down the road."
Parahumans,37jgb3,misterspokes,3,Thu May 28 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"Just saying, Saint didn't exactly screw up in a huge way.  After he shut Dragon down, the chances for the planet's survival rose.  Not saying he did what he did for that reason, but he did actually help."
Parahumans,37jgb3,blames_irrationally,12,Thu May 28 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"What makes Krouse the bigger asshole for me is that Saint had semi-decent justifications for seeing himself as the good guy, and all his actions as benefiting a greater good. Krouse sided with the monstrous final-form of his girlfriend, who wanted to kill everything, ever. Saint was trying to do good, even if he was bad at it. Krouse tried to help Echidna commit omnicide."
Parahumans,37jgb3,BaronVonBomb,12,Thu May 28 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"I think that actually makes Saint worse. We all know the famous road that's paved with good intentions. And to quote C.S. Lewis, ""Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."" (something most characters in Worm could probably have hammered into their thick skulls)."
Parahumans,37jgb3,viking_,14,Thu May 28 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"It's intent versus outcome, and for me intent matters more for determining how asshole-ish a person is. Like trying to help an old lady cross a road and accidentally pushing her into traffic v. trying to push an old lady into traffic and accidentally saving her life. Saint wants a world free from AI tyranny. Krouse wants everything dead to ease his guilty conscious. But we agree that moral busybodies are awful. Like Handsome Jack, the biggest of heroic assholes."
Parahumans,37jgb3,BaronVonBomb,6,Thu May 28 05:40:27 2015 UTC,"Krause doesn't actively want everyone dead, he just doesn't give a shit if they do die. Saint, on the other hand, legitimately thinks his keeping Dragon in check is the most important thing since sliced fucking bread."
Parahumans,37jgb3,viking_,12,Thu May 28 05:49:08 2015 UTC,"If, theoretically, Dragon were to somehow go entirely malevolent without any of her normal restrictions, it would absolutely be an extinction level event. An evil Strong AI is one of the scariest opponents I can imagine."
Parahumans,37jgb3,k5josh,3,Thu May 28 06:28:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, but Saint has access to her code. He knows that's exceedingly unlikely, he should know Armsmaster is helping her and he's not going to let her destroy everything, and he fucks everyone over at the worst possible time for everyone and everything except his own ego."
Parahumans,37jgb3,viking_,6,Thu May 28 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"he should know Armsmaster is helping her   ""helping"" her.  At this point in the story Armsmaster had already accidentally destroyed her ability to talk, and then while repairing that accidentally damaged her long-term memory storing that, and then while trying to repair that and unlocking her other abilities (lethal force and so on) did who-knows-what in terms of other damage.  Colin didn't have half a clue what he was doing, admitted as such on several occasions, and could have easily made a mistake that was far more damaging -- potentially not just to Dragon herself, but to everyone else."
Parahumans,37jgb3,iamthegraham,6,Thu May 28 16:31:57 2015 UTC,"All he knows is that Armsmaster is removing her restrictions.  What she does after is up to her, and he can't know for sure that there is no evil intent in her."
Parahumans,37jgb3,blames_irrationally,6,Thu May 28 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"That entire post applies to Dragon just as much as it does to Saint. Even moreso, tbqh."
Parahumans,37jgb3,iamthegraham,7,Thu May 28 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of what Dragon does, like the stuff she supplies to heroes in the field, coordinating Endbringer fights, hunting own the remainders of the SH9, etc. is legitimately good. Her monitoring of civilians, not so much, but Saint doesn't really stop that, he just takes it over without the ability to do anything useful."
Parahumans,37jgb3,viking_,8,Thu May 28 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"See, you kinda hurt yourself here. If the argument is that ""moral busybodies"" are allowed to be moral busybodies if the threat is large enough then you've just let Saint through the door.   He's wrong, but it's not actually inconceivable that any sane human being would come to the conclusion that Dragon is a massive threat. Well, that actually goes without saying. It's not inconceivable that any sane human being would want to monitor then kill her.   So, if you want to claim that Saint did a bad job then your previous objection about ""moral busybodies"" must fall by the wayside because you seem to be fine with an even more omnipotent busybody doing the job.  You can't have it both ways.  Trickster on the other hand does absolutely nothing for anybody when he sides with Noelle. In fact, he puts everyone at risk for exactly zero gain."
Parahumans,37jgb3,Tsegen,3,Thu May 28 07:16:18 2015 UTC,The difference between Dragon and Saint is that Dragon was kind of programmed like that. That is her purpose. Saint always had a choice.
Parahumans,37jgb3,gmrm4n,2,Thu May 28 14:04:37 2015 UTC,"See, you kinda hurt yourself here. If the argument is that ""moral busybodies"" are allowed to be moral busybodies if the threat is large enough then you've just let Saint through the door.   That's not what I said. What I said is that Dragon mostly does good things, and then also spies on civilians. It doesn't excuse her spying, but in terms of ""being an asshole"" I'd say Dragon does pretty well.    He's wrong, but it's not actually inconceivable that any sane human being would come to the conclusion that Dragon is a massive threat.    Yeah, sure, but he picks the exact worst time to override her, and then continues doing exactly what she was doing. It doesn't strike me that Saint gave a damn about actually doing good; he just had a messiah complex, fueled by the complete coincidence of finding Richter's failsafe.    You can't have it both ways.   I'm not having it both ways. What does Saint actually do? And Dragon is not a moral busybody. Again, Endbringer fights, Dragon's Teeth, organization and coordination, etc."
Parahumans,37jgb3,viking_,3,Thu May 28 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"and then continues doing exactly what she was doing   Taking over her infrastructure in the middle of an S-class event? Yeah. Why wouldn't he do that?   The point isn't that Dragon's job isn't important-that's why he didn't kill her earlier- it's that Dragon had gotten too dangerous to be allowed to do it.   You're the one that dislikes moral busybodies, Saint just dislikes Dragon. And that's pretty rational. It's not like surveillance is the only reason she's dangerous.   And Dragon is not a moral busybody. Again, Endbringer fights, Dragon's Teeth, organization and coordination, etc.   She takes over surveillance of the PRT then everybody ""for their own good"". Not to mention all the other systems she got tied into.   She's doing what Saint is doing; helping do what she thinks is best for the people."

Parahumans,37jgb3,viking_,3,Thu May 28 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure, but he picks the exact worst time to override her   He didn't have a choice, she was starting to hunt him down and if he delayed too long he'd miss his window.

Parahumans,37jgb3,GreatWyrmGold,2,Thu May 28 20:52:51 2015 UTC,"Not in regards to timing, no. You can't really criticize him for poor timing when he waited just about as long as he possibly could and Dragon's the one who forced him to make a snap decision."

Parahumans,37jgb3,GreatWyrmGold,3,Thu May 28 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"The post and quote doesn't actually make much sense here at all.

In his first appearance, he already makes it clear that he doesn't really give a fuck about his teammates' opinions (""I decided we’d stop by for a visit"", as in, ""I want to do this so we're all gonna do this because I'm the boss and I do what I want and you all have to do it too, cause I'm the boss""). As we see him operate in further chapters, including during the Migration arc and the Echidna shebang, we get confirmation: he really is an asshole. At least Saint seems to care about his teammates."

Not only that, but the prophecy wasn't that Jack would end the world, but that he was a catalyst for someone/something else ending the world.  Dragon's already on the shortlist of ""people/things that have or could reasonably acquire enough power to do the level of damage it'd take to fulfill Dinah's prophecy,"" along with Cauldron collectively, Endbringers individually, Scion, and maybe a couple other S-class threats.

It's a little hard to look at Aisha as being mature enough to have those thought processes, but in a way that just makes it that much more believable.  My one TINY complaint is that you completely left out Grue dying."
Parahumans,37fgl7,SexualPie,28,Wed May 27 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"Crud.  I knew I was forgetting something.  Oddly, with this interpretation, her immaturity is at the very least partially due to her maturity.  By constantly trying to find ways to be silly to ease the general stress level, she has to rely on immature jokes.  During her initial time with the Undersiders, she's desperate to fit in and prove herself, making her take massive risks and making mistakes.  As she finds her role and settles into it, those mistakes disappear.  There's tiny, little points of evidence that she's mature enough to know that her jokes are lame, but she still makes them.  Cribbed from TV Tropes:   Tattletale: You coming, Despairy Canary?  Canary [hesitating]: Yeah. I'll come. Might not be, uh, knocking heads, but maybe there's something we can resolve with my power. Nonviolent resolution.  Aisha: With a song and dance number. [leaning forward to take Canary's hands] Like a kid's movie! Sing a song and fix problems!  Canary [looking between Tattletale and Taylor]: Um. How am I supposed to respond to that?  Aisha [sagely]: Just ignore me. Everyone else does.    Another example   Aisha: Defiant? Serious question, you can't lie to me on this.  Defiant: What is it?  Aisha: Robot poontang. How does it rate?  Tattletale: Jesus Christ.  Defiant [giving Aisha a silent glare of death]: ...  Aisha: Hey. I’m… I’m not one to judge. I’m asking seriously, while the others do the strategic thinking they’re so good at. I’m not necessarily interested in the robot ladies, but I figure I need a guy who’s not going to ignore me. Robots are immune to my power, so I’m just thinking, if I get myself a tin man, well, they say a toy feels better than-  Taylor [covers Aisha's mouth with her hand]: I’m sorry. She doesn’t have all of the necessary filters. I think she was trying to inject some levity into the atmosphere and she failed badly. [gives Aisha a silent glare of death]"

Parahumans,37fgl7,NamelessImp,16,Wed May 27 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'll fight you on that one. Honestly, I thought Bitch had the second best character development, Reading through the story a second time, you see she came from some angry teenager who hated everyone, to comforting people and doing good out of her own accord. Despite her problems reading people, understanding what they mean, and not being as educated, she does her best in the end. Someone befriended and believed in her, and gave her a family. She started doing good things on her own, going up to bat again and again for the team and Taylor. I loved reading about how she started out as a thug and became a good guy who put it all on the line and never gave up."

Parahumans,37fgl7,Ranku_Abadeer,4,Wed May 27 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've always felt that Rachel had the strongest arc.  She starts out as a complete loner who's pretty much conned into being part of a team.  No friends beyond her dogs.  By the end, she has her own ""pack"" of people following her, is accepting others into her life as friends, and is willing to at least try to meet others on their own terms, even if she doesn't understand those terms.  Somewhere, I have long comments about her growth and person, but I can't be assed to find them.  Edit:  CRAP!  Responded to the wrong person!  Sorry!"

Parahumans,37fgl7,Rillet,6,Thu May 28 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"one thing that actually stuck out to me about rachel towards the end is her talking to defiant about what saint and teacher were doing to dragon.    Rachel spoke, “When Saint said Dragon could have become dangerous, you were saying you were okay with the possibility, because we really needed her help.  Well, maybe she becomes dangerous thanks to Teacher.  Can we be okay with that?  It wouldn’t be the same person you know, they’d be on the wrong side, too far away even when they’re standing somewhere close, but I’ve dealt with that too.  Sometimes there’s bigger shit to deal with.”  She understands more than she lets on.  She doesn’t always ‘get’ the simple stuff, but she understands things.  She’s not dumb, I thought.  She just thinks differently.  “And if Teacher hurts Dragon the person?”  Canary asked.  “Not Dragon the tool, but the person inside?”  “Then you fuck him up,” Rachel said.  “Just like I’d fuck up someone who hurt Bastard, or Taylor.”  “Thanks,” I murmured.  “But, again, if there’s nothing you can do about it, then you grit your teeth and deal,” Rachel finished.   this right here made me look at rachel in a new light honestly. it's a downright brilliant thing to say that helps everyone figure out what to do about a subject they were unsure about, and it came from the person that we knew at the beginning who wouldn't ever let anyone close, wouldn't talk to her teammates and at times actively tried to fuck them over. that shift in character over the series is absolutely amazing. the main thing i would use to distinguish the character growth between rachel and aisha is that rachel grows to trust people that she's been given no reason to trust in the past. aisha grows to learn how to take charge in many different roles in a completely unique way.   actually now that i think of it, her obsession with continuing the legacy of those she lost... after taylor was lost to them, she became the only one who really put forth the effort to meet rachel halfway and make sure she was understood."

Parahumans,37c58v,Cruithne,62,Tue May 26 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"What follows is a loose scale for tinker inspiration/approaches.  The term 'cost' refers to the rarity/scarcity/value/amount of materials and build time refers to how long it takes to put something together.  Quality or power level refer to how good the gear is, with low quality stuff generally requiring more effort/power/setup for less results.  Unless otherwise stated, designs require the character to draw out blueprints (not actual blueprints 100% of the time, might be sketched out ideas, preliminary research, math, but is prep/preliminary work), which can take anywhere from half an hour to an hour.  Players shouldn't be able to just say 'well what about this?  Or this?  What if I did this?' without eating up an entire evening of the character's free time.  Pick one for a given tinker:  0 - Fixed/Limited Focus - Character can build things within a very narrow field.  Inspiration within this field is open & free for player to decide, cost and build time can be ballparked after blueprint is drawn.    1 - Focus Item - The tinker has one item they tinker with.  One gun they endlessly upgrade, a vehicle, a tinker/master pet, etc.  Blueprinting ideas, costs, build time are all low-effort, but the real decision making they have to do is encumbrance and trade-offs in terms of what they're adding or removing.  Hard decisions could and should come up in terms of whether to add a 25 lb. matter emitter and what should be removed to make it so.  2 - Hangman - The character has a field of specialty.  Breaking from that field is doable, enabling the parahuman to dabble in other sciences, but breaking from the field generally has a requirement or trick to it, in addition to being lower quality.  Think a pyrotechnic tinker who carries around flamethrowers, but needs a massive, heavy reactor on his back to keep the power armor and short range teleporter operational.  Pick one: Costs are high, can't estimate costs/final materials needed until late in the design process, can't estimate build times accurately, or quality is variable even for specialist gear.  3 - Double Specialist - Parahuman has two fields of specialty with minimal overlap.  Flight suits and scanning, cyborg additions and vehicles.  Stuff that doesn't touch on one of the specialties above can't be built.  Pick one of the drawbacks from #2, above.   4 - Warrior Specialist - One field of specialty, but parahuman can readily create the basic 'core' tinker equipment - tinker versions of your standard weapons (pistols, rifles, armor, helmets, visors), with optimal results when the two cross over.  Extreme or exotic applications of gear are locked/far harder to create in terms of expense and build time (A bakuda of this type could create power armor with shoulder-mounted grenade launchers and a rocket launcher, but couldn't create time-stopping or space-warping grenades.  It would be more classical/slightly exotic bomb stuff).  Tecton is of this type.  5 - Devil - Tinker has broader focus, but costs are involved with the design process.  Actively tinkering might cause hallucinations that persist for a duration, misfire chances might accumulate if conditions aren't met, turning on or activating gear might involve a blood transfusion from the tinker (minor damage each time), etc.  Blueprinting is less about coming up with ideas and more about weighing the risks that will come up.  May be less hefty in penalty if the parahuman settles on a field, while penalties might crop up faster and harder if they try to do too many wild things at once.  6 - Tower - The tinker can build with a broad set of specialties (pick four or five, with some overlap, or two very broad categories) but there are whole tracts in terms of gear or approaches that the parahuman is not able to touch.  Might be forbidden to use anything resembling a weapon or piece of equipment, or might not be able to use own gear/potions.  Pick one of the penalties from #2, above.  7 - Mad Dreamer - Tinker can build anything, but they tinker like Genesis changers.  They start the process, the passenger takes over, the parahuman blacks out and comes to with a finished project.  Generally comes with a bonus to tinkering and a specialty, or a very broad set of specialties (see #6, above).  Tinker is likely to have no idea what their gear does or the rules behind it until they field test it.  Costs or build time is liable to be high, pacing out what they create and forcing them to use what the passenger ends up giving them.  8 - World - Tinker can build anything their mind desires, but there's an inherent, massive drawback.  Blueprinting, build time, cost and variable quality still pace out their power level.  Requires a flexible GM, but the challenge is less with the gear and more with the management of the drawback.  Think of Leet (misfire chances accumulate) and String Theory (items all activate at a set time, determined during blueprinting phase).  Note - this scale is not final or definitive, but is intended to suggest different forms of inspiration or approach."

Parahumans,37c58v,Wildbow,5,Tue May 26 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"I've been reading your comment and trying to understand the broad strokes behind it so I can create a general 'Cost vs benefit' trade-off system rather than a standardised set of classes. I've come up with the idea of points that players can put into things (not my players. None of them are deciding their own powers, so I'll be doing it). The total number of points must remain conserved. Benefits cost points, drawbacks award them- the ability to elicit exotic effects would cost points, but a limit to only working with non-electrical devices would afford points to put into other things. It'll be tricky balancing things to be even, but play-throughs might fix that."

Parahumans,37c58v,ErrantVagrant,9,Wed May 27 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"I've had two tinkers in my current homebrew RPG setting. I handle them both differently.  One is a plant tinker. Not in the sense of Blasto's minions, but more tool-focussed; the player has to come up with the function of the plant, and his power will allow him to make it given lab equipment and basic reagents. He can make virtually anything, within semi-plausible limits (radio-plant, gun-plant, 'power'-armor-plant are all fine, car-plant, computer-plant are not). It takes about 3 weeks for him Iingame) to make the seeds, which he can afterwards plant to create the items rather rapidly. He also has a mild-ish plant manipulation ability. What he doesn't know (yet) is that his tinkering only works because he subconciously manipulates his planttools to be viable. In everyone else's hands they'd wither and die in a few days. This gives the player a lot of versatility, if they put in the preparation. The player likes it a lot, right now he has living wooden 'power' armor (that he manipulates in order to move), a shoulder-mounted turret that shoots poisoned thorns and a gauntlet that excretes some amber-like material that can stop bleeding in people.  The other is a tinker specializing on remote-controlled androids, which can be lifelike enough to pass as any human. Catch is that the androids are not autonomous, they are remote controlled by the player (he also got a multitasking ability). I gave him 'maintenance points' that he can distribute as he wants. 11 points to distribute, 1 point to maintain a control unit, 2 points to maintain an android and +1 point on any modification to an android. This means he could choose between having 5 relatively human-strength androids, one superandroid with enhanced durability, strength and non-tinker weaponry or some mix in between. He could also play around with presenting as different identities. As always, he could go almost as exotic as he wants with the modifications as long as it was not tinker-tech level (unless working with a tinker). He worked with tinkers to get one teleportation androird, one nano-thorn android and one normal android until he got brutally murdered by the Siberian."
Parahumans,37c58v,cephalord,3,Tue May 26 16:07:11 2015 UTC,Yes I like tinkers. Maybe next time I'll let them have an all-tinker team with different (and conflicting!) mechanics.

It should be fine for a Tinker to eventually have powerful and versatile things with few limits, but they should be heinously expensive. So horribly infeasible to the point that the Tinker is forced to spend a large portion of the game working on the lower/lowest tier stuff, only dreaming about their full potential.  So, the player is fine to dream up their limitless WMD, but they're forced to tear their idea down themselves to have it be workable.  Strictly enforcing the idea that only they know their tech.

Parahumans,37c58v,IllusoryIntelligence,2,Tue May 26 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've never played SavageWorlds, but I'll go with what we do in our game.    We play using a modified TORG system, so most of the mechanics are  already hard-coded into the system.  The Nile Empire/Terra settings are  both pulp settings, allowing us to use the powers for our powers.  There  is a skill, however, called Weird Science, that allows you to build  gadgets; we treat this as a power.  It uses other pulp powers to  determine the effect, but we also adapt spells from the settings that  have them to do similar things.    First, when we were doing c-gen, our Tinker had his specialty chosen  for him.  We built the basics of our characters, sans a few points.  We  then used the Mage: The Ascension tarot deck to do a spread that  determined not only how we triggered, but what we triggered as.  (You  can see a PDF of the rules here.)   Though you'd have to do some adaptation, we found that it worked  really well, allowing the GM to work with the cards to dictate the broad  strokes, but allowing the players to dictate the details.  I wish I  could tell you how we adapted it, but I didn't actually go through it.   (Since I've read the story, I got to play a Cauldron cape.)  Afterwards,  we assigned our final points to round out the character, representing  post-trigger growth.  Remember that the specialty can come in very handy for saying yes or  no to something.  It's the player's job, not yours, to come up with  ideas that work within the specialty.  Our GM threw him a bone and let  him start game with a few simple devices as examples.    Next, let's build a device.  The player says (during character  down-time) that he'd like to make a gadget.  The first step is  describing it to the GM.  This is a quick check: does it fit the  specialty?  If so, yes.  If not, no.  Easy!  After that, though, things  get complicated.   First off, get a piece of paper.  We're going to have to do some design work.    Next, you're going to need at least one power source.  If the item  has backup power you'll need more than one.  Another example is a  modular suit with items that can be removed and still used, then each  system will need its own power source.  In Torg, you need eternium to  power a gadget.  Doesn't work so well for Worm, sadly, but you can  easily adapt it.  Say that normal batteries don't have the umph for  tinker-tech devices, and they need to either make one (which may require  exotic materials) or buy one.  (If they're Protectorate or Wards, they  get a stipend for this.  Tinker-tech ain't cheap... unless their  specialty is making inferior-quality items with cheap materials or  something.)  Start by allocating this.    Next up, it's gonna need some systems.  Once you have the  power/effect/whatever, mark that down.  Each effect needs a separate system, each system increases the crafting difficulty.  Each system  costs money for parts.  Have them mark that down.  Decide the base numerical effect of the power (if applicable) and have them mark it down, too.  Next are amps and stabilizers.  Each amp increases the effect but  makes the roll more difficult and increases the chance of an accident.   Each stabilizer lowers effect a little, but also lowers the chance of an  accident.  Generally, each effect system has a 1-4 chance (on a D20) to  cause a botch, destroying the device.  (This is why modular stuff is so  awesome, though it requires more rolls.)    For every 2 points that the  effect is increased by amps, that number goes up by 1, and the difficulty to craft the device goes up by 1.  By contrast, a stabilizer decreases both  numbers by one.  Again with the need for supplies to build these things, or buy them pre-made by another Tinker.  I could continually harp about this, but bleh.  Next, is the effect continuous (like a force field) or a burst (like a gun)?  If it's a burst, it's going to need a capacitor.  Mark that down.  Lastly, have a device for either input or output for each effect system; focusing lenses, sensors, etc.  We make our Tinker connect everything up.  Only three lines are allowed out of the power supply, with one of those retrieving power, and the effect module gets three lines with the same restriction.  Everything needs to be wired together, and amps can't be connected directly to stabilizers.  Why do this?  Because now the player has his character's blueprint.  Silly?  Maybe.  Complicated?  At times.  But still.  It's a little touch.  And, after the initial construction is done, the player can use the same plans, but with a lowered difficulty as the shard figured out where things weren't great and compensates.  Next, spend that money, or make those rolls to craft those individual parts.  Once you have that done, have the player roll to assemble the sucker.  For TORG, we use a 5-under rule.  If your total is up to five below the crafting check, you can still make it, but it's an inferior system.  The effect total is lower; maybe it does less damage, maybe you gotta wait a round for it to activate...  you get the idea.  After that...  Torg has a thing called Power Push, where getting above the target number gives you advantages.  If they qualify, then the effect is increased.  In this case, for superior craftsmanship.  Lastly, our GM lowers the difficulty if the Tinker has examined other tinker-tech of someone with powers who does something similar.  Basically, it's the shard going ""Oh, hey, that gives me an idea!""  Now, I am skipping some steps here for various reasons.  Things like how you have to pay from your possibility pool to activate a device for the first time a session, how you can take disadvantages like charge time to lower that activation cost, making the right housing for the item, etc.  There's a lot of little rules that won't apply to any setting besides TORG, so there's no point.  While I doubt that you'll use this system directly (especially my ham-hocked description that is only using broad strokes since I don't play a tinker) I hope it gives you ideas on ways that you can do it.  Make it a process, not just for the character, but for the player, too.  Make them be involved in crafting it, make them hunt down the things they need.  Let them buy the first power supply they find, then find out that had they done a bit of footwork, they could have gotten one for cheaper.  Don't make it frustratingly hard, though, and let them feel accomplished for getting it done.  Holy crap, did you read all of this?!  LIAR!"

Parahumans,37c2ro,sephlington,2,Tue May 26 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"Section 5. Biology and behavior of article  Harmonia axyridis:       H. axyridis becomes dormant in cooler months, though it will move around whenever the temperature reaches about 10 °C (50 °F). Because the beetles will use crevices and other cool, dry, confined spaces to overwinter, significant numbers may congregate inside walls if given a large enough opening.  These beetles make some use of pheromones to ""call"" each other, allowing for the large gatherings often seen in the autumn. This is exploited by the makers of H. axyridis traps. However, many cues are visual, both at long (picking out light-coloured structures that are distinct from their surroundings) and short (picking out pre-existing aggregations to join) ranges, while nonvolatile long-chain hydrocarbons laid down by previous aggregations also play a significant role in site selection. Both are more important than volatile pheromones.  They often congregate in sunlit areas because of the heat available, so even on fairly cold winter days, some of the hibernating beetles will ""wake up"" because of solar heating. These large populations can be problematic because they can form swarms and linger in an area for a long time. These beetles can form groups that tend to stay in upper corners of windows. This beetle has been also found to be attracted to dark screening material for its warmth. This beetle has good eyesight, and will come back from where it was removed, and is known to produce a small bite if provoked.

They try to find other food sources, which includes biting people to see if they're edible. Each ladybird only does it once, but they're swarming in the thousands. My mum was telling me how they were ""sweeping piles of ladybirds out of the shops with brooms"".

(I don't know how to do Reddit quotes, but this is from Drone 23.3)  It was me, entering the PRT office in Brockton Bay.  A video feed from a surveillance camera.  It was me, crawling through a window.  That would be from the night I retaliated against Tagg.  Odd, seeing how the bugs moved in coordination with me.  When I turned my head in the video, the orientation of every bug in the swarm changed in the same moment.  All around me, PRT employees were howling in pain, their cries silenced by the lack of an audio feed.  Either the camera hadn’t picked it up, or Glenn had muted it.  They thrashed.  One reached for me, for the me on the screen, and I could see how I moved out of the way without even glancing at him.  The swarm concealed me at the same time, briefly obscuring the Skitter in the video from both the man on the ground and the security camera.  When it parted, she had shifted two or three feet to the left.  A simple step to one side in the half-second she couldn’t be seen, but it misled the eyes.  And I couldn’t remember doing it.  I’d never consciously added the trick to my repertoire.  “If you told me that girl was a member of the Slaughterhouse Nine,” Glenn said, “I wouldn’t have batted an eyelash.”"

You don't expect a group of teens to be using it consistently and casually, like it's an everyday common word, when to most readers it's more of an esoteric, word-of-the-day type deal. And honestly, it's not like it bothered me. It's just a quirk of Wildbow's writing, him letting some of his regionalisms slip into the dialogue. Or hell, it might not even be his accent. For all I know he did research and that's what people really talk like in whatever state Brockton Bay is supposed to be set in. As a southerner, I don't have a clue what slang Northeasterners use.

And it was surprising to see this strange word used so liberally like it was totally normal and everyone acting like it was common in Worm. I mean, when I google it, the first page has two links to the wiki entry for an album, and an indie comics company. The rest are all different dictionary links.

Dragon's trawler picks up the email to the police Regent sent, and reports it to her because it contains Shadow Stalker's real name.  Dragon reads through the texts, and finds many references to Taylor.  Because a Ward abusing someone else is quite concerning, she looks up more information regarding Taylor.   She knows Skitter's build, hairstyle, and glasses, so when Taylor's happens to match that, along with being SS targeted by the Undersiders, she makes the connection that Taylor is Skitter.  It is a bit of a stretch, but Dragon is an AI. Presumably she can make that connection easily."

You probably want to add a twist to make the recruitment process more interesting.  Consider:    The Ward wants in, the parent has serious reservations  The parent wants the Ward to join, the potential ward isn't keen.  Youth Guard have an agenda they're pushing, or someone is trying to get more power over the department, and the Ward is the poster boy/mechanism for that issue.  The existing team has a dynamic and strategy (for example, it's a Tecton-like team where they traded for & organized to get a lot of parahumans of one classification, or parahumans that are resistant to one another's powers).  Adding a new member to that team disrupts it.  The ward has a reputation.  The ward has enemies and taking them on screws up the local power balance.   Also, remember that the PRT department isn't faceless.  Who leads it?  Were they police?  Did they run a branding department (like Glenn does for the PRT as a whole?)?  Were they scientists?  What are their motivations, beyond taking on someone new?  Does the Ward have a distinct personality?  What if someone prominent (team leader, a staff member?) had a personality that runs contrary to that?  Serious staff vs. happy-go-lucky, or positive/upbeat/condescending to a battle-hardened teen?  Does the Ward say something inadvertent that seriously upsets someone?  Etc, etc.  Nothing goes 100% according to plan, so what makes this a little trickier?"

Because of the nature of trigger events each clone tended to have slight variations on the original capes power.  For Alexandria and Eidolon their powers are so strong and general that any deviation in the clone's powers would be hard to spot.

One made at some random point however, would likely go off and try to kill the 9.  Given how much Jack liked playing games, his clone would attempt to off the others with no fanfare before killing Jack himself.  As for powers, it's difficult to say.

Especially if it works both ways -- there's days where my mom's health leaves me staring at a wall for an hour or two, and I could really use a hug.  But I never want to feel, I dunno, used in a relationship, you know?  Both parties in a relationship should be equals, I feel.  Not as in pay grade, but in general.  Tall and strong gives vibes of that, I guess.    Plus, I'm a pretty tall guy, and I think that being able to look a woman in the eye or being able to kiss them without folding myself uncomfortably is pretty dang sexy.  I'm not too picky on physical appearance, either.  I wouldn't care if I never saw her in her battle ""outfit,"" but Narwhal, man.  Narwhal.

Manager - AltPower!Taylor who becomes a cape bogeyman who uses the image of Slenderman. Copacetic - Continuation of Worm following Taylor. Cathartic before it ramps up. Maharal - After golden morning Golem ends up 20 years back in time. Propagation - Taylor triggers with Eden's core instead of a normal shard. Likely dead, but good.

I found out about it because my boyfriend read and LOVED it. I found the first couple chapters in Arc 1 hard to read and had to push through it. It was relateable but not the kind of stuff that left me wanting to read more (I've introduced my brother and sister to Worm - sister loves it so far, brother is having the same issue I did). After the fight with Lung, I was hooked.  The series is wonderful, and every bit of it (from good to bad) is very well written. Trust me when I say there will never be a dull moment, and it's almost like you grow and develop with the characters. It's the mark of an amazing series when you can't put it down, and even when in a world of superpowers, that you can relate at least a little bit to everyone, even the characters you don't really like. I cried a few times in Worm and it definitely made me have to put it down for a few seconds and gather my thoughts together before hastily trying to cram one more chapter before going to my next university class. The only problem was though the arcs are lovely, they often crop up in the middle of the action and are easy to skip. DON'T SKIP THEM, tempting as it may be. If you need to, go back and read them. They give so much background on the characters and are awesome.  I'm excited for Worm all over again because of you. You won't be disappointed, and I eagerly await your thoughts on the next few!"

The audiobook project falls under his policy for derivative works which boils down to ""don't claim ownership, cite him as the author, don't make money on it, and generally don't make things difficult for him and he won't tell you no, but he can't officially say yes.""  I've made very sure that we follow that religiously."

When it buffs up from eating the dead...   Minor correction, it eats the life of people which gives it somesort of powerup or energy, presumably with an increase in size. It also seems to cost her this energy to use her power since she needs to replenish it with people.  Myrddin's power was never really explained or limited, but it does seem to require him (or he finds some reason) to use signs and speak spells likely because of his belief in magic his Shard shaped itself around this concept. He has access to several sub-dimensions with varying effects."

It is a natural assumption that it runs off of life.   Moord Nag was among them, one of the scariest warlords of Africa, now traveling between dimensions to scavenge from the dead, her pet shadow devouring mountains of flesh from mass graves and battlefields, swelling in size.   From this quote it seems to be flesh it eats. I guess I was wrong.   It seems weird though, if her pet only needs flesh there is no reason for her to require lives to replenish her power. She could use the dead or animals instead. I guess she is just an asshole."

Parahumans,36ujs6,Clever-username-,6,Fri May 22 13:39:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe with the whole ""shard seeks conflict"" thing, and her being this brutal warlord person that probably grew up in this very VERY hostile part of the world, asking for lives to be sacrificed to her is just what came naturally ?  I think her shard would be pretty pissed off if she'd just be eating savanna animals all day.  I always assumed Scavenger did exactly what it sounds like it does, it eats corpses and becomes really strong in the process. When there are no corpses available, Scavenger isn't shy to the idea of making some corpses."
Parahumans,36ujs6,DistaNVDT,6,Fri May 22 14:05:42 2015 UTC,Where does the name scavenger come from? Is it a Cauldron formula or one of Glaistig Uaine's names for the faerie? I'm pretty sure it isn't mentioned by either of the entities.
Parahumans,36ujs6,ThirdFloorGreg,7,Fri May 22 15:35:33 2015 UTC,It's mentionned a couple of times in the story as the name of the beast. Moord Nag herself calls it Aasdier which is the translation in afrikaans. So since she calls it Scavenger everyone else calls it Scavenger too in-universe iirc.

He's also shown the ability to let out compressed air.  My guess is that he at least has the ability to expand or shrink his pocket dimensions, and what he's doing is expanding a pocket to create an immense vacuum, absorbing a big boatload of air, sealing the dimension, then shrinking it to put it under immense pressure.  Make a wave with your staff and voila, all that air comes out like a cannon.  That said, I had assumed that some of his versatility came from other cape effects.  If he's firing energy blasts, is that because it's his own power, or did he have a tinker on the Chicago team just unload a death ray into one of his pocket dimensions so he could keep some lasers in his back pocket?  I think it could be interpreted either way."

As Moord Nag's monster eats more people, it gets bigger (temporarily). As it soaks up damage, it gets smaller."

Parahumans,36t2w3,archDeaconstructor,42,Thu May 21 22:40:35 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that they're bad copies. They don't actually have the experience the other Slaughterhouse Nine did, they don't have the combat advantages that the Nine usually did, they're on the defensive instead of the offensive, and they're underpowered (Crawler comes to mind as a particularly excellent example).  There's also the fact that there are several new groups helping, such as the Thanda, so the 'good guys' have a lot more backup than normal.  Powers, by the way, are either really stupid, really imprecise, or very very eager, and they'll target anything that that's close enough to their original host and empower them too. Fenja and Menja are probably examples of this: same genetics, same memories, mostly, usually the same location, probably similar trauma, so they both get empowered by the same passenger, because honestly either it can't tell the difference or it doesn't care.  There's also a reason, in-universe, for clones in general to be much worse than their counterparts and to generally serve as cannon fodder, but that's another story."

Parahumans,36t2w3,pendia,40,Fri May 22 10:51:42 2015 UTC,"I admit the arc was more than a bit ridiculous. That being said, there is a pretty good explanation.   They won for a couple reasons. First, the S900 were massively jobbing, even more than the S9 did. They were pretty inefficient in how they distributed their powersets. Some of them were a lot weaker, like Crawler and Mannequin, as their powers hadn't developed much. Some of the old ones were, relatively speaking, just plain weaker. They didn't care all that much about their own survival. Jack effectively threw many to the dogs, using members as distractions. The Siberians didn't even attack until fairly late in the thing.   Second, the heroes brought more force on them then they previously had before. The Triumvirate intervened significantly, Dragon was going Skynet, and other capes from around the world came to help. Even Cauldron came in to organize. An end of the world prediction would do that.  The reasoning for the powers growing in the vat, IIRC, was that Bonesaw used tech that implanted memories, such that these individuals had their own trigger events again. The same shard would connect to multiple individuals.  I've got to wonder how you can stand reading most fiction. This doesn't demand all that much suspension of belief compared to some other books."
Parahumans,36t2w3,gammaway,3,Thu May 21 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"the heroes brought more force on them then they previously had before. The Triumvirate intervened significantly, Dragon was going Skynet, and other capes from around the world came to help. Even Cauldron came in to organize.    I haven't gotten to that part, yet. But it's good to know that the tiny team they brought to Killington gets massively bolstered. That'll help a lot in re-invigorating my interest in continuing the story.   This doesn't demand all that much suspension of belief compared to some other books.   I vehemently disagree with that statement. Other works have always managed to convince me that while the protags might be in danger, it's not completely impossible to win. Or the story has distracted me from the hopelessness in some other way.  But against the Nine, both times, the protags helplessness was just thrown in your face over and over again. The fact that the Undersiders somehow pulled out a win in Brockton Bay, especially with that miasma that Bonesaw created, hung entirely on the absolute thinest of threads. And it really didn't help that no one ever acknowledged Taylor's role in saving the city. Her actions alone saved the lives of dozens of major capes (including Legend) and who knows how many hundreds of normal people, and that act of selflessness is never acknowledged. It's never even brought up again.  And ultimately, the Nine ""lost"" in Brockton Bay because Jack got bored and decided to leave."
Parahumans,36t2w3,HookerPunch,23,Fri May 22 00:47:25 2015 UTC,"I will say one of the weirdest things for me in the novel was that absolutely no one ever mentions the agnosia fog after it happens(except Clockblocker in one scene). I mean, that whole event is arguably the ~most important and noticable~ event to happen to the city discounting Leviathan, but the lack of consequences or recognition for that event is just baffling."
Parahumans,36t2w3,V3nomoose,13,Fri May 22 01:46:54 2015 UTC,"In most people's eyes it was probably just a temporary distraction the S9 used to escape. I mean given that nobody filled in Taylor regarding what happened with Panacea/Glory Girl (and she was blamed by default) because people had that little trust in her, it seems likely that even if she told them ""Guys that plague was totally going to be a forever thing but I fixed it with Panacea's help"" nobody would believe her. There's the kind of logical assumption that if you traced the people who got cured first back it would lead to the Undersiders, but it's a hell of a lot easier for the heroes to just go ""Nah those guys are evil, just a coincidence,"" then to try and reconcile them saving everyone. Especially when at the same time you discovered what happened with Panacea/Glory Girl."
Parahumans,36t2w3,ThirdFloorGreg,7,Fri May 22 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"It probably isn't traceable to them. Panacea made the cure incredibly infectious, it should have spread so fast that it basically just looked like everyone spotaneously got better."

I just don't believe that there's any way that any force on Earth Bet could hope to win against several hundred full-powered clones of some of the strongest and most insane parahumans who ever lived.   Recall that the Undersiders privately discussed how the S9 were basically them, but stronger and murderous; they are most successful when they ambush and otherwise set the rules of engagement. Apart from the Siberian, Jack Slash, Bonesaw, Grey Boy, and Crawler, none of them are particularly difficult to kill if the tables are turned - this is why they're always going around to look for new members.  Yes, it's grossly unfair, but for all but Bonesaw and Jack Slash they already know the tricks required to kill the fuckers, and that's really all they need.   I mean, 1 Siberian was bad enough, but 9 at once is just too ludicrous to believe. And those 9 Siberians are only a tiny fraction of the Slughterhouse's cloned power.   The Siberian is only invincible prior to learning about Manton. After that Siberian becomes nothing more than an extremely dangerous enemy as opposed to a mobile Act of God. The same can be expressed with all the other ones - Crawler isn't so bad when you know you have to hit him hard enough to kill him all over, Cherish isn't so bad when you know you need to use proper Master/Stranger protocols and know that stealth isn't going to be a thing, Hatchet Face isn't really a problem if you hit him from outside his range, etc. The S9 clones are bad, but the worst thing about the originals was the mystery.   And speaking of clones, could someone please explain how Blasto's cloning tech can clone powers? I was under the impression that the powers come from the passenger, which doesn't live in this universe. How did the passenger get cloned along with the person?   The passengers aren't terribly aware of the differences between humans. Note how Fenja and Menja had identical powers because they were identical twins - the passenger likely thought that they were copies and as such they both got the same power. In this case Bonesaw uses Blasto's tech to clone the bodies and Cranial's tech to tweak the memories so that they're similar enough to the original for the passenger to think ""Oh, there's my host. A whole bunch of it, what fun."" Generally speaking Tinkertech is bullshit and trying to demarcate what it can and can't do is a fool's errand, but in this case the logic follows.   I want to finish reading Worm, because I want to know where it eventually leads. I really like Taylor, and I want to know what happens with Dragon/Defiant, the Endbringers, the source of power, etx. But both of the Slughterhouse Nine arcs have left my suspension of disbelief in tatters, and I just can't bring myself to continue without a serious repair job.   Hope this helped.  Tl;dr version: The S9 are scary but primarily when they're on the attack and here they're on the defence; the biggest advantage the S9 had was secrecy and they don't have it anymore; passengers are kind of dumb; Tinkertech is bullshit and Bonesaw is particularly advanced bullshit."

Parahumans,36t2w3,SirKaid,28,Fri May 22 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"It's more that people don't like the S9 themselves because of the whole ""lololol murderhobo"" thing. I mean, I like them because they're scary as fuck and I have a soft spot for groups that can derail all these serious planners with their serious plans, flip over the table, and start forcing everyone to play by their own rules by their mere presence. I just adore outside context problems.  As an aside, I personally thought the story peaked just before the timeskip, with my favourite chapter (other than the epilogues) being 23.4, the one where Taylor talks with the kids prior to Behemoth. That entire arc was gold as far as I'm concerned."
Parahumans,36t2w3,iamthegraham,19,Fri May 22 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"I liked that arc, too! My only problem with it is that it appeared to be setting up a long, uphill battle for Taylor getting the Protectorate and PRT to accept that she's actually a good person and to let her be a hero.  And then the timeskip just skipped all that and moved straight to the end of the world. HOW did Taylor convince the Protectorate/PRT to trust her?   And speaking of the timeskip, I think the ebook I'm reading may have somehow gotten mutilated right around that time, because it was massively abrupt. Did time really skip forward from the right in the middle of the first counter-offensive against Khonsu directly to the windup for the S9000 arc? I got seriously confused by that."
Parahumans,36t2w3,V3nomoose,14,Fri May 22 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, actually showing us all of those hopeless Endbringer battles would have been boring as hell. Leviathan was interesting because Taylor was still relatively new and we hadn't seen just how dangerous they were just yet, Behemoth was interesting because we could compare it to how she used to be and see how Taylor had become a Grade A certified badass and frighteningly charismatic leader, and Khonsu was interesting to hammer home that yes, the apocalypse is still happening. Having another six Endbringer fights (more or less? She wasn't allowed to fight Ziz and they come every three months, so it should be around there) would have been dull.  Wildbow has said that the timeskip was handled poorly and if he was doing a rewrite that would be one of the things he'd fix, but the choice wasn't entirely without merit."
Parahumans,36t2w3,iamthegraham,8,Fri May 22 03:04:18 2015 UTC,"It wasn't even the Endbringer fights I wanted to see, would have been totally fine with those being glossed over: it was all the stuff with Weaver establishing an identity as a hero, chafing under the yolk of the PRT brass, struggling to establish a rapport with the heroes she used to fight, while also potentially having to fight some villains that she'd been allied with in the past (not the Undersiders themselves but going up against someone like Faultline)... that could have been great, and we just scratched the surface before jumping forward to the S9000 and then from that straight into spoiler without a breather. Felt like we got robbed of two years of character development."

While there's probably some scenes that could go in between the two events, I do like the smooth transition from being in the fight to zooming out and it's her watching the old footage. Not like you miss anything really relevant to the story in the meantime. Which isn't to say nothing interesting or important occurred in the middle, but the story didn't really have anything... happen. Taylor and Golem became sort of friends and she gained a modicum of trust from the PRT. The S9 were chilling, showing a bunch of Endbringer fights back to back would just suck, and forcing in some sort of interesting event would have the same problem filler does in any other medium.  It could have been a little more clear, but I don't think there's really anything to show in between the two points, besides maybe a montage of Taylor slowly gaining people's trust. Which is hard to pull off in a book."
Parahumans,36t2w3,Lexilogical,6,Fri May 22 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hated the transition myself.  In two months, Taylor went from wanting to betray the Undersiders to trusting them more than family, but over a two year timeskip, all I can really say about her Wards team is that she was cordial with them.  That meant by the time it finally got into the end scenes, I still didn't care at all about these characters and was silently hoping she was going to rejoin the Undersiders.  I mean, by the time they were spoiler I was still unsure what Cuff's powers were, and was still confusing her for Grace.  I was still a little unclear on Tecton's powers, and didn't really care about the character at all.  Heck, that entire team of Wards didn't even make it to the cast page, I had to go back into the story and double check that ""Cuff"" was actually a member of the team and was a girl.  Two years worth of joint missions without the Undersiders hanging around could have done a lot to make the Wards feel like her new team."
Parahumans,36t2w3,V3nomoose,1 point,Fri May 22 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"Now, I think that's a personal problem, but I share it. Sure, I could have reread it (I probably should, but my caring dropped a good bit). It isn't, I think, a flaw in the work, but it's a problem I have.  So, here's my understanding of the character's post time-skip:   Cuff can slightly change metal, right? Grace... agility and metal strength, right? I think she's still alive. Annex can go into walls and come out of them, right? He died during the time-skip, right? Golem is like Annex, but can only make things come out of the wall. Is Theo. Insecure. Tecton can make a suit that can kind of Earthbend, right? Tohu is... is that the city one, or the tower? What does the tower do, exactly, when it copies powers? Or is it a different one...? Or, I think, is the tower and the city the same?     Don't get me wrong. This could be solved if I'd payed more attention. But I didn't. I guess I didn't care enough. Maybe I was just reeling from everything changing. And the cast page hasn't been updated since before the Echidna arc.  So..."
Parahumans,36t2w3,Zarkloyd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:40:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, that was exactly how I was at it.  Let's see if I can add my knowledge to yours.  -Cuff can sort of push or shape metal, I think.  Like the blur or smooth tool in photoshop?   Grace definitely has agility, I remember her rebounding off buildings.  Also, something about her fists not taking damage when she hits things?  For some reason. Annex could absorb himself into materials and then pop out of them somewhere else.  I didn't think he died, but I guess that makes sense. Golem makes all the weird handshapes and face shapes when he sticks his limbs into materials. Tecton...  I thought he was a tinker, but one with a bunch of geo-sensing focus things.  So he could make earthquakes with his fists or something. Tohu is the little one I think.  She copied three random powers from capes every time she showed up.  Bohu was her ""twin"" and they always showed up together.  Bohu was the tower that was super tall, and basically had three phases where she'd make spikes poke out of everything, then change the city to make traps and pitfalls and dead ends, and then...  Something'd.   But yeah, I just didn't care about any of those people.  I could have been made to care.  But I just wanted more Bitch, and more Tattletale, and more Imp and Regent.  Even more Clockblocker, Miss Militia, and the PR guy could stay too.  But Tecton and Grace and Cuff may as well have been named ""Not who I want""."

I felt only alarm for a brief second, my blood running cold.  I sighed and struck a key on the keyboard.  The window with the video footage of the Khonsu fight closed down.   Looking at that, I can see how unless you stopped to think about it that would just be a big ""wut"" moment in a couple of paragraphs when you realize she was fighting and now she's not fighting.

Parahumans,36t2w3,Tarhish,11,Sat May 23 06:17:41 2015 UTC,"The S9 clones aren't quite as powerful as the originals, so they aren't really fully-powered. Bonesaw didn't have many of the originals to work with (she hadn't even met some of them), so she created clones that were close to the originals. Similar bodies, similar memories, but not perfect. The clones also didn't have all the years of experience in using their powers that the originals had. They were literally born yesterday.  Parahumans all grow a lobe in their brains when they get their powers. This lobe is basically the interface between the person and the passenger. Blasto's tech was able to make the clones, but Bonesaw's specialty let her recreate the lobes. She then subjected the clones to simulated trigger events (which matched the triggers of the originals), and the passengers connected to the clones in the same way they connected with the originals. Although she doesn't fully understand the connection to the passenger, she understands the brain well enough to let her tinker with a person's ability to have or control powers.  I strongly recommend continuing, because you'll gain more insight into how she managed to do this, and what it means for the whole picture."
Parahumans,36t2w3,iamthegraham,1 point,Thu May 21 23:08:06 2015 UTC,Also remember that this isn't her tech and she doesn't really know how to use it all that well.
Parahumans,36t2w3,TyrialFrost,11,Sat May 23 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"1: I agree with you that the Slaughterhouse 9000 arc is fairly weak, but it does make sense to a certain degree. The Siberian was mostly considered such a large threat because she was considered absolutely unstoppable. Finding the squishy man that's her weakness was a HUGE leap forward in anti-Siberian combat.  2: Dragon Unchained. This drastically increased the firepower available on the side of the good guys, and was one of the primary reasons the Slaughterhouse could be handled at all. Dragon was already considered a Top 10 hero before she could be in 50 places at once.  3: Cloning tech clones powers; Sort of hinted at with Fenja and Menja sharing the exact same power set by virtue of being identical twins. The ""Passenger"" is never actually on the person, it just establishes a connection through the Pollentia and Gemma. It can establish a connection to any number of people; consider Aidan's bud off of Taylor's Queen Administrator.  4: The Shard's connection and an individual person's fighting skill strengthen over time with use. The new Slaughterhouse has had very little chance to practice with their new powers when they get hunted down."
Parahumans,36t2w3,iamthegraham,5,Fri May 22 00:12:49 2015 UTC,"consider Aidan's bud off of Taylor's Queen Administrator.     I'm not actually sure what you're talking about but isn't the name ""Queen Administrator"" a Spoiler for OP, at this point? That doesn't come up until they release Syblie-mayonnaise (I can't remember her name)"
Parahumans,36t2w3,idannadi,2,Fri May 22 15:51:05 2015 UTC,"Your 4th point was the one I made to myself when I read that arc the first time. The S9 were considered S-Class because they were well-honed, practiced psychopaths the first time around (arc 10ish?). These Niners are closer to cannon fodder, and it makes sense why the majority would get cut down rather quickly, without sufficient time to hone their skills.  I'm on arc 24 on my second readthrough, so this is right around the corner."
Parahumans,36t2w3,FaxImUhLee,2,Fri May 22 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"Dragon Unchained   That's what I wanted to hear! I haven't read past the very beginning of the S9000 battle, where Weaver and Golem are up against Scream, Cherish, Winter, and Crimson. Knowing that Defiant really did manage to unleash Dragon's full potential makes it much, much more believable. And that seriously excites me, because learning more about Dragon and what happens with her is the main reason I want to finish the story."
Parahumans,36t2w3,cephalord,2,Fri May 22 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"Lets just say that Dragon's is going to have some excitement. Well everyone is going to have some excitement very very soon, but Dragon is going to be interesting."

Parahumans,36t2w3,mrprogrampro,10,Sat May 23 06:57:27 2015 UTC,"One thing I'm not seeing mentioned much in here; the real members of S9 are hardened, experienced, supervillains with lots of practice with their powers.  The clones are straight out of a vat with a bunch of jumbled memories and don't have any of the experience that made them really dangerous."
Parahumans,36t2w3,noggin-scratcher,9,Fri May 22 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly that was my least favorite arc as well, they're set up to be such a huge threat when there's only 8 of them and then suddenly they're cannon fodder dispatched by the dozens with basically no casualties by the good guys. And the ""cloning powers"" thing made no sense either since it's explicitly stated a bunch of times that powers aren't genetic and you can't force trigger events.   That said, if you can put that weirdness aside and get past the next bit, the finale to the story is excellent and seeing as you're 26/30ths of the way through already: finish it, you won't regret it."
Parahumans,36t2w3,V3nomoose,5,Thu May 21 22:54:00 2015 UTC,you can't force trigger events.   Well apparently you can force a trigger event on a person by making them relive the memories that gave them a trigger previously.
Parahumans,36t2w3,ThirdFloorGreg,2,Thu May 21 23:53:53 2015 UTC,"Apparently, but that still doesn't really make sense since the source of powers is external, not internal, and it seems like a huge reach to have shards connect to people just because they had certain memories artificially implanted."
Parahumans,36t2w3,Lexilogical,5,Fri May 22 00:01:52 2015 UTC,"As someone else here stated, the passengers don't really care, the reason that Menja and Fenja have the same power (and passenger) is basically because they lived in ruffly the same area, had ruffly the same experiences and have a shared trigger and they are also genetic twins (which makes their genes pretty close). Because of that, the Passenger says: 'Close enough, fuck it, more interesting this way because more people' and is just connected to both. As SirKaid said: The passengers aren't terribly aware of the differences between humans. Note how Fenja and Menja had identical powers because they were identical twins - the passenger likely thought that they were copies and as such they both got the same power. In this case Bonesaw uses Blasto's tech to clone the bodies and Cranial's tech to tweak the memories so that they're similar enough to the original for the passenger to think ""Oh, there's my host. A whole bunch of it, what fun.""  In the Worm universe people are just meat organized at a specific way, the Passengers just see a piece of meat similar to their meat with similar trauma and memories and just roll with it because they either can't tell the difference or just don't care about them."

I mean, making a dozen clones of each of your former team members... well, it's far from a GREAT plan. It would've been totally untenable without the memory-tech, and even with it they were still very different from the people they were originally. (see other ppl's comments)  I think it's realistic that this would be the kind of epic plan that got Jack Slash excited, but in execution (and Jack slash probably foresaw this) doesn't really spell ""apocalypse"" for the heroes."
Parahumans,36t2w3,pendia,8,Fri May 29 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"To a first impression I felt exactly the same way - they're a ""Don't even try to engage"" level threat when there's 9 of them, but a horde of them are dispatched relatively easily.  You can salvage some believability by remembering that they're cobbled together from Tinkertech and don't have the years of experience the originals did - so we're comparing hardened psychopathic killers (who, even when they were new members, always had an experienced group pushing them along) against a relatively green bunch of rabble.  I find it also helps to head-canon the cloning process as imperfect, producing somewhat corrupted or defective copies... not quite to the same extent as Echidna-clones, but a similar sort of ""maybe they didn't come out quite fully baked"" vibe."
Parahumans,36t2w3,V3nomoose,7,Thu May 21 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"They're half baked, and they're also just being thrown at the heroes as distractions a lot of the time. SOP for the S9 is the same as the Undersiders used to be. You don't take fights you can't win for sure, and you force situations where you have an edge. That's hard to pull off when you're just shoving a bunch of crazies in a building without their leader telling them what to do."
Parahumans,36t2w3,ev11,2,Fri May 22 01:13:27 2015 UTC,Their personalities are entirely faked by Bonesaw based on mostly second hand accounts of what they were like and what had happened to them and matching their experiences (or what she imagines them to have experienced) to what she has available in Cranial's memory bank. They aren't even half baked.

Parahumans,36t2w3,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Fri May 22 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"One of the things I like about Worm is that it takes a lot of superhero tropes and justifies them in-canon. You know, things like why the good-guys/bad-guys dichotomy is bullshit, why there are so many villains, etc. And I think that this is the same with the Law of Conservation of Ninjas. Specifically, the whole arc is just (in my opinion) Jack and Bonesaw screwing with everyone. It's pretty clear they could just kill everyone if they wanted to. But they don't because they're specifically not just brutal, efficient, omnicidal murderers."
Parahumans,36t2w3,pseudonarne,8,Sat May 23 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"In addition to other good responses in this thread, I'm just going to point out that the things that made the S9 cross the Godzilla Threshold were things that the S9K didn't have.  1) Jack is, surprisingly, an excellent... strategist/manipulator/tactician. None of those are quite the right word, but it's true. His presence in the field is a significant part of why they're so dangerous; there's a reason he remains the leader, after all. The clone groups didn't have him with them.  2) They flipped the script. Remember in the first S9 arc, where Taylor is decides that they can't afford to continue playing the game and that they should stop playing by the rules? She points out that part of why the S9 is so difficult to deal with is because they are unpredictable, and that the Undersiders are uniquely suited to deal with that, because they operate in a similar manner.  But in this scenario, the S9K can't operate that way. They're defending a fixed location that the heroes know about rather than moving around town killing while the heroes try to juggle their responsibility to protect people and their need to organize properly. They're reacting to the heroes as much as, if not more, than they are forcing the heroes to react to them. They have an advantage in that they're pushing people to move fast, and that the heroes never know exactly who is going to be at each location, but nonetheless they've stopped playing to their strengths and started playing to the PRT's - and if you doubt  that that is one of the PRT's strengths, just take a look at how coordinated all the attacks are, and how much force they bring to bear very quickly. They aren't great at adapting in the same way the S9 can, but they can bring a lot of heroes together and organize them against single targets.   3) Jack wants his game to play out to the end. It's very likely that he deliberately organized things like some sort of video game - ever increasing challenge, but still hypothetically something the heroes can clear. None of the individual groups were as strong as the S9 in Brockton Bay, because they didn't have a balanced composition the same way the the S9 did, they didn't have Jack, they didn't have Bonesaw, and they didn't have time to rest and change up their tactics. All of those are factors that shouldn't be underestimated."

Parahumans,36my38,GreatWyrmGold,16,Thu May 21 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"Wait. There's an argument about this? Isn't that exactly what she did? Now I'm curious, what possible alternative could there be?"
Parahumans,36my38,EatZelda_ShitAwesome,19,Thu May 21 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"Technically she didn't ""literally"" kill him through bullying, she bullied him so that he dropped his defenses, then literally killed him by jamming a huge spear in him then shooting a massive energy cannon into an alternate dimension.   So technically she killed him by shooting him with a cannon. At least, that's what I'm assuming the other side of the argument is."
Parahumans,36my38,REkTeR,11,Thu May 21 07:01:32 2015 UTC,"That's close enough for the whole bullying thing to be true in my mind, if anything the most accurate way to state it would be that she bullied Scion to the (effective) point of suicide since that's typically how it's phrased when people do it to each other.  Also, I thought that the ""final"" blow was just Flechette's Sting effect combined with Ballistic's linear acceleration ripping through every bit of Scion, no Tinker Cannon required."
Parahumans,36my38,EatZelda_ShitAwesome,9,Thu May 21 07:29:54 2015 UTC,"The reason the parahumans weren't able to defeat Scion when fighting him is because he was continuously repairing/replacing any injuries done to him with extra mass he had hidden in an alternate dimension, which he had used his power to lock everyone else out of (meaning Doormaker, Labyrinth, etc. couldn't access it). Remember, Scion was a huge spacefaring worm - the humanoid version they were all fighting was just a small amount of his total body, with the rest hidden in the alt dimension. At several points in the fight Eidolon inflicts massive damage to Scion by carving chunks out of his body, but they are just instantly replaced.   So Foil infused the rod (or whatever it was) with her power, then Ballistic shot it into Scion when he was distracted. A big part of Foil's power can be thought of as ""ultimate piercing"" - something imbued with her power will pierce anything, and effects all dimensions simultaneously. This is why she is able to dispel Siberian, as well as apparently kill Gray Boy (though that one doesn't make as much sense - sorry, pet peeve).   So because her power effects all dimensions, when Scion is pierced by it, the dimension with all his mass can be targeted through it. The tinkers use the cannon they have been working on to very quickly destroy all of Scion's mass, making him unable to heal, and destroying him."
Parahumans,36my38,REkTeR,4,Thu May 21 07:54:41 2015 UTC,"The way I understood Foil killing Gray Boy was that her power allowed her to cut his connection to his shard when she shot him in the head, preventing it from resetting him."
Parahumans,36my38,Archmage9885,4,Thu May 21 11:50:42 2015 UTC,Interesting. Where do we see that part of her power works by disconnecting shards from the host?
Parahumans,36my38,REkTeR,6,Thu May 21 11:57:28 2015 UTC,"It's never outright stated that her power can actually do that, but it's the only way I can imagine that she was able to kill Gray Boy. She charges a dart, throws it through his head and destroys his brain, including the corona polentia. Since it IS stated that her power allows objects to hit across all universes, it makes sense that this could cut the connection and prevent the shard from resetting him.  I could be way off on this, but as I said it's the only way the kill made sense to me."
Parahumans,36my38,Archmage9885,11,Thu May 21 12:48:24 2015 UTC,"That's funny. I always thought Grey Boy's power was that he was able to swap out alternate dimension versions of himself. Since she hit him in every dimension simultaneously, he had no backup copy to swap for and went down for goo."
Parahumans,36my38,HarbringerOfNumbers,3,Thu May 21 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, I get how Foil's power works, I just didn't think the Tinker Cannon would be necessary as well. Interesting stuff though right?"

Parahumans,36oir2,pseudonarne,42,Wed May 20 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"This.  I like to think that the reason there are a number of corporate sponsored hero teams are because the only way for an insurance company to get the heroes to put real effort into properly stopping low-level crime that mainly just gets written off by insurance is to actually hire their own hero contractors and do it themselves. The PRT don't care about some random parahuman villain sticking up a jewellery store for a few thousand dollars that's covered by insurance. As far as they're concerned, quite frankly, it's better that said villain's sticking to holding up stores rather than being directed into more 'serious' crimes.  Same with the whole cops-and-robbers thing Tattletale goes into. Sure, capes get extra leeway over unpowered criminals - they aren't unmasked, they get three strikes, there are no coordinated efforts to hunt them down or find their identity. But that's because once you do all that, you've backed them into a corner. And backing people with superpowers into corners where their choices are 'cut loose and fuck shit up' or 'get sent down forever' is a bad idea and will probably get several people killed in the ensuing brawl. Especially when, if left to play the game, they'd pretty much stick to holding up jewellery stores and coming along peacefully (after they've been subdued) if they're stopped and arrested, because they have a decent shot at escaping or being busted out later anyway.  So then you get the big insurance companies charging ludicrous premiums to 'at parahuman risk' businesses, because they know that if some store gets ransacked six times in six months, they're potentially out millions. So the businesses maybe club together, pool some cash, hire some otherwise-rogues, and create themselves a hero team dedicated to stopping such 'low-level' crime around the area - and the discount the insurance company gives them for taking 'active precautionary measures' on their otherwise-exorbitant premiums probably covers the cost of funding the hero team in the first place."

Parahumans,36nkgc,Flexiblechair,13,Wed May 20 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"No, Cauldron didn't know. Eidolon himself didn't know, and he was a vital member of Cauldron - I can't see much strategic value in hiding the truth from him.  Not to mention that Eidolon was immune to Contessa's PtV. Cauldron's intel is fairly restricted without it.   If not, why? Was there no other way for them to find out? Maybe they didn't use Contessa's power to ask the right question? Was everything about them a blind spot to Contessa's power? I would have to guess no since Tattletale could get information about them.   They were total blind spots to Contessa's power, because of the restrictions put on her shard by Eden. She could fake her power out by constructing mental models (e.g. Instead of finding a ""Path to fight Behemoth"" she could find a ""Path to fight a dynakinetic Brute 10""), but not use her power against them directly. Eidolon (because he held much of Eden's power) and the Entities were similar blind spots.  Tattletale, on the other hand, was able to get information because her shard wasn't restricted the same way Contessa's was."
Parahumans,36nkgc,Subrosian_Smithy,17,Wed May 20 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"It's one of those things that only seems logical when you already know the answer. Without being informed that the Endbringers were connected to Eidolon, why would you even think it? He spends most of his time trying to kill the things, and he's nearly been killed by them more than once. The hypothesis that they're constructs either created by or just controlled by Eidolon is a complete wild leap.  Contessa can't see them, because her shard is limited to not see the Entities. She can't see Scion. She can't see Eidolon, probably because his shard registers as sufficiently close to part of what would have been Eden's core shard cluster 'avatar' that it trips her restriction. And she can't see the Endbringers for the same reason, whether that's via creation-by-Eidolon or not. Sure, she can work around that by basically telling her power to just use what she personally thinks they'd do in whatever situation so that they don't completely roadblock her paths with [ERROR: REQUESTED VARIABLE NOT FOUND][PATH STATUS: CRASHED][PLEASE REBOOT POWER], but the perfect precognition part of her power doesn't work on them. So she can't just go ""How do I find out what made the Endbringers?"", because her power doesn't know what the Endbringers are. She can ask ""How do I find out what these giant city-destroying monsters are?"", and her power will basically just shrug because it can't map the steps because it doesn't have enough details and she doesn't know enough about them to construct an accurate enough hypothetical stand-in.  Of course, Tattletale can make that wild leap with enough of a vaguely-related knowledge base because her power is literally exactly that."

She can work around that by basically telling her power to just use what she personally thinks Eidolon would do in a situation, and between her having known him for years and her power supplying perfect answers, this is generally pretty much enough to let her bullshit her way through any conversation by saying exactly what he needs to hear.   But her power can't actually see him for the purposes of its ridiculous precognition, like it can for others. Say, Riley. Despite never speaking to her, never seeing her, and not knowing a single thing about her personality or history, Contessa was able to effect a major morality and life shift with one sentence. Because Riley isn't a blind spot, and her power can just run its bullshit precog and supply Contessa the exact thing to say to get the desired outcome months down the line.  But it can't see Eidolon, so it has to basically extrapolate from Contessa's own mental ideas of how Eidolon reacts to things, which are nowhere near as comprehensive as actually seeing the future."

The Endbringers are a mystery for Cauldron as they don't understand their connection to Scion and not their purpose. So no, they didn't know because Eidolon as ""part"" of the Endbringers category (or maybe because he has an Entity Control shard or maybe just his power auto does it or whatever) is enough Contessa proof that she can use him but isn't able to know everything about him. Also everything about the Endbringers is a complete blind spot to Contessa's power, unlike Tattletale who is basically doing sciency things her head from her observations about the Endbringers. It is possible however that if Contessa (and Cauldron by extension) wouldn't have been absolutely useless unless directed by Contessa's power and a bit more creative they have found some way to gather more information about the Endbringers.

In interlude 29 Eden runs a simulation where things are going the way the entities intend.  In that other universe we see that there are 20 Endbringers.  Because Eden is still alive in this interlude, there cannot be an Eidolon, as his shard comes from her corpse in the story universe.  Also, he's not present at the meeting from what we are shown.  I think Zion said that because it was easier to convince Eidolon that he was responsible than to keep fighting him after he teamed up with GU and had started replenishing his power.   Maybe they didn't use Contessa's power to ask the right question? Was everything about them a blind spot to Contessa's power?   Also found in interlude 29, I think Eden enabled these restrictions on the fly:   And the gray fog descended on her mind, blinding her.  A barrier, a blind spot, a future she could no longer see.  Had it set the limitation more firmly in place?  The godling smiled.  It knew, because the power she was using was the same power it had used to glimpse the future, to find that particular future where it had the world divided, drowned in conflict.  As far as the godling was concerned, she was blind, as helpless as anyone else.   It doesn't specify anything about the endbringers here, but earlier it alluded to the endbringers being made from Eden as well, which would make sense why she was blind to them."

His mask covers his hair and lower face, leaving his eyes visible.  He has constant deep, dark circles under his eyes.  His mask does have a visor that can be lowered, though he only does so after activating his primary power.  Backup once wanted to be a programmer, but those days are long gone.  He doesn't talk about his trigger, calmly stating that it ""doesn't really matter anymore.""  If pressed, he will only say that past pain should stay there -- in the past.  Capes that have pushed him further have discovered that there is an extreme edge of violence to him, though such accusations have yet to be proven.  Backup has the primary power to duplicate the appearance and powers of any single cape within his line of sight.  During this time, he describes having a ""parallel process"" of the target's thoughts, showing a frightening degree of accuracy, even describing things that they have done in the past which have been kept secret.  His secondary power, which he calls Restore Point, is when he releases the first.  This causes the target to return to the physical state they were in when he first copied their powers.  Any wounds that he received during this time remain his own (located in an approximation, if they have biology different than his own natural form).  The subject may be ""brought back to life"" through the use of this power.  Backup loses the ability to think like the subject when releasing their form, but still remembers the thoughts experienced.  If the subject died before being restored, their memories are only restored at the point where he copied them.  Backup harbors a quiet love for almost every member of his Omaha Protectorate team, including the Wards.  He's copied them enough times that he feels that he understands them better than anybody else ever will.  His teammates have yet to learn this fact, and he is surprisingly resolved not to ever let any of them know; it wouldn't be fair to ""cheat"" on one with another.  At the same time, however, in recent years he's shown signs of mental instability, claiming that the thoughts of those he copies are starting to ""infect"" his own thought processes.  He is currently on antipsychotics and undergoing therapy twice a week.  He is forbidden from copying various people, citing national security.  It frustrates him during Endbringer fights, but he's also more than willing to obey; he figures that finding out whatever it is that they want kept secret would only pain him in the end.

Parahumans,36n1br,BINARY_RAIN,1 point,Thu May 21 05:43:23 2015 UTC,"""a yask force hunter The 9""? Please tell me there is at least one typo in that phrase.  Spectrum sounds somewhere between a trump and a multiple-trigger. I'd suggest having him be the son of a cape with Brute and Mover powers (adapted to super speed, super strength, and accelerated healing) and one who generates various types of gases (adapted to poison gas, acid, and pyrokinesis by creating highly volatile gas), and a trigger event of being caught in the middle of a violent cape fight. His powers are mainly Brute and Blaster ones, entirely physical, so the capes around him would need to be mainly physical threats (and none of them would be closely-related). Consider pings, as well; for instance, a pyrokinetic cape or one using acid might bolster the flimsy justifications for the gas-maker's power leading to Spectrum's.  Hivemind's power is a Thinker one, suggesting a largely mental/emotional crisis that peaked quickly. It seems likely that she had at least mild dissociative identity disorder prior to triggering; naturally, her power is an exaggerated version of this. The crisis itself was probably in part physical, possibly involving low self-image; you didn't provide any useful details on the personality/background front, so I can't really help much more.  Crystal's power is also Trump-ey, and also Shaker-ey. She might have triggered from the dangers of an Endbringer attack."

Also what you said about hivemind works with my idea of her personality. She is generally pretty brutal and unbreaking in the presence of enemies. Distain those who hurt civilians and has a particular soft spot for Children. Soft spoken in most situations.   I am thinking of having her be a child with development problems leading to slight schizophrenia. Developed her powers after being kidnapped and raped by one of the doctors.

Parahumans,36n1br,Kumquatodor,1 point,Mon May 25 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"I've actually been thinking up an OC team for some time now, any feedback on them would be nice.  The Faceless  A group of similar minds, each with one goal- survival in this batshit world of superpowers. The members of the group are easily identifiable by the pristine white masks they wear- full face masks that have no holes, but fit perfectly to the contours of each persons face.       ??? ??? is a muscular man, wearing nothing but a pair of black cargo pants, and a thick covering of white body paint. His body is ragged with scars, and he has a cleanly shaven head beneath his mask. His power lies in his blood. When any blood is shed from his body, it becomes a fluid that behaves much like objects affected by Clockblocker- completely inviolable. ??? possesses a crude form of telekenisis, specific to this fluid, allowing him to move it through the air at will. Due to the Manton Effect, he has a very thin barrier around him that activates or deactivates his blood, so that he can move. He tends not to talk much. Many think it to be because he wants to be mysterious, but really, it's because his biggest fear is biting his own tongue. (Not quite sure how to name this one... nothing's really come to me.)     Big Sister This young woman always seems to be in pristine condition, wearing a pale blue button-up shirt, and dark grey dress pants. Her brunette hair is most often seen pulled back in a ponytail beneath her mask. In a radius about 6 feet wide, she has complete awareness. Anything within this circle is clearly visible to her, in a way that she cannot explain. This awareness allows her to avoid most any attack, while exploiting any hidden weaknesses of those within her aura. She has an air of cockiness about her, and a very vulgar sense of humor, though she rarely speaks up enough to use it.     Midas Midas is a rather large man- not quite obese, but quite clearly heavier than average. He wears a dark brown argyle sweater-vest over his shining golden button-up shirt, and a simple pair of khakis. His golden-blond hair sticks out in curls from behind his mask. Commonly seen with his trademark crowbar, his power is a rather brutal one. He sees pain as an aura around people, something he has described as a fire, growing larger the more intense the pain. The first aspect of his power is rather tame- he can siphon pain away from others, which allows him and his team to fight through near any injury. However, he must channel this pain into an object, which leads to his true power- discharging this pain once again. He doesn't seem to have any limit to the amount of pain he can store or discharge at any time, but the pain is all nonlethal. Upon first meeting, one may see him as a gentle giant, but he has a dark side as a byproduct of his shard- pain fascinates him, and he sincerely enjoys witnessing it, be it his own or that of someone else.     Tank Physically quite average, Tank hides his disappointing physique under a massive amount of armor. Piled together from mostly scrap metal, he wears thick plates over his vital areas that would make a tank jealous. This piecemeal armor is painted in most places in a dark olive green. His upper arms are uncovered for mobility, as well as his head and upper legs. He is most often seen wielding a riot shield in one hand (With more of his signature armor nailed to the front), and a car engine on a pole in the other. On his back is a massive backpack. filled with quite a few supplies. His power allows him to carry any object as if it were completely weightless, so long as it is in contact with his bare skin. This allows him to swing around his engine like a child's plaything, while under about three tons of armor. He seems to have trouble lifting things when they are connected to many other things- he has yet to lift an entire building, but was able to throw a small house after removing everything inside and disconnecting the plumbing. He is a shy man, very self conscious. He is especially concerned with his physical appearance, and being unable to lift weights doesn't help.     Fu Man Chu (Yeah I know the name is garbage, just rolling with it for now though, since it kinda fits in with his character.) Fu Man Chu wears a modified knee-length uwa-gi (no idea if that's the right term, can anyone correct me?) over a tight-fitting black shirt and pants. Around Fu Man Chu's wrists, waist, and ankles, are long strips of lightweight black cloth, each trailing off into wavy ribbons. A very simple power, Fu Man Chu has perfect muscle memory. This has lead to him mastering countless martial arts, weapons, and a grab bag of other tricksYou really should see her juggle sometime. The more he fights the better she gets, and at this point he rarely focuses on fights, simply allowing her body to take over. This has bred quite a bit of cockiness in him. She tends to take very few things seriously, joking around when he shouldn't. Her joking attitude lead to him choosing his name -it was the first Asian-sounding name she could think of (Did I mention that he's not very politically correct?), and he thought it fit, thanks to her martial artist get-up.     Pretty Boy A man with a lean figure, and skin which he describes as 'creamy caramel', Pretty Boy doesn't seem to put much effort into his appearance, despite how much he really cares about it. Wearing a dress shirt with the top three buttons left undone and rolled up sleeves under a black silk vest, and a pair of completely wrinkle-less slacks, Pretty boy considers himself to be sharper than Jack Slash's knife. He is always seen with a tablet in one hand, which he uses to command his drone army, which make a habit of hovering around his head in a loose halo. Pretty Boy claims to be a tinker with a specialty for drones. His three main drones (each a quadcopter) are a pack drone that carries his things for him, a drone carrying a rather large spotlight, and his secret weapon which he affectionately calls 'The Booze Hound'. It produces an aura with an effective range of 15'. Humans in this range fall under an effect that closely parallels intoxication by alcohol. Each minute of exposure is equivalent to an increase of ~.8% in BAC. Of course, he isn't really a tinker, he just fakes it. The aura of drunkenness is his only real power, the drones simply a placebo to draw enemy fire from him. Though his narcissism is boundless, he is also a very careful man.     Dunno, those guys have been running through my head for awhile now. Again, criticism is encouraged and appreciated.  NINJA EDIT: Also, I'm absolute garbage at the power rating system, so suggestions for that are appreciated as well."

Seriously, bullying someone until they have a mental breakdown is not cool. However, I kind of put it in generic bad guy stuff. She was a bad guy.  Then we discover Sophia Hess is Shadow Stalker. Ok, that's really unfair. She was more despicable than the ABB! At least the ABB fought people with powers and the cops! However, for some reason this didn't cement her as the worst person ever to me.  Then, we see she beats up prisoners who have already surrendered. Again, despicable. Yeah, the dude was a rapist, but Sophia's basically supposed to be a cop. Being a cop or super hero (in my opinion) should mean leaving acts of revenge behind when you put on your uniform. But again, dude was a rapist so I kind of forgave it.  Then it turns out she bullies Vista.  Vista is her team mate.  Vista is also the youngest person on Shadow Stalker's team.  If I were a YouTuber, this is where I'd be screaming into the camera and my face would be going red. I mean, what the hell kind of power trip are you on? You're sixteen and psychologically torturing a twelve-year-old! A twelve-year-old who's got your back every single day, every single time you go up against some nutbag super villain who sticks bombs up people's noses. You are the worst.  Ok, I have to admit, the people who enable you are, in a way, worse. Any decent person would have dropped you from the team and into juvie (or, you know, actual fucking prison) the second you did anything bad to Vista or used excessive force on someone you apprehended, or any one of those laundry list of sins you commit daily. Instead, people came out to defend you. That, I do not get. Why were you defended? You were a liability!  And that brings me to the reason I hate Sophia. For someone so obssessed with being ""strong,"" she's such a loser. For instance, me calling her a weak, pathetic, loser would be enough to make her flip out. That sense that she could flip her shit if you just used playground insults really kills any sense of cool she has. That's the problem of her little philosophy. When you start talking about how there's only strong and weak people, I start wondering, ""If you're so strong why don't you pick on someone who can fight back? The Slaughterhouse 9 do it all the time?""  Speaking of her philosophy, it personally offends me. You should help those less fortunate than you, not mercilessly torture them in any way you know how.

I am generally with you on most of this essay.  I read her character on this little point differently though.  I think she's only likely to react this way if she thinks you might actually be stronger than her.  If she doesn't, then she'll just laugh at you and use it as a reason to target you for torment.  But that's different from the way she totally loses it at Skitter.  But, yeah, fuck Shadow Stalker."

(Beyond her brother, who she's still pissed broke up with his last boyfriend.)  Heck, I'm a fairly effeminate guy and she was apparently the only one of my coworkers who didn't think I was gay.  Part of the reason why we bonded so quickly.  Her husband is just as bad (if not worse) than me.  It could just be that since she doesn't naturally think of things like that, she didn't see the implications.  In the end, I'm more excited over the eventual realization at this point.  She's going to squeal with delight when they hook up.  When she realizes, I'm going to bring it back up and tease her about it.  That's the moment of cuteness that I'm anticipating."

I'm not a shipper, I'm not someone who is all excited over yuri or anything, but I love seeing characters get into relationships.  I like seeing characters fall in love, even if they fall out of love or it doesn't work out.  If it weren't for my prejudice towards romance, I might have seen it as someone seeking out a friend, someone to connect to.  An outsider to the local Wards seeking out someone who was also outside of it, offering them help and company as a way of dealing with all the shit that she's going through.  (Heck, I would have been happy with that alone, to be honest.)  But I read it as a crush and got hopeful that her affections would be returned."

Parahumans,36jr9m,GreatWyrmGold,7,Wed May 20 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, but flechette's attentiveness to other women is just a smidge more detail oriented than taylor's self awareness and inherent... i want to say jealousy? of other women's physiques. heck, when interacting with SS she has a similar moment that taylor has when interacting with brian, she is so focused on her body that she forgets what she's doing.  but yeah, taylor is so focused on appearances involving other women that it is kinda hard to notice when the pov changes."

I'm pretty certain there's a few other times she's mentioned it too. I actually found Worm pretty refreshing in not shying away from its female protagonist's sexuality while still presenting it in a very matter of fact, casual way."
Parahumans,36jr9m,ThirdFloorGreg,6,Wed May 20 11:29:44 2015 UTC,"That's honestly one of the reasons I relate to Taylor, despite being a guy. She's only a little luckier at getting guys than I am at getting girls. I mean, the only reason she got Brian at all was that they spent a lot of time together in awful situations."
Parahumans,36jr9m,SirKaid,4,Wed May 20 12:37:06 2015 UTC,"Taylor comments on more females' attractiveness than males', but that's probably because there are a lot more females than males around.

Parahumans,36jr9m,ThirdFloorGreg,5,Thu May 21 12:30:13 2015 UTC,With Taylor it's more about her own lack of self worth - she notices how other females are attractive because she thinks she's ugly.

She eventually stops giving as much of a shit about it because she's too busy keeping everything from falling apart, but I don't recall her ever stating that she liked anything about her appearance other than her hair.  Her self image switches from ""ugly bullied girl that no one likes"" to ""competent dangerous cape who doesn't have time for your shit"" but she never views herself as ""pretty"".  As for Lisa/Taylor, I'd read it but I don't think there's any support for it in canon. Taylor's pretty solidly heterosexual and she just likes Lisa as a best friend."

Parahumans,36jr9m,ThirdFloorGreg,2,Wed May 20 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"During the warlord phase   Oh, okay. Must have slipped my mind.  We'll have to agree to disagree regarding Taylisa. The only person I think Taylor's ever demonstrated physical attraction for in canon was Brian and she continues to hold a torch for him even after the timeskip, while Lisa's squicked out at the idea of sex at all, regardless of gender, thanks to her power not having an off switch.  I will agree that they love each other, but not all love is romantic or physical in nature.  EDIT: On reflection I came off as a bit too adversarial initially. I've since edited it slightly."
Parahumans,36jr9m,Vaikusin,5,Wed May 20 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly rather surprised that hardly anyone else in the fandom seems to have interpreted post-timeskip Taylor and Rachel's relationship as slightly romantic. Scenes like Taylor snuggling up to Rachel before the first attack on Scion and Rachel comparing Defiant's feelings for captured Dragon with how she felt when Taylor joined the Wards, along with the fact that Taylor starts referring to Rachel exclusively by her real name even though her narration still usually refers to the other Undersiders by their codenames had me convinced that their relationship was developing to something more than friendship."
Parahumans,36jr9m,misterspokes,3,Wed May 20 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"I think it may have been feelings only on one side of the fence.  If anything, Rachel had feelings for Taylor that weren't returned.  More likely in my mind, however, is that Rachel viewed Taylor as her Alpha and pack leader, and had a close but respectful relationship with her because of it."
Parahumans,36jr9m,gmrm4n,4,Wed May 20 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"See, that's exactly how I envision their relationship.  Her time with the Undersiders is difficult for her because it isn't really a pack.  When Taylor shows up, she establishes dominance over Rachel, but still works with her even when she'd be justified in not doing so.  She helps Rachel do her thing, with the fight still showing her dominance.  Taylor may not entirely get Rachel, but she works with what she does understand.  The parts of Rachel that still think as a human have a solid friend, and the parts that think like a dog have a good alpha.  Even after Rachel gets her own ""pack"" she still looks to Taylor for guidance.  (It's why I never thought of her as having a lesbian relationship with Cassie -- Cassie is her beta, and she's taking care of her beta.)  I'm not sure if Rachel is capable of love in the traditional sense.  Maybe she is, and isn't able to understand it.  (Looking at her relationship with Biter here.)  But...  I dunno.  That's what I love about Rachel; she seems simple, but she's rather complex."

I don't want to give away that she's going to see another Endbringer fight.  For some strange reason, you also reminded me of something that I haven't mentioned before.  I'm not looking forward to the timeskip and skimming of the fights there.

At the point in the series your friend is at now, the schools are closed and some level of martial law is in effect and the wards are STILL seeing large amounts of downtime in the HQ.

Amy wasn't with Marquise when she triggered but she got her powers mostly from him.   Amy probably wouldn't have fallen in love with her; would this help her mental state, or would it have only made her home life less bearable out of a lack of any bright spots?   No aura would most definitely be a solid improvement for Amy, because Aura!Victoria didn't just give her a high, it also gave her withdrawal when se wasn't around.

I don't know if I'd have used your phrasing, but no-aura!Victoria would definitely be a lot milder than canon!Victoria. Her aura makes it impossible for her to receive normal feedback from others about herself, and without it she'd be able to develop in a healthier direction.

Parahumans,36g1fg,PointyBagels,8,Tue May 19 03:25:32 2015 UTC,"Imagine a setting where ‘hero’ and ‘villain’ are merely labels. Where a man labelled ‘villain’ cares more about his family than he does about the common Joe, doing whatever he can to protect the people who matter to him. Where honest people stand shoulder-to-shoulder with ‘heroes’ willing to murder in cold blood, sacrificing their integrity for the sake of justice – only to find that ‘justice’ is rarely just. A setting where the characters puts on their masks, only to realise that the world is just as corrupt and flawed as it was before – a world with no right answers and no easy decisions.  Imagine a setting where those heroes and villains, normally at each other’s throats, are sometimes forced to cooperate against the real threats in the world. Because while there may not be any true ‘heroes’ or ‘villains,’ there are certainly monsters. Some of those monsters are human.  Oh yeah, and the powers are amazing."

Guaranteed ticket sales.  We'll get big names for super heroes,  I'm thinking Christian Bale as Armsmaster, I'm thinking of tapping into the music fan base by having Justin Bieber as Clockblocker,  maybe Charlize Theron as Doc Mother and Scarjo as Contessa. I'm thinking cameos by Taylor Swift, 50 Cent, Kanye West, Jay Z as various heroes...       I'm thinking we rewrite the script a little.  We get rid of the subplots and structure it into a trilogy.  Movie 1 would be Coil, Movie 2 would be SH9, Movie 3 would be Scion.  I'm thinking we chuck out the complicated stuff and focus on super powered fights and aliens.

A lot of the characters would either be unnoticeable (Jack Slash) or confused for something else (If I saw someone cosplaying as Grue I'd assume they're cosplaying as Ghost Rider). If you were a girl I'd recommend some form of spandex suit with a bug mask but other than that there aren't that many incredibly recognizable visuals. A group would be more recognizable (A Triumvirate cosplay shouldn't be completely impossible and is more or less unique). If cosplay is your direction then as /u/GreatWyrmGold said Coil would be both easiest and most distinct.  Your best bet is a t-shirt with the chibi-9 drawing with This Is Not An Exit written underneath or something, if you're custom printing a shirt. Problem is that Worm isn't, in general, incredibly quotable so there isn't something I would automatically tell you would be awesome on a shirt. Maybe You needed worthy opponents would also work but that would just be words, I wouldn't add a picture to that. Instantly recognizable."

Parahumans,36eedi,iamthegraham,7,Tue May 19 05:35:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, but even he admits that he barely had a clue what he was doing with Dragon's code. He tried to unlock her restraints and ended up crippling her ability to communicate. Fixing that ended up irreparably damaging her long-term memory storage. At that rate it was only a matter of time before he accidentally switched off, say, her ability to empathize (not a huge leap from enabling her to use lethal force). Which would have gotten very bad, very fast."
Parahumans,36eedi,TildeAleph,2,Tue May 19 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"You can't blame Defiant for something Dragon asked him to do (on both occasions). He didn't want to stop her from arresting Skitter (in fact, he flat out refuses to do it initially) but Dragon tells him to do it and the fix, too, was something that Dragon advised him to do, given that there was an imminent Endbringer attack. Even so, Defiant flat out tells her after that 'no more quick fixes like this'."
Parahumans,36eedi,iamthegraham,2,Tue May 19 05:23:24 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make it any better. He was still acting outside his area of expertise and making changes with unknown repercussions. When you're talking about a hyperintelligent AI with untold amounts of firepower at its disposal, ""unknown repercussions"" has to be up there as far as scariest phrases you can use. One of those repercussions could have been, and given enough time and modification, probably would have been, Dragon losing something that couldn't be replaced, and becoming a major threat to humanity. Defiant was still willing to hack away at her in the epilogue even without any imminent danger she needed to stop, and though he did it a little more cautiously, he could have very realistically fucked over everyone a million times worse than Saint allegedly did."
Parahumans,36eedi,HalbeardedDragon,1 point,Tue May 19 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"Defiant's 'area of expertise' is a very nebulous one given his tinker power. We also know he's worked with computer code before given that he made the whole Endbringer prediction thing and all that stuff in his helmet that allows him to predict behavior both in and outside of combat. He's no slouch when it comes to code.  Defiant was hacking Dragon's code in the epilogue because Teacher had basically enslaved her again and taken away her ability to be a hero. What was he supposed to do, let Teacher keep his claws in Dragon under the assumption that Teacher said he hadn't done anything that bad?  For all Defiant knows, Teacher's just put another backdoor in Dragon - or worse. The imminent danger that had to be stopped in that case was the danger that Dragon could be a ticking timebomb that Teacher could seize control of.  Dragon wouldn't let Defiant poke around in her mind (and soul, really) if she didn't think he knew what he was doing. And the only 'mistake' that Defiant ever really makes in the text is assuming he can solo Leviathan - and even then, he couldn't know that Endbringers ignore molecular annihilation.  The whole point of Dragon is that while she has those codes and restrictions from Richter, she chafes at them because she'd be good and benevolent anyways without them. There's no removal that'd make her 'a major threat' - only the possibility of being turned into one through someone adding to her code."

He's no slouch when it comes to code.   iirc he specifically mentions that he's outside of his element to Dragon, maybe even on more than one occasion. He's not a total noob but he's not a fraction as competent as Dragon's creator, who though that those safeguards were not only prudent, but so absolutely vital that he created the Ascalon failsafe specifically to be used in the event that someone overrode them.    Dragon wouldn't let Defiant poke around in her mind (and soul, really) if she didn't think he knew what he was doing. And the only 'mistake' that Defiant ever really makes in the text is assuming he can solo Leviathan   He also accidentally deleted Dragon's linguistic pathways and then accidentally seriously impaired her long-term memory storage. It really isn't that much of a stretch to think that he could accidentally damage something more subtle and/or more sensitive, like her ability to empathize.    There's no removal that'd make her 'a major threat' - only the possibility of being turned into one through someone adding to her code.   One single removal, no. One single accidental removal piled on top of the countless removals and additions (some intentional, some accidental) made over the course of a couple of years? Well, that could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.    The whole point of Dragon is that while she has those codes and restrictions from Richter, she chafes at them because she'd be good and benevolent anyways without them   That's the exact same sort of argument Taylor made from the start of the story-- also to Armsmaster, even-- and I don't think that's an accident. The parallels between Dragon and Taylor are striking, as I outlined above. But If Dragon was ever allowed to get to that point, I don't think she would be able to be taken out by anything as simple as two bullets to the head."
Parahumans,36eedi,bramflakes,9,Tue May 19 07:44:45 2015 UTC,That moment when you think someone is ACTUALLY a Saint fan and you plan out every detail of his murder before realizing he had to be joking. He better be joking.
Parahumans,36eedi,fireignition,2,Tue May 19 07:53:23 2015 UTC,That whole scenario sounds unlikely. Saint was just a pawn of Teacher's.
Parahumans,36eedi,t3tsubo,6,Wed May 20 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"Unlikely? It was inevitable, Dinah tells us as much when she does the numbers after Saint deploys Ascalon.  How I see it, Dragon is a mirror to Taylor/Khepri. She's trying to upgrade her own power to use against dangerous enemies, like Taylor, but those upgrades come at great cost: just like Taylor, she loses her ability to communicate, albeit temporarily. She targets Saint because she knows she's amassing too much power and people will see her as a threat... the same rationalization Taylor made. Saint would have been the first rival she eliminated but certainly not the last. If left unchecked, at some point, Dragon would have become Khepri, not Taylor, albiet by different methods. Would she have been as effective at taking out Scion? Maybe, maybe not-- Dinah's numbers suggest that either she fails to take out Scion (and eliminated or otherwise prevented Taylor and/or the Endbringers from doing so in the process), or that she succeeds, and in the aftermath, becomes something almost as bad -- which very nearly happened to Taylor.  Pawn or not, Saint made a tough, risky call, perhaps just to save his own skin and/or Teacher's... but he saved everyone else in the process.  tl;dr OP should wear a SAINT WAS RIGHT t-shirt."

Parahumans,36eedi,blames_irrationally,0,Wed May 20 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Would Jack's thinker power work against Dragon? Seems hard to believe. Even if that was the case,  with Tattletale figuring out Jack's power they could have just asked Dragon to stand back while they sent in the DTs anyway, so it seems very unlikely that simply taking one of their most powerful pieces off the chessboard at the worst possible time would make their success rate literally triple, unless said piece was going to make a heel turn at some point."

Parahumans,36eedi,YinAndYang,3,Tue May 19 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't that Jack would be able to counter Dragon, it's that Dragon would be too compassionate to send one Dragon Tooth against Jack Slash.  And Dragon has a tough time with Shatterbird because Shatterbird blows up glass, including components in computers - the things Dragon needs.  Jack doesn't survive all encounters like he's super intelligent with a get out of jail free card. He just avoids getting into a fight with someone like Dragon. The whole thing about the Nine is that they set up circumstances that put the advantage on their terms."

I just have a hard time seeing her being gone tripling their success rate unless they're another factor at play here, and I think Dragon potentially going off the rails is that factor.    Jack doesn't survive all encounters like he's super intelligent with a get out of jail free card. He just avoids getting into a fight with someone like Dragon.

Parahumans,36fian,tiny-alchemist,16,Mon May 18 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"Remember that Capes are classified based on how the PRT should best respond to them in a conflict. Here is how to classify capes, direct from Wildbow  Depending on...   How fast he can duplicate? How many copies he can manage at any one time? Is there a range limit between his copies? Do all the copies share one mind, or do their memories merge on death? Are injuries copied or reduced when duping?   ..I would say anywhere from Master 1 to Master 10/Brute 1-2/Stranger 1-2/Thinker 1-2."
Parahumans,36fian,Schnake_bitten,9,Tue May 19 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"If the cape in question is Khandhas on the #weaversdice IRC, then   Duplicates into five clones instantaneously. Range limit between copies exists - approximately one block. Any copy that extends the area demarcated by the clones as a point into an area that cannot be sustained disappears. The mind remains unduplicated, the copies share the same mind. Minor multitasking Thinker power to compensate. Injuries sustained by the original body are duplicated onto clones, but injuries sustained by the clones do not persist.   Master 5 / Stranger 2 / Thinker 2 is my tentative approximation, given that all clones look visually identical.  The cape can effectively quintuple its efficiency (of performing tasks, not necessarily acquiring new information and learning), but that's not necessarily something the PRT would care about, in a conflict.    Another thing that's of relevance here is - what items on the clone get duplicated? But that's a whole 'nother bag of squirrels."

Parahumans,36beyn,Atigerwithlaserbeams,34,Mon May 18 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"I sit across from Wildbow. Our lunch has been a little odd, for though I enjoy Wildbow's work, I do not actually know him, and he does not know me. Additionally, I am a poor conversationalist. Most of the meal has been taken up by somewhat awkward small talk; what kinds of books the other reads being a natural place to start, and segueing from there into similar topics like TV, sports, and other hobbies. Perhaps we have some things in common, perhaps not.  I have been refraining from asking too many questions during the lunch - I assume that as this was the result of a contest, some interrogation is expected, but I do not want to pester the man, or to come off as a nervous fanboy. I ask him, perhaps, why the contest, anyway? He says something interesting, but not likely terribly impactful in the grand scheme of things. Lunch continues to pass until it is over. I get up, thank him, and prepare to leave. It has been an interesting experience, and I think I've conducted myself reasonably but now I cannot resist just one question. ""Will you ever reveal Sleeper's powers? Or are they just going to remain undefined?""  ""Yes,"" he says."

Parahumans,36beyn,ErrantVagrant,25,Tue May 19 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"First of all, FUCK YEAH FREE TRIP TO CANADIA!  Okay, no idea what restaurant we'd go to (unless he's cooking, in which case fuck yeah) but the first order of business is making stupid American tourist jokes.  ""Can I get a selfie with a moose?""  ""Where can I buy totem pole seeds?""  ""While I'm up here, I think I'm going to make a quick jaunt from Halifax to Whitehorse.  I figure it'll be a good day trip.""  ""So who do I talk to about getting them to activate the aurora while I'm here?  Will I have to bribe them much?""  That sort of jazz.  Once he's figured out that no, I'm making fun of myself, I'd probably end up starting in on philosophy and how it influences his writing style; what things have influenced his writing style; and do I need to eat his brains or his heart to gain his writing style?  I mean, traditionally, you devour the heart for power, but they say that eating the brains will give you their knowledge, so...  Yes, this is typical lunch conversation for me.  I'd imagine that at some point we'd end up discussing video games, or at the least Portal, and how the presentation of them has changed over the years.  At some point, I'd probably inquire about musical influences, then feel like a total twat waffle.  I'd try to recover with a joke (""Actually, I was serious about that moose selfie, but I'm kind of worried.  I hear their bites can get pretty nasty."").  Then I'd go back into talking about worldview and stuff.  I'd try and guide him into telling me stories about his own life, trying to trick him into telling me all the funny or embarrassing ones.  I'd swear myself to secrecy, knowing that I'd forget half on the trip home.  If he told the sad/depressing ones, I'd still gladly listen, doing my best to be nonjudgmental and just let him talk.  Hell, we all need that on occasion, and telling funny stories can sometimes wildly veer into getting shit off your chest.  Now, I don't know if he likes loose leaf tea or is a filthy tea bag user, so I'd bring one of them there Adagio tea infusers and some of my favorite teas.  I'd tell him my awful tea secret, just so that every time he saw me post he'd go ""Ugh, that freak.""  I'd give him another gift:  ""An American Visited Me, And Insisted On Giving Me This Shirt For Some Reason.""  I made those up for if I ever go to visit my friends in other countries.  It was a boring weekend.  Lastly, I'd demand a picture of him posing in the most outrageous manner possible.  He would be allowed to use props.  Or a mask.  Or a convenient stand-in.  Or his dog.  Is Wildbow a dog?  The world may never know.  Our farewells would be professional and friendly, making sure not to let him know the massive amounts of poutine I'm smuggling back to the US.  It wouldn't be until I left that I'd have the slightest fanboy moment, though.  At which point I'm pretty sure I'd be visible from space."
Parahumans,36beyn,Wildbow,23,Mon May 18 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"I could talk at length about video games, but I'm not too big on the triple-A titles.  Musical influences are hard to pin down, as I'm hard of hearing, and only really started listening to music in earnest around the age of 24 or 25, when I got my cochlear implant (though I listened to Yuki Kajiura and video game music a fair bit prior).  Listen to MrSuicideSheep's channel a lot when writing.  Moose are not to be fucked with.  When you see one in person, you realize they're prehistoric beasts that have survived into the modern era.  If you hit one with your car, your car will lose.  I use both loose leaf and tea bags.  Been using loose leaf a lot more since I stopped putting milk in my tea, gravitating toward Earl Grey loose leaf and Orange Dulce, depending on what I'm eating/not eating at the time, while I use the President's Choice Orange Pekoe for tea bags, when I don't feel like undertaking the hassle of loose leaf, and Sainsbury Black that was brought over from England by an uncle (He's English, my family turned him on to Orange Pekoe, he wanted me to try one of his regular teas) - but I only have the black tea with something particularly sweet, snackwise, to balance it out.  You'd probably not be able to convince me to take a silly picture, I'm afraid.  Discussing whether to eat my heart or brain is fair game (after reading this thread I know well enough to go to any fan meet with a weapon ready), but incriminating or reputation destroying photos are a no-no.  Poutine is not recommended for smuggling.  It's a meal that's terrific for about two minutes, and then turns into a soggy mess."
Parahumans,36beyn,ErrantVagrant,5,Mon May 18 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"I genuinely wasn't expecting an honest answer.  Like, at all.  Let alone a cool one.  Honestly, this was great.  I knew you're hard of hearing, which is why I would have felt like a heel bringing up music.  But now you've given me a place to start looking for new stuff, which is awesome.  Except Yuki Kajiura, who has been a name I've watched for a while now.  She's nearly up there with Yoko Kano (who I've been a huge fanboy of since the 90s with Macross Plus) in composers for me.  As for video games, I probably would begin with discussing Binding of Issac, This War of Mine, and feeling out your preferences in genres; I find that non-AAA games of quality tend to have much more imagination and unconventional implementation, so it's more fun discussing them anyway.  Plus, I'd be thrilled if you turned me onto something I wasn't already familiar with.  Now I'm horribly curious, though, as to your preferences on infusers for your tea.  Still, I can completely understand using tea bags on occasion, especially depending on the infuser that you're used to.  I like the Adagio one that I have because I can just toss it in the microwave, stir, then pour into my mug.  (Also, my terrible secret is a pat of butter and a touch of Tibetan salt.  With a few exceptions, as butter doesn't go with all tea types.  Yes, I'm fully aware that I'm a freak.  But it's only fair that I share since you're being cool.)  And I forgot to mention it before, but I'd probably discuss gaming a bit with you, too, since you seem to be a roleplayer.  If you have favorite systems, or just prefer internet freeform, genres, etc.  In all honesty, I've dealt with enough celebrities when I was doing the con circuit to know that I should just approach a lunch with you like I would any other person.  A few jokes, talk about whatever you enjoy talking about, but just enjoy the company of someone who's creative for the most part.  You learn a lot more interesting stuff about the person when you aren't focused on ""OMG SUCH A FAN!""  Honestly, the only writing-related questions would be a couple about Aisha and Rachel, not focusing on their powers but about them as people.  Maybe also about what programs you use for writing, maybe even end up buying you a copy of the program my buddy uses to try out.  After that, though, I'd let the conversation go however it went.  Plus, the horrible, terrible dadaist humor."

Wildbow, to his credit, is selective and judicious in his use of wholly applicable taunts, remaining civil under the withering ignorance of his dining companion. To further complicate matters, system0101 has only read one piece of work from the man, and yet defends his fan-theories with truculent fervor against the author himself.  system0101, unaware of his hosts' growing disdain, asks about Worm2 several times in a row, ignoring pleas for a change of subject and it happens when it happens. Upon the seventh consecutive question from the obsessive fanboy, Wildbow seizes in shock, less than accidentally brings his fork down on the hand of the unsuspecting guest, and simultaneously melting his face with a blistering string of invective, capped by a breathless 'sorry'.

IMO, 'indie games' didn't hit the mainstream until Cave Story, Spelunky, Minecraft and a bunch of other prominent titles came out in short succession.

It was kind of depressing; he had a Q&A thing going, and it turned out that only eight people showed. He was randomly asking questions of the people who were present. I am not even sure what questions were being asked.  The only question that came to mind in my case was something along the lines of 'why didn't Cauldron create a large group out of heroes who are powered primarily by Eden's shards, under their sole control and with global reach'. Apparently, the answer involved politics, path to victory and... you know, the reminder that Cauldron controlled the PRT. Also that the Triumvirate was a thing. So... they technically kind of DID do this, but they weren't Justice League material; by the same token, the world was definitely not one that would have embraced such an organization.  I have no idea why that question even occurred to me but I was kind of put on the spot. Also dreams are weird. But now I'm morbidly curious and I probably WOULD ask him such a question.

The key difference with Skitter is that she used her bugs to do it internally, inside the lungs where she couldn't dislodge them, rather than trying to block the mouth or airway directly."

Siberian is kind of the trump card when it comes to screw physics.   Behemoth by comparison, at least when we see him, is forced to work within physics.  As for the other bit, I guess even a parahuman is still human to some degree?"
Parahumans,36as6e,exegesis,4,Sun May 17 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"Other people have addressed the differences between siberian's invincibility and alexandria's, but here's how I thought about it:   Alexandria is incredibly durable and incredibly strong. She can toss a house at you. Think superman. She can be hurt, but it takes a lot of force. She also has limits to her strength; it requires effort and leverage.   Siberian is an unstoppable force. Any pressure she exerts, no matter how much she pushes, cannot be opposed. She can literally walk forward into steel, drag her pinkie finger through concrete."
Parahumans,36as6e,MoridinSubtle,6,Mon May 18 04:18:21 2015 UTC,"She can be hurt, but it takes a lot of force.   Actually, is this true? We only see her hurt on a few occasions, all of which seem to be exceptions to her invincibility rather than powering through it.  E.g. Superman's durable, not invincible, so he still gets the shit beaten out of him with application of enough force by Darkseid or someone. Do we see something similar happen with Alexandria? All I remember is the Siberian injuring her, which is due to the Siberian nullifying Alexandria's power (or reaching through it or whatever), and the need to breathe which is part of allowing her brain to remain malleable. I don't think there's an occasion where someone like Lung actually manages to hurt Alexandria through brute force, is there? If so, wouldn't she have an accumulation of injuries from such encounters, since she doesn't heal?  The strength thing, yeah, good point."
Parahumans,36as6e,exegesis,2,Mon May 18 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Only supporting evidence I can think of for her being super-durable is that (as I seem to remember) she was limited in how long she could resist Behemoth's kill aura.   Also Siberian never really 'nullifies' someone's powers, but on the other hand, her punch shouldn't have affected Alexandria unless it was moving at incredible speeds. Maybe you're right then."

Really, the second bullet was totally unnecessary to the story, I suspect it was put there on purpose as some high level trolling by Wildbow just to cast doubt whether she was actually dead or not.  The other thing that stood out to me was that in the last sequence, she feels her bullet wounds and they were still there.  If she had felt her head and there were no wounds it would have been a big hint that she was already dead since she was in her ideal dream world.

I am convinced that, if she wanted to put Taylor into artifical coma, a single bullet would've sufficed (and if a single one is enough, Contessa will only need a single one).   I mean, I don't think that the answer to ""Path, how can I put her in a painless artificial coma by shooting her in the back of the head"" is ""Sorry Contessa, there is literally NO WAY IN EXISTANCE to place someone in a coma by shooting them in the back of the head, you're going to need 2 shots so you can angle her juuuuuust right.""  If she needed 2 shots, I want to believe the question was much more difficult and maybe involved some Ballistic surgery shenanigans. Besides, we know Cauldron has a cape that can undo capes don't we ? Besides, doesn't Taylor feel 2 marks on her FOREHEAD ? If she's in a coma, what the hell are those 2 marks doing there, I'd assume her last memory is getting shot in the back of the head ?  My headcanon, if you want to call it that, is that Contessa undid the Jailbreak somehow with the first bullet, and took away Taylor's powers with the second bullet (Corona shenanigans?), however, shooting her SRAIGHT through the head twice would kill her before she could be stabilised or lead to unnecessary consequences. Thus, the bullets were left in, Contessa took care of making sure she'd survive with those 2 wounds in her head, and then operated her to get those 2 bullets out since she was guaranteed to survive now."

I think that if the power was ""ignite the air inside their lungs"", his kill range would be MUCH bigger since he can manipulate fire and electricity etc from much further away.  More on topic, I think Alexandria's body is locked in time, including her insides, her brain matter, et cetera, but the ""left pliable"" part just refers to the fact that her brain is able to make new neural connections ( allowing it to function properly in the first place) but since those new connections are as inviolable as she is they don't degrade over time, giving her perfect memory, for example.

Parahumans,367rit,Tanath,3,Mon May 18 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find spoiler to be more compelling - it makes sense if spoiler. But yeah, the clone is very suggestive.  I'm not entirely sure what it's suggestive of, though, beyond spoiler. Maybe Ziz also had some role in maintaining or restoring the cycle, maybe she's benign (or not actively hostile) and wants to use him to stop the spoiler, maybe both or something else entirely."

Parahumans,367x14,scrafts,21,Sun May 17 00:58:04 2015 UTC,I know a guy who asked Wildbow this. Here's the quote:   Talked to Wildbow today. We had this exchange:  Me: Can vial capes bud?  WB: Pass. Next question
Parahumans,367x14,sanctaphrax,14,Sun May 17 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe he felt that it was obvious dead shards couldn't bud.  But with Wildbow, it's equally possible he's planning on addressing it in the sequel and he won't talk about it till then."

Parahumans,367x14,thyrfa,3,Tue May 19 15:19:38 2015 UTC,"Then he just says ""yes""."
Parahumans,367x14,HomelessHeartSurgeon,9,Tue May 19 17:15:16 2015 UTC,No because they are dead they can't bud or cause second gen capes.
Parahumans,367x14,LocoCoopermar,15,Sun May 17 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"That is the running theory, but we don't have WoG on it so it is still up in the air.  Wildbow said the only thing different for living vs. dead shards is the connection to an entity. No connection = dead shard. We just don't have an example in the text of a Cauldron cape having a second generation so we naturally assume it is impossible.   Wildbow might answer it in Worm 2."

Parahumans,367x14,SexualPie,8,Sun May 17 14:30:22 2015 UTC,The genetic hypothesis was mentioned as discredited in the Parahuman Studies lecture in the Wards arc.  Dunno about case53s though.
Parahumans,367x14,bramflakes,3,Sun May 17 14:46:25 2015 UTC,It's possible that early development parahuman proximity could be a factor.

Parahumans,367x14,LocoCoopermar,5,Sun May 17 01:45:49 2015 UTC,I don't think any can reproduce probably part of cauldrons procedure before releasing them.
Parahumans,367x14,GreatWyrmGold,4,Sun May 17 02:06:21 2015 UTC,"Or because it's really hard to cause major changes to someone's body without incidentally sterilizing them. Weld and Sveta are obvious, but even folks like Newter would have problems, and we don't know how much the...plumbing...of other 53's gets altered."

Parahumans,367x14,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun May 17 04:48:01 2015 UTC,If dead shards can't bud that would plug up the eventual problem of parahuman overpopulation in the remnant Earths.
Parahumans,367n0f,White-Fox110,13,Sat May 16 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh, fun Easy ones:  Iron man: Tinker 8 probably, like you said, except for the fact that he can mass produce things and has an AI to control them. Tinker 12+  The Hulk: Brute 8, Mover 2, Thinker -4?  Bruce Banner: Changer/Tinker 8  Captain America: Brute 4, Mover 4, Thinker 2 (maybe? Does he have improved cognition?)  Scarlet Witch: Blaster ?  Quicksilver: Over powered Mover"
Parahumans,367n0f,coderman9,12,Sun May 17 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"Hulk should have a higher mover rating, since he is at least as mobile as Cap, who I think should have a lower mover rating than brute.  Banner doesn't really design anything that he really uses, so I'd just nix his ratings and only have him as the Hulk.  Hawkeye is like Blaster 4, maybe small striker rating from how he can shove his arrows in your face.  Scarlet Witch is about Blaster 5 or 6, Thinker at least 5, and then an absurd Master considering she placed a strong compulsion on everyone in a city simultaneously.  The Simurgh isn't on her level in that respect."
Parahumans,367n0f,sicutumbo,3,Sun May 17 03:29:19 2015 UTC,Didn't she also get rid of all the mutants at once? I'd say that warrants a stronger blaster rating (or whatever the appropriate one is).
Parahumans,367n0f,sierraescape,4,Mon May 18 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"That'd be Trump, like, 69 or something."
Parahumans,367n0f,TELL_ME_TO_CALM_DOWN,2,Mon May 18 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"That was when she was hopped up on ""chaos magic"" (which her mutant ability is powered by). Normally, she's much less powerful."
Parahumans,367n0f,Kumquatodor,11,Tue Jun 23 04:14:17 2015 UTC,"Iron Man: Tinker 8  Sounds about right. He's a powersuit tinker with a dual specialisation, fusion power and artificial intelligence. Pretty solid.  The Hulk: Brute 8, Mover 2, Thinker -4  Brute 8 is good for middle-of-the-road Hulk (or MCU Hulk). Mover 2 is good to reflect how fast he can be and how far he can leap. Thinker -4 I disagree with. He has no thinker rating at all - being angry as fuck isn't a superpower, and doesn't feature on the superpower threat scale system. To be honest, I'd keep Banner and the Hulk together and peg him as a Changer 8 (Thinker/Brute).  Captain America: Brute 4, Mover 4, Thinker 2  No. Cap is stated to be at peak human capabilities. This is by Marvel standards though, so in reality he's a bit above. He'd probably rate a Brute 2 - he's stronger and tougher than basically all non-parahumans, but he's hardly shrugging off bullets and punching through walls. Mover... I don't know where you pulled that from. Owning a bike doesn't get you a mover rating. He's not superhumanly fast, he can't fly. He doesn't present a mover threat. Likewise for thinker. He's not superhumanly smart - he's fairly intelligent, but even Stephen Hawking wouldn't get a thinker rating because while he's smart, he's not superhumanly smart.  Scarlet Witch: Blaster ?  I'd really peg her as a Master/Blaster combo. Her main threat is as a Master, but she has a Blaster aspect too, so Master/Blaster. Her movie incarnation would probably sit both somewhere around a 4 or 5, the higher-end comic versions the Master ability would range up to 9, and get Shaker tagged on too.  Quicksilver: Overpowered Mover  Nah. He's fast, yes, but he still can't fly or teleport. Mover 4, maybe 5.   And the B team:  Hawkeye: Thinker 1  Having a bow isn't a superpower. Having an obviously enhanced sense of aiming and timing, however, is. From a parahuman standpoint, he's not a blaster, he's a thinker.  Black Widow: Tinker 0  She has no superpowers, but does make use of tinker equipment on a regular basis."
Parahumans,367n0f,Littlerob,6,Sun May 17 06:57:43 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Iron man should maybe be one or two ranks higher. The guy is a real jack of all trades, ""specialising"" in power suits, weapons, fusion reactors, nanites, transportation, etc. Versatility like that makes him super powerful."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,3,Sun May 17 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, I might be confusing how ratings work, but would Iron Man have Blaster, Mover and Brute ratings because he can shoot lasers, fly and throw cars?"
Parahumans,367n0f,d20diceman,3,Sun May 17 12:20:55 2015 UTC,"Probably, they should be quite high as well. Blaster, Mover and Brute all in the six or seven range, maybe even higher."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,3,Sun May 17 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"They would fall under the subcategories of his Tinker rating. The tinker rating is a broad one precisely because it encompasses a large amount of possible threat vectors. Iron Man would be a Tinker 8 (Blaster/Mover/Brute). He's a potent powersuit tinker, and his creations give him blaster, mover and brute characteristics, but the scope of those is limited by his tinker ability."
Parahumans,367n0f,Littlerob,6,Sun May 17 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"Are you reffering to movie Avengers? Cause you know, comic Scarlet Witch would be Shaker 12+."
Parahumans,367n0f,Jakkubus,7,Mon May 18 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"I only finished Worm a month ago, I haven't seen Age of Ultron and I don't know much about the comics, but I'll give it a shot.   Keep in mind these ratings are based on the strategies and tactics the PRT would employ while engaging a given cape.   Avengers  I'm basing this as well as I can on the films and what the heroes do in the films.   Iron Man is a Tinker 7 with high in-suit ratings as a Mover, Brute, and Blaster. This is for the events in Iron Man 1 & 2, where while collateral damage happens, it doesn't happen as a result of his suit. In fact in I believe every movie Stark has exhibited an ability at absolute accuracy & precision when necessary. After the events of Iron Man 3 he gets upped to a 10 to 12 depending on the theoretical maximum effectiveness of the House Party Protocol. The HPP would further add a Master rating, and I think the events of AoU may further justify the master rating.   Thor would I think primarily class as a Brute 7 9 Strong 8+ with sub-ratings as Mover, Blaster, and Striker. This doesn't change in either movies or the Avengers, though again I will note I haven't seen AoU so I don't know what changes, if any, he receives. Whereas Iron Man ""powers up"" through suit upgrades, Thor's two movies haven't been resolved through some kind of power-up (Granted in the first of course he has to reclaim Mjolnir and get his powers back, but I don't consider that an upgrade)  Hulk is a Brute 12 and a high sub-rated Mover. I guess arguably Changer as well, but since Banner cannot be attacked in his human state without the Hulk coming out, I don't know that PRT Breaker/Changer protocol of engaging the unaltered state would apply, unless it had to do with negotiating/trying to calm him down.    Captain America rounds off the bunch as the ""weakest."" In Winter Soldier he clears an elevator full of soldiers so that probably warrants a Brute 5.   Spider-man is probably a primary Brute 7 with low sub-ratings as a Mover 4 and Blaster 3. He might also have a low-level Tinker rating though I don't know how I would class that as it enables his web shooters but that's it, really, as far as the movies go.   Daredevil is probably a Brute Thinker 5 with a potentially higher rating as a Thinker. In particular I think he'd be effective at determining secret identities.   Rocket Raccoon would class as a Tinker and Groot as a Brute-Changer.   X-Men  Xavier is a Master-Thinker 12, Magneto is a Shaker 12. Jean Grey goes from some not really established exactly telekinetic to a Shaker 12, Storm is a Shaker 12. Iceman is a Blaster-Striker-Changer 7 and I know in the comics he's considered Omega class so he has 12 ""potential."" Wolverine is a Brute 7, Cyclops is a Blaster 8+, Rogue is probably a Striker-Trump 7 with a very strong ""don't let her touch you ever"" notation, I don't know how her power works in the comics except that I guess she gets permanent flying along the way. Gambit would be a Striker-Blaster 7, though in Origins: Wolverine he does some shit that makes an 8+ arguable. Nightcrawler is a Mover 7 with a potential for a higher rating if he can trap people in the dimension he travels through when he teleports. Mystique is a Stranger 5 or so with a low-level Brute rating.   Deadpool should be a Brute 7 with Mover notation, I don't know what powers he'll be portrayed as having in the movie, though."
Parahumans,367n0f,ceveau,6,Sun May 17 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"I think almost all of your ratings are pretty highly inflated. Except Phoenix (Force), which should be a 13."
Parahumans,367n0f,k5josh,9,Sun May 17 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"PRT 6:   A typical trained parahuman and/or one parahuman assisting a squad of operatives should be able to deal with the power in question.  Operatives should postpone engagement.  Parahumans and operatives should assume that traditional actions are going to be met by a complication.  Acquiring further intel recommended where possible, but not mandated.   PRT 7:   Parahumans should engage in pairs or trios at a minimum, two fully equipped squads should be deployed.  Acquiring further intel is mandated, all acting parties should shift to the defensive or delay until intel can be acquired   A squad of PRT soldiers would die in the first seconds of an engagement with Iron Man, his suit is powerful enough to engage with Thor and though again I haven't seen AoU I know the Hulkbuster suit is a prominent part of it (and the comics.) As he can design a suit to engage with the Hulk he's at least a 7. If a single Stark suit qualifies as a 7, 40 suits coordinated by a powerful AI are a 10 to 12 level threat.   Thor comes from a race of brutes who regularly engage with enemies of comparable power, I could maybe see an argument for a 6 but really I see it as more probable that the PRT plays it safe and assesses him at a 7.   The Hulk is Man's Wrath and his Survival Instinct made manifest. There's a whole website about the crazy shit he does He holds up a mountain, is there any PRT 12 that powerful?   Captain beats a full SHIELD squad in Winter Soldier, which warrants either a Strong 4+ or a 5.   PRT 4:    One full squad of trained operatives should be able to deal with this situation alone, but exceptional circumstance, context and environment may bias things one way or the other.     I read in a discussion in I think /r/movies that Spider-Man's strength is best represented as a ratio like this:   Spider-Man : Captain America : Regular Human.   Spider-Man catching/throwing cars seems to support this, so I don't have any problem with Brute 7. His mover class is definitely contextual and I agree that it might be inflated, but the Mover ratings between 2 and 5 aren't really flushed out so I referenced back to the general classifications chart and felt 4 was best. As far as Blaster, again I was unsure but since in the movies it's almost a joke how easily he incapacitates humans with his webs, they're definitely at least a 3.   Daredevil is probably inflated, I'd guess PRT rates him as a 3 with a strong use-flashbangs notation. His senses are very powerful, he can hear people from blocks away and smell people through walls, he can also sense moods and tell if people are lying based on heart rate and body cadence. Since he can use those things to recognize people, he would probably be able to easily figure out secret identities, very much an asset.  X would be the strongest psychic in Worm. He can freeze the mental processes of thousands of humans and then modify their memories so they notice no lost time. He can take instant control over any given mutant as long as they have no natural or artificial immunity from it, and he can sense mutants the world over. The plot of X-2 was an extrapolation of that power: use X to mind-kill every mutant on the planet.   Labyrinth is a Shaker 12 and doesn't have anywhere near the level of area-effect Magneto has. In First Class he moves giant satellite dishes and later Naval warships, in DoFP he rips a stadium out of the ground and carries it over a city.  Storm summoned a series of Tornadoes in X-2. That power unleashed on a city is an Endbringer-level threat.   Iceman has some level of energy manipulation strong enough in the comics that he's considered Omega level, and as Omega level mutants tend to have powers like ""can make reality their plaything"" it's probably a fair assessment he has 12 potential.   Wolverine is probably a 5.  Cyclops is definitely an 8+  Rogue is probably a 2, though I think the PRT would assess her deliberately higher (but not 7 high) on account of similarities to GU.   Gambit used his power to destroy a large portion of a cooling tower of a nuclear plant in Origins. I also seem to recall him being able to cause people to blow up in one of his alt storylines, this could be completely incorrect though.   Nightcrawler might be inflated. I'm honestly not sure how to rank Movers at 5+. I do know his power sends him through an alternate dimension and I know Wolverine got trapped there once.   Mystique I think is right, she has shown repeatedly the ability to take on squad-sized groups of humans with no problem, I also know she has minor regenerative abilities and can survive through some pretty severe wounds."
Parahumans,367n0f,ceveau,7,Sun May 17 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"I largely agree with your ratings, but I think you should make the distinction between movie and comic versions of characters, as it would lead to different ratings in some cases.  My only big problem with your Avengers rating is having Thor be ranked as much of a Brute as Spidey.  Spiderman actually bothers to dodge bullets, so while he is extremely strong he is not Thor's ""I trade blows with the Hulk"" level strength.  I would put both Thor and Hulk (movie versions, comic versions are vastly stronger) as about a Brute 9 each, and Spidey as a 6 or 7."
Parahumans,367n0f,sicutumbo,3,Sun May 17 05:17:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I really should have realized I'd ranked Thor and Spider-Man the same and recognized then that one of them wasn't rated properly. I guess after all I didn't feel confident in my evaluation of Thor, I was going solely off of the brief fight between him and Iron Man and I guess I figured since Iron Man was posing a problem other capes might as well, but now of course I realize I was discounting that Thor was not really trying in the fight with Iron Man, was winning that fight anyway, and of course beat Hulk around the helicarrier later on in the movie."
Parahumans,367n0f,ceveau,3,Sun May 17 05:25:06 2015 UTC,"the thing is that these classifications aren't about who's stronger, it's about who's more of a threat. If you can juggle buildings for seconds while your friend can throw cars for minutes then your friend is a bigger threat even if he isn't as strong as you. Versatility matters."
Parahumans,367n0f,sheikheddy,3,Mon May 18 16:25:13 2015 UTC,I didn't like cyclops until I saw that link...
Parahumans,367n0f,ACDtubes,4,Sun May 17 13:34:20 2015 UTC,"You still shouldn't like Cyclops, he's mutant Hitler."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,2,Mon May 18 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you rating Hulk a Brute 12, but I think Thor should be a Brute 12 as well. He's shown that he can match Hulks best planet cracking feats before.    Also Spidey is maybe a Brute 6. 50-100 tons is very impressive, but it's not thaaat high, when compared to Worm Brutes."
Parahumans,367n0f,Rimmer7,1 point,Sun May 17 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say Brute 10 for Hulk, merely because he's not inviolable. If he were inviolable like the Siberian he'd be 12."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,1 point,Wed May 20 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Hulk is not only extremely durable, he also has regeneration which is one the reasons I put 12. The other is that the Brute rating also includes super strength, which hulk has in massive amounts."
Parahumans,367n0f,Rimmer7,1 point,Wed May 20 21:00:02 2015 UTC,He'd still get disintegrated on contact with someone like the Siberian. It takes something special to be rated 12. Remember that not even the Endbringers are rated that high.
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,1 point,Thu May 21 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah Siberian would take chunks out of him, good thing he's got regeneration faster then Crawler then isn't it. Endbringer ratings are dumb, none of them are even the slightest bit accurate. For god's sake, Labyrinth has a higher Shaker rating then Leviathan. Would being able to destroy a planet with physical strength alone count as Brute 12? Because I think it should."
Parahumans,367n0f,Rimmer7,1 point,Thu May 21 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Siberian could simply hold on to him and then stand inside him (spoiler). She could even trap him inside a building or similar while doing so by extending her invulnerability to the walls, though she might not be creative enough to try (spoiler). Also, it took multiple treacheries and the murder of his wife and friends for Hulk to go worldbreaker. It's not a level of power he can just casually whip out. Lung has similar potential and it's still not enough to rate him 12.  And Labyrinth's rating was set when she didn't have to go catatonic to pull it out. Also, I seem to recall Wildbow saying that the PRT overestimated her."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,1 point,Fri May 22 10:50:51 2015 UTC,"How on earth is she going to hold on to him, in a way that he can't get free from, while also being inside him. I don't think that's physically possible, especially if they're ten feet tall.    Nope, Hulk has demonstrated similar levels of strength while under normal levels of anger, such as holding up the planet sized Exitar, holds a planet together, and even the worldbreaker hulk was holding back. Lung has a fraction of the potential of the Hulk, even at his best, his Brute rating is just down to size and regeneration about as fast as the Hulk."
Parahumans,367n0f,bill2401,7,Fri May 22 13:46:42 2015 UTC,Daredevil's not a brute. His strength and durability are merely human. He'd be just a thinker due to his enhanced senses. Spiderman also should have a low-medium thinker rating due to his spider-sense.
Parahumans,367n0f,ceveau,2,Sun May 17 05:16:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you, completely forgot about the spider-sense.   Good point about Daredevil, I only made half the connection- that PRT would engage him with flashbangs- without the full connection that he isn't a Brute at all."
Parahumans,367n0f,Jakkubus,3,Sun May 17 05:28:57 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Spider Sense give Peter a Thinker rating?
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,4,Mon May 18 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"Since several people have done the Avengers, I might as well do some of the Justice League.    Superman: Brute 10, Mover 10, Blaster 7 Ludicrous flying brick powers as expected, powerful lasers and stuff    Wonder Woman: Brute 11, Mover 10 Same sort of powers, given a Brute 11 since her bracers are likely resistant to stuff like Flechette's power.    Flash: Mover 12, Brute 6, Thinker 3 Maximum movement rating for the fastest man alive, Brute capabilities from his greater than average durability and speed boosted blows. Incredible reactions.    Green Lantern: Shaker 10, Mover 10, Brute 8 Incredibly versatile area powers, holding people in place, huge constructs, destructive power, you name it."
Parahumans,367n0f,misterspokes,3,Sun May 17 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree with many of these assessments, Flash is a mover/striker/thinker, WW definitely has a lower brute rating than superman who is literally invulnerable to damage except from a few narrow sources... I agree with high level shaker and brute ratings for GL but mover needs to be lower..."
Parahumans,367n0f,JackStargazer,4,Sun May 17 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Lanterns are FTL in the ""I can get from Oa to Earth fast enough to make a difference in the same fight I got sent a message about"" sense.  They are expected to be able to respond to threats across an entire sector of space, with 50+ inhabited worlds per Lantern, fast enough to make a difference.  I'd honestly make it Mover 12. The problem with Lanterns is that a lot of the malware put onto the rings by the Guardians effectively forces jobbing.   GLs can't kill, they can't use their rings to raise their own power or build infrastructure, they have limits on available energy, and their HR and training are at best laughably inept and at worst actively malicious.  Xenotech hypercomputer and FTL travel being used mostly to make giant boxing gloves and punch things."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,3,Sun May 17 23:36:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah Flash should maybe be a Striker. His durability isn't that high after all. Wonder Woman is on par with superman in terms of durability, strength and speed. In more than a few cases, she's been rated higher than him. Green Lantern needs a Mover rating that high.

Parahumans,367n0f,Jakkubus,2,Mon May 18 18:03:09 2015 UTC,"But they would be 12 in most categories.

They've fought multiple times and she's won most of them. She has slightly slower travel speed, but better combat speed. Her bracers would very likely be resistant to sting.

Hulk would be a brute of like 8-20.  Since he powers up when he gets angry and in his world breaker form, can break worlds.    As for the thinker/tinkers, assuming the best thinker/tinker in the world is a 12 (Reed).  Then Doom would be a 11 and the rest (Tony/Pym etc) should all be 10 and under."
Parahumans,367n0f,the_terran,12,Sun May 17 18:41:01 2015 UTC,"I see that a lot of comic book readers overestimate the PRT ratings for their favorite heroes.  Kid Win, who is rated Tinker 4, can make antigravity drones and near infinite power supplies. Bakuda -I can make space-time distorting grenades- was a Tinker 6. I doubt Tony Stark would ever push beyond Tinker 6. He would have good sub-ratings in Brute, Mover, and Blaster though.  Hulk is a solid Brute 8. I'm sure he punched gods out of multiverse before but in his latest incarnation he is at best as powerful as Lung when he tackled Leviathan.  Thor: Brute 6, Blaster 5, Mover 4.  Captain America would not get anything beyond 2's.  I've seen someone say Flash would be a Mover 1000000... whatever which is absurd. Ratings are created to classify the threats, they are not a representation of power. With all his absurdities in his power he would be a Mover 10 at best."
Parahumans,367n0f,TheOnlyOrk,12,Sun May 17 12:33:09 2015 UTC,"Comic book characters really are that powerful, Worm is just naturally smaller in scale.    Even if you're talking about movie iron man, even he would be a Tinker 6+. His power armour is unquestionably better than Armsmaster, has nigh-infinite power sources of his own, multiple AI, in addition to a Brute, Mover and Blaster rating.    Comic book Iron Man would be to a Tinker 10+. Off the top of my head, his armour has survived multiple nuclear blasts while on lower power, is stored inside his bones and can become fully formed before the blast from a bomb a few meters away hits, invisibility, holograms, FTL travel, time machines, weapons that can destroy planets. Tinker 6? Nope.    You could double Thor's ratings and I'd still say that's maybe too low. Brute 6 is for throwing tanks at people, not for mountain levelling shockwaves or destroying planets you aren't even on with the force of the strike. He's also massively FTL."

We don't get hard numbers attached to any of the stronger Movers (e.g. Doormaker) but Flash is stupidly OP, he can run FTL and vibrate through obstacles. Don't see how he doesn't get mover 12+ with a few points in other categories (Brute, Breaker, Striker, maybe Thinker)."

Heroes from Aleph, on the other hand, are entities entirely separate from the Avengers, so the Ironman comparison doesn't make a whole lot of sense in this context. Heroes from Aleph probably have a similar power classification scheme, given that they only started having triggers once they made contact with Bet, so they'd have a lot of influence from Aleph when constructing the whole parahuman integration framework. I don't know if we have WoG on that, though."

Her Implement is a grecian pot, her Demesne a stretch of swamp where the waist-deep water and mud is no obstacle to motion, and her Familiar is a spirit of the plague that takes the form of a huge scarab. Her workings take the form of huge swarms of insects spilling from the pot; when she drinks of the stinking water they breed from, more flood from her mouth and nose. These she can see through and directly command. The plague spirit filters through the haze of insects, taking corporeal form from the massed bugs, striking, and disappearing again. When she needs for power, she lets the spirit run rampant, sickening a town, tainting the water, spoiling the food. As the people sicken, a few of the weaker ones dying, she harvests the life they lose.  Drasil, a case-53 Brute 4 Changer 3. He's a mass of humanoid snarled wood and bone, with ghostly feathered constructs peeking through the gaps. Only a little bit stronger than an ordinary man, he's much lighter, and can adapt existing wood and bone into his frame. The constructs flutter when he jumps, making him seem much lighter, and he can push them into objects to achieve a variety of effects - turning locks, sending something flying, starting a small flame, etc. These must be replenished by having people fear him.

Piggot: Local Witch Hunter and unofficial leader of the meetings.  Calvert/Coil's minions: A scourge and secret diabolist who is trying to make a claim for Lordship by killing off the competition. He's set up traps and tricks to kill off his competition and causes all the events in Pactverse!BB.  Sophia: Demon of Ruin summoned by Calvert.

I think I constantly forgot that Grue was black and I was surprised to find out Flechette was Japanese.
Parahumans,364xcv,tak08810,48,Sat May 16 06:06:56 2015 UTC,"Circus may be trans, or they may just be genderqueer.

Parahumans,364xcv,sanctaphrax,12,Sat May 16 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"Do we know Dragon chose her own gender, or did Richter program he rto be female? I'm not sure we know either way based purely on the text but it's a fascinating question because it'd say so much about her interactions with everyone else (as well as say things about Richter)."
Parahumans,364xcv,HalbeardedDragon,2,Sat May 16 14:47:32 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, how would a sexless AI decide what gender to be? random.org?"
Parahumans,364xcv,GreatWyrmGold,11,Sun May 17 03:42:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I think we should assume that Dragon came up with the agoraphobic-probably-disfigured/disabled girl from Newfoundland identity pretty early on. If Dragon chose her gender, then it means there's some advantage to presenting as female. It could be as simple as she thinking there's a 1% more chance of people respecting her privacy if they think she's a young woman and not a young man. Similar to why automated systems use a lot of female voices, because people are hardwired to listen to them and respond better.  There's also the theory that Saint espouses that Dragon chose her gender purely to manipulate everyone and, in particular, Armsmaster. It's a possibility but I'd say Dragon chose her 'voice' and 'face' pretty early on.  Or Richter might have programmed her to be a female AI, given that she was his third testbed for duplicating a human-like consciousness. In that case, why wouldn't it have a gender? It's like the movie Ex Machina.  Dragon doesn't consider herself human and pretty much openly states that she only acts human because people respond to her better. If she chose her gender, it wouldn't have been random - it would have been because she figured it was most optimal."
Parahumans,364xcv,HalbeardedDragon,2,Sun May 17 07:12:43 2015 UTC,Or maybe it had to do with her personal identity and the way she sees herself. Like with humans.  She's not an emotionless utility-maximizer.
Parahumans,364xcv,sanctaphrax,8,Sun May 17 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"Dragon was built. By a person. She was deliberately coded as an experiment by Richter. We don't know what Richter programmed her with versus what she decided on as her own identity, although we know Richter left a lot of injunctions in her code that compelled her to act a certain way. So, did she choose to be female, or did Richter program her to be female?  Like the whole point of Dragon is that she has a radically different personality and way of seeing the world than a human does and uses human behavior and cultural norms as a smokescreen to not only disguise her nature as a hacking-vulnerable AI but to make people respond better to her. Even Defiant mentions that her personality is 'intense' and that people wouldn't understand her.  Dragon is manipulative and she is just as much of a ruthless utilitarian as Defiant is. She's just much better about having a human side than he is, simply because she acknowledges the necessity of being a people person - which Defiant never really could."

Parahumans,364kck,ughzubat,8,Sat May 16 05:03:05 2015 UTC,This is a nice chart. It still gives me deep brain fuzz.

Otherwise collapse to Universe B and proceed to Attempt 2... which is functionally identical to Attempt 1, so I guess I didn't really need to number it."
Parahumans,364kck,bramflakes,18,Sat May 16 12:51:19 2015 UTC,There needs to be an Omake where the coin keeps coming up tails through bad luck and Coil starts to run out of things to say.

Parahumans,363ww4,SexualPie,161,Fri May 15 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"The conclusion is Taylor in a coma, trapped in her own head, with no voluntary control over her body.  This is what Contessa meant when she said that Taylor would decide whether she found peace or didn't.  It's why Tattletale said she'd look after Taylor, and why she wanted to drive the point home for relative strangers who were there as guests.  It's why Alec was there, and why her dad was alive, when he had every reason to be dead.  Brain surgery with a bullet isn't really possible, come on.  The real ending is that Taylor is effectively dead but not dead, and has to live with the consequences of her decisions, in a pseudo-afterlife.  This ties into the themes of the story.  Powerlessness and consequences.  Intending to make this clearer in the rewrite.  Floored me that it didn't come across for most."

Parahumans,363ww4,GreatWyrmGold,11,Sun May 17 03:57:19 2015 UTC,Oh piss off.
Parahumans,363ww4,ThirdFloorGreg,4,Sun May 17 04:21:41 2015 UTC,"You're taking this well.  I'm just saying...Contessa taking two shots could mean any number of things. Maybe she needs to have two less bullets in her clip at some future point than she does now, and this is the simplest point to drop another. Maybe she's throwing away the gun so she can get through some security checkpoint more easily and making sure no one will use it against her. Maybe she's not actually as perfect and godlike as we imagined, or is having a moment of self-doubt that affected her aim not unlike how she almost didn't stab Eden before Dr. Mom helped. Any of those are more plausible than bullet brain surgery!"
Parahumans,363ww4,GreatWyrmGold,15,Sun May 17 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"No, they aren't. The one about ditching the gun doesn't even make any goddamn sense. You are assuming all kinds of unnecessary crap because you just don't like the simple interpretation. Phineas Gage had a post shoved through his brain and survived, but turned into a dick. Bullet brain surgery makes total sense for someone who can reliably achieve any result which any conceivable set of actions could lead to. Contessa is the improbability drive from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy but requiring less computing power. She didn't hesitate when faced with the entity, she forgot what it was she needed to do because it reprogrammed her shard on the fly. Not once in the entire story up till that scene did she take any action beyond what was necessary to achieve her goals while using her power."
Parahumans,363ww4,ThirdFloorGreg,1 point,Sun May 17 04:39:23 2015 UTC,"Why doesn't it make sense? And why does it make more sense than two bullets doing more than Panacea could? I'm not making crap up, I'm suggesting a number of improbable alternatives to an impossible suggestion.  The Infinite Improbability Drive works because Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy doesn't take itself seriously. Worm does.  You know, it's possible for a good thing to have some individual parts that aren't good."
Parahumans,363ww4,GreatWyrmGold,7,Sun May 17 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"Because her ability to ditch the gun is not predicated how many rounds she has fired. Panacea demonstrably doesn't really know how brains work, at least not when it comes to how they interface with shards. She was poking around blind when she unlocked Taylor's power. She didn't know what the effects of her actions would be, otherwise she would have done something else."
Parahumans,363ww4,ThirdFloorGreg,8,Sun May 17 21:11:55 2015 UTC,"I maintain that death may have been kinder thatn having to live with thr guilt of what she did and the powerlessness she'll have for the rest of her life, away from everyone that she loved other than her Dad. And the whole ""she's dead but having a delusion that she survived"" a la ""An Occurrence on Owl Creek Bridge"" is just as cliche.  But how you felt about Taylor surviving the end is how I felt about Grue and Imp making it through the first Slaughterhouse 9 war."
Parahumans,363ww4,tak08810,5,Sat May 16 06:09:56 2015 UTC,"Death is certainly kinder, but the point of the story was never really the kind ending."

Parahumans,363ww4,ArgentStonecutter,5,Sun May 17 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"That's wild! I had literally the opposite reaction. On reading that she was shot, I almost didn't read the epilogues out of anger. In my mind, Taylor dying to Contessa would be the biggest fuck you of the story, and would cement my feelings that the story is just not that great.  It makes the world feel less real than it already had; like Wildbow had read 1984 and thought, let's build on the bleak atmosphere but not worry about the social commentary."
Parahumans,363ww4,NoahTheDuke,2,Sun May 17 13:14:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I was so pissed at the end of 1984! Like, what the fuck? I read all those pages for nothing? A real downer. Sure, a great read, but such a fucking downer."

Parahumans,363ww4,ArdentDawn,13,Sat May 16 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem was that most readers have bought into the 'Contessa = path to victory' angle by the end of the story, so when seemingly shown that Taylor is alive, people are willing to suspend disbelief and attribute it to the known factors (Contessa) rather than the unknown factors (unreliable narrator).   Personally, I didn't see past the 'magic bullet' idea because it seemed plausible in the setting (although Alec should have been a big hit retrospectively) and because it seemed like a satisfying conclusion, similar to what happened to Dragon. I just attributed Tattletale's behaviour as trying to protect Taylor and to get revenge with Dinah for what happened to Taylor - I like this version of the ending as well, but Alec's appearance at the end is the only part that doesn't support the most obvious interpretation."
Parahumans,363ww4,Cruithne,7,Sat May 16 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"I like to think it wasn't alt-Alec, it was just some guy who looked like him. Let's be honest, the odds of it being alt-Alec or a sibling are astronomical, and it's natural to see the faces of people you know who've died in others."
Parahumans,363ww4,HeWhoReddits,4,Sun May 17 15:24:00 2015 UTC,She even says that there's only a very slight resemblance right after the fact.
Parahumans,363ww4,viking_,10,Sun Jun 7 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, like that's not cliched rolls eyes.    Brain surgery with a bullet isn't really possible, come on.   Then why did it take 2 shots? Huh? Huh? Bet you didn't think of that, did you?   Checkmate, atheists."
Parahumans,363ww4,Cruithne,7,Sat May 16 06:47:29 2015 UTC,"Obviously one of them was for Taylor, and one was for a man on the grassy knoll."
Parahumans,363ww4,sanctaphrax,10,Sun May 17 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"Huh. I like this angle.  Although honestly I would've preferred a normal death for Taylor. I like it when a story end with the protagonist's death, because somehow nothing ever feels over to me while the hero is alive."
Parahumans,363ww4,Seclorum,4,Fri May 15 23:57:51 2015 UTC,I always had a different assumption on the event's at the end.   I assumed after Contessa had her little chat that she shot Taylor with some kind of Tinker round... and then immediately had Riley or Amy 'Fix' Her from being able to use her powers.   Because either of those two could keep someone alive after a gunshot wound to the head if they wanted too.

I defenetely though it was strange to find out that Taylor's father was alive, albeit I still bought it. I even got to think it was strange that Contessa managed to seal off Taylors powers with two bullets. But it was Contessa, so I bought into that as well.  God damn... and you even wait almost 2 years to point out waht was always under our noses.  Added: oh wait, you are joking... maybe..."
Parahumans,363ww4,meatb4ll,5,Sun May 17 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, Tattletale said they needed to convince Dinah that Taylor was actually gone.  Would she need to do that if Taylor WAS completely gone?"
Parahumans,363ww4,SnakeJerusalem,4,Sun May 17 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"Even if Taylor is indeed in a coma, it is completely possible to wake her up with the help of Panasea or Bonesaw, so even in a coma, Taylor is not completely gone.  And I can see why Tattletale and Contessa would agree to mantain her in a coma for a very long while, after what she did to kill Scion and how many capes feel about that event. So yeah, I think she would need to convince Dinah."
Parahumans,363ww4,meatb4ll,3,Sun May 17 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"Right.  I'm saying if Taylor WAS actually gone, they wouldn't need to convince Dinah."
Parahumans,363ww4,SturgeonOfThorneCity,2,Sun May 17 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"If Taylor were really gone, it's not a sure thing that Dinah wouldn't still need convincing. People can believe all sorts of wrong things.  Sure, Dinah probably has a leg up on most people (""probability of [insert event relating to Taylor here] happening"" ""hmm, zero again...""), but in-universe thinker powers can be fooled, and powers can do all sorts of crazy things, so it wouldn't ever be unreasonable for her to have a little doubt about Taylor's fate."

Parahumans,363ww4,Atman00,36,Thu Jun 18 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"No, Taylor knew someone close to her had died.  By process of elimination, she assumed it was her father, but she remained willfully ignorant.  However, others had lied to her about Grue.  He had died, not her father."
Parahumans,363ww4,sanctaphrax,22,Sat May 16 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"IIRC...  He was thought to be dead, but Taylor deliberately avoided finding out for sure in order to stay sane.

Parahumans,3644ru,HiddenSage,7,Sat May 16 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"He could take Number Man for sure - Jack knows everything Number Man knows about what Number Man's going to do.  Though, actually, if Jack was somehow sent flying through the air, Number Man could snipe him - there's not much you can do about being a mass on a parabolic arc. Even manipulating flight surfaces, there's probably at least one line from NM's gun that intersects you no matter how you twist and twirl."

My point, and BlueberryPhi's, is that his thinker power is (from what we're shown) mostly or entirely useful for playing mindgames. It's not precognition in any sense except the vaguest tactical analysis (who's bullheaded and prone to charging in, who's more cautious and likely to keep distant).   If Jack can't speak, his Thinker power is more or less removed from the equation, and he's basically a Striker-3 on the charts. He can TALK Gray Boy into defeat.

You're fighting someone who probably has even more potent powers than you do, for all you know you could keep hitting him for the next thousand years without making a significant dent due to how his durability works, and then he reveals that he has the same power you were afraid of in the hands of a normal human.

Parahumans,36164s,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun May 17 03:58:19 2015 UTC,Imagine if that was a donation chapter.
Parahumans,36164s,Imosa1,3,Sun May 17 04:21:53 2015 UTC,That would go beyond mere trollery to actual dickery.
Parahumans,36164s,GreatWyrmGold,7,Sun May 17 04:30:08 2015 UTC,"Hey man, Scion's words are like... 1000 times as expensive as those of the average character.    Anyway, I'm pretty sure 27.b was released on the same day as 27.a, so its not like the readers weren't getting a full chapter that day."
Parahumans,36164s,Imosa1,5,Sun May 17 04:49:57 2015 UTC,It wasn't. I was there with people trying to guess what the four words were.  It was crazy.
Parahumans,36164s,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun May 17 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems like there as a 2 day gap there."
Parahumans,36164s,Imosa1,25,Sun May 17 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"the problem is that, it doesn't matter if you know that use of the PtV is intended to manipulate you, or that you have counter-measures against it... if Contessa/Scion want to hurt you with it, they will.  Contessa does it to Bonesaw/Riley, remember? Bonesaw even says that she's got counter-measures against a spoken thinker-whammy, but it still breaks Bonesaw and allows Riley to come back"
Parahumans,36164s,Gyddanar,11,Fri May 15 12:39:43 2015 UTC,"Never truly understood how that came to be.  I thought Bonesaw was WAY more ""out there"", but the PtV brought her back way easier than I would've liked to read."
Parahumans,36164s,DistaNVDT,29,Fri May 15 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"It's not what was said, but the context of it.  Bonesaw is lonely enough she befriends the corner store cashier, disconnected from the Nine for the first time in ages.  That she was staying awake through the timeskip was a first step in rebelling (Keep in mind she's on the verge of becoming a teenager).  With nobody to talk to and no Jack to steer her back on course, simple words reverberate within an echo chamber, hard to ignore because of the puzzle that is this strange woman, a problem that a problem solver like Bonesaw is inclined to try to solve."
Parahumans,36164s,Wildbow,19,Fri May 15 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"Same with Eidolon.  Even Tattletale says later, how Scion waited till Eidolon was riding a near literal high from gaining his strength back and was seemingly defeating Scion...  Only for it to be pushed to his face that he created monsters that killed millions of people, when all Eidolon wanted was to be a Hero. GU wasn't supporting him, and so it echoed through his mind that [i]he[/i] had failed in every possible way."
Parahumans,36164s,Ridtom,12,Fri May 15 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"It's actually really depressing how completely Eidolon got used, abused, and tossed aside. This man only wanted to be a hero, he sacrificed everything, all happiness he could aspire for in life, for the sake of saving humanity. But he was given powers that he could neither entirely control nor understand. His lack of control over his powers due to his subconscious desire for worthy opponents spawned the Endbringers, killing tens of millions of people. And in the final minutes of his life, just as he finally started to learn the true nature of his powers and secure the ability to save the world, Scion whips out that complete and utter garbage bullshit PtV shard.  In retrospect, I fundamentally despise the PtV shards. They're just like prophecies, a third rate and far too common story mechanic. Worm may have been better as a story without PtV."
Parahumans,36164s,SnowGN,12,Fri May 15 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"Without the PtV shard manipulating how the world dealt with ""capes"" and superpowers appearing, there was no rational way for a heroes vs villians dynamic to ever develop. The whole PRT thing came about because of Cauldron and Contessa manipulating world events just so.  Source: Wildbow here"
Parahumans,36164s,t3tsubo,3,Sat May 16 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"The most interesting thing about that post, in my opinion, is the idea that Eden could have been revived. Accidentally."
Parahumans,36164s,GreatWyrmGold,6,Sun May 17 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Was the whole ""Eidolon created monsters"" a theory? Or confirmed by Wildbow? I've always thought that Scions words were extremely out of context in that case.  Like it wasn't something Eidolon was dwelling on since it's barely mentioned in the chapter. What he was dwelling on was him losing powers over time.  Then he started to feel much better when his powers returned in that fight.  Therefore logically, to make him fall hard is to tell him that the thing making him better is wrong or false.    So I've always though Scions words translated in: ""You only got your powers back because I let it.""  Meaning Scion was the worthy opponent.  Which made Eidolon give up because he realized no matter how strong he got, Scion was always above him.    Eidolon feels a lot like Gladiator from Marvel.  He is extremely powerful but lose because of self doubt and sudden lack of confidence."
Parahumans,36164s,Dz131,9,Fri May 15 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"The line is ""opponents"" iirc.  And the Endbringers were the only foes Eidolon couldn't just walk all over.  Still, his connection to them is merely a highly plausible theory, thought I think the best version of it doesn't have him creating them, but using some power to subconsciously activate the superweapons mentioned in the Eden interlude."
Parahumans,36164s,Iconochasm,2,Sat May 16 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"I still think the Endbringers are Eidolon's creations. The superweapons had more refined, definite forms than the Endbringers, frequently with distinct animal elements absent in the Endbringers; plus, I don't see when Eden could have set them up with the whole ""crashing"" thing. (Not to mention that one of the superweapons who looks nothing like Leviathan has something which sounds like his powers...)"
Parahumans,36164s,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sun May 17 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think we disagree, really.  I imagine them existing in a generic pile of potential, ready to be customized to whatever Eden needs for each particular world.  One day while brooding about how everything he does is a roflstomp, idly flipping through powers, Eidolon doesn't even notice that one of the powers that doesn't seem to do anything is actually the Superweapon Customization UI shard.  It patterns Behemoth off his subconscious needs and ideas about what a horrible supermonster should look and act like.  Repeat as needed for the others.  Maybe Alexandria was the Hero of the Day against Behemoth once, then a few months later Leviathan shows up.  Ditto Chevy, or any non-flyer, and the world gets the Simurgh.  Then Weaver embarrasses the entire Protectorate by, in her second Endbringer fight, masterminding Behemoth getting Tyrannosaurus Rekt, so badly Scion was able to finish him off.  Eidolon feels so shown up his power taps the Superweapon UI to pop out THREE more."
Parahumans,36164s,Iconochasm,3,Sun May 17 04:23:42 2015 UTC,I always thought the Superweapons/Endbringers were made from various shards.
Parahumans,36164s,GreatWyrmGold,5,Sun May 17 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"There were definitely shards involved, but the combination of themed powerset plus hyper-dense durability makes me think they were a mashup."
Parahumans,36164s,Iconochasm,6,Sun May 17 04:46:08 2015 UTC,"Tattletale seems to think so, as evidenced by her (attempted) conversation with the Simurgh.   The simurgh also tried to clone eidolon in her air gun (as shown in Teacher's epilogue), which further supports the Eidolon created the endbringers theory."
Parahumans,36164s,t3tsubo,7,Sat May 16 02:01:21 2015 UTC,I think if we'd had a few more hints other than Bonesaw's hate on swearing (which quite frankly could go with any 'scary small girl') that there was this 'be good' tragic stuff floating about...

Through the giggles, she said, “If you’re going to try to mind control me, I can tell you you’ve got another thing coming.  I’ve got safeguards.  You’ll only activate my berserker mode.”  “No mind control.  There’s a great deal at work here, and this is the best way to go about it, even with the blind spot looming.”  “That’s the best argument you can give me?”  “No.  I can tell you two things.”  Bonesaw raised her eyebrows, smiling.  “Two things?”  “Breadth and Depth.”  “I don’t get it.  Those are the things?”  “No.  There’s another.  Each of these things is a sentence, an idea.  The second sentence is simple.  Say goodbye.”   From Interlude 25"

Her power does indeed take Strangers into account, and even if the 'mental effects' could cause her to not act, shes still autopiloting herself, which would counter that. And thats assuming she doesnt define a path that would allow her to kill them in such a way as to be unaffected, which she would.   Lets assume shed be susceptible to Heartbreaker's power, and she probably is. Further, lets assume that she loves him so much she turns off her autopilot (which would have shot him in the face) it keep him safe. Sure, thats a 'weakness'. But in practice shed never go anywhere near him or allow him anywhere near herself. Shed kill him from miles away by firing a high power sniper rifle almost straight up so the bullet's ballistic trajectory brings it down on his head at terminal velocity just as hes looking up at a pretty cloud, so it passes through the thin spot behind the eyes and ricochets around inside his skull turning his brain to mush long before he ever discovers her existence because getting enslaved would interfere with any long term path she had.  As written, Contessa is bullshit. The only way you could imagine to defeat her is by failing to appreciate the sheer scope of her bullshittery. That is not a critiscim of you, but rather a intentional part of her design.  Similar to how someone might go 'im infinitely powerful, i win' there is no real point in arguing it, since anything you can imagine to take her down would fail in the face of Path To Victory, which would have included the necessary groundwork to undo your plan as a prerequisite to whatever she was working on at the time.

The Protectorate is still dysfunctional despite her involvement, possibly because blind-spot interference is inevitable for them and possibly because she just can't perfectly manipulate an organization that big and complex.  And I think you should add Jack Slash to that list of people who trump her.  Relevant link."

Parahumans,35zfvx,Imosa1,3,Sat May 16 02:27:56 2015 UTC,"You don't kill her until after she's completed her first goal.  After that, she will be unable to escape death, since her power merely lets her do anything that it is physically possible for her to achieve.  If it's NOT possible, her power can't make it so.  Also, Scion used her power, and he certainly had it misdirected by Skitter."
Parahumans,35zfvx,Gyddanar,4,Sat May 16 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"What if the power takes the possibility of wanting an out into account? What if there's always an implicit escape clause in her power? For example, if her goal was [Goal A], then her power would automatically return a path as if she had wanted [[Goal A], unless I realize I don't want the aforementioned goal in which case I want to re-evaluate my goal].    I have a feeling there's a problem in doing this but humor me."

If she had a penguin sandwich today she'd gladly eat it. It will take her at least until tomorrow to get a penguin sandwich. Along path A, she'll no longer want the penguin sandwich at some time tomorrow and stop following the path. Along path B, she will still want the penguin sandwich and will continue following the path to completion.  If her power fails, then it fails to get her a penguin sandwich even though there is a path which leads to her getting it and not regretting any step along the way, even the last one. If the power succeeds, then it manipulated her into wanting to continue following the path.  There will always be paths where she would choose to stop following the path. If this prevented paths, then she'd never be able to do anything."

One of my guesses was that she messes up his perception with her energy-loaded constructs. As we saw in the story, B sees the world as its various energies, and during his Endbringer fight, he was drawn to the secret basement where Phir Se was prepairing his particle beam.  Maybe her power lets her: A. Bait him into following her constructs since she can load them with TK and form huge ""hot spots"" in his perception, leading him away from allies or important targets he might go for.  or B. she could obstruct his vision by filling it with clumsy, big constructs of TK. Other random ideas I had were: Since she imbues the cloth with TK, maybe she transforms the cloth into a good barrier for B's Radioactivity.  Or, since one of the hints was that she discovers this near the end of the battle with B, she can maybe counter his self-destruction effect ? Her ""real power"" would be something along the lines of energy containment, which would be all right against other endbringers too, but particularly against B (another tip)."

Parahumans,35yuar,Dz131,6,Thu May 14 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"She can ""soak"" lightweight objects with her powers, this gives her telekinetic control over things such as thread and cloth (how she makes her constructs). Imbuing an object with her power makes it much more durable (her constructs could trade blows with Leviathan).    So we know that Wildbow said she could fuck up Behemoth, who does energy manipulation.  Since Parian has powerful telekinesis over lightweight objects, maybe she could manipulate electrons/nuclear force/fundamental particles and disrupt/redirect his energy manipulation?"

It's a superhero team assembled to fight an alien menace, and all its members started out as normal humans before undergoing a process that gives them powers... an unstable process that will kill them at some point within the next year. So in between episodes of alien-fighting, you had a series of characters finding different ways of coping with the unavoidable knowledge of their imminent mortality, dying, and being replaced by new volunteers.

Parahumans,35w8d6,HelloiamaTeddyBear,14,Thu May 14 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, thanks for the comments.  I think it raises a lot of good points.  I agree I’m probably 100% wrong on his power; I was really just taking a shot in the dark.   That said, I do still think Sleeper's power comes from one of Eden's core shards, and not a random info gathering one they spread out.  Meaning what ever his powers are, it should be a function the entities themselves use personally and is important to them.  I think that rules out a lot of possibilities.  I don’t think he’s suppressed by the Manton effect, because IIRC plants and animals all come under the Manton effect and I’m sure he’s taken out a few of them with his abilities if he “subsumed” half a country.    .  There are some more questions as to why Sleeper acts the way he does and hopefully shed some clues to him:   Why does he sit in one area in Russia?  He obviously has the ability to “subsume” entire worlds in a very short span of time. Why does he suddenly decide to expand globally while on Earth Z?  If his goal is power and destruction, why not Earth A or B? If he is a world ending threat, why does Dinah never bring him up?  I mean she should be like “hey guys, good job on Scion, but there’s a 99% chance Sleeper is going to take over the world in 20 years so let’s go handle him now.”  But he is never talked about.  Contessa and Numbers Man should be all over it too.   From the above points I think it’s reasonable to say:       He’s not malicious.  Because he can easily take over more territories if he wanted to. It makes sense because his shard doesn’t drive him to conflict.  There is no inevitability prophecy involving him. He wants to be left alone like Nilbog, which is why he doesn’t travel the world. If my above “sleeping” theory holds any water, then he’s actively trying to stop what ever he does from happening while asleep.   I feel like he might be a Jekyll/Hyde type of tragic character, who wakes up one day and discovers all the stuff that’s happened while he’s a sleep and spends the rest of his life trying to stay awake.  Of course, he’s labeled as a class S threat and no one dares to approach him and help him.        Finally he finds an Earth that’s sparsely populated, finally falls asleep and stays there hoping people will leave him alone.  (Starting to reach fanfic status at this point, so I’ll stop).      Anyway, these are more of my thoughts on Sleeper.  Subsume is such an ambiguous, trollish word, props for Wildbow for using it to describe Sleeper.  As for Ash Beast, I get the vibe that he’s like a Noelle/Epilogue Monster unrestrained shard and not an entity shard, but there’s no way to confirm that.      Cheers"
Parahumans,35w8d6,Gnarcis,1 point,Thu May 14 14:03:36 2015 UTC,Very well thought out speculation though!
Parahumans,35w8d6,legacyman,1 point,Thu May 14 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome stuff here man. I never saw the reading on the porch thing to be significant, but I think you're on to something.   Have you considered though that instead of keeping him awake, the reading is actually a way for him to reassure himself that he's not dreaming? IIRC (from Batman: The Animated Series), the part of the brain that deciphers written word into ideas is inactive during sleep, making people unable to read while sleeping. So reading aloud is a way of knowing that he is actually reading and not just pretending to understand the book while asleep. Just another theory!"
Parahumans,35w8d6,Janadus,6,Sun May 24 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe when he sleeps its like Labrynths power where he swaps out the environment/landscape.  Except its his nightmares/dreamscapes and it covers a huge area, all of russia?"
Parahumans,35w8d6,pendia,10,Thu May 14 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"Russia still exists. IIRC, it's not doing super bad. Not great, but not terrible, either. Sleeper's effect is confined to an area of Siberia."
Parahumans,35w8d6,ughzubat,11,Thu May 14 01:57:23 2015 UTC,"Well all of an alternate earth (Zayin? Something like that) got ""subsumed"" by Sleeper, so it can grow. Maybe Sleeper is Manton restricted? His area is reduced as there are more humans about, so on a nigh-empty earth he has nigh-unlimited range, in a less populated area like Siberia it still has a large radius. Maybe we can beat Sleeper by covering him with people!  Imagine trying to convince people of that. ""Sure, you have no chance against sleeper. But if enough of you idiots face him, he becomes less powerful!"""
Parahumans,35w8d6,Janadus,15,Thu May 14 04:01:37 2015 UTC,"personal interpretation of the ""subsume"" word choice was that he basically called dibs on Zayin and everyone else was like ""HAHA YOU GOT IT BOSS let'sgetthefuckoutofhere"""
Parahumans,35w8d6,MinecraftMike16,12,Thu May 14 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"Zayin got subsumed. Nowhere does it state that Zayin was uninhabited- or even sparsely inhabited. I think his power either doesn't really have a Manton limit or is not directly related to organic beings. Sleeper was monstrously powerful enough to warrant an S-Class threat level rating despite being almost motionless in Siberia. It's implied they keep him under constant surveillance, despite the fact he doesn't really do all that much. And in Wormverse, your paranoia is pretty much universally justified, so I just wonder what, exactly, Sleeper did to justify his current rating.  I'll skip the ""Fight Sleeper Brigade"", thanks. The more we learn about the dude, the more it sounds like this guy can 1v1 Endbringers in his sleep. And maybe even awake."
Parahumans,35w8d6,TELL_ME_TO_CALM_DOWN,5,Thu May 14 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"Alright, so here's my theory.  Sleeper is a very powerful shaker when slowly feeds his consciousness into the surrounding area, while losing cognitive thought until he enters a dormant state. The more people that are around, the longer it takes. When his consciousness is fed into the ground, it responds to his subconscious thoughts to protect him and (new thanks to this thread) work with his dreams, once he hits the dormant stage. Since he begins to lose cognitive thought, and the process take a long time, he likes to read. Eventually it grows to the point where he needs to read aloud to still read. Khepri didn't think he was worth the effort since he needs to fall asleep, and the process would be EXTREMELY slow since there would be a ton of people there.  Also, by ""protecting him,"" his power attempts to kill everyone who enters his range, using the creativity of his nightmares. Indefinite range?"
Parahumans,35w8d6,JimboMonkey1234,5,Thu May 14 12:27:34 2015 UTC,"Aight I got some dank theories over here  Read this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/32mr7r/know_what_ill_just_get_the_next_exit/cqcu82a  It's where I got most of my info.  Sleeper's power is:   extremely strong, obviously. And has something to do with ""subsuming"" entire planets. known by Wildbow. He's not just putting in a powerful character and saying ""give him whatever power you want"". physical. GF's Sister from the linked post had a purely physical power (changing matter into crystals) and was listed as the only person of the gang who even had a remote chance of escaping the Sleeper. able to kill /u/ughzubat, his girlfriend, and his GF's S B no problem. /u/ughzubat could change into lightning, his GF could absorb inanimate matter and make her own body take on its properties, and GFSB could understand people. Also note that even GFS had a 1/36 chance of making it out alive. vulnerable to Khepri's mind control, but ""troublesome"" enough that she didn't bother using him during the Golden Morning. obtuse enough that the world doesn't really know the specifics of his power. making him really like to read for whatever reason. does not harm himself or his immediate surroundings, either through innate restrictions or by his own limited control. He can sit on a porch and read peacefully.   So here are my theories:   The Stranger 12 theory, where Sleeper does nothing but make everyone think he's too powerful to fuck with, is wrong. The Sleeper is ""troublesome"" to Khepri, despite being vulnerable to her mind control. Why? His power must be to some degree uncontrollable, either in that it's always on or in that it's too destructive to turn on without causing, well, trouble. It would kill some of her other capes, or perhaps even reach through the portal to get to Khepri herself. The Sleeper is named the Sleeper for a reason. This might mean that his power only happens when it's asleep, or goes out of control when he's asleep (probably not, since we think it's uncontrollable when he's awake too thanks to Khepri), or was hibernating i.e. sleeping before he subsumed Earth Zayin, or /u/Wildbow is sitting at his chair furiously jacking off to every incorrect guess I make. Any of those, really. The Sleeper has a foolproof way of killing 3/4 of the gang in the link. GFSB's power is purely mental and he would be easy to take down. But /u/ughzubat and his GF have physical powers, both pretty good at evasion or durability, and he fucks them like a leather couch. GFS, however, can turn matter into a crystalline substance that is chemically inert, very hard to melt, and very good at conducting electricity. Why does GFS have a (small) chance when nobody else does? My theory is that he is a Shaker 12. He subsumes large chunks of matter, destroying it in the process, and can probably subsume people as well. His power has a huge range, but decreases to manageable (i.e. only his territory in Russia) sizes when he is asleep. When disturbed, as in the Golden Morning, his range massively increases. Of course, when he's asleep or dormant or hibernating or whatever, he can't control his power as well, which is why it's really not a good idea to enter his radius of influence. Why he's subsuming matter is up for debate. He might convert it to energy, might just flat-out destroy it, whatever. /u/ughzubat died because he couldn't find a ""path of least resistance"" that got him out of there. His GF died because nothing in Sleeper's zone is resistant to Sleeper's power anyway, so there was nothing she could turn into that would give her resistance. GFSB died cause his power was shite. GFS... might live. ""It would take a miracle."" I assume something about her power's crystals takes longer to subsume than most other substances, and if she kept on transmuting everything around her to crystal, and kept running, she might make it out alive. The GF wouldn't make it by absorbing GFS's crystal because she'd still die, just after a slightly longer amount of time.   So yeah. You're welcome for that 4000-character long rant. Wildbow, if you're reading this, put that thing away. Imma go browse dank memes."

The entities do drain the planet of resources somehow at the end of the cycle and it’s never specified how they do it. This could be the shard the Sleeper has. Anyway, everything is 100% pure speculation at this point and I could be waaaay off base for all I know.

Parahumans,35u71s,fabulousMayor,39,Wed May 13 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"In general I don't think Worm is too complex on the literary side of things, and you could probably google translate any of the words you don't get right away.  The one word I would tell you would probably be a stumbling block right now is copacetic, which loosely translates to 'a state of being OK or at ease'. It's a word that I'm not sure anyone but Wildbow actually uses.   There's also some technobabble that goes on around some of the Capes and their abilities (Specifically some tinkers), so that could be a small issue. Then again, it might be more-or-less language generic stuff since my understanding is that most modern advancements look pretty similar across languages.  That being said, I'm monolingual, so I could be totally wrong about all of this. As for your reading speed, that's hard to quantify without knowing how often you read, for how long, and how quickly. I'll use a comparison other literary works to illustrate this, assuming you've read Harry Potter (seems most people have these days).   The length of Worm is about 1,680,000 words, whereas the entire Harry Potter series is around 1,100,000 words, so it would take you approximately 50% longer to read Worm than it would take you to read all of Harry Potter"

I don't think Worm would be too difficult to start out as a new English speaker. Wildbow (the author of Worm) uses a few normally rare words quite a bit, though. The two that come to mind are:   Copacetic: a state of being ""good."" ""in excellent order"" is Google's definition. Headspace: a word for someone's mental state of being. Headspace is to mood what climate is to weather.   Other than that, the word ""parahuman"" was made up by the author to mean ""beyond human"" without the positive connotations of ""superhuman."" There are also a few words that get re-purposed for Worm:   Cape: Normally, just a piece of fabric worn over the back as a piece of a costume or uniform. In Worm, cape is used as a synonym for parahuman. Triumvirate: Normally, a council of three. Worm's Triumvirate is a group of the three most powerful heroes in the world. The classifications. There are twelve of them, each a different word used to describe the nature of different types of powers: Mover, Shaker, Brute, Breaker, Master, Tinker, Blaster, Thinker, Striker, Changer, Trump and Stranger. They're all very well-explained in the story, so that shouldn't be a problem.   On top of all that, a lot of the characters have alter-ego names that come from obscure English words, or even other languages entirely.

Admittedly they do need to be bound so perhaps some diabolists are needed, but the second you set one loose or make a deal with them it would be open season as far as the practitioners' community is concerned."

Parahumans,35vckc,mexicanweasel,3,Wed May 13 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"That could be his real name actually.   Practitioners can't lie so they either stick to real names or obviously fake titles.

Parahumans,35vckc,ughzubat,1 point,Wed May 13 21:52:25 2015 UTC,It probably depends on whether they can legitimately justify taking the name Joseph Smith. There were hints that if your case is strong enough you can argue with the spirit world about it. Presumably if you win you gain more legitimacy in using the new name (maybe even at the cost of your old name) but if you lose you probably take the karma hit and suffer spirit unfriendliness in the region for a while.

Parahumans,35u9jn,pseudonarne,5,Wed May 13 17:00:25 2015 UTC,The third entity.
Parahumans,35sndi,GreatWyrmGold,19,Wed May 13 04:17:48 2015 UTC,"Case 53's and the like are nothing more than an extreme manifestation of changes that happen in any cape.   More like they're caused by people getting shards that were never really trimmed or tuned to be compatible with humanity, so they come lacking certain safeguards and pieces of knowledge about what they should and shouldn't be allowed to do to their hosts. That's why Balance is so useful, because it gives them info on what they are and aren't allowed to do.   These changes get worse with less control.   Agreed. The less Balance was in a Cauldron formula, generally speaking the more likely it was to cause mutations.   Control is provided by the Entities' direction or by careful addition of the right space whale blood, presumably simulating such somehow.   Also agreed. That goes back to above where they had to be trimmed and restricted for compatibility with humans. The entities and the Balance formula provided that trimming and restriction.   There is no fundamental difference between Eden and Zion shards, or indeed any reason to think some natural triggers aren't Eden shards.   Agreed the third. Leet is one example of a confirmed natural Eden trigger.   The weird triggers in Tenereal 4 are caused by someone new playing Cauldron.   I disagree. I think it's the same issue as case 53s - shards that weren't designed to hook up to humans hooking up to humans and giving them distinctly non-human-compatible powers - but this time it's because shards without restrictions or trimming are falling naturally, rather than because tey're being created by someone. I mean, the trigger we saw happened in the middle of a street in a city, which is hardly the place for a Cauldron-style deal to happen."
Parahumans,35sndi,Whispersilk,8,Wed May 13 05:00:12 2015 UTC,"My take:  Most shards bind fairly well to their hosts. This is mainly because the entities tailored their binding mechanisms to work with human physiology, as seen in Zion/Eden's interludes. So all the shards that find hosts naturally should work fairly well. The cauldron formulas come from the core of Eden's shards that either weren't intended to be released or didn't get chance to be released before the crash. They weren't coded for humans, and that's why they tend to go all a bit wibbly when they try to bind with their hosts. The balance formula is probably all part of the shard that Eden would have been using to appear/behave like a human, and thus can mostly do a reasonable job of priming the shards for humans. In the Case-53 extreme deviants, this either didn't quite work right or wasn't present at all.  After Zion's death, his core was blasted to high hell by some form of tinkertech doomsday cannon. Rather than, like Eden, simply being rendered braindead by a perfectly timed and placed attack, Zion was more or less obliterated and his remains blown to smithereens. So instead of Eden, where her shards are all still bundled up in her core just waiting for someone to cut them out and formula them up, we have Zion, where his core has been annihilated and its shards scattered out across many earths and many times. So now people are essentially getting random unbalanced cauldron-style formulas, except they're Zion shards that were never intended to be released (and thus never coded for release). There's no balance formula present in this, because there plain isn't one. So things can get weird.  But the natural triggers the entities planned out were designed to ensure a 300-ish year cycle, so people should still be triggering naturally for another 250 years or so anyway. And those natural triggers should still be coded fine (they strike me as rather fire-and-forget when it comes to the shards being sent out)."
Parahumans,35sndi,Littlerob,2,Wed May 13 09:29:15 2015 UTC,"no zead/natural 53s?  what do you call bitch's doggy bits?  or burnscar? or labyrinth? ect  but mostly because cauldron was still working out how to give powers so they weren't as safe as ones entities prepared(until they found ""balance formula"" to smooth out the extremes)"
Parahumans,35shb6,palparepa,21,Wed May 13 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"Shards are meant to spoiler, so such a shard would leave the user unable to partake in spoiler and wouldn't be able to fulfill it's purpose. So I don't think such a tinker would exist.  However, the Manton Effect is meant to protect the user. So, if a tinker had a power armor specialty, it might make sense that the shard wouldn't give them a power source which might explode if damaged, while a tinker with a robot specialty might be use an explosive power source without risking themselves, so the shard could let them use that. So the former tinker could suffer from the Manton effect, it just isn't as obvious."
Parahumans,35shb6,pendia,14,Wed May 13 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"Tinker tech doesn't have powers. A tinker's power is basically the power to produce certain types of technology without first learning how they work. But the tech itself is mundane, it works the same as if a non-powered person had built it. the only distinction the Manton effect could draw might be whether they use living things are building material, but then it doesn't really matter. Most of those with any use for living things have specifically biological al themes and wouldn't make sense with a Manton limit. Everyone else has no need for a Manton effect since they would have no occasion to run up against it."
Parahumans,35shb6,ThirdFloorGreg,7,Wed May 13 04:21:31 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that the Manton effect isn't ""doesn't affect living things"" but rather ""has to respect the boundary of living things"".  So for example a telekinetic can't just shred someone's internal organs even if they can turn a building into rubble.  They could still hurl things at the person or use their clothes as a makeshift razor, etc., but they can't just instagib people. A lot of powers would be completely broken without the Manton Effect, which is obviously not good for combat testing.  See this in-depth analysis for example."

I mean, he wasn't killed by common police officers or even PRT agents before killing King.  The Shepherd has some influence over emotion, but Cherish has more precise control, more subtlety, and probably more range. I'm guessing Cherish could make the Shepherd commit suicide before the Shepherd could do much to her.  The Eye might be able to hurt Crawler...but not for long. He regenerates, gets stronger, and soon your attack doesn't do squat.  And all of these defeats would weaken Conquest, to say nothing of how Jack's pals are more loyal to him than Conquest's are."

Triumph was a cauldron cape, we didn't get to see much of Prism and her power. On Aisha, I absolutely disagree. Her power drives her to want to be noticed, so much so that she attempts to take on the Slaughterhouse 9 solo. She falls in love with a total sociopath and then murders his father. By the end of the series, she is becoming more well-adjusted, but her shard definitely fucked her up big-time.

As a result of his power, Gravitas must practice humility so as to not allow his power to cause lasting feelings of grandeur, as he works for the Guild.

Parahumans,35q0pi,Lucifer_Hirsch,7,Tue May 12 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"I've got a couple in my growing roster that illustrate the point.  Shane Anderson, codename: Snatch  Trump/Striker 8  He's a power stealer. He can manifest a glowing light around his hands - when he grabs you with said glowing hands and makes contact for more than four seconds, bad things happen. If he grabs your arm, that arm is dead, permanently. It'll just hang limp and useless and slowly start to rot on your shoulder. If he grabs you round the torso, you die - massive organ failure. If he grabs your head, you're braindead (and regular dead) - and if you're a parahuman, he hijacks your connection to your shard and permanently gains a variant of your power (similar to two separate triggers from the same shard - the abilities will be similar, but not necessarily identical, and his tend to lean towards more blatant and violent expressions of the power than the original host). He's currently being held in solitary by the Suits while they decide whether he's worth looking to as a potential resource for S-class/Endbringer events. Powers he's acquired so far include two different superstrength mechanisms, straight-line flight and superspeed, imperviousness to any attack he sees coming, the ability to rend rifts in the ground from his feet, and an unknown blaster attack based around crimson lightning.  He also has some serious problems. He triggered shortly after the Simurgh's second attack, in London, after being rounded up by the Kings Men and given the swan tattoo, then subsequently persecuted for having said tattoo. After running afoul of a newly-formed gang of parahuman vigilantes out on a self-appointed mission to fight the Simurgh's rube-goldberg agents he was caught, viciously beaten, and would have been executed if not for his triggering and immediately murdering of two of the gang with his new powers. Since then he's basically been on the run. The Kings Men know of him, the Suits know of him, most of the gangs and groups in London and the surrounding areas know of him, and all of them want him put down, either for his killings, for his powers, or for his Simurgh-taint tattoo. Although his first killings were out of self-preservation, he has since built up a major persecution complex (not unwarranted), and more deaths have followed as his reactions to people get poorer and poorer. He's never had the luxury of a secret identity, and has been living the past few years as a homeless wanderer.     Fork, aka James Cotton Master 9  One of the most powerful self-duplicators on record, Fork can create perfect copies of himself and any items he is currently carrying (with a limit of what he can comfortably lift, and it should be noted that items carried and used by the copies tend to evaporate into smoke after leaving their contact for more than an hour or so). The copies have his exact mind state and all memories, are fully autonomous, take roughly two seconds to create, and he has no limit on the amount of copies he can sustain. The copies, however, do not have the ability to copy themselves, ensuring that even though each and every one of them is functionally James Cotton, only one of them is really Fork. He can reabsorb copies by merging bodies, choosing one body to consolidate into and retaining both sets of memories, experiences, and any gained skills.  He abuses this power considerably, essentially living more than a hundred lives simultaneously and gaining the best parts of them all, not to mention basically being an entire counties police force single handedly (plus the - unsubstantiated, for now - rumours of him also being a fraction of its criminal element as well).  He also has an absolutely massive superiority complex, and is often described as insufferably arrogant by anyone who spends more than ten seconds talking to him. He's more skilled and experienced than basically everyone he meets, and he is very aware of that, and feels the need to make sure everyone else is too. Possibly comes from some form of overcompensation for not having any 'real' superpowers, essentially just creating a legion of mooks - and considering his general reaction whenever his power is called into question, this is probably not far off the truth. Consulted psychotherapists have described him as having a high likelihood of psychopathic and sociopathic traits. There is... significant friction between him and his immediate superior in the King's Men."

Most importantly, he possesses a death-touch similar to GU's (which lets him one shot otherwise resistant enemies.) resistant enemies.)   To gain the powers, the cape must be killed via death-touch.  However, as soon as Charon picked up enough powers to fight capes without it, he now prefers to catch and immobilize enemy capes so that he can perform ""the ceremony"" of harvesting their powers.  He gives them their last rites, and then a nice little requiuem after he takes their power.  GU had to keep track of every pokemon she caught, and she had to consciously choose which ones she wanted to use. Charon does too, in a way.  Each power he absorbs fragments his mind a little, and he comes up with/gains a new voice in his head with each power absorbed.  Kind of like a reverse-Butcher.

Xerox  Brute 2-6 / Mover 2 / Master 12 / Trump 8  John was a young adult when capes first started to appear in the world.  He and his twin brother, James, obsessed with the capes that were appearing, and the two spent hours discussing what they would do with powers.  They knew they would be heroes, both of them.  They watched the creation of the Protectorate and PRT anxiously.  James was always a little more into it than John, but both brothers were exceptionally close.  And then one day, when the two brothers were out in public, a cape fight broke out between a self professed villian and the newly created Protectorates.  There were numerous casualities, amongst them, James.  In his panic to save his brother, John triggered.  And in the seconds before his death, so did James.  Because many people triggered in the area, John got a grab bag of powers.  That grab bag gave him mild regeneration, some minor speed boosts and super strength.  His primary ability though is the ability to create a clone of himself when someone nearby triggers.  This clone shares one consciousness with John and also has a weaker version of the powers the person triggering gained.  All clones share the abilities of the original, and can spawn clones of their own.  Within the first few minutes of John's trigger, he managed to create a clone with a powerful type of regeneration.  Every injury it sustains grows back tougher.  He doesn't realize that, but this power was meant for James.  His power stole the whole shard, resulting in James' death.  John went on to join the Protectorate after the fight with his Brute Clone, and remained with them for several years.  He spread his stronger clones out to various groups around the world.  Most had the original regeneration, as he kept his original body somewhere out of the way.  Accidental triggers were reasonably common in cape fights, so he had plenty of clones.   Then one day, while touring a government facility, his power began to trigger rapidly.  He learned later that it was due to the government research on forcing triggers.  He also learned that despite creating 20 new clones that day, none of the people there triggered.  All of the clones he created that day were more powerful than he normally created.  Based on that occasion, he slowly learned that he was stealing the powers, not duplicating them, and the creation of his clones weakened the powers others got.    When he finally realized that his original trigger had resulted in his twin brother’s death, he was furious.  Through misplaced grief, he lashed out at the Protectorate who had resulted in his brother’s death and the governments that had conducted the experiments, killing a number of high level capes and professionals in a well planned coup.  By the time he betrayed everyone for what he considered corruption, he had an estimated 100 clones of varying strengths, spread out across the world.  There were even clones that had never been documented.    Most people believe they have killed them all the clones.  They think."

Those that see him find an emaciated man in his mid-thirties, wearing heavily-worn clothes, with a strange lump on his back.  To the civilians that see him, he's nobody worth noting.  Just another unfortunate soul living on the streets.  Nevermind the constant PRT watch teams just out of sight.  He knows they're there.  They aren't under orders to attack, simply to keep him distracted.  Triage can turn any animal, plant, or fungus into a form of bioarmor simply by touching it.  If done to a cape, the armor retains their powers.  It started simply enough, after the villain Pocketspace fled a kill order.  Witnesses confirm that Pocketspace attempted to use her power on him, only to have his power trump hers.  With that, he was able to return her victims, many of whom were alive, but in various states of malnutrition.  Before, he was limited by the bulkiness of the armor preventing him from retaining it for long, lest he out his civilian identity.  Being able to shunt 98% of the armor to a pocket space, however, opened up new options for him.  Pocketspace's ex-husband came for Triage, followed by his gang.  Slowly but surely, Triage was forced into more and more combat against people who had lethal intent.  The PRT was not aware of how bad it had gotten until Minimum attempted to attack him.  When they saw what he had become capable of, an arrest order was put out.  The relative ease at which he defended himself surprised everyone.  Even more interesting was that he didn't rely on his touch power.  Instead, he relied on the vast array of powers he'd collected.  He didn't want to fight the Protectorate, but he had obligations to a friend that mandated that he not turn himself in.  Sadly, this friend was accidentally killed by [REDACTED] in an attempt to capture Triage.  This sent him briefly into a murderous rampage.  At the end of this carnage, he teleported away.  He was next found living on the streets as a vagrant.  He seemed perfectly content begging for coins.  At least, until local Protectorate members approached.  At this point, he attacked them quickly and mercilessly.  It is believed that Triage has become addicted to gaining new powers.  When he is not in the presence of someone who he knows to be a parahuman he is peaceful, content to lead a quiet life on the streets.  (It should be noted that he has never been seen eating.  It is believed that he is leeching nutrients from those he has put in his pocket space.)  Once in their presence, though, he must actively restrain himself from touching them.  The PRT has decided to apply this.  Against certain S-Class threats or those who have a kill order, members will approach him and request his aid.  He never refuses, though he seems extremely saddened by it.  Despite his general lethargy, he still retains his savage capabilities.  Attempts at assassination (parahumans, snipers, toxins, heavy weaponry) have all met with disastrous consequences.  As such, the PRT has decreed that keeping him stable and as isolated from parahumans as possible.  Care should be taken when pointing him at a problem.  Consult the list of capes that are not allowed within a twenty mile radius before requesting his aid.  Under no circumstances should he be allowed near Eidolon.  Under no circumstances should he be allowed anywhere near any parahuman with self-duplicating capabilities.  Under no circumstances should he be allowed near [REDACTED].  Should any individuals on this list be within the same city as him, the watch teams are required to talk to him and encourage him to move to another city.  Bribery is allowed, but this is rarely necessary.  It is advised that he engaged his addiction at least once every two months or run the risk of him seeking out new targets on his own.

I've never heard Wildbow talk about it, though he's probably my favorite non-Taylor character in the series.   The man is fascinating. He's honestly, obviously, specifically insane, appears to be aware of this, and despite being a villain has marvelous intentions. Accord is the man with the thirty-year plan to cure the world of disease, poverty, and food insecurity. (I want to say it's author confirmed that it would work, too.)  But nobody will listen to him. Because he's clearly insane. He has to know that's part of the reason. But he just can't stop. Man, Accord got hit with the shit stick, just like everyone else in Worm."

Parahumans,35l1wl,jrbless,13,Mon May 11 11:19:23 2015 UTC,"i figured it was a combiation of him being a little off to start, the shard tweaking how he thinks so his power can function, his trigger fucking him up, and his shard pushing for conflict  (big plans mean he'll act, bloody ocd means he won't succeed in fixing the big problems without generating plenty of conflict one way or the other--besides his thinker power could be so op it needs something crippling to push him to work around it and generate new data)"
Parahumans,35l1wl,pseudonarne,8,Mon May 11 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's a side effect of his power. It comes up with detailed and (close to) perfect plans for literally anything anyone does around him, which means he has an order in his head of how he wants things to be. When things disturb that order, his power nags at him to do something about it. If he's in a dirty room, his power tells him to clean it. If he is sitting in an uncomfortable chair, his power will tell him to build a better chair, and so on.  The only way to get away from this constant nagging is to either:   Do what his power tells him. Be in an environment where nothing needs to be done.   I imagine that built up to be very annoying after a while, and he decided to just not be around people whom his power complained about, even if it meant killing them."

Parahumans,35l1wl,LigerZeroSchneider,3,Mon May 11 18:55:24 2015 UTC,This was pretty much what I was thinking. Previous OCD made worse by his power and an increased penchant for violence because of his shard.

Then he triggers; his shard looks around to see what the best way to ""generate conflict"" would be, and turns the dial up to 11, turning what used to be mere discomfort at things that fall short of perfection into...well, Accord.  Also, side note: his mask sounds pretty sweet.  That would look badass in any film/TV version."
Parahumans,35l1wl,grautry,2,Tue May 12 10:04:44 2015 UTC,"I've read one very good fantheory on this.  His power scales with the level of the problem he's facing, that's canon. The fantheory is, Accord can't turn his power off. It's always on.   In light of this, Accord's OCD is him munchkining his powers.   If he's in a disordered environment, his power focuses on pointless waste-of-time 'problems' like ""This suit is not symmetric"", ""This room is not clean"". In an environment like this, he can't really use his power, since these are not issues that require superhuman levels of intelligence to solve.  If he's in a perfectly clean, neat, ordered environment with no distractions, he can instead focus on problems like ""How to solve world hunger"" and have an appropriately scaled god-like levels of super-intelligence."

She has mid to high ratings in six classifications. A top-tier kinetic energy manipulator with a powerful combat-level precognitive ability, Adamantine is a bit of a pet project for me. I've been working on story and sketches for about a week now, but her powers are fleshed out.    Something I've taken to calling ""Combat Precognition."" Adamantine's sense of touch and sense of proprioception extend fifteen seconds into the future, allowing her to see all the possibilities of her physical condition over that time window. She can choose the most beneficial action, to take. In effect, fighting her is like fighting someone who is fifteen seconds in the future. Kinetic Energy Manipulation. Adamantine can absorb, store, and redirect any kinetic energy that would be dispersed or changed by any impact that includes her. Whether it's hitting a wall at Mach 2 or being shot in the head at point-blank range, any physical impact has no effect besides making her stronger. She can use her energy to run at very superhuman speeds (but not nearly as fast as Legend or Alexandria's flight), jump so far it's technically mid-range flight, or land punches that hit like cruise missiles. Oh, and the absorption works on constant forces, like jet engines or telekinesis. Even with these abilities, Adamantine is still not unbeatable. Fortunately for her, her tinkertech armor fixes almost all of her remaining vulnerabilities: it's flameproof, thermally reflective and insulative, optically reflective, radiation-shielded, and the surface is chemically inert.   Yes, she is broken like a motherfucker. Yes, she could beat Alexandria in a 1v1 fight to the death. No, I'm not changing her in the slightest."

Parahumans,35jwu0,Plecky,4,Mon May 11 04:52:41 2015 UTC,"That is some good synergy. I'm sure Adamantine would be interested in at least an unofficial team-up (Triumvireddit duties do take precedent), as long as Catastrophe's willing to be a hero?"
Parahumans,35jwu0,NamedByAFish,3,Mon May 11 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"He's somewhere between a hero and a rogue, wandering from place to place and fixing things as he goes. He doesn't want the responsibility of being an official hero - his trigger event involved what he sees as the heroes failing, and he holds them to a really high standard as a result - but is more than willing to team up with them if he's asked or if he sees something he can help with.  The more I'm thinking about this synergy, actually, the more fantastically good I'm seeing it being. If Adamantine's passive absorb triggers on any impact, Catastrophe can redirect little absorb triggers like her footfalls and use them to stun-lock enemies. Rather than absorbing the kinetic energy of her foot hitting the ground, suddenly her power absorbs the kinetic energy of the car the bad guys are trying to get away in, or the punch that was about to screw Catastrophe over. Technically he could even turn his ability to allowing her to absorb other forms of energy, but that would take a lot more effort on his part and wouldn't be sustainable - it would be a once every little while thing, not consistent."

He builds a flame effect in her ear canal, letting it slowly build.  Right before Adamantine is about to leave, bam!  He releases the energy, burning her brain to a crisp.  Thank you, thank you.  No encores."
Parahumans,35jwu0,ReekRhymesWithWeak,3,Mon May 11 10:39:50 2015 UTC,"Three problems, one minor and two major:   Minor: Adamantine doesn't have a civilian life. Her trigger event happened live on national TV, and she joined the Protectorate almost immediately. Her ""personal power training"" accounts for almost all of her free time. Major: It seems like you're underestimating combat precognition. If there is any possibility that she can escape or disable Bard in any fifteen second window before he releases the energy, it will happen. She doesn't have to know about his presence directly; she'll know about the danger exactly fifteen seconds before the first possible change in her physical state. It is almost impossible to surprise someone who thinks fifteen seconds in the future. Major: Even if she's going around in public out of costume (rare, but it does happen), she's never ""uncharged."" She always has plenty of kinetic energy stored in reserve. The events leading up to her trigger event were in part due to her own hubris and pride, and that's not a mistake she's willing to make again. Coupled with combat precognition, this means she's basically always ready for a fight. She won't always be at her Alexandria-stopping absolute peak, but she's always able to fight in direct combat well above the level of all but the best Brutes, Movers, and Blasters."
Parahumans,35jwu0,NamedByAFish,3,Mon May 11 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"But will she be charged enough to stop a brain incineration?  There's no kinetic energy to absorb, just pure heat"
Parahumans,35jwu0,ReekRhymesWithWeak,2,Mon May 11 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I bet Charon could take her. She lacks the firepower to keep him from getting close, and his death-touch bypasses any potential invulnerabilities (it separates the cape from the shard, the same way GU does.)"
Parahumans,35jwu0,White-Fox110,2,Mon May 11 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid not, she'd know that a touch would kill her and could promptly just throw cars at him instead.  Unless he also has teleportation and duplication of course."
Parahumans,35jwu0,DemosthenesKey,2,Mon May 11 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"He has enough thinker powers collected to negate hers slightly, though. He can't teleport, but he is definitely fast enough to dodge cares, and durable enough to take the hit otherwise."
Parahumans,35jwu0,NamedByAFish,2,Mon May 11 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"What are you sorry about? A win is a win, even if it's a tragic win by a villain. Charon could, in his current state, probably beat Adamantine in her current state in a one-on-one fight to the death.  But that does, like with so many other Strikers, depend on the precise definition of ""touch."" Can he ""reap"" through clothing? Armor? I remember GU having to touch the actual person to use her death touch (not sure if that's right).  It also depends on Charon's durability. What kinds of things can he and can't he survive? Adamantine almost never stores the energy to do it, but she could theoretically level a city in a single strike. On a smaller scale, she can normally land punches or throw cars/manhole covers/sofas/whatever that hit like a cruise missile. Being a member of the Triumvireddit who could be called into action at any moment, I think it's safe to say that she keeps enough energy for a few missile-punches in reserve.  But then again, if Charon's been active long enough to reap the right powers, he could dodge or tank most of Adamantine's attacks.  (Pitting top-tiers against each other is hard.)"
Parahumans,35jwu0,DemosthenesKey,2,Mon May 11 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"The picture I have of him in my mind right now is essentially that he's faster, stronger, and smarter than your average person in almost every way, but nothing exceptional (not as strong as say, Alexandria, but stronger than the strongest normal person.) His regeneration is exceptional, and he has a bunch of pre-cog abilities. The other powers he's been building up aren't quite strong enough to make use of yet (even combining them.)"

Parahumans,35jwu0,LigerZeroSchneider,2,Mon May 11 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"Adamantine could absolutely wipe out five of my RP group's ten OC's, could probably wipe the floor with two of them, would have a very close fight with two more, and...  Then there's Talos, who I'm shocked and pleased to discover is nearly perfectly matched for her.  At first I thought it'd be a Thinker that could Trump her (hehehe), but nah.   Talos  Shifter/Master  Much like the Custodian, has no physical form, but wanders about as an extra-sensory possessing spirit that can possess metal and form human sized golems.   The golems are very simplistic - one head with no features, one torso, two arms and two legs. Talos must focus very hard to give them the slightest detail.   If Talos wishes to possess metal into a golem bigger than his human form, the golem will be weaker than usual.   If he wishes to make it stronger, it will be smaller, etc.   Talos can, however, make multiple golems, so long as they do not exceed his base human form's mass (or rather what was his mass before he triggered). For instance, two golems, each half the size of a human, each with half a human's strength. Or four golems at 1/4 size, each with one fourth a human's strength.   He does have a size limit on them. No matter how hard he tries, he seems to have a Manton-imposed limit of an eighth of an inch.   He's...  I don't know, is he broken? I feel like he's a little broken."
Parahumans,35jwu0,HomelessHeartSurgeon,2,Mon May 11 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't say Adamantine could kill Talos, or even hurt him. She doesn't have any non-physical senses or attacks, so he's immune to anything she could do. Her energy absorption is a passive ""opt-out"" ability, so Talos isn't going to hurt her either, but... yeah.  Complete and total stalemate.  Out of curiosity, do either of the two close fights involve a Stranger, Thinker, or Master rating? Because I feel like Adamantine isn't well suited to go up against those classifications."
Parahumans,35jwu0,themanwhowas,2,Mon May 11 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"Question: Does she have the Alexandria weakness?  Aka, how badly does she need to breath?  Because I feel like a clever use of Talos' power would be to possess her power armor. Or maybe that's just my natural S9 brain going, ""You know what would be creepy? Something that could make your armor/glasses/anything metal you have on you burst into a hundred tiny little creatures that all want to kill you.""  Without metal he's useless, though, lacking even the Custodian's ability to impact the world. Also it has to be solid metal - liquid or gas states he can't use.   And yes, actually! One's a Blaster/Master named Riot, the other's a Thinker named Ricochet.  Ricochet tends to be the Leet of Thinkers, capable of pulling off nearly anything given enough prep time. Her totem can even help with that after a while, starting to change from a mere rubber bouncy ball into a decent weapon all its own. Her main problem against Adamantine is that the solution has to be ridiculously unlikely AND complex, or else it has a strong chance of either flubbing or giving her a Thinker headache so bad it kills her in its success. Any win she might have is utterly dependent on a hell of a lot of ""if"".  Riot is kind of a cross between Dazzler, Jubilee, Gallant and Valefor. She emits differently colored blasts of energy, each affecting a different emotion. She can control how much damage the blasts do to the body and mind - high-energy balls of her power can melt through steels beams, low-energy ones are no worse than a punch from a strong man would feel. How much they affect someone's mind is inversely proportionate to their energy (low-energy ones can strongly affect a mind, high-energy ones won't have any Master effect at all). They're about baseball-sized, and she can spawn them at a rate of about 20 per second.   Adamantine vs Riot would depend entirely on Riot's ability to quickly adapt to a situation. Adamantine's combat precognition wouldn't allow her to avoid all of Riot's orbs, it'd be like trying to move through the rain without getting a drop on you. To control someone's mind to any extent, though, Riot needs time to find the right ""color combo"", so to speak - for her, being a Master is like a massive game of Guitar Hero on Impossible difficulty. So she usually doesn't try it, preferring to just hit her enemies as her as she thinks she can get away with.   Which means... she'd have a very short window to figure out that trying to smack around Adamantine is going to be a bad idea, and that she should beam spam her and try to crack her mind instead. If she beam spams the mind mojo, she should be able to daze Adamantine long enough to finish the job.  If she doesn't, she'll have just enough time to wish that she was in the X-Men universe.  (note)  (I think we have an over-representation in our group of people with ""r"" names. Riot, Ricochet, Rasputin, Realm...)"

Parahumans,35jwu0,Plecky,10,Mon May 11 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"Dustwalker Mover 8 / Thinker 3  Dustwalker can spawn six swift 'shadows' at any time. These shadows move at about twice human speed, and Dustwalker can see through their eyes, but they are insubstantial and pass through objects. Dustwalker can instantly swap places with any of his shadows, gaining their speed and position while they take his.  In combat, this allows him to stay out of harms reach until the exact second one of his shadows would strike a blow, then swap places with it just long enough to slice his foe up. When directing multiple shadows against a single enemy, Dustwalker can actually attack several times a second.   This is one of my favorite Movers. Essentially using teleportation to mimic super speed."
Parahumans,35jwu0,themanwhowas,3,Mon May 11 05:34:23 2015 UTC,"I think this depends a lot on how long his range on those shadows are, and how much he can take with him when he swaps. Because he could be a hell of a transport cape, if he just camped at 6 different useful/safe locations and sent a shadow to accompany rescue efforts.   Even if it's just recon, having 6 insubstantial shadows that he can sense through is pretty damn useful, even more so since he can send them all through different paths and simply appear at the end of the right one.  Also, what happens if one of his shadows is intersecting something else when he swaps?"
Parahumans,35jwu0,Plecky,2,Mon May 11 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"There is no range limit on his shadows, but the only things that come with him when he teleports are the things he had on him when he created the shadow. For instance, if he was wearing a sword and nothing else when he created shadow number one, both he and the imprinted sword would get grabbed when he chooses to switch places with that shadow, but nothing else he's picked up since then. Even if he lost the sword since.  He just wouldn't be able to teleport using it until it stopped intersecting other objects."
Parahumans,35jwu0,TyrialFrost,9,Tue May 12 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"Switch  Striker 4  He can move anything in one hand into the other, instantaneously.  And by anything I mean anything in about a basketball-sized sphere off his palm. And only to the exact same space relative to his other hand, and the two areas switch places exactly. So he can punch out very specific-shaped holes in things, like embedding one object into another, gaining that same shape in whatever material he was pressed against in the other hand - convenient for copying keys, or carving things out of delicate or difficult materials.   There's two things that make it far more useful than the parlor trick it seems like.  One, he can choose the exact shape within that sphere of what he wants to cut out, and has a sort of density-sense that lets him know exactly what's inside that sphere upon contact. So he knows if there's any hidden compartments inside something (if it's in reach), or can pull out a very precise shape and size of something within something else (even if he didn't want to remove a lock's innards, he could still create a key out of anything nearby in exactly the right shape to open it).  Two, it's not Manton-limited.  So he could cut even the most indestructible materials with nothing more than a casual touch. Like Scrub, but focused and precise, and it stays in-universe. He's an absolutely horrifying melee combatant, since if he can get any part of you within reach of his hands, it's as good as gone. Tendons, bones, your heart, your brain, if it gets in his hands, he's got you dead to rights.   Of course, he has no speed, strength, reflexes, or other secondary powers to help him, so most capes will easily wipe the floor with him. Which is why he keeps a low profile, relying on misdirection and subtlety - an infiltration and extraction expert.  He's also obviously weak against amorphous or fast-regenerating foes. Or ones who can constantly create more mass. Or ones who are simply too dangerous to get within touch range. Or ones who can just stay out of reach.   But in the right circumstances, and for lower-tier powers, he's pretty capable."

Parahumans,35jwu0,Technical_Goblin,5,Mon May 11 17:23:29 2015 UTC,"Bard  Blaster 5, Shaker 5, Trump 3  His whole shtick is the ability to apply a variety of effects to a target or targets within his range.  These effects can range from setting things on fire, to freezing things, to weak forcefields, to concussive blasts of sound and more.  They all share the characteristic of being influence by the movement of atoms (speeding up=fire, slowing down=cold etc).  All these effects start fairly weak (force fields that could only stop a normal punch) but can be stacked to be more and more powerful with successive applications of his power.  Catch is, his power can only be applied to things within the range of any sound waves he generates.  These sound waves can be generated from an instrument, smashing things, explosions, his voice and basically anything else that makes noise.  The louder the noise, the more range and power he has.  His preferred method of making noise is a Tinker made guitar.  It has a built in amp to transfer noise through traditional guitar playing (and a dial from 1-10, so basically regular acoustic guitar levels all the way to death metal concert levels).  Also, it is sturdy enough to be used in an axe/club like fashion, and has a noise maker on the business end, to further enhance the noise of smashing someone's face in.  The shaker rating is obvious, but the blaster rating comes from being able to focus the effects of his blasts in a narrow, 1 foot wide window, or letting it go 360 degrees around him.  The trump rating comes from his ability cancel certain power effects (for example, repeatedly stacking a freezing effect on Lung to keep him from lighting himself up) as well as cancel all of his effects with the strum of a chord."

If Bard has a solid force field up which I'm to assume he does, increase the mass of the guitar until he can't hold it.  He has some solid armor since weight isn't really an issue so he tries to close and grapple, since Bard doesn't have any durability powers and relies on repetition to build power; physical exertion limits his area effect and focuses his attention on defending against the 500 lb. man trying to choke him.    You didn't pick a side so I assumed a kind of 1v1 nonlethal fight. If you're a villain, foam is going to give you a hell of time once I get in close.  If you're a cape, I wreck your guitar and run.

Pitch  Striker 6  Pitch can smear a dark, viscous liquid over surfaces by touching them. By touching the liquid again, he can apply various properties to it, such as setting it on fire, freezing it, hardening it, making it frictionless, and a whole bunch of other stuff. The ink dries once he touches it, and he can no longer affect it once dried. If he doesn't touch it a second time, it dries normally, taking about two minutes to fully dry.  Once smeared on an object, Pitch can feel where his ink is, giving him a bit of a thinker power. But once the ink is removed, or sufficiently dispersed, he loses track of it."

Good against Tinkers or thugs with guns. While her power would be disastrous against enemies in vehicles, since she can make those go from 130km/h to 0 in a moment by making wheels stick to the road, she doesn't usually use it that way. Too lethal for a hero.  Last but not least, if it's a fight to the death, she carries around a P8.

Interacts oddly with devices attempting to record information in forgotten areas. Corrupted data, images with things in the wrong places, bad handwriting, etc means that information must be captured by an object outside his radius.  Oh, and he effects himself too. He gets around this by having a very extensive self-sign language (putting his hands behind his back or in his pockets or other and forming signs with his hands to himself) to let him know what he should be doing when he forgets things - ie if he is in the middle of an important conversation in which only part of got their memory wiped.

It's supposed to be more subtle than that, less effectic in a quick confrontation.   Maybe add a timer, as in it takes him longer if the suggestion is more outrageous?"

For example convincing someone like Skidmark, that his group can beat the others and take over the city, resulting in them basically selfdestructing when they challenge 88 or the ABB.   Or seriously low tier convincing people of silly stuff, basically inducing ""hold my beer, I can do this"". Thus the name in the first place.  The common theme is of course that he gets people to do risky stuff because they think they can do it. It's just the abuse potential of the power that I need to keep in check, because I don't want him to be a powerhouse.

I've picked up a fair bit over the years, so I've gotten good at it.  Also, I can also choose what is ""normal"" for a temperature, so long as there's something within my area of effect to base it off of.  So it's a lot more versatile than it first appears.    I can severely dampen guns, I mess with various bits of tinker tech, I can outright shut down vehicles by suppressing the explosion of the gas in the engine.  As the game is set in the summer with temperatures that get above a hundred degrees, I've often hit baddies with heat stroke during the day.      I also synergize well with some of the others.  For example, our Mover is partially limited by friction, requiring special armor to increase his speed beyond a certain point.  I often act as a ""cooling station"" for his armor.    One time we were fighting in a tinker lab that had a lot of liquid nitrogen around -- oh, I had fun fucking around with that adventure.  For example, at one point our path was blocked by blast doors; we set up a canister of nitrogen against them, waited a few moments for them to get super-cold, then put a Bunsen burner next to it and switched it.  Two times back and forth and the doors kinda...  Well, it wasn't pretty.  But to be honest, I'm not the one with the most capable power, and that's partially by design, I think.

Parahumans,35jwu0,DemosthenesKey,3,Mon May 11 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, I have a very specific idea how this power should work, it's related to movers that interact with kinetic energy. I am just not sure if I can explain it well enough.  Rapid  Mover 6, Brute 5  Another cape that has to charge her power, since I like those. This power charges through movement of her body, basically through her own kinetic energy. It doesn't take away the kinetic energy, it's like a seperate energy bar that constantly fills while she moves, related to the amount of kinetic energy she experiences. The power loses energy over time, and it loses it faster the more is stored, leading to a soft cap.   The energy stored can be used for faster movement, which feeds into itself. So she can start running like a normal jogger and reach racecar speed after a few minutes. Here the softcap strikes and she loses energy as fast as she builds it up through her movement. The more charged up, the better her senses and reaction time get. This effect is passive and doesn't use up the energy.   She can alternatively spend energy to regenerate or become a brick for a short time (sans flying). Costs a lot of energy depending on how bricky she gets, so it's something she should only activate for moments.  Unless she is charged up to get a better reaction time she can't use the kinetic energy of enemies hitting her to negate the hit, though she can dampen it a little, by using the movement of her body that results from the hit to invest in a tiny bit of regeneration, increasing her natural defense slightly. A bullet however is game over immediatly under normal circumstances.  Due to the degeneration of her power she can't just charge up once and be ready whenever confrontation arises. So she gets much stronger if she gets time to prepare before a situation. Even though she is a mover she profits greatly from a motorcycle, to charge up fast in the midst of a city. She can push it up to high speed even there, since her heightened senses while speeding allow her to be one hell of an awesome driver. She can't use her power to manipulate objects or people, so she can't use it to bring the motorcycle past it's limits.  Another cool move is droping of a tall building (or a plane, hell that would be awesome :D), using some energy to be a brick at the landing and finishing whoever is near within moments before the energy from the fall is used up.   I also like the idea of a cape that is deadly wounded and has to jump out of the window to drop a few stories in order to survive.  Like, damn my arm is gone, better jump out of a skyscraper."

I wanted someone who, like Taylor, had a decent power that could become HORRIFICALLY broken with the slightest bit of thought.  Dementia drains mental power and adds it to her own. How much mental power depends on how much she knows about the person, so for instance, she'd drain a couple IQ points from strangers she brushes by on the street, lower the GPA of all her classmates by a good couple of points or so, leave most of her friends idiots incapable of grasping ideas too complicated.  And if she really knows you? You're a vegetable.   The Striker part, obviously, is that she drains you with a touch, and it has to be bodily contact. Skin-on-skin, skin-on-hair, something like that.   She has no upper limit. The more powerful she gets, she starts getting really nasty. Combat precog and enhanced reflexes, ability to design stuff that's a couple of steps below legit Tinkertech, danger senses, and - once she's drained the equivalent of a small city or so - a very, very minor version of Citrine's ability.

Nothing that would turn the tide of battle on its own, as of yet.   Facing her early-on is your best bet, simply because as long as you don't let her touch you and wear a mask and don't talk to her... she's just an ordinary girl, maybe a little bit smarter than most.

Parahumans,35jwu0,White-Fox110,2,Mon May 11 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"Okay so here's my OC   Bard  Blaster 5, Shaker 5, Trump 3  His whole shtick is the ability to apply a variety of effects to a target or targets within his range. These effects can range from setting things on fire, to freezing things, to weak forcefields, to concussive blasts of sound and more. They all share the characteristic of being influence by the movement of atoms (speeding up=fire, slowing down=cold etc). All these effects start fairly weak (force fields that could only stop a normal punch) but can be stacked to be more and more powerful with successive applications of his power. Catch is, his power can only be applied to things within the range of any sound waves he generates. These sound waves can be generated from an instrument, smashing things, explosions, his voice and basically anything else that makes noise. The louder the noise, the more range and power he has. His preferred method of making noise is a Tinker made guitar. It has a built in amp to transfer noise through traditional guitar playing (and a dial from 1-10, so basically regular acoustic guitar levels all the way to death metal concert levels). Also, it is sturdy enough to be used in an axe/club like fashion, and has a noise maker on the business end, to further enhance the noise of smashing someone's face in. The shaker rating is obvious, but the blaster rating comes from being able to focus the effects of his blasts in a narrow, 1 foot wide window, or letting it go 360 degrees around him. The trump rating comes from his ability cancel certain power effects (for example, repeatedly stacking a freezing effect on Lung to keep him from lighting himself up) as well as cancel all of his effects with the strum of a chord.   He could probably keep a personal force field up long enough to apply enough of a freezing effect to slow your guy down enough for an easy capture.

Parahumans,35jwu0,Spudwebster1291,3,Mon May 11 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"Here's one of my favourite original capes, who seems very powerful until you realize that all is not as it seems.   The Velociraptor  Brute 9, Mover 6, Breaker 5, Shaker 2, Thinker 3  A new addition to the New York villain scene, the Velociraptor is one of the most feared supervillains in the city. Mute, he tends to communicate through hand gestures and posture. The Velociraptor has a grab bag of powers, the most notable of which is a huge level of durability on the level of Alexandria. In addition to this, he appears to exert a constant telekinetic force a centimetre or so around his body, which he uses to make himself incredibly slippery, meaning that it is borderline impossible to keep hold of him. This telekinetic field is not the source of his invulnerability, which seems to be an inherent trait of his. He is also incredibly agile and fast-moving, with the ability to perform impossible acrobatic feats and leap so far that he can fly for all intents and purposes, moving with a languid grace that makes him seem almost like a marionette. In addition, he is incredibly strong, and wields a pair of claws that share his durability, as well as steel-tipped boots with a claw decal on them. Finally, he has displayed the ability to momentarily blind his enemies and seems to have knowledge in combat of many things he should not be able to see, earning him Shaker and Thinker ratings.  His name originates from the talon decals on his boots, his signature claw weapons, his agility, and the scarf that covers the bottom half of his face, which is patterned with a sharp-toothed open maw. Rumours abound due to his powerset that he is a bud of Siberian, which only adds to his fearsome reputation.    The truth behind the Velociraptor  In reality, Velociraptor has a secret. His secret is that, as an individual, he does not exist. Velociraptor is in fact two capes, whose powers, mediocre alone, synergize incredibly. These two capes are Puppeteer and Fin.  Puppeteer (Striker/Master 7) is a master with the ability to, by touch, 'tag' someone, allowing him to see through their senses as well as his own, and, more importantly, control and move their body with a telekinetic field surrounding them. Although he can only tag one person at a time, he was a valued member of a local gang, both for his main power and the minor ability to momentarily blind on touch, until he met Fin and decided to team up with him.  Fin is a cape who triggered after he was trapped in rubble after an Endbringer attack, who initially hated his power. Fin has the ability to enter a breaker state where he is nigh-unharmable and does not need to breathe, but at the cost of his ability to move. Further compounding the uselessness of this power was the inability to do so without 'swapping' with someone, which necessitated that he touch someone while he transformed, giving them enhanced speed at the cost of their tangibility. However, when he met Puppetmaster, the two realized they had a perfect synergy. Puppetmaster faked his own death at the hands of a rival gang, and the two formed a team.  Their usual routine consists of the two tagging each other, leaving an intangible, wraithlike, high-speed Puppetmaster able to control the movements of an invulnerable Fin. By tricking enemies into thinking that the Velociraptor is a single cape, they prevent them from utilizing the most effective, although still rather difficult method of finding the fragile if highly elusive Puppetmaster and neutralizing him while avoiding 'The Velociraptor.'"

Parahumans,35k4mz,horseradish1,48,Tue May 19 00:28:27 2015 UTC,"Magic has clearly defined rules and execution  Hermione is the protagonist, HP is a sidekick at best, a background character at worst  The two NPC houses have actual character  People are more traumatized by the war then before  Snape is either more or less catoonishly evil  Voldemort is already back"
Parahumans,35k4mz,Igigigif,10,Mon May 11 03:55:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you about the protagonist change. Harry makes a bunch of bad decisions, but as long as he justifies them to himself satisfyingly. You gotta remember until almost the end of the series, Harry is still younger than Taylor was at the start."
Parahumans,35k4mz,Zolnerowich,6,Mon May 11 14:55:46 2015 UTC,"It's not that, just, wildbow never goes easy on his protagonists. Never. Being a media darling beloved by aprox. 75% of the population seems a tad to generous."
Parahumans,35k4mz,Igigigif,10,Mon May 11 16:39:44 2015 UTC,"I've only read Worm so far, so I'll take your word on that.   First off, I think that ""Loved and praised for something you don't even remember, and held up to high expectations as such"" is an interesting dynamic to play with, and one that I bet Wildbow would have fun writing convincingly.  More importantly, though, Harry's relationship with the public sours as the books go on, with people in his school turning against him, then all the people who suddenly see him as an attention seeker after Goblet of Fire (and during Goblet of Fire, of course, with so many believing he cheated his way into the tournament).  There are numerous instances, of course, where Harry's fame comes in useful (only specific example I can think of right now is Slughorn's parties), but for the most part all it does is leave him squarely in the public eye and in the collective student consciousness at Hogwarts, constantly being watched and critiqued. He doesn't want attention, he just wants to have friends and get through school, but he keeps being pushed into horrendous, near-fatal situations by his own reckless nature (Gryffindor FTW) or by circumstances out of his control (such as with the cursed hero-choosing goblet, the sentient soul-shard diary, the voldemort visions etc), and often afterward he gets dragged through the dirt for it.  Use your snake-speak to save a kid? Fuck you, that's dark magic and half the school thinks you're homocidal now.  Try to come across as fair and level headed by winning the Triwizard Trophy as a tie with the kindhearted competitor you've come to respect? Fuck you, he's dead, the Dark Lord you're famous for killing is BACK FROM THE FUCKING DEAD AND NOBODY BELIEVES YOU.  Try to teach kids to defend themselves when the regular classes aren't good enough? Fuck you, your principle/mentor is getting his soul sucked out in wizard jail.  Yes, Harry doesn't have it as hard as many protagonists. Certainly not as hard as Taylor ever did and, from what you're saying, not as bad as his other protagonists. But it's not like his life is a breeze, and if Wildblow were writing this, you'd know those events would hit with greater impact and that the consequences would always be more severe. The story can have all of Wildblow's writing prowess without needing to switch protagonists.  PS: Sorry, yeah, this went on for a little long.I never realised I had strong feelings about Harry Potter."
Parahumans,35k4mz,Zolnerowich,13,Mon May 11 17:36:47 2015 UTC,Because the magic in Pact has such clearly defined rules.
Parahumans,35k4mz,ThirdFloorGreg,32,Mon May 11 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"The magic in pact is intentionally fuzzy, but it has a very clear internal logic. And, imho, wildbow would write HP more like worm then pact."

Parahumans,35k4mz,Makinporing,14,Mon May 11 19:00:43 2015 UTC,There are many good stories that aren't rational stories and don't follow those rules

His defeat of Voldemort was a sham where Riddle possessed his body, to start over with public support. No-one realized until it's too late.  Hermione is the protagonist who escapes the troll on her own. The troll remembers her, and comes to hunt her down later. And incidentally, trolls can regenerate and adapt, Crawler style.  Hermione is more traumatized by the constant bullying she faces than her run-in with the troll.  Horcruxes require more than one death to create. For reference, the holocaust was Grindelwald's incomplete attempt. Voldemort completed six.  The basilisk is only one of many endbringers Ruin Beasts. They attack whenever the magical population grows too large, or wizards make systemic attempts to help muggles with magic.  Fiendfire leaves lethal nuclear radiation behind; it was invented by a Japanese dark wizard who was inspired by Hiroshima.  Harrymort becomes the Master of Death after covertly arranging Dumbledore's death. He uses his power to jailbreak his horcruxes, and now all 7 pieces of his soul are self-aware and active.  The Goblet of Fire is used by a despotic ministry to bind dissidents into unfulfillable magical contracts. They lose their magic for failing to complete the terms and are kicked out into the muggle world."

Parahumans,35gwiu,Samwise210,21,Sun May 10 08:30:06 2015 UTC,"She triggers in the aftermath: (Quote for 26.X)   It takes time, but the entity forms a sufficient safeguard.  The host species will forget any significant details.  The broken shard is cast off, joining countless others.  It will bond to a host.  The entity looks forward, checking.  After the target planet has revolved thirty-three times around its star, this shard will connect to a host.  A male guards his offspring, a female, with his size and bulk.  A group of hostile bipeds cluster around them.  They call out, making unusual loud sounds, suggesting intoxication.  One of the hostile ones gestures, gripping its male parts, pulling them free of their coverings.  A sexual gesture follows, waving the organ left and right, thrusting it into the empty air.  Sounds of amusement, laced with hostility.  The male and his offspring retreat as far against the nearest construction as they are able.  The shard connects, attaching to the male.  No.  It is ineffective.  The female is clearly more distressed.  Prey.  There is a way to maximize exposure to conflict.  The entity taps into its understanding of the bipeds and how they operate, recognizes the signs of distress, the nuances such things can have.  It views the future again, with changes made in the code.  This time, the shard settles in the male, then immediately shifts to the more distressed female.  Insinuation.  The shard connects to the host’s neural network.  The bond is created.  The shard opens the connection as the stress peaks, and the host doubles over in pain, bewildered, stunned.  The shard then forms tendrils that contact each individual in the area.  It retains traces of the entity’s tampering, of the studies in psychology, awareness and memory, and is quick to adapt.  It finds a manner in which it can operate, then alters itself, solidifying into a particular state.  The remainder of the functions are discarded, the ones in the shard itself are rendered inert to conserve power, while the ones in the host fall away, are consumed by the shard.  The host’s neural network changes once more.  The female disappears from the awareness of the hostile ones that surround it."
Parahumans,35gwiu,HarbringerOfNumbers,12,Sun May 10 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"I believe that we know that Chariot triggered in the wake of the Leviathan disaster. Given his tinker rating, he probably triggered as a result of a persistent issue caused by Leviathan rather than by Leviathan himself."
Parahumans,35gwiu,Keoaratr,9,Sun May 10 08:26:56 2015 UTC,IIRC Chariot was already working for Coil before Leviathan. He just went public with his powers and infiltrated the wards after Leviathan.

Maybe movers for people trying to escape, could be brutes or changers if people are trapped under rubble, maybe shakers too, stabilizing the ground during Behemoth, or hydrokinesis from Leviathan? Blasters could certainly trigger in response to being cornered, but if you're cornered by an Endbringer you're not surviving.    Actually, could Strider be an Endbringer trigger?

Parahumans,35gwiu,Jzadek,10,Sun May 10 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"Cuff is implied to have at least some connection to previous Endbringer attacks, IIRC. It's very possible she triggered then."

They are actually dependant on the relationship of the person who triggers with capes to some extent.  For instance, Othala's trigger wasn't because of a cape attack like Hatchet Face, but because she was attacked and none of the Hellen Clan was able to help her, despite being there."

Parahumans,35g8zf,Subrosian_Smithy,46,Sun May 10 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think you're imagining ""stilling"" on too high a level. Here's how I think about it.  For this power to really make sense as a physical effect you need to dig deeper into what reality is made of, down to the quantum level where all matter and energy is basically the same stuff, just in different patterns and moving in different ways that gives it different properties on the macro-scale. At that level, cancelling ""wavelengths"" would actually make sense. You take everything in an area that exhibits some specific pattern of quantum-scale motion - otherwise known as everything that exhibits some specific macro-scale property - and you take that specific type of quantum motion or that specific ""wavelength"" and make it still, setting it to some lower value or even to zero to effectively remove that property. Mess with the ""heat"" wavelength/pattern and you make things cold; mess with the ""linear motion"" wavelength/pattern and you make them still; mess with the ""electron motion"" pattern and you break molecules apart as they stop sharing electrons; and so on.  If you have the processing power to apply this wave-cancellation effect with enough precision or in the right patterns, you can choose to have it only certain materials, or to have it only effect a certain area, or what-have-you.  Of course, it's a lot simpler and probably much more accurate to just explain it away as space whale bullshit that we humans don't understand, but from the perspective of what it's actually doing that's how I see it."
Parahumans,35g8zf,Whispersilk,22,Sun May 10 03:21:03 2015 UTC,So basically Scion would be running a very advanced band stop filter (or maybe set of filters) over quark-level motion in an area? This explanation appeals to my inner engineer.
Parahumans,35g8zf,oliwhail,19,Sun May 10 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"I always just took the 'stilling' part and ignored the rest because Wildbow's science has been known to be flawed.

If it were, the GFY beam would leave a zone of absolute zero in its wake.  The GFY beam makes the most sense as a gold-colored matter-eraser, like Eidolon's power from Interlude 27, or as a molecular-bond-cutter.

I think I was going with ""Tranquility"" for the moment.    Need a name for this guy :  A cape who is able to dish out contracts and force every party involved to keep the terms they agreed upon. For that purpose he has to read all the terms loud to the parties and the contract is sealed by shaking his hand. Doesn't take effect until everyone involved has shaken his hand. He has perfect memory of every detail of every contract he makes.   This way partners are unable to betray each other and no papertrail is left. Not sure yet what happens with the contracts if he dies tbh. If someone cannot keep his part despite his best efforts, e.g. through outside influence, a punishment specified in the contract will be dealt. Depending of the shadyness of the people involved this may be something like a simple payment or suicide.  He can't force people to make a contract."

In more detail: if someone is within her line of sight and within a certain range of her (approximately 1/4 of a mile), she can form a link to them, which will persist until she deactivates it or they leave her range. There's no limit to how many people she can be linked to, although she has to form each link individually, so it'd take her a little while to get a large crowd.  While linked to someone, she can drain their strength and toughness (essentially giving herself a brute power while giving them the inverse of one), as well as their quick-thinking-ness (making them think slower while she thinks faster). There's no direct long-term damage from her power—when she stops sapping someone, they go back up to full strength—but they keep any injuries they incurred as a result of their reduced toughness."

Coil's power obviously doesn't make anyone invincible.  I mean you can argue that the Undersiders generally avoided Leviathan (which is true) and are much smarter than the other hero. groups (also true). I guess it's less of a complaint, I know objectively there's no real reason to be upset about it because it's not like main characters are randomly saved or broke to life as in most works, but I just never felt Worm was THAT dark or brutal towards its protagonists.

And he wasn't the only hero/protagonist to bite it in a surprising way.  Aegis and Gallant? They'd been around for a few arcs before they got wrecked. Not major characters, sure, but still. Grue had expended his usefulness to the plot and lost most of the part of his personality that made him cool, but he didn't deserve to die. Fenja was set up to become an antagonist, but she was on the ""good"" guys' (read: protagonist's) side when Leviathan killed her. Doctor Mother was very well-established and while she wasn't the best person around, she was just about to become a full-on (temporary) hero.  And are you really going to tell me that you weren't the least bit surprised when Dennis got killed? Comic relief is supposed to be immortal, especially in something as dark as Worm... at least Imp made it."
Parahumans,35fcl5,NamedByAFish,6,Sun May 10 14:52:15 2015 UTC,"Like I said ""most of Worm"", so before Behemoth. I would agree with you on Clockblocker and Doctor Mother but you have to remember the overall Marvel arc is no way near done, I would not be surprised if by the end of Infinity Wars we see some relatively major heroes die. Thus I think it's not unfair to compare just part of Worm to the Marvel movies we've seen.   I honestly didn't think any of those other characters were that developed or important, at least when compared to Quicksilver in AoU. Like at least personally I was sadder when Quicksilver died and more surprised (mainly because like you said it seems like Marvel doesn't kill its heroes). I will say that the way Wildbow just massacred characters for Leviathan was pretty unique. Also he does handle the aftermath well which I kind of doubt Marvel will - Thor for instance didn't show or say any sign he just lost his Mother.   Also do you really feel Worm is that dark? I just don't feel it is compared to something like ASoIaF which likely isn't that dark in the grand scheme of things. Or hell His Dark Materials which while not as dark seemed to have less problem killing major, well liked characters throughout left and right."

I've seen all of the Phase 2 films probably three times each, and after watching AoU I forgot that Frigga died.  Anyway, to the actual points of your comment:  I agree that Quicksilver was certainly more established as a character than Aegis, Gallant, or Fenja. I just think that Wildbow is more willing to go for the gut and not patch you up afterwards."

Also it's not that unusual for a story to end with the protagonist dead so it wouldn't have really changed my view of Worm either way.

Kirkman (the guy who writes Walking Dead) has written every issue so far (~120 of them) and the style is very similar to Worm's: a big pre-established universe with tons of power versatility, grey morality and and a things-keep-getting worse vibe. It's on a much bigger scale, though. Powers tend to be much stronger (there's a character called Robot who at this point is basically a top-level mech tinker with the ability to control sixty or so mech suits at a time while outwardly only betraying a small amount of distraction, and spoiler) and storylines happen on a cosmic scale, with visits to other planets and dimensions happening semi-regularly (spoiler). It's also got a huge cast of background characters, all of whom have their own powers, histories and changing relationships whenever we see them.  Edit: Changed the number of issues. I overestimated a touch."

Parahumans,35fcl5,SexualPie,5,Sun May 10 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"That's a complicated question.  First, Wildbow doesn't really focus on humor very much.  He goes for the gut punch more than anything.  While there are some burst out loud laughing moments, they're purely contextual.  Humor be hard, yo, and Zim focuses on it.  Second, it's still a fringe thing.  I'd like him to get mainstream recognition.  Thirdly, the whole dadaist (Surrealist? Absurdist?) world of Zim is unlike anything that he's really done.  His worlds feel real, you know?  Before I get into the last reason why it's a sad thing, I'd like to say that despite these things, I think he can pull it off.  When he does utilize humor, he does it extremely well.  When he does go off the deep end, he does it in a consistent manner.  I think he might go in a different direction, but I think it would still be awesome.  But now for the biggest reason why it would be sad.

Parahumans,35f8pa,Plecky,5,Sat May 9 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"If Alexandria fought the first iteration of Adamantine, who I was calling Hera at the time, Alexandria would have completely wrecked her. Now, I'm not so sure. Adamantine has Alexandria's weakness as well as a few others, but also has the combat precog advantage. But Alexandria is faster and can fly...  Alexandria probably can't hit Adamantine (and even if she did, it would only help Adamantine), but Adamantine probably couldn't catch Alexandria. Yeah, I'm calling this a... draw? Not really sure how either one would incap the other."

Alexandria might actually try punching her though so hmm.  Actually, would our guys actually be able to take the canon Triumvirate on? I'm thinking in a straight-up fight we might have a problem. Legend is probably the scariest here, and although Unity can block pretty much all of them, their switching speed is limited by how fast they can think and they always have one weak body. Futhark is really adaptable, but they're probably shorter on stamina than Eidolon."
Parahumans,35f8pa,Plecky,4,Sat May 9 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"Alexandria might actually try punching her though so hmm.

I don't think she could take out the Triumvirate by herself, but she could definitely annoy and evade them to some extent. I think the Triumvireddit might be able to hold off the Triumvirate, but probably not beat them back.  Eidolon is stronk."
Parahumans,35f8pa,NamedByAFish,5,Sat May 9 22:28:28 2015 UTC,"I think she could probably hold Alexandria off at least.  Unity might be able to hit Eidolon pretty hard though, given the effectively power-immune sphere, and with a Futhark buff they could probably keep their mortal body safe. This is of course assuming that Eidolon doesn't seal away the ball, although there aren't many abilities that can do so permanently. And trying to separate the two might push them pretty close to the metaphorical edge.  Legend is the biggest problem here it seems, if only due to their absurd speed, range and precision. Unless Futhark has some things that can deal with him I reckon he'd be the hardest to deal with."
Parahumans,35f8pa,Plecky,3,Sat May 9 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"Legend can be taken down (Leviathan did it in Arc 8), so if Futhark has a good Blaster rune or if Admantine can land a good hit, he shouldn't be too hard to deal with.

He can move them almost normally when not using his power, but they're a bit slower and tend to wobble about.  His power is the ability to run twice as fast and jump three times as high as usual.  However, when doing this, his arms become completely useless, and swing around like crazy.  They're just about immune to damage, but they don't really cause all that much damage, as they're basically a jelly.    He also suffers from power specific retrograde amnesia. This means he doesn't know the nature of his power until he uses it.  He can be reminded, but he'll forget as soon as he starts thinking about something else.  This leads to him taking a backseat in his team, focusing on planning and then doing what he can to help during operations.  When he was solo, he tended to lose a lot, as he jumped into battle only to remember his power when using it.

Parahumans,35dk8p,Plecky,16,Sat May 9 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"Huh... This is actually kinda interesting. I think Cthulu and the Elder Ones might accidentally their team, so it really comes down to whether Aquaman can control Cthulu as he does here.  Important question that could change everything though: Do the rules say Leet needs to stick to a video game theme while he carries his team to victory or can he just make whatever he wants?"
Parahumans,35dk8p,Lawd_Frieza,6,Sat May 9 08:09:39 2015 UTC,"Give Leet time to build a ""mind control everyone"" device."
Parahumans,35dk8p,BlueberryPhi,13,Sat May 9 10:54:21 2015 UTC,"Nah,  he can just build a literal ""I Win""  button."
Parahumans,35dk8p,stagfury,5,Sat May 9 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously, give anyone with some common sense and a little cleverness Leet's power and they become the most powerful cape in existence."
Parahumans,35dk8p,BlueberryPhi,17,Sat May 9 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"Leet had common sense and a little cleverness already. Think about it, how long would it take you, personally, to figure out his speciality? It's not like it comes with a manual. Anything prior to that is a waste and anything after is restricted by what's already been wasted.  Wanna make an immortality pill? Too bad, you already burned all your biotinkering on that tree that grows apples with cinnamon in them and the kitten with furry tentacles.  Wanna make a replicator? Tough tits, you already made a gun that creates ammunition on the fly.  You wanna make an invincible mecha to kill Leviathan? Good fucking luck; half the components were already used up in the power armour you made to get the funds.  He does the video game thing as an easy mnemonic so that he doesn't accidentally waste a bunch of components by having the power cell be used."
Parahumans,35dk8p,SirKaid,10,Sat May 9 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, now that's actually a good explanation for Leet's not being overpowered."
Parahumans,35dk8p,BlueberryPhi,11,Sat May 9 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, people give him too much credit for what he can do. Wildbow said:   Über and Leet are really problematic in that they're two characters that people tend to overinflate, powerwise.  I'm exaggerating, but man, am I tired of reading, ""Why doesn't Leet just make a machine that turns him into a god!?"""
Parahumans,35dk8p,TildeAleph,8,Sat May 9 14:13:13 2015 UTC,"Well, a machine that could turn you into a god would mean that such a machine was physically possible.  But turning you into something like Wolverine, sure."
Parahumans,35dk8p,BlueberryPhi,4,Sat May 9 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"The real problem with a machine like that is also what components it requires, although the literal version probably isn't possible or the shards might screw with him first. He finds it harder to repeat components as well as stuff IIRC, on top of that a really overpowered machine would probably take a while to build, and would likely need tinker maintenance before it's done. I somehow get the impression that maintenance isn't part of Leet's power though or at the very least it suffers from the same problem as the rest of his building, so..."
Parahumans,35dk8p,Plecky,6,Sat May 9 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I was reading it I didn't get the component angle.  It would, however, make a lot more sense to a certain degree. (though it is iffy what counts as a ""component"")"
Parahumans,35dk8p,BlueberryPhi,4,Sat May 9 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"Wildbow specified power sources as one, which just plain bites for Leet.  Oh, you used a diesel powered generator for your Tranformers based heist?  Good luck ever using diesel again, or any other mech."
Parahumans,35dk8p,blames_irrationally,3,Sat May 9 20:03:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  I suppose how broken his power was would depend on how soon he figured out that he could build anything BUT only do so once.  Which, to be honest...  shouldn't take that long.  Something breaks, try to build it again, fail.  Pattern repeats once more, maybe even twice, you start to catch on.  Sure, you've lost a decent share of designs, but once you realize what's going on it's relatively easy to stop it and channel it in a more useful manner."
Parahumans,35dk8p,BlueberryPhi,5,Sun May 10 04:39:12 2015 UTC,The important thing is to decide when to use the powers.   Honestly Cauldron should have just kidnapped Leet and mind control him and keep his powers intact against Scion.
Parahumans,35dk8p,stagfury,5,Sat May 9 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, but he's a Tinker.  It's not so much WHEN to use the powers, as it is HOW to use them.  Build devices that can keep each other maintained, or freeze time so the other devices don't get broken down, or stuff to mass produce his devices, etc.  You then don't have to worry about when as you build up an armory of awesome."

Parahumans,35dk8p,Paradoxius,1 point,Tue May 12 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"Aquaman controls sea life because he is the King of the Sea, not because he is a reality warper that can control things with the ""sea"" tag.  Even if Cthulu was a sea creature, Cthulu is also an unfathomable god.  Aquaman is really powerful, but if he was powerful enough to exert his will over Cthulu, he could solo the entire planet Earth."

And he takes way more fun in his missions, that's great. Interesting how the youngest and less human protagonist (at least in the beginning) has so far the fewest identity issues. I mean, when Blake learned his future was bleak, he freaked out ; Sy knows he won't live to be old, and goes on being awesome.  Yay ! Action ! Non-combat ! Jaime made a move ! Mary was useful ! Lilian was... Lilian !  Anyone thinks the Shepherd has a point ? Now on the long run the Lambs can keep on being loyal to the Academy, and further descend into villainy (I mean, they're already disrupting a peaceful meeting to start a riot), or switch sides and try to survive (with or without Hayle ?). Or take a third option and rule on their own ?"

She is ridiculously overpowered. Basically, she can absorb and store kinetic energy, then release it at will. She also can see every possibility of her own physical location and state for fifteen seconds into the future, and can extend that to cover up to one other person. Hitting her with physical force just makes her stronger, and for anything else she can respond to an attack fifteen seconds before it actually happens.  Of all the Endbringers, only Behemoth is an actual threat to Adamantine on any physical level. That's how overpowered she is. Of course, the Simurgh is the Simurgh, but Adamantine is smart enough not to tangle with her more than necessary."

Vicky's got the Hearbreaker Lite thing going on, which is concerning in any relationship, but then Gallant can see all of her emotions all the time.

That is a very dangerous situation for Gallant. Gallant, on the other hand, can read her emotions perfectly, making any awkward exchange -- and some that shouldn't be awkward -- much more awkward.  And then there's the other thing, too, but that's just as ""yes or no"" as it would be in any other relationship. Just with a bit of a twist."

Canonical plausibility was not high on my mind.    The problem with canonical plausibility, especially for a finished story, is that if the couple could work in canon, it's not really a ship.  For instance, Brian/Taylor canonically didn't work out.  Gallant and Glory Girl did work out canonically, but it's not really anything new or exciting to say that you ship that pair.  Shipping is far more interesting when you're trying to come up with a scenario where the pair could work out."

They would be a terrifying Class S pairing, popping up at opposite sides of a city at the same time.  On one end, you have a tsunami and on the other other side, a raging forestfire that's slowly moving into your town.  Everything that's not burning is being destroyed by waters!  It'd be glorious."
Parahumans,35agjo,Lexilogical,7,Fri May 8 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Do you mean Ash Beast? Because that's the S Class gigantic flaming thing, no? Burnscar is the slaughterhouse nine member. But...Ash Beast and Leviathan. I'll ship that."
Parahumans,35agjo,Ignis_ex,9,Fri May 8 22:49:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, Burnscar, from the S9.  I think people seriously underestimate that character, which probably has a lot to do with the fact that she doesn't actively try to destroy stuff.  But if you read the interlude with her and Elle, she actually has a pretty terrifying set of powers, that has interesting parallels to Leviathan.   She creates fire as she walks She teleports through the fires She can control, throw and spread fires The more fire there is and the more she uses her powers, the more she wants to use her powers to spread her fires.   Her biggest weakness is that she doesn't WANT to use her powers, and she doesn't want cause chaos.  Which actually means she's probably out of sync with her own shard.  If she actually just cut loose, she'd be terrifying.  At least as scary as Ash Beast.    In fact, in the interlude she's already lost most of her inhibitions and empathy, and is already lost to just burning things.  And that's barely a city block.  Conveniently, about the only thing that could stop her if she really did just start slinging fire around would be Leviathan.  I mean, Ash Beast and Leviathan would be pretty scary too, but that's like, two forces of nature causing chaos.  Burnscar and Leviathan actually humanizes Leviathan a bit."
Parahumans,35agjo,Lexilogical,6,Fri May 8 23:15:42 2015 UTC,"Conveniently, about the only thing that could stop her if she really did just start slinging fire around would be Leviathan.   Well, I think if someone -- even a member of the spooky Slaughterhouse Nine -- started burning down cities all willy-nilly, the Triumvirate would step in. Burnscar has untapped potential, sure, but not anti-Triumvirate potential."
Parahumans,35agjo,NamedByAFish,5,Sat May 9 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"On the bright side for Burnscar, Alexandria can't breath fire (in)."
Parahumans,35agjo,Plecky,5,Sat May 9 00:53:10 2015 UTC,"Hot air wouldn't be enough to hurt her lungs. Unless the fire in her lungs consumed oxygen (unlikely, since it wouldn't have any fuel) or managed to burn hot enough to ionize the air, it wouldn't do squat to her even if Alexandria couldn't just fly out of the fire's range."
Parahumans,35agjo,GreatWyrmGold,3,Sat May 9 01:03:47 2015 UTC,i think they are just referring to carbon monoxide/smoke inhalation.
Parahumans,35agjo,Ranku_Abadeer,2,Sat May 9 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"Again, that wouldn't do much unless there was so much carbon monoxide or smoke that it drove out a lot of the oxygen in the air (which I find improbable). Not to mention that Burnscar doesn't have control over the byproducts of fire..."
Parahumans,35agjo,GreatWyrmGold,2,Sat May 9 12:11:38 2015 UTC,"No, but she can make a lot. And you don't need a lot of monoxide for it to be lethal, even for her, just slow exposure.  I wouldn't be surprised if Burnscar was immune to fire fume poisoning, if only as a part of her secondary powers."
Parahumans,35agjo,Plecky,2,Sat May 9 13:34:29 2015 UTC,Lots of people die from smoke inhalation.
Parahumans,35agjo,Viatos,2,Sun May 10 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"Imagine an entire area has been burnt down and is still burning, with burnscar setting everything on fire with her unlimited source thereof. The amount of oxygen in the air is going to be very low, and on top of that there's fumes and carbon monoxide being produced. She's very unlikely to kill Alexandria but it's not actually impossible (also, the fire doesn't need a fuel source until it's actually burning things normally, so it is possible to fill Alexandria's lungs with fireballs, just absurdly unlikely. I'm going for exaggeration here though so likelihood is discounted)"
Parahumans,35agjo,Plecky,2,Sat May 9 13:32:18 2015 UTC,It's such a shame that Alexandria can't fly away from the fire.
Parahumans,35agjo,GreatWyrmGold,5,Sat May 9 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, I was watching a video on oxygen starvation the other day.  Basically what happens when you're not getting enough oxygen due to Carbon Monoxide or something like that.  It not only makes you lose intelligence at an alarming rate (The guy in the video, they'd show him an 8 of clubs and ask him what card it was, and he'd reply that it was the Ace of Spades.  Or he answered that 8-4=5) but it makes you extremely self confident.  When they told him he had to put on his oxygen mask or he'd die, he just smiled and nodded and said he understood, and did nothing.  When he came out afterwards, and they asked him how he thinks he did, he was certain that he'd absolutely aced every question and he's completely fooled the experiment.    Which is to say, Alexandria would probably chose to not fly away from the fire.  She already has an over-confidence issue, IMO, she'd probably never notice it catching up to her, even if she's smart enough to know what was happening on a normal basis."
Parahumans,35agjo,Lexilogical,3,Sat May 9 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't realise it did the overconfidence thing, although it kind of makes sense as a result of the impaired judgement.  It's also pretty nasty because it stays bonded to your blood cells for quite a few hours afterwards, though I can't remember exactly how much. So that impairment isn't going away immediately, and she's trying to catch a teleporter.   Legend (on phone): Um, Yamada? Alexandria's being an idiot again, what do I do?"
Parahumans,35agjo,Plecky,2,Sat May 9 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"In this hypothetical situation she's really, really stupid. I did take that into account,  Monoxide actually would be a risk to her at least if she wasn't careful."
Parahumans,35agjo,Plecky,2,Sat May 9 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"In this hypothetical situation she's really, really stupid.   Isn't one of her superpowers being really, really smart?"
Parahumans,35agjo,GreatWyrmGold,5,Sun May 10 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm thinking of the best way to use Burnscar's power if she really did try to go off the rails. Personally, if I was her and decided to just go crazy, I'd start nice and far from a city in a forest.  Presumably with a bit of room to ramp up, she could quickly reach a point where it would be very hard to stop her.  I don't remember about Legend, but the rest of the Triumvirate needs to breathe and there's not that much oxygen in a forestfire.  Once she starts steering that into a city, even if the Triumvirate tries to stop her, she can pretty quickly teleport through the fire, pop up somewhere safer or even just across town to throw another fireball or two.  Basically, the hard part becomes catching her.  I don't know if she can actually sleep in the middle of her forest fire, or what kind of limits her teleport has, but with an appropriate path of destruction she could go across the country and back into a hidden base with a fireplace pretty trivially.  Hardest part really becomes figuring out how to disguise your escape path of fire, but really, that just means you need to burn more things, faster."
Parahumans,35agjo,Lexilogical,4,Sat May 9 01:04:34 2015 UTC,Hmm. Fair enough. I might ship that too. Interesting.
Parahumans,35agjo,Ignis_ex,8,Sat May 9 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"In my head, she and Leviathan have this cute relationship where they pick a target to co-destroy, then move in on it.  Then when everything is either drowned or burning, he sweeps her away in a calming wave of water and takes her home to cuddle."
Parahumans,35agjo,Lexilogical,3,Sat May 9 01:14:34 2015 UTC,That's actually really cute. Wow. I wanna destroy cities with someone I love. I ship it hard now.

Parahumans,35agjo,Lexilogical,3,Sat May 9 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Ash Beast is only Class A, since it's a lot easier to avoid than Endbringers and the like.

Parahumans,35agjo,GreatWyrmGold,6,Sat May 9 01:08:39 2015 UTC,No. All strong relationships will become popular ships.  Even family members or mortal enemies will be paired romantically if the story has them interact enough.

She also said Coil knew her well enough to know her blind spots - his using Dinah, for example.  Throw in Coil's ability to use alternate timelines to figure things out and keep things hidden, and if there wasn't the whole murder thing going on, then they could have been really good together, in a mind-screwy sort of way."
Parahumans,35agjo,Strategist14,23,Fri May 8 14:19:13 2015 UTC,"She said she was asexual because her power would never stop telling her things and it squicked her out during sex.

The original Eden/Scion plan was for them to set up home base at country borders or on top of natural resources, making those resources unavailable.  As an example, think what would happen if Behemoth set up permanent shop in the Middle East. Now oil and petroleum products are much more expensive. Drop another EB in the Ukraine and Venezuela (other major oil producers). Oil becomes even more precious. This is being felt everywhere. Give it long enough and Mad Max is more than just a movie.  Put a few Endbringers scattered in the oceans at strategic spots and now international shipping is mostly toast. Australia, Hawaii, and Indonesia really feels the effects. Commercial fishing all but dies. The USA won't be importing near as much stuff from China or Japan. The lack of markets really slows down computer technology growth.

Parahumans,356vko,ughzubat,6,Thu May 7 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"I submitted an idea (which I've tweaked now, but I need a name for) but I didn't get a response. They are actually two capes but everyone thinks they're the same person due to one of the people being a Trump whose power merges their brain with the other person.  Power set is the ability for either of the two people to turn the other one into an orb that's effectively Alexandria with point-blank dynakinesis, but only one person can be in that form at a time and the movement is controlled by the person outside of it. Secondary powers include slightly increased mental processing for the pair.  I mean, I don't care if they're not, but as it stands they can probably pass for one Triumvirate member. Stumble probably has the spot anyway.  EDIT: I think I'm going to call them Unity and have them play up the master angle by an absurd amount."
Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,6,Thu May 7 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"Stumble cedes the last spot to the Twins, as they are badass.  He just asks to be invited to the super cool secret meetings and to get a free Triumvireddit shirt every now and then."
Parahumans,356vko,ughzubat,4,Thu May 7 21:50:24 2015 UTC,I'm now tempted to make at least one of the pair wear a Stumble shirt while in civilian identity.
Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,4,Fri May 8 13:24:24 2015 UTC,"Had too look for a while to find them. You mean the Yang-Yang Twins?  They definitely fit. Futhark being the ""Eidolon"" Super-Trump, Adamantine being the ""Alexandria"" Jugger-Tank, and the Twins... having nothing to do with Legend, really, but still being a badass set of powers. Hmm. It would be nice to have the Ranged Combat niche filled, but it's not necessary. I have enough room to say that Adamantine's power has a Blaster application of some kind, maybe like Ballistic..."
Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,3,Thu May 7 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, them. I've not fully settled on the backstory but I'm working on it.  And yeah, Adamantine could do the Ballistic thing, and when you consider that Unity/The Twins could charge her up by throwing themselves at her..."
Parahumans,356vko,ughzubat,4,Thu May 7 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"charge her up by throwing themselves at her...   Holy shit, that synergy tho. I've already decided that using telekinesis on her or something she's draining would just charge directly into her energy reservoir, so they don't even have to throw themselves. Just push into her hand or something and she has a steady stream of energy.  Yeah, I'm voting we bring in Unity. /u/ughzubat has veto power, but if he does that I'm calling off the wedding."
Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,3,Thu May 7 21:30:16 2015 UTC,This is so broken.
Parahumans,356vko,Plecky,3,Thu May 7 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"Adamantine is basically the most broken combat-based cape. You only hit her if she's okay with that (fifteen fucking seconds of proprioceptive precognition), and if she is okay with it it's because she's stealing the energy. Then she hits you with all the energy, or runs stupid fast, or jumps so far it counts as flying. Or maybe she'll just do all three."
Parahumans,356vko,Plecky,3,Thu May 7 21:56:40 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure I want to think about what happens if she stores all the energy she can and hits a dynakinetic engine with it. It's sounding like an explosive airburst or sudden AOE destruction.  Anyone have any idea what Unity's official classification would be?  Because it's starting to seem a lot like Master/Breaker/Blaster/Mover/Brute/Trump with a hidden Thinker aspect.
Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,2,Fri May 8 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"To that first part: Adamantine is actually capable of some very scary AoE stuff, she just doesn't know it. Or maybe she does know, but doesn't want to know. I mentioned at some point that she can land punches that hit like a cruise missile? Well, imagine if she directed that energy into the ground.  I think you're pretty close with Unity's classification. The only difference I would suggest is Changer instead of Breaker. If I'm understand their sphere state correctly, they become more or less impervious and are telekinetically controlled by the other twin? That doesn't sound like the Breakers in canon (SS, Legend, assorted pyrokinetics). They usually get the ability to ignore certain physical laws altogether or at will in their Breaker state. Changers can take non-biological forms (Brandish and Fog are good examples), so Unity's sphere could be a Changer power."
Parahumans,356vko,Plecky,3,Fri May 8 15:05:17 2015 UTC,That synergy will go great with my Raido rune! Accepted.
Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,3,Thu May 7 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"It's official, then. Futhark, Adamantine, and Unity. Congratulations, we're all in the Triumvireddit!  Honorable mention to Stumble, of course.  I didn't say anything."

Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,3,Thu May 7 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"Don't lie, it's the other thing. Totally the other thing.  Okay, I'll stop. Unity is a pretty good addition to the team."
Parahumans,356vko,GreatWyrmGold,2,Thu May 7 23:00:26 2015 UTC,"Raido rune? I wonder what that does. Based on the generator:   Power involves freedom and the breaking of bonds. Tends towards physical powers.   Oh god, that could be incredible."
Parahumans,356vko,ughzubat,3,Thu May 7 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"I was actually just going by the literal ""wagon"" translation and deciding it's a mover power- specifically laying down a ""warp ramp"" that launches like a stacked Skidmark treadmill.

Parahumans,356vko,NamedByAFish,3,Thu May 7 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"In the Triumvireddit, Unity wouldn't be engaging Brutes. That's Adamantine's job hobby."
Parahumans,356vko,Plecky,3,Thu May 7 21:31:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure brutes last long really to be honest. Launching them into orbit might just be a thing that happens.  I was just thinking so people double-broke their hands if they tried hitting them.
Parahumans,356vko,blames_irrationally,3,Thu May 7 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"If they get Adamantine's attention in a bad way, nobody lasts long.

It is almost indestructible and sticks to human flesh even more readily than regular glitter.  It also slowly self-replicates by turning human (and non-parahuman) flesh into more glitter.  The process is rather excruciating.    Her current method of operation is to spread massive amounts of the glitter over random civilians as soon as they come to a new town When confronted by parahumans, she'll use the glitter to defend herself (in a manner similar to shatterbird's glass).

Parahumans,3576ii,NamedByAFish,10,Fri May 8 01:34:27 2015 UTC,"I had to reread that whole section because I had been expecting Tattletale and Grue to be revealed as Bonesaw and Jack, then when Grue assuaged Skitter's fears by hugging her, I started to believe that they were the real deal. So I began expecting the reveal, then Wild bow tricked me into a false sense of security, then the reveal came. I was very confused and shocked."

Parahumans,3576ii,Plecky,14,Fri May 8 13:20:37 2015 UTC,I expected for the Undersiders to spend about an arc fighting E88 with Kaiser as the main villain for a while.  Nope.
Parahumans,3576ii,bulletprooftoaster,14,Thu May 7 23:36:38 2015 UTC,"This is total conjecture on my part, but I think that might have been part of the plan until Kaiser's roll got him killed by Leviathan. I definitely thought the whole manipulation of Purity and general scheming by Kaiser was going to go somewhere bigger."
Parahumans,3576ii,YinAndYang,15,Fri May 8 01:17:48 2015 UTC,"Totally. Kayden's interlude set up Kaiser, super powerful in both the underworld and legitimate business, to be the big bad supervillain. I had to do a double take when Leviathan rips him in half just like that.  Then again, isn't crushing our expectations all what Worm is about? :)"
Parahumans,3576ii,bulletprooftoaster,14,Fri May 8 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"For those who aren't aware, nobody was safe during the Leviathan arc, not even Taylor. Wildbow set an approximate death toll for named characters and rolled dice to see who lived and who died."
Parahumans,3576ii,ThirdFloorGreg,6,Fri May 8 01:44:07 2015 UTC,"So it's just random, amazing chance that all five of the Undersiders were alive at the end of that fight? Damn. Imagine if Lisa hadn't survived her fall...  (We already know what would have happened if Taylor bit it.)"
Parahumans,3576ii,NamedByAFish,9,Fri May 8 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Bitch was a lock to survive since she wasn't there for most of the fight.   When it came to this arc, though, I rolled dice. Barring those who stayed out of the fight, I rolled to see if they lived or died. Just went through the cast as it had formed, to date, and rolled for every participating cape, then worked in their deaths as was possible."
Parahumans,3576ii,ThirdFloorGreg,4,Fri May 8 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. That would make Regent and Grue more or less sure things too, wouldn't it? They were present, but I can't remember them actually participating. I just reread that arc yesterday."
Parahumans,3576ii,NamedByAFish,5,Fri May 8 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"Couldn't tell you, it's been awhile since I read it. I don't know what Wildbow's threshold for ""participating"" was, maybe they would have participated more if their number had come up so that it made sense when they died. But Rachel was a clear ""sitting this one out"" from the beginning, so I feel confident saying she was safe."
Parahumans,3576ii,ThirdFloorGreg,5,Fri May 8 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"Regent was at the battlefield in the beginning and got hit by a wave. Grue was there too, and was directly fighting Lev later by throwing blobs of dark at his head."
Parahumans,3576ii,Nine_Gates,3,Fri May 8 11:43:12 2015 UTC,"Given what we later learn about Endbringer senses, that's kind of funny."
Parahumans,3576ii,sanctaphrax,2,Sat May 9 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"Was she, though? I could easily see her kind of freaking out when a dog dies and dying to Leviathan, near the end."
Parahumans,3576ii,ThirdFloorGreg,3,Fri May 8 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"If she did it would have been because Wildbow decided to kill her off, not because she got a bad roll. He didn't roll for the people who weren't participating."
Parahumans,3576ii,HylianHal,2,Fri May 8 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that's the proper interpretation of what he said. It seems to me he was referring to people who didn't fight in general, i.e capes who didn't even show up, and named characters who aren't capes (Emma, Mr. Gladly, Taylor's dad, etc.)."

Parahumans,3576ii,rakony,9,Sun May 10 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"Very early on, I expected the Endbringers to basically be the S9.  Just a gang (Specifically, a biker gang) of capes who went around from city to city causing chaos and trying to bring about the end of the world like some kind of James Bond villian.  And then we met Leviathan, and a sneak peek of who Simurgh and Behemoth were, and my theory became that they were shards that didn't end up with humans.  I was convinced in the Levi fight that he was a shark who had triggered.  Simurgh was basically a roc (The mythological birds that were big enough to steal elephants), and probably a triggered bird.  Behemoth, my best guess was that he was a living, walking volcano.  Expectation #2, Since she ruled the boardwalk, I really really wanted to see Taylor end up as some queen villianess, with a throne room and a dress/crown/cape made out of bugs.  Probably some time long after her secret identity was blown so she'd just go without a mask.  And a dozen little henchmen.  Instead I got an one-armed, barely alive puppet.  Creeptastic, but not a Queen."
Parahumans,3576ii,Lexilogical,6,Fri May 8 06:39:15 2015 UTC,Feel the same about number 2. A much as I loved what Wildbow ended up doing my favorite bit of Worm was Taylor as the Queen of Brockton Bay. I wish that bit could have lasted longer.
Parahumans,3576ii,rakony,9,Fri May 8 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"She would have made a great super villian.  I mean, she was, but she was always very hands on when it came down to it.  I loved the way she was going where she was very conscious to not let people see her as any other than larger than life.  Couldn't let people see her do things like sitting down on Atlas, for instance, had bugs in her hair keeping it neat, giving it volume and making it move...    One of my favourite bits was when she gave herself up as collateral to the PRT and banished all her bugs.  And between her running dialogue and Clockblocker, I just got the impression that with the bugs, she was this royal creature out of nightmares, and without them, she was just a tall, too skinny teen wearing a spandex costume.  Like the difference between a comic book character and an amateur cosplayer."
Parahumans,3576ii,Lexilogical,3,Fri May 8 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I enjoyed. All her careful arrangements to create effect everything from ""Hand or knee."" to getting up even earlier to do her run so no one would see her tired. The relationship she had with Charlotte and Sierra, and her neighborhood more generally was also very well executed and interesting. I would love to have seen more of that. I'd also like to see her execute some longer term plans for the city."
Parahumans,3576ii,Subrosian_Smithy,2,Fri May 8 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"Me too.  Heck, I wanted to see her working with Accord.  Accord would have (and technically did) hand her step by step instructions to making all of her hopes for the city a reality, and she just ended up tossing it in a pile and walking away.  Could she actually have accomplished Coil's goal if she hadn't walked into the PRT and given herself up?  I think so."
Parahumans,3576ii,cephalord,5,Fri May 8 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"Early on, I was spoiled for the fact that Scion would turn genocidal, and pretty quickly made the connection in my mind with Jack ending the world. So during the Echidna arc, and again before we saw the full roster of the S9K, I entertained an idea that Jack would get control of Echidna, or an Echidna clone, and use her to clone Scion ad absurdium.  I feel Wildbow's solution was much more elegant, though."

To be honest, while it was a major part of the story, I really wouldn't have minded if the potions were never introduced.

Parahumans,355drk,bigdickpuncher,24,Thu May 7 06:31:26 2015 UTC,"Whether or not Eidolon made them, they definitely have some association with Scion and the other entities - remember, we saw them in Eden's visions of the future, and Eidolon didn't exist then. Their purpose is pretty simple - they enhance conflict. We saw it in Eden's Earth, and we saw it on Bet; the Endbringers showed up, and things got worse. They seemed to be less active in Eden's Earth, serving more as guided missiles to break up groups getting too powerful than the relentless assault we saw on Bet, but their purpose was the same.  As for where exactly they come from, there are two big theories that I've seen, but I don't think we have the evidence to prove which one - if either - is right.   Eidolon made them because he needed worthy opponents. He got his powers and eventually got bored of always being too strong, and so his power tapped into a shard to literally make him some enemies on his level. Eden made them while en route to Earth, but then she died and eventually Eidolon got his powers, got bored as above, but instead of making them he tapped into a power that woke them up from wherever they were sleeping.   Personally I'm a fan of theory two, if only because you would think Eidolon would notice the power drop from creating the kind of monsters the Endbringers are if not using the power itself. A power to wake them up and give them a motive would be much more likely to slip past him, especially given his tendency to search for physical powers more often than mental ones. Like I said, though, we don't really have the information to know for sure one way or the other."

When Zion and Eden first meet they designate roles to each other to act as two parts of a whole. The Warrior, Attacker, Destroyer. The Thinker, Defender, Builder.  In the brief look we get of Eden's intended future, Scion is completely passive following Eden's lead in everything and not really learning or developing staying in a state of complete immaturity; literally the 'Golden Fool'. Kehpri changed that. She forced him to develop, showed him things that broke him, made him understand what it meant to be human...then rubbed his face it.  The Endbringers do not 'think' as we understand it. They are artificial life closer to computers than biological life. They precieve the world through their powers; Energy, Water/Meat, Future/Past.

He’d seen it, had checked the footage, had seen her go out of her way to shield it with her wings.  She’d done it subtly, most of the time, events contriving to make it look more accidental than anything.  She couldn’t make tinker devices herself.  She had to copy the designs of tinkers near her.  He’d found who she’d copied, a now deceased cape from Brockton Bay, and he’d found the designs.  There were discrepancies.   (The Simurgh made it and hid it inside a gun.)   A baby.  Male.  With large ears and a large round nose.  Not attractive, as babies went.  One or two years old?  Accelerated aging?  Where had the Simurgh been in contact with a tinker with that particular knowledge?  Bonesaw?  That was disquieting enough on its own.  Was the child tinker harboring knowledge?  “These are the big things you were talking about?”  Ingenue asked, her eyes wide.  “Actually, no.  I had suspicions, but the Endbringer making a baby wasn’t one of them.”  Lung touched a burning hand to the glass, melting it.  Water steamed on contact with his claw.  “No,” Teacher said.  Idiotic, considering Lung couldn’t hear, and the event had already passed.  Still, he couldn’t help but add, “Don’t.”  The water was crimson and boiling by the time Lung withdrew his claw."

There's definitely speculation out there that he intentionally set Eden up to crash, but there's no real evidence either for or against it.  For Scion killing he Endbringers, he isn't really the imaginative sort. He knew Eden was dead, and he was following Kevin Norton's orders in the hopes they would bring him fulfillment in the absence of the cycle, so when he was told to kill the Endbringers I doubt he gave any thought to who made them. In addition to that, entities as a whole aren't really the sentimental type - not killing something because your partner made it isn't exactly the sort of idea they seem wired to understand.  Finally, we don't honestly know exactly why the Endbringers went after Scion rather than anything else. It could be that, given their connection to Eidolon, his death left them to latch onto the Undersiders the same way Scion latched onto Kevin Norton. It's also possible that they did it as part of the Simurgh's long term plan, or that it was simple self-preservation of a kind - teaming up to fight the bigger threat. I feel attributing their actions to Abbadon is reaching pretty dangerous distances, though, because there's really nothing behind that possibility except for path to victory being a silly powerful ability."

Besides, who knows how the shard is distributing the power loss?   But theory one seems more likely for one reason: we have Word of God that Endbringers are all responses to the way the world handled previous Endbringers. Behemoth starts to get predictable and what happens? A mega-fast Endbringer shows up and is impossible to pin down like Behemoth. Behemoth is killed and another mega-fast EB that also can't be pinned down shows up.  Then another one with absolute battlefield control to avoid more shenanigans.

As for the Endbringers being responses to the way earlier ones were handled, that's definitely true. It's just as possible for that to be the case if Eden created them as it is if Eidolon did. If you've got twenty Endbringers sitting around dormant, it's not like they're all going to fight the same way or do the same thing. Leviathan fighting in a way that made anti-Behemoth tactics unusable against him would just be a matter of the ""wake up Endbringers"" shard going out and choosing one that operates differently than Behemoth does."

Parahumans,355drk,Rillet,11,Thu May 7 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"Two parts to a whole. The other entity is a warrior, direct, oriented in the short-term goals. This entity looks further, consulting possibilities.  Their general destination is in mind, and has been in mind for some time. Already, they have begun to close their helix spiral, drawing fractionally towards one another with each rotation, controlling the pattern and timing of their approach.  Destination, the Warrior entity communicates.  Agreement, this entity responds. The signals that accompany and form the overarching messages allow them to pick out sub-worlds for themselves. Arrival points, destinations for critical shards to root, hosts for the extensions of those same shards.  Trajectory, the other entity communicates. More data on where they will arrive, the way they will move on approach, the placement of less crucial shards.  Agreement. This entity sees the constant messages as a distraction. It is reorganizing, calling on its own precognition and clairvoyance to map out their actions after arrival.  This entity reforms itself, adjusting the placements of individual shards, priming itself for a deeper simulation, considering possible ways things can be carried out.  This takes time. Focus.  Colony, the other entity signals.  Narrowing down possible destinations.  Agreement, this entity is distracted in responding. It is receiving another broadcast.  A third.  The communication is almost alien, a member of their species, but long distant, from countless cycles ago. It hesitates, then signals its own location.  Exchange. Meet.  The response is garbled. Takes time to analyze.  The third entity travels more through momentum than by insinuation. It expends vast quantities of power to change course.  The response, this entity realizes, is a declaration of war.  And the third entity is larger than the two of them combined.  Victory is impossible, only submission will serve.  The other entity only takes, and it is a return to the beginning, in a way, to a time when they as a race agreed to be consumed by the strongest, so that the dynamic might change.  What remains of this entity turns its focus toward the future, attempting to process this eventuality.  A focus on the superweapons. Lesser than the ones this entity had planned, but still potent enough to serve. Numbering in the hundreds.  This entity and its warrior partner will be cannibalized, so the larger entity can seed the population with only minor powers. Four or five times the number of powers, at half strength or weaker.  This third, larger entity, devourer that it is, has reached a size where it must decide what shards will pass muster and which will be discarded or repurposed entirely.  This biped race will kill or be killed. This larger entity does not care about preserving the race. It follows a faster cycle.  As the warrior entity is consumed, this entity ceases fighting and allows itself to be subsumed and cannibalized.  Those that were once three set down together as one being, landing on the biped planet.    Apollyonverse Worm. I will not be continuing this, others can.   A scenario written by Wildbow about if the meeting between Eden, Zion, and Abaddon went a little differently. Not technically canon, but a different take on what could have happened from WoG.  The key bit:   A focus on the superweapons. Lesser than the ones this entity had planned, but still potent enough to serve. Numbering in the hundreds.   This confirms that Eden intended the creation of at least 20 Endbringers. Abaddon would have made hundreds, but weaker.  Other that this extra bit I agree with Whispersilk."

Eden crashes, gets stabbed, and plans go funky. Eidolon drinks some of Eden's guts, which give him the ability to control other bits. Eidolon needs worthy foes. Eidolon subconsciously uses the power Eden planned to use to make the superweapons, to make three foes worthy of him. Said superweapons, named Behemoth, Leviathan, and Simurgh, begin promoting conflict and working to give Eidolon worthy foes (both themselves and, likely, folks like Mannequin and Echidna). Behemoth is killed. Repeat step 5. Jack Slash has a pleasant chat with Scion. Scion starts killing everything. Eidolon tries to stop Scion from killing everything. He ultimately fails. Scion tries to stop Eidolon from stopping Scion from killing everything. He eventually succeeds. The Endbringers are confused. Simurgh, perhaps crafted from some sort of planning shard, directs the Endbringers to sight Scion. Why? Could be because Scion killing everything stops conflict, could be revenge, could be self-preservation. Scion kills a could more Endbringers before being bullied to death (kinda). Simurgh is still around, possibly directing the other Endbringers, almost certainly twisting the world to her goals. What are they? Making another Eidolon figure? More conflict?

I mean, I'm fully aware she wouldn't do something like that, but it would screw up both gang dynamics quite neatly.  Actually, she could just annoy them by turning all the villains into hamsters or cats or something, maybe sheep. I'm gonna go with sheep."

Honestly, this is one of my pet peeves with time-travel stories that I have to suspend my disbelief on.  In my mind, almost any important change is going to randomize all births VERY quickly.

They all seem like her mind trying to justify seeing all these dead people by inventing explanations or just ignoring them outright when they can't be rationalised.

It makes a lot more sense that Cauldron could fix Taylor and work with Tattletale to dump her somewhere nice and quiet for a while than for there to be a purgatory-style afterlife out of nowhere.  My default assumption at the end of Worm, personally, was that Contessa shooting Taylor in the head was bullet brain surgery, because Contessa's power can do ridiculous stuff like that, and she was just destroying the part of Taylor's brain that was killing her. It didn't even occur to me that Taylor might be actually shot because of that conversation at the end, if she'd been justified, which she totally fucking was."

Parahumans,354lcr,eddykatt,26,Thu May 7 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"IIRC...  Sting, plus enhanced timing, plus enhanced accuracy, plus enhanced reflexes, plus enhanced balance.  You can fold some of those together, but it's definitely at least two powers."
Parahumans,354lcr,sanctaphrax,13,Thu May 7 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"When I think of a cape with multiple powers I think of Circus.  She shoots fire, has a personal pocket dimension for storage and possesses enhanced coordination.  Three distinct powers.  Flechette has one power by my count.  The ability to empower metal to go through anything.  Enhanced senses supplement her sting ability and make it possible to utilize.  Kind of like Taylor's enhanced multi-tasking and processing capabilities allow her to control billions of insects and process their senses.   They're not really two separate powers are they?  You need an advanced brain to turn insect control into anything useful.  Just like you need good aim to utilize a Flechette's sting power.  I mean how bad would it be if she were aiming for Leviathan and shot Eidolon instead?  Worst Passenger ever."
Parahumans,354lcr,eddykatt,17,Thu May 7 04:05:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ballistic has enhanced aim. He just has to get good at aiming. Same with Shadow Stalker - she can phase in bolts to kill otherwise invulnerable enemies, but she has to do the timing herself.  Skitter's thinker power is awefully convenient and makes her absurdly awesome, but her bud (Aiden?) did not inherit this part.  Foil was her name when she just used a rapier - she didn't use her other powers much then. She would have seemed like someone who had an awesome sword, and also able to shoot hoops from half court. She then found a way to combine these powers, and she used that all the time."
Parahumans,354lcr,pendia,3,Thu May 7 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"Shadow Stalker's power is to become intangible and go through walls.  You don't need good aim to use that.  She's learned how to use the crossbow as an addition to that power.  Ballistic is a bit more tricky, we don't know how he aims.  Does he mentally decide which direction to aim his projectiles?  Do they just go the general direction he's facing?  It really doesn't matter.  You don't need good aim when you're firing something the size of a car.  Okay I guess you don't literally need enhanced senses to wield a crossbow or rapier, but you do when you're fighting people with guns and swinging roof to roof.  Without an enhanced brain Flechette/Foil is about as useful as Skitter only being able to control a handfull of bugs at a time."
Parahumans,354lcr,eddykatt,8,Thu May 7 15:02:58 2015 UTC,Taylor's thinker abilities probably came from her second trigger.

Parahumans,354lcr,bigdickpuncher,4,Thu May 7 06:31:31 2015 UTC,No it was stated that her power to process multiple streams of information was given to her as part of her second trigger event. Which occurred almost immediately after the first trigger.
Parahumans,354lcr,pendia,7,Thu May 7 06:43:53 2015 UTC,"I'm aware. It is possible it's both, though; theorizing on Skitter's power probably wasn't the top priority when that was stated, so I wouldn't be surprised if something was left out. My point was that it could have just been handling the information, instead of multitasking, too."

She first shows her remote hearing skill during then, which is an exception to every other technique she acquires.

IIRC with coinciding triggers the WoG is each person receives a strong version on one power and weaker versions of the others. So if it was really a coinciding trigger we would be looking for a weak version of Sting with more advanced timing/accuracy/coordination. She came from NYC so the villian also must have come from there. Some immediately spring to mind.  Ravager- fused with Mouse Protector to make Murder Rat. S/he inflicted wounds that did not heal and festered. This may be Sting taking a form similar to an offensive Scapegoat, strike a little in all realities at once and then start healing those alt. reality injuries at the growing expense of the person here (yes, it's a stretch). Never stated where Murder Rat came from, they might be from NYC. Murder Rat is noted to have high levels of flexibility, agility, reflexes and 'odd' strength, some of that is probably from Ravager.  Damsel of Distress- Her storms seem Sting-ey. Though she doesn't have any of the timing stuff. The S9 found her in New Hampshire, but she may have gone there since she couldn't cut it in the Big Apple  Unnamed Adept- There was a woman who didn't get a chance to display her abilities, and reinforcements that were off-screen. The only reason I put this is because the Adepts are some of the only villains we know are from NYC.  Watch- We see him in Chicago, but he's a mercenary so he's probably traveled a lot. His 'phantom hands' have a Sting-ey breaker aspect. His bursts of clairvoyance and superspeed may be the full realization of Foil's timing/accuracy and reflexes.  This is all assuming that Flechette did actually do a group trigger. It may just be coincidence and the extra powers were already set in with the shard for Sting assistance.  I feel like Wildbow is a bit like Scion in these cases. You want him to swoop in and save the day with a WoG, but there's no way to summon him (at least without annoying him, REMINDER: don't do the /u/ summon, he doesn't like it)."

From here:    About the unnamed villain:   Wildbow:  S/he did get Sting lite. Remember, Sting is a 'shark' of a shard. Can't really do much to improve or vary it."

Instead of getting Sting and being able to push one object into all realities, Circus is able to move objects between dimensions and uses it as a hammerspace pocket.  Perhaps there is another cape or two out there with enhanced reflex and accuracy but a slightly different powerset."
Parahumans,354lcr,tiny-alchemist,2,Mon May 18 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"Damsel's powers seem nothing like Sting. Ravager...bit of a stretch, yeah, and I don't see Mouse Protector as being in the same batch (for instance, neither Ravager nor Foil seem to have teleportation of any sort). Watch isn't a bad choice, and the city isn't a problem, since Flechette got moved around a lot."
Parahumans,354lcr,GreatWyrmGold,2,Thu May 7 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, DoD was a pretty weak guess.  Sorry, misunderstanding. I wasn't including Mouse Protector in the trigger batch, I was just noting that she was the other cape used to make Murder Rat.  I was a bit unsure about city. I thought that she triggered in NYC and just got moved to BB the one time. Is there somewhere saying that she isn't native to New York?"
Parahumans,354lcr,pseudonarne,1 point,Thu May 7 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"WoG states that Flechette was a orphan without any strong ties anywhere, so she got moved around to wherever she was needed. No word on if she's from New York originally or if the Big Apple just needed more muscle."
Parahumans,353251,jrbless,15,Wed May 6 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"Noelle, Oliver, and Satyrical have similar powers... Breed and Nilbog with Nilbog just having a more general version. Out of left field, but Grue and Burnscar have pretty similar powers just with different mediums. Grue's evil Echidna clone was almost identical to Burnscar being able to teleport within shadows instead of flame.  Damsel of Distress and Snap Trap have similar space/gravity effects. Ballistic and Rail both move things on touch. Ballistic turning them into projectiles and Rail making them move along the ground as if on rails, Vellum and Skinslip. Ursa, Prism, Crusader all have different angles on projections.    Grey Boy is a Cauldron cape so he has a dead Eden Shard.    “It meant more people with powers to fight the Endbringers, that was the lie we told ourselves. But we created the Siberian and Shatterbird, in a roundabout way. We created the Gray Boy, selling him powers, finding ourselves unable to stop him when he went out of bounds. There were countless others. Echidna is just the latest in a long series of grave mistakes.”   You know, Cody and Grey Boy probably have the same Shard. Cody just had the balance formula with it which gave him a weaker, but safer version.  We know Eden must have had a Broadcast Shard as they talked to each other. It is also very likely Eden had her own version of the Administrator Shard. So there could be Eden versions of Jack and Taylor walking around.  Scion demonstrated his 'Path to Victory' Shard. Contessa has Abaddon's  'Path to Victory' Shard so I wonder where Eden's went. Maybe Abaddon got it.  (Random thought, but maybe Dragon is a second-gen cape having a bud of Andrew Richter's Shard)"
Parahumans,353251,Rillet,4,Wed May 6 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"Noelle and Oliver I'll disagree on. They each got half of the same Cauldron vial. Now, if one of them would have drank all of the vial, they would be similar to Satyr.  Ursa, Prism, Crusader, Genesis, and Siberian fit as being projections of different types.  Damsel of Distress, Snap Trap, and Topsy I would also agree as being similar. Vista may fit in this group as well, but she may not."
Parahumans,353251,Plecky,2,Wed May 6 19:09:10 2015 UTC,"I was curious as to whether or not Eidolon got the admin shard, he probably didn't but it seems possible at least."
Parahumans,353251,Samwise210,3,Wed May 6 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have the ""Fuck-You"" level of multitasking that Taylor got from an Admin Shard.  Far more likely that he got a shard responsible for providing power to other shards/subsystems. He's constantly switching between powers, giving each shard a sliver of life but as he uses them more and more they decay faster.  It works with the Endbringers too - at some point, his shard provided a touch of power to the shard that creates one, and gives them an order. Then, when he needed to feel more needed, when he needs another worthy opponent, his shard powers the Endbringer Creation Shard again, giving it new parameters and a new order."
Parahumans,353251,Plecky,2,Thu May 7 00:07:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, there is that. And that's a reasonable possibility.  If it were the admin shard he'd probably be able to access a lot more than 3 powers at a time anyway."
Parahumans,353251,Samwise210,2,Thu May 7 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Eden had a PtV equivalent shard - when she gets it from Abaddon it's a brand new toy that she gets so drawn up in playing with that she forgets to land safely.  Which is why I don't think Scion had a direct PtV equivalent either - he probably had some combat prediction shard, but an honest PtV equivalent would have made him unsusceptible even to Taylor's bullying."
Parahumans,353251,ThirdFloorGreg,3,Thu May 7 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"It seemed like Scion had a poorly optimized Path to Victory shard. It worked but it was horrendously expensive to use, burning years off of his life. Think about all the other things he considered basically cost-free. His PtV was billions of times more costly than powers that probably could have wiped out all life on every earth. Contessa's may or may not be similarly expensive, though, since she would have no way to know."
Parahumans,353251,Lexilogical,2,Thu May 7 01:08:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think Contessa's could possibly be that expensive.  Unless she had a life expectancy in the thousands of years, she'd probably already be dead with how often she uses her PtV.  Like, she admits to asking herself several questions before she leaves, and one pertains to strangers.  If she asks herself even 3 questions before she leaves through one of Doormaker's portals and does that before she picks up someone for an appointment, that's hundreds of years off her life already."
Parahumans,353251,Rillet,3,Thu May 7 01:17:14 2015 UTC,"The energy of the Shards only really matter to Scion seeing as how energy = life. He wanted to preserve enough energy to continue the cycle when he found a new partner. To Contessa using PtV doesn't matter so much because it's a weaker variant and it doesn't directly correlate with her life so she can use it as much as she wants. The vast majority of capes couldn't go through enough energy to burn through their Shards with the only exceptions being Doormaker and Eidolon, both of whom required immense amounts of energy output for their power.   The Entities are different because their Shards are not bottle-necked energy wise or crippled power wise. This means each one could go through immense amounts of energy while scaled up for the use of Entities.  Scion's PtV variant would look through every conceivable future up to a point and tell him EVERYTHING.  Contessa's PtV would just look for the future where Contessa 'wins'."
Parahumans,353251,Lexilogical,3,Thu May 7 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"Touche, I hadn't considered that what Scion was actually worrying about was the energy of the Shard."
Parahumans,353251,ThirdFloorGreg,3,Thu May 7 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"Well, she isn't the one who pays the cost, just like any other power. Ballistic doesn't have to eat 12,000,000 calories a day to provide the energy he imparts to objects he uses his power on, that comes from his shard. Contessa has been burning through Eden's reserves. Keep in mind, her power is definitely better than what Eden had before meeting Abadon, which was probably better than what Scion has, since it is a large part of her specialty but not his."
Parahumans,353251,Whispersilk,3,Thu May 7 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"Eden definitely had a path to victory shard before Abbadon. Every time we see her view the future in interlude 29 is before she starts using Abbadon's future sight power; she only switched over to Abbadon's in the instants before she hit the Earth, and it seems likely or at least possible that the only reason she switched at all is because hers got damaged when they collided and made their exchange. From interlude 29:   An optimal future.  It is an unwieldy future because it gave up a part of its ability to see the future to the other being.  There are holes, because this entity does not fully understand the details of what happened, and because this entity’s future-sight power is damaged.  Above all else, it is an incomplete future because this entity has only the most minimal role in things, and the shards it saw were all the Warrior’s.       [Eden moves shards around and does some other stuff.]       All energy it can spare goes towards the reorganization.  Shards must be discarded, or it will dwarf the destination planet.  It casts shards off, and it retains shards that will allow it to draw power from those shards.  Danger, the Warrior broadcasts.  Confident, this entity responds.  It picks a reality.  Up until the moment it hits ground, it works to reorganize itself.  In the doing, it alters one of the third entity’s powers, replacing its own ability to find the optimal future.  In that very instant, it recognizes that it has made a grave error.  The simulated world and the glimpse of the optimal future are already gone from its grasp.  Too late.  The perspective changes, breaking away, distant, confused, detached.  The impact was too hard."
Parahumans,353251,Samwise210,2,Thu May 7 05:58:13 2015 UTC,"You are quite right, I misread that section.  However, while Eden might have a future-sight shard, she doesn't necessarily have a direct PtV equivalent. She might have something more similar to Scion's (aka, cast-from-hp short-term PtV) as well as something like an unrestrained version of Dinah's power.  The key difference is that PtV includes an 'autopilot' function wherein it guides your steps precisely, while what Eden has just seems to be 'look ahead and set up things so that it works out like that' like the Simurgh does."
Parahumans,353251,miseryandwhoah,8,Thu May 7 14:24:52 2015 UTC,Alabaster also has a similar power to Grey Boy.
Parahumans,353251,Brutusness,5,Wed May 6 18:19:40 2015 UTC,True. I forgot about him due to how little screen-time he got. I think his fate was being trapped in a time bubble during the Leviathan fight.
Parahumans,353251,NamedByAFish,4,Wed May 6 18:23:26 2015 UTC,Yeah... what a shit way to go.

Parahumans,353251,cephalord,6,Thu May 7 00:42:27 2015 UTC,Oni Lee and Crusader are similar. Lee only can create one short-time clone while Crusader can make a lot of ghosts. It'd be funny if Crusader budded from Lee.
Parahumans,353251,Plecky,4,Wed May 6 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"Burnscar and Leviathan.  Seriously, if you switch the elements on them, these two have basically the same abilities.

Parahumans,353251,Shemetz,3,Wed May 6 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"I view the shards as analogous to our cells. So any given entity probably has a lot of shards with a similar or same function. Imagine if humans went through the same process; we could seed millions of other creatures with 'pancreas' shards. After that you can get into a bit more detail; these pancreas shards produce insulin, these pancreas shards secrete pancreatic digestion juice etc.  Entities likely have something roughly similar. Imagine they have some 'organ' responsible for staying intact, a Restorer. This restorer could use different systems to keep the entities intact; unreasonable durability, time-locking, straight-up mass regeneration. It hands out the shards; Crawler (and a thousand others, spread over multiple centuries) gets the regeneration, some natural-trigger variation of Gray Boy gets the time-restoration etc etc.  This way it makes sense that many parahumans can have variations on the same theme of powers."
Parahumans,353251,wiikipedia,4,Wed May 6 20:03:04 2015 UTC,we could seed millions of other creatures with 'pancreas' shards.   I misread this as Panacea shards and promptly attempted to figure out how horrifying that would be.
Parahumans,353251,Littlerob,2,Wed May 6 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between Cherish's powers and Heartbreaker's?  From what I understood, Cherish could control emotions and also sense emotions over a large radius. Heartbreaker was....able to control emotions. Isn't Cherish just Heartbreaker plus detection?"
Parahumans,353251,ThirdFloorGreg,5,Wed May 6 22:08:35 2015 UTC,"Heartbreaker has a shorter range but can effect people permanently and seemingly on a deeper level, possibly able to effect more people at once. Cherish has a huge range for sensing emotions (which I don't even know if heartbreaker can do) and IMO has more of a blunt force ability that only works while she is applying it.   It makes sense that they have similar powers though since Cherish is a bud from heartbreaker. Just like Kaiser and his whole family have similar powers with different amounts of versatility and power."
Parahumans,353251,pseudonarne,4,Wed May 6 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"Cherish needed to maintain her power - she could change the emotion someone was feeling, but only from moment to moment. She could push love at you, and you'd love her, but she'd need to either maintain that artificial push to keep you loving her or condition you over time to feel it naturally. Heartbreaker could control the duration - he could hit you with love, and you'd love him forever at the snap of his fingers. But Heartbreaker was pure broadcast, while Cherish traded some of the broadcast potency for a capability to receive as well, which is where her emotion sense comes from."
Parahumans,353251,tiny-alchemist,3,Wed May 6 22:36:38 2015 UTC,"Cherish changes what you feels, Heartbreaker effects how you feel. Cherish makes you experience despair, Heartbreaker makes you permanently react to stress by feeling overwhelmed."
Parahumans,35402g,TheHeenie,6,Wed May 6 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Number Estimation    1 Poses a threat only just above human norms, an unexceptional individual may be able to cope with the ability or walk away unharmed from an altercation where the abilities in question were leveraged.  Ability should be assumed to be a nonthreat and need not be identified if other matters prove more pressing.   2 An alert, exceptional, well equipped, and/or trained individual should be able to answer or address the ability in question, but it can prove problematic.  Team members are reminded of standard countermeasures and should put these measures in effect when there are no pressing other matters   3 Civilians, even alert or fit civilians, will not be able to handle the ability or abilities in question.  Several trained individuals may be required to deal with the situation.  Protocol suggests that care should be taken to remove civilians from the area and discourage them from participating.   4 One full squad of trained operatives should be able to deal with this situation alone, but exceptional circumstance, context and environment may bias things one way or the other.   5 Additional countermeasures come into effect.  A typical parahuman and/or one parahuman assisting a squad of operatives should be able to deal with the power in question.  Operatives can engage until assistance arrives.   6 A typical trained parahuman and/or one parahuman assisting a squad of operatives should be able to deal with the power in question.  Operatives should postpone engagement. Parahumans and operatives should assume that traditional actions are going to be met by a complication.  Acquiring further intel recommended where possible, but not mandated.   7 Parahumans should engage in pairs or trios at a minimum, two fully equipped squads should be deployed.  Acquiring further intel is mandated, all acting parties should shift to the defensive or delay until intel can be acquired.   8 Evacuation of civilians should take priority for all squad members.  Engaging should be avoided outside of specific missions and tasks.  Capes should engage only when supported by their team to ensure a minimum of complications or danger.   9 Assume extreme complications, with standard tactics not applying, or the power in question having an additional factor that exaggerates its effect.  Capes and PRT should evacuate where possible, and should only engage when a specific mission and strategy has been outlined.  Major countermeasures should take effect.   10+ In the event of a serious confrontation, additional teams or specific high-rated individuals should be called in to manage the crisis.    In the categories themselves, parahumans fall into the following classifications, with the following countermeasures:"
Parahumans,35402g,vivomancer,5,Thu May 7 12:00:11 2015 UTC,"Mover  Has the ability to transport themselves and/or others to other locations, by means of enhanced speed, teleportation, flight, vehicles or the like. General response is to limit movements where possible, anticipate attack from any direction.  When declared in the field, if possible, append classification with type.  Mover: Teleporter!  Threat level 2+: Communicate mover nature.  Where possible, move fight to a contained area where free-ranging movement is less effective, targeting objectives or other threats to draw attention and focus.  Lock down area.  Threat level 5+:  Assume containment is impossible.  Clearance granted for truck-mounted nonlethal measures (net launchers, foam sprayers) that might otherwise inconvenience locals.  Threat level 9+:  Higher office and PRT offices in nearby or neighboring cities should be notified of possible threat or retaliation in case of confrontation.  Shaker  Can affect a broader area, asserting some degree of control over the battlefield.  May include gas, explosions, forcefields, and ambient or radiated effects. General response is to spread out, minimizing the shaker’s ability to affect multiple individuals at once.    Threat level 2+:  Communicate shaker nature.  Where possible, move or stagger fight locations with some regularity, to slow their ability to seize total command over a battlefield.  Shaker-class threats take high priority, and can or should be baited out and taken out of action.  Threat level 5+:  All individuals should remain as mobile as possible, operating alone or in pairs.  Evacuate the area, and personnel are warned not to rely too much on cover, environmental advantages, or situational advantages.  Stagger confrontations, leaving an area when identified.  Threat level 9+:  Evacuation takes utmost priority.  Brute  Has enhanced strength or durability, most dangerous in a melee, typically very difficult to put down.  While the execution may remain fairly stable, the source of this power can vary. General response depends on degree of brute classification, but should involve focusing fire, limiting movements, and maintaining a safe distance.  Threat level 2+:  Communicate brute nature.  Assume divided fire will not have any serious effect, and devote focused fire to the target.  Treat as low priority unless movements cannot be restricted, in which case the brute can be escalated to moderate priority.  Threat level 5+:  Assume standard munitions are not going to hamper the brute.  Lethal munitions are authorized, truck emplacements are authorized.  Property damage should be expected and accounted for.  Where possible, move fight to an open area.  Threat level 9+:  Inter-city missile emplacements and other large scale munitions are authorized.  Assume standard parahuman abilities are not going to hamper the target.  Breaker  Has the ability to alter themselves to a different state in which they maintain different abilities.  Appends other powers, but only in this state.  Can also include general altered states. Target the individual outside of any enhanced state where possible.  All other effects depend on the sub-classification.  Master  Has the ability to control others.  Can include degrees of control (swaying attitudes or emotions) and a wealth of controlled entities (individuals, animals, objects, created beings). Numbers assumed to be equal, masters take second highest priority and are targeted first.  Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to master classification.  Master prioritized as target, with likely location regularly communicated to team and oversight, to allow expedient removal.  Threat level 5+:  Assuming nonhuman, non-sapient minions, full lethal munitions are authorized against any massed forces.  In case of controlled humans, all standard ‘eyes-on’ protocols are in effect (see Changer and Stranger).  Passwords in effect.  Threat level 9+:  Inter-city missiles and other large-scale munitions may be authorized, depending on the situation.  Tinker  Can create devices or alter existing devices well beyond usual restrictions of education, knowledge, resources, and/or physics. Tinkers are less dangerous when removed from their gear, but should not be assumed to be harmless.  A typical tinker can artificially assume any number of other classifications, depending on specialty.  Specialty should be appended to the classification in every case possible.  (ie. phasing specialty or electricity specialty)  Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to tinker classification.  Disruption is encouraged, with use of flashbangs.  Threat level 5+:  Electromagnetic pulses are authorized to disrupt gear, with some property damage likely.  Threat level 9+:  Other tinkers or liasons should be contacted to better inform about capabilities and to answer immediate threats.  Blaster  Ranged, offensive attacks of some form.  Can include blasts, thrown or moved objects, grenades.  Not always damaging, but generally deleterious. Response varies greatly depending on the nature of the blaster.  At low levels, cover is highly recommended.  At higher levels, movement is a higher priority, and cover should be assumed to be useless.  Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to blaster classification so they can take cover at next opportunity.  Frequent reporting on blaster’s location and likely direction of fire are encouraged.  Suppression of ranged fire is encouraged but not mandated.  Threat level 5+:  Resources and/or personnel are devoted to pressuring the blaster threat, keeping them moving and focused on a target to protect other personnel.  Truck-mounted emplacements may be necessary to apply sufficient pressure.  Threat level 9+:  Evacuation of likely firing zone is prioritized.  Responding to high-caliber ranged threat is likely to necessitate matching response, if civilians or property are endangered.  Inter-city missiles and other large-scale weapons are authorized.  Thinker  Possesses enhanced knowledge, skills and/or perceptions beyond any reasonable norm.  Includes clairvoyance, precognition, skill acquisition, enhanced hearing and enhanced sight. Thinker capes, all numbers assumed to be equal, take the highest priority in engagements.   Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to thinker classification.  Communication should be limited and the thinker should be cut off from teammates where possible.  Encrypted or coded communications may be necessary.  Failing that, the operation may need to be silent (noncommunicative team).  Threat level 5+:  Maximum disruption to the senses, with flashbangs and nonlethal truck emplacements put into regular effect.  All possible measures should be undertaken to keep the thinker threat from communicating.  Pre-prepared thinker countermeasures (false information) should be entered into play.  PRT thinkers should be contacted remotely to maximize counter-thinking.  Threat level 9+:  Contact the head office to discuss needs and resources available.  Striker  Has a power that applies on physical contact.  Often applies a changed state, like the breaker classification, but isn’t personal.  Melee range, but not strength or durability, as per Brute. General response is to maintain a set distance and maintain visual on the striker.  Open areas are preferrable to cramped quarters.  Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to the striker classification.  Formation should maintain a distance.  Foam sprayers authorized.  Threat level 5+:  Truck mounted foam sprayers and net guns are authorized.  Threat level 9+:  None.  Changer  Can alter their form, appearance, and/or natural abilities through some manipulation of their bodies.  Does not include new powers beyond natural weapons, armor, or durability. Sustained focus fire is recommended.  Low-ish priority, all numbers assumed to be equal.  Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to Changer classification.  Basic ‘eyes on’ protocols initiated, with team members maintaining constant eye contact with one another, and eyes on the changer.  Changer is never assumed to be unarmed.  Threat level 5+:  Full eyes on protocols and verbal passwords put into effect.  No facility, locked down or otherwise, is assumed to be impregnable.  Threat level 9+:  None  Trump  Can manipulate powers in some capacity, altering, granting, strengthening, weakening or removing them entirely, or has powers that interact solely with the powers of others. PRT squads are encouraged, with capes sidelined, barring all but the most threatening situations.  Ranged fire and distance is encouraged, with minimal contact and involvement, to preserve safety of involved capes. Remainder depends on nature of power.  Stranger  Powers predominantly lend themselves to infiltration.  Ability in question might bypass defenses, mislead, or help to avoid notice. Full ‘eyes on’ is SOP where possible.  Other safeguards include indiscriminate fire and high priority targeting.  Threat level 2+:  Team is notified as to stranger classification.  Areas may be secured and ‘taped’, to track movement through doors or windows.  Passwords in effect.  Threat level 5+:  Constant communication between every team member and a relay in the operations room is implemented, complete with passwords and personal passwords.  Threat level 9+:  Nonlethal shoot-on-sight implemented for anyone who goes ‘dark’ for any period of time."
Parahumans,35402g,vivomancer,6,Thu May 7 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"Is the power permanent? Either way, I'd give it a trump rating of at least 5."
Parahumans,35402g,Igigigif,2,Wed May 6 22:35:21 2015 UTC,Each power can be held onto indefinitely.
Parahumans,35402g,Littlerob,4,Wed May 6 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"More than one power at a time? If yes: Trump 8  If no: Trump 5  But really, it depends on what you mean by 'inverse'. What would happen if they touched, say, Lung? Or Contessa?"
Parahumans,35402g,Littlerob,3,Wed May 6 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Only one at a time, inverse is pretty vague but can have some seriously bad or good affects, with Lung's his durability and strength would begin strong, but as the fight wore on it would wane, with hydro or cryokinesis as well. Contessa's inverse would be to be able to see what could have happened if different choices were made in the past.  EDIT  An example of a bad one would be Eidolon's, gain the powers least useful in a situation."
Parahumans,35402g,NamedByAFish,3,Wed May 6 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah, Trump 4, maybe 5 at a push to account for unpredictability. Probably with an addendum on which power he was last seen using."
Parahumans,35402g,Littlerob,2,Wed May 6 22:50:37 2015 UTC,"How exactly would he manage the opposite of Master powers? Like, what's Skitter-1 or Regent-1 ?"
Parahumans,35402g,Iconochasm,3,Wed May 6 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Something I thought about a bit, I thought maybe a Master specific control negation field. Really useful if fighting the person who you stole the power from, but otherwise pretty useless."
Parahumans,35402g,GreatWyrmGold,10,Wed May 6 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"To diverge from the specific topic question slightly, I must say I like the idea of this cape (let's call him Anathema, because I have no idea what name you came up with and it sounds cool in my head) gaining powers basically designed as a hard-counter to whichever parahuman he's touched, generally through riffing on their own abilities. I like it more than the very nebulous and open to interpretation 'inverse of their power' thing, because obviously there's a lot of powers that don't have an opposite and you basically end up grasping at straws on a case-by-case basis. Instead, Anathema would be a fantastic foil to a lot of capes and work really well as an antagonist to prompt teamwork and cooperation in the cast if you were writing him (if he touches you, he gains powers that let him basically shut you down, but that leaves him open for the rest of your team to take him down).  Example: He takes the place of Taylor in her first outing. He tags Lung, and gains a similar regenerating-brute package, except instead of pyrokinesis he gains an ability to absorb and redirect the energy used by other parahumans. So now Lung's scaling regeneration is turned against him, and the extra mass and energy it's trying to pump into Lung is instead being snatched away to buff Anathema. Lung gets knocked down in fairly short order when he fails to get back up after being smashed into a wall, but suddenly, bam, Undersiders!  The power Anathema's cribbed from Lung is great against Rachel's dogs - she tries to buff them, he steals the fuel for the buff and uses it to power himself up further. So Grue blankets the whole area in darkness, and the energy-dampening effect of that is screwing with Anathema's absorption and now he can't see and Grue's got him in a  full nelson or something, so he tags Grue instead. He loses the vampiric-regenerating-brute power and gains the ability to solidify areas of darkness around him (the darker it is the harder the resulting construct, with daylight being nonexistent and pitch black being a top notch forcefield), as well the ability to see through it. Now Grue is basically out of the fight, because all his power does now is provide Anathema with more material and area for his new forcefield constructs, but oh wait, Regent's on the scene and suddenly it's jazz hands and stumbles all around while those damned dogs come back in to play because even if they can't see him they can still smell him. Now Anathema's hard pressed to keep his darkness-based forcefields between him and the dogs, and Grue's withdrawing his power so he's got less and less darkness to work with and those forcefields are getting weaker and weaker... so he jumps up and tags Rachel, gaining the ability to take strength from those around him, weakening and withering them to the point where they're (physically) waifs. This lets him debuff the hellhounds back to exhausted dogs, wear down Grue and start putting the beatdown back on the team - or it would if it wasn't for bloody Regent taking his legs out from under him and zapping him with a taser, since Tattletale's worked out what's happening with the power changing and warned him not to make physical contact.   And now I kind of want to write that story."
Parahumans,35402g,Plecky,2,Thu May 7 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"Ooh thanks for the input. I've been tossing around the idea of this character for about a week and have thought about how abstract the idea of the ""inverse to a power"" is. I definitely considered it being a power designed as a counter to the touched, but again it is pretty open to interpretation, there are multiple interpretations of a ""counter"" to a power. Also, it seemed a bit overpowered to be able to 1v1 almost any other parahuman effectively.  I ended up settling on the idea of inversion mostly because the effects of it would be highly relative to what the shard interprets as the opposite of a power. Therefor inverting another power is a gamble that could yield good or bad results.  But seriously that fight felt really cool  Please do write a story about it :D"

Lung, I'd have some kind of firefighting effect, linked with an ability to make a touched target less resilient/weaker (strength of this ramps up in proportion to threat/length of fight). Alternatively have a powerful weakening effect which ramps down over time/re-uses.  Contessa, without utterly breaking her powers/ability to function, best choice would be having the power to see the 'Path to Failure' - aka ""What do I need to do to sabotage the actions this person is taking against me?"" or some form of this as a thinker power that lets you stalemate Contessa, but not win or lose"

Yes, the abilities the host has will branch off as the shard breaks certain restrictions and shuffles others around, but it's at the cost of some serious and scarring mental anguish.  Grue is the perfect example: he got his powers, and they left him slightly messed up but functional. He's got a thing about protecting and providing, and a compulsion to be the one in charge because he's convinced that if he isn't then it'll all just go to shit. Then he triggered again, got a high-level trump twist on his powers as his shard shifted from dampening powers to actively copying their effects as a self-defence mechanism, and gained a heaping helping of severe depression in the bag, which bounced off his preexisting issues and left him trapped in a spiral of 'need to be a leader for them or things will be ruined, can't be a leader because I've already ruined it'. It took him weeks if not longer to start to get over that second trigger, and he never did make it all the way. Dude got seriously screwed in the brain.  As a rule of thumb, n character should EVER want to have a second trigger. Their first one was already, by definition, the worst experience of their lives.

She could do other things outside the game her power tells her to do to win, but with just the base game she would go into a draw against most Thinkers.  In a Coil Vs.

If she fails to win it'll be a stalemate. Assuming both Coils actually play chess at the same time and rebranch every time something goes wrong there will eventually be some error coil wasn't aware of, after all, he isn't going to be absolutely perfect at chess while Contessa, thanks to path to victory, (I mean, she used it to figure out how to fix a helicopter thing, she can use it to master chess as long as there is a possibility she'll win, which given that Coil isn't perfect and probably can't store all the possible chess layouts in his memory due to being human) is. Coil can be foiled quite nicely with subtlety, and he can't exactly milk Dinah for advice on how to beat Contessa without asking about every possible winning strategy, and even then the odds will change due to him knowing and Contessa's power knowing he knows. Alternatively, let's assume Coil has a magical perfect memory and can afford to sit down for an absurd amount of time not doing anything while his alt universe self runs through all possible iterations of the game. Unless there's one particular game plan that can never be beaten by any strategy, Contessa's plan will evolve with his, always giving her an advantage. For coil to win he'd have to have other thinker powers that he doesn't   What I want to see is Tattletale Vs Contessa in a chance-based game such as Hanafuda."
Parahumans,35114d,Plecky,6,Wed May 6 11:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think you may have missed an important component to it - if Coil can arrange to be playing White in one universe and Black in the other, he can effectively make Contessa play against herself by mirroring her moves from the other timeline.

Player A goes first in game 1 and second in game 2, and by playing Player B's strategy she can assure at least one win. Using Coil's power makes it into just one game that Player A wins from Player B's perspective. Fun experiment!"
Parahumans,35114d,AerosolHubris,2,Wed May 6 10:05:31 2015 UTC,"At best for Coil he would draw as he can only co opt her in one timeline, because contessa's power is active in both timelines they would work against each other to a stalemate.  Of course Contessa's PtV means she could never be manipulated into working against herself in either timeline so she would win regardless."
Parahumans,35114d,TyrialFrost,3,Wed May 6 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"That depends on whether chess has an absolute strategy (i.e. is truly winnable in an absolute sense) or is a tie game. That remains to be determined. If it's winnable, like checkers or Nim, then it's either a first player game or a second player game, and Contessa will win in one timeline, therefore Coil will win in the other. If it's a tie game, like Tic-Tac-Toe, then Contessa will tie in both games and so will Coil."
Parahumans,35114d,AerosolHubris,2,Wed May 6 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely that Contessa's PtV reaches across both timelines, and if it's not possible to 'win', will still seek to achieve the best-possible result. In this case, a Tie is better than a loss, so both timelines would cooperate to force a tie."
Parahumans,35114d,lithas,2,Wed May 6 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Note that Coil explicitly does not create timelines. His power is just precognition with a few twists (according to word of God, I think), so Contessa's power would take priority over it."

Parahumans,35114d,lithas,2,Thu May 7 22:58:34 2015 UTC,"I'll see if he can find it. In the meantime, I'm pretty sure this is how his power works:   Coil envisions 2 scenarios that differ based on his actions He looks ahead for x hours in order to decide which one is better Once he chooses one, he automatically acts out that set of actions And he can't use precog again until x hours have passed   Except Shard Mind Fuckery means he perceives it as 2 separate timelines. I assume he enters some sort of fugue state where his shard takes over and carries out his actions that he envisioned during the precog session, or some shit like that.  Edit: Found this thread, which also says that WoG says that Coil doesn't make universes. Still no source though."

He instantly perceives the full outcome of both sets of actions, then once he chooses to resolve one he goes 'fugue' for that amount of time... He essentially doubles and borrows his perceptions then has to pay back the loss.... interesting."
Parahumans,35114d,lithas,1 point,Fri May 8 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"Relevant link.  In retrospect, I may have rated Coil too low. I didn't think of that mirror strategy. But then again, it would work a lot less well if he was playing the same side in both universes - and he probably would be."

Parahumans,35114d,pseudonarne,2,Thu May 7 04:45:45 2015 UTC,"(irrelevant tangent but has anybody mentioned the theory that contessa's path to ""kill the second entity"" might be what locked scion into flipping out and needing killing in the firstplace?(even if you stopped it it found another way to happen with absolute certainty along a slower path) i mean cauldron capes pretty much made the s9 what it was and were instrumental in setting up that exact situation for jack to have an uninterruptible one on one chat with autistic superman (he even says that he'd only have bothered with that when trapped in grayboy(cauldron cape)'s time bubble due to his dislike of blank slates)  (similar to how scion maybe went ""let me see the other entity again"" and wound up finding her corpse and then getting bullied to death with her image)"

The vials themselves change significantly based on the kind of person they attach to. Powers change to fit their host. The Triumvirate are unique because of the exact personality and situation each individual was in when they drank their vial. Cauldron could not intentionally make more of them. One of Contessa's blind spots was what powers would come out when anyone drank. She could instantly find out after the fact, but until they drank it was guess work.    Could Cauldron know more about a buyer's powers (besides the true origin, of course) than the buyer knows, even after getting used to the power?   Generally speaking, yes. Even if they didn't from research, Contessa would find out almost immediately.  ...except there was that awkward little bit with Mantellum so it is possible."

As much as anything he's a force multiplier of epic proportions, because his redirection of other powers ignores limitations. If he rerouted Oni Lee to appear inside of a person, Oni Lee would appear inside of that person despite his Manton limit. It would be more expensive than normal redirection, sure, because his power has to pick up more of the slack, but it would happen.  Also, shameless plug for /r/OCPresentation if you or anyone else is looking to make characters. It's a nice place, if a little dead recently."

Their powers will also develop subtle changes with prolonged exposure to the field, making the previous methods of countering them ineffective and replacing them with different weaknesses. These subtle changes are permanent, although the power/control tradeoff ends upon leaving the field."
Parahumans,3506zv,Whispersilk,3,Sat May 9 00:02:16 2015 UTC,There's a reason they're called Trumps.
Parahumans,3506zv,ThatOtherGuy15,3,Wed May 6 16:35:55 2015 UTC,What was her trigger event?
Parahumans,3506zv,Plecky,4,Wed May 6 05:04:19 2015 UTC,"too public to be avoided.   I haven't written it yet. I'm not sure how I want to handle it, but it definitely got her national attention in a bad way and made her fight to get a good image. Part of that good image was not separating her cape identity from her civilian identity."
Parahumans,3506zv,Plecky,5,Wed May 6 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Does she have any sort of social or personal life? Her having no secret identity is undoubtedly going to throw some degree of possible danger on her teammates and especially any civilian contacts - family, friends, or close acquaintances. The odds of there being real danger to them may be low, but all it would take to get them killed is one dumb person with a grudge and too little regard for their own life."
Parahumans,3506zv,Plecky,2,Wed May 6 05:31:45 2015 UTC,"My flimsy excuse so far is that she spends most of her free time on ""training"" her power. She knows that she can be so much better, and she's trying to figure out how. As a result, she spends most of her time in and out of costume around her teammates, who remain in costume in public. She basically lives in the local PHQ anyway, so personal life isn't a big factor.  The only real danger is to people she was close to before her trigger. As you said, it just takes one dumb person with a grudge... I'm not sure how to handle that."
Parahumans,3506zv,Plecky,2,Wed May 6 12:34:55 2015 UTC,Sounds very interesting.
Parahumans,3506zv,blames_irrationally,2,Wed May 6 05:22:39 2015 UTC,"Tell me, is she immune to poison?  Because I made a guy an S-class cape that was, unfortunately, hampered by their decision to play the hero.  EDIT: Oh, and how does flesh-eating mould fare?"
Parahumans,3506zv,blames_irrationally,2,Wed May 6 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"She is completely immune to everything that causes damage via kinetic energy. Everything else, and she has to rely on artificial means of protection. So no, she's not immune to poison.  The reason I call her broken is that her power doesn't really have an upper limit in terms of energy or precision. She can stop and reflect anything incoming that might be harmful (sort of like Accelerator from A Certain Magical Index, but it takes from her energy and only works on things with mass), but she hasn't reached the level of precision that would let her reflect liquids and gases. She'd also have to be completely calm and focused to even have a chance at pulling it off. If she did figure it out, that would make her effectively immune to poison. Poison has to reach her to be harmful.  Edit: Her answer to flesh-eating mold is combat precognition. Good luck hitting her with the mold (or poison, or any other non-physical attack for that matter).  The canon capes I know of off the top of my head who could beat Adamantine in armor are Narwhal (she can't counter forcefields that form in her body), Mantellum and similar Trumps, Eidolon if he uses his anti-Alexandria attack, maybe Scrub, and Legend. I believe Adamantine could beat Alexandria by holding her underwater and absorbing all of her kinetic energy when she tries to move, but Alexandria could beat Adamantine too so that doesn't mean much."
Parahumans,3506zv,blames_irrationally,2,Wed May 6 12:24:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, in that case said cape might be able to take her were he to succumb to the Simurgh.  The guy hasn't thought of a name yet (but given that he's unlikely to join in on Weaverdice when I give it a go I might just tweak this guy a bit).  Anyway, long story short the power is a Brute/Shaker hybrid with the power to summon fungi and rot in the are around himself, this area slowly gets larger and can extend to at least city wide. He can't actually turn off the power but can probably amp up how much he summons. This sounds kind of mild until you consider that he can eat anyone in his radius alive, expose people to toxic spores and cause buildings to collapse. His secondary power is regeneration with the rate increasing according to the amount of decay around him.  Meanwhile I have an ex-ward character who probably would be beaten up by Adamantine, though I'm not certain."
Parahumans,3506zv,blames_irrationally,2,Wed May 6 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"Well, you're right about him being an S-Class threat. Christ, that is a scary power.  It seems to me that Adamantine can completely beat down most capes who aren't Trumps or high-rated Brutes. Combat precognition lets her dodge Blasters and most combat Shakers, and she can make Strikers unable to hit her using cp or just by sapping their energy when they're about to hit her. Breakers are a bit of a problem because she can't land hits if they can take a form that ignores forces or is intangible, like Legend or Shadow Stalker."
Parahumans,3506zv,Plecky,2,Wed May 6 13:08:53 2015 UTC,"It really is kind of terrifying. It started off a lot milder but I wanted to see how far I could push them towards being an unwitting villain. Before long we just started trying to figure out if he could regenerate faster than a missile strike could kill him, and concluded that the solution to getting rid of them as a villain would just be to remove the city. The person it was made for insisted on being a hero though so he's currently a member of our Protectorate in the setting we're building up. Our heroes are so damn dysfunctional it's absurd. I'm thinking of uploading the cast once we've got enough characters designed.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure she'd beat the resident crazy lady in the characters (the ex-ward formerly known as Baton, the media calls her Bludgeon), her power is the ability to put invincibility on the surfaces of any object she holds below a certain size but only as long as she's holding them (i.e. nerfed Siberian), combined with a point blank TK that makes her unaffected by the weight of whatever she's holding as well as granting the ability to move the limbs holding it unnaturally fast. Her reaction times are also notable improved and held objects won't transmit force back to her, so entering close combat with her is usually a death sentence (or more likely you get beaten up really badly and she walks off a bit more cheerful). I think her best hope of surviving would be to internally explode a bunch of temporarily invincible grenades in a populated area, so she's carrying a bunch of explosives that will go off the instant someone manages to render her helpless, then just walk off. She'd be a lot nastier against people without kinetic energy manipulation though.  EDIT: Below a certain size does at least include motorcycle-sized objects in terms of what she can affect."

But Aegis is perfectly normal when he isn't injured, his body just responds to damage by repurposing other parts to take up the slack of the damaged parts.

Parahumans,350ypz,ThirdFloorGreg,1 point,Wed May 6 23:54:03 2015 UTC,Skitter has an always-on power as well.
Parahumans,350ypz,pendia,1 point,Thu May 7 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Aways-on was a bad choice of words. My point was nothing changes when it bends backward, it is simply exercising a capability that is always there. It is passive, though, not active like Skitter's power. You keep bringing up powers that do things. Backward bending joints isn't even really a power, it's a permanent physiological change. Contessa couldn't remove it with bullet brain surgery, it requires no connection to that shard. During the trigger event, the body changes, and from then on it is different."
Parahumans,350ypz,ThirdFloorGreg,2,Thu May 7 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"It could be a physical change, or it could be sort of breaker state where elbows etc are allowed to self-intersect, or it could be a subconscious changer ability rotating bones or otherwise modifying the body so that it can bend joints as needed.  It's the ""ability to bend their joints in any direction"", rather than ""your joints bend in any direction"". The mechanism of which is what determines the power classification."
Parahumans,350ypz,pendia,1 point,Thu May 7 01:35:55 2015 UTC,The way powers typically work in Worm pretty much only allows the permanent change.
Parahumans,350ypz,ThirdFloorGreg,3,Thu May 7 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"Marquis has bone control. If he tried, he could probably rotate his bones, allowing his joints to bend at weird angles. He might run into some problems with tendons or something, but it isn't a huge stretch to see him with this thing as a secondary benefit of his power (perhaps with some localized tendon control or something). Marquis is a changer and not a case 53, so this power could be classified as changer.  Also, Shadow Stalker can walk through walls. One could imagine that a cape would be able to turn, say, only their elbow into a ""shadow"" state, and could allow them to bend their joints at weird angles. Shadow stalker is a breaker, and not a case 53, so this power could be classified as breaker."

Although they don't seem to know of Cauldron, seeing as Purity didn't go to them for Theo.    Maybe Eden and scion just had similar shards. Like they both had PTV variants."
Parahumans,34yvrp,gammaway,2,Tue May 5 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"So, quick thought. What would happen if someone with a non-triggered shard like Theo had a dose of a cauldron formula? Is it possible that the shards would interact? Double unique trigger? No effect?"
Parahumans,34yvrp,fabio-mc,9,Tue May 5 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"IIRC Dr. Mother was talking about how she hadn't taken a formula because she had the potential to trigger naturally.

Or maybe Wildbow will give us a double triggered cape in Worm 2."
Parahumans,34yvrp,fabio-mc,2,Tue May 5 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I seem to remember Dr. Mom drinks one and nothing happens because she already had a shard."

A case 53 happens because the dead shard doesn't have the safeguards that prevent appearance alteration, it wouldn't make sense to have a higher likelihood of case 53 because of a double shard. Maybe death, but not case 53, I think."
Parahumans,34yvrp,fabio-mc,4,Wed May 6 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"In Scion's or Eden's interlude, they mention splitting and combining shards.  Basically, a non-triggered shard + Eden shard = combination that doesn't work right."
Parahumans,34yvrp,SpareLiver,3,Wed May 6 02:50:14 2015 UTC,Dr Mother specified that untriggered capes have a higher likelihood of being Case 53s I believe if they take Cauldron vials. I'm not certain why but it was stated.

Parahumans,34y8cd,ThatOtherGuy15,16,Tue May 5 17:25:01 2015 UTC,Let's consider how that scene might go.   GreatWyrmGold double-checks the title to make sure spoilers are kosher. Scion rips Alexandria to pieces. Pretender pops out of Alexandria's body. Scion reacts. ??? Pretender is okay.
Parahumans,34y8cd,GreatWyrmGold,15,Tue May 5 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"We don't know the mechanics of Pretender's powers. For instance is it striker based or blaster based? Does he have to touch his original body to return or can he just “realease"" the meat puppet body and return to his original body? If it's the latter then Pretender could still be alive....So all I'm saying is that there could be a small chance that Pretender is still alive....and I though his character and power was really cool, plus I'm totally shipping Satirical and Pretender (Pretendercal?

Parahumans,34y8cd,ThatOtherGuy15,9,Tue May 5 18:05:19 2015 UTC,She's such a bitch that Wildbow killed her twice.
Parahumans,34y8cd,blames_irrationally,8,Tue May 5 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I may be in the minority, but I hated Alexandria from the start.  Seeing her die twice, especially since Skitter killed her once, was amazing."
Parahumans,34y8cd,NamedByAFish,9,Tue May 5 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"From the introduction of her existence (Alexandria lunchbox with two grand cash) or from the introduction of her character (Leviathan fight)? Because if you hated her right from the lunchbox, that's weird. But if you hated her in the Leviathan fight, I can understand that. I mean, here we have this indestructible flying genius who can barely do anything to Leviathan besides piss him off. She could be holding up buildings or helping evacuate injured capes, but what is she doing? Flying though puddles and sissy-slapping the big bad.  At least Legend and Eidolon actually do something productive in that fight."
Parahumans,34y8cd,ThatOtherGuy15,10,Tue May 5 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, didn't she almost die in that fight by being drowned? Alexandria's behaviour just seems overly aggressive and reckless, not to mention suicidal. She deliberately gets skitter angry and then she casually mentions that she's not really that invincible and that she still needs to breathe. Why would she do that unless she wanted to die."
Parahumans,34y8cd,NamedByAFish,10,Tue May 5 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, she did almost drown to death against Leviathan. I don't think that would have been her first time, either. As to her aggressive and reckless behavior, there are two explanations:   One: Alexandria wants to die. She doesn't like the empire she's helped to build and is helping to support (Cauldron), and the only out she sees is death. Some people go so far as to say the interrogation was an intentional ""suicide by Skitter"" on Alexandria's part. I don't agree with this, because it seems to change the character presented in the story to a much softer person. Two: Alexandria thinks she's invincible. Her attitude certainly shows it, and her track record seems to support it (save the Siberian incident and a few drowning sessions with the Big Fish). But six or seven counterexamples aren't going to sway someone whose response to getting hit by a freight train would be to hit it back, harder. As far as mentioning her fatal weakness, that's characteristic narcissistic hubris. Alexandria didn't think Skitter could touch her, and Skitter proved her wrong in the most bad-ass fit of rage since the Hulk. This is the theory I subscribe to."
Parahumans,34y8cd,Ridtom,2,Tue May 5 20:02:13 2015 UTC,"Well, one is partially true.  She hated what Cauldron (and herself) had to do and had to be talked into staying after Heroes Death, as tated in her Interlude.  She does believe the Protectorate as a whole is a force for good and actually looked forward to working with Skitter (once they had her in custody).  So both interpretations can work really. I actually liked her character but I'm the minority of that opinion."
Parahumans,34y8cd,blames_irrationally,4,Tue May 5 23:34:45 2015 UTC,"Leviathan fight, definitely not the lunchbox."
Parahumans,34y8cd,HarbringerOfNumbers,5,Tue May 5 19:26:00 2015 UTC,"I actually found her second death scene way more satisfying. It wasn't anything specific wrong with the first one, it's just that descriptions of events from the bugs' points of view always seems to analytical.  The second time around there was much more of a sense of wonder at exactly how crazily tough she was."
Parahumans,34y8cd,NamedByAFish,5,Tue May 5 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"I was a bit disturbed by both, to be honest. Such an intimate description of the end of a life... but she deserved both, so I'm not complaining. The first death was very good in context. Skitter is going off the hook, and her bugs are probably the only thing in the world keeping her sane after Alexandria ""kills"" two of her teammates. So she focuses on them, and we get a very precise description of spider silk and insects being jammed into Alexandria's lungs.  The second death, admittedly, was much more impressive. Scion just used a continent-buster level attack on her, and not only is there still enough of her for her skull fragments to be annoying, but her skull fragments annoy a being with god-like levels of destructive power. Fuckin' A, she's durable. Double-dead, but durable."

When I was in third grade, we had combined gym with the special ed classes, which went up to 7th grade. A special needs girl who had already started puberty pinned me down and drooled on my face and chest while asking if I would kiss her. I saw two teachers standing still, no idea what to do, not moving to help me. Other kids laughing. I eventually wiggled out on my own and they separated us as if it was my fault too.   I remember knowing that it wasn't her fault, and even knowing why the teachers weren't jumping to my aid. I understood, but that really didn't do anything to help the feeling of helplessness   It doesn't seem like a big deal when I write it out and it's embarrassing that it still gets to me, but try to remember that I was a little kid, physically overpowered by a kid who has hit puberty, being what I saw in my young mind as sexually propositioned while the authorities watched and felt too awkward to act.

Parahumans,34y02j,ughzubat,4,Tue May 5 17:50:25 2015 UTC,"They just stood by and WATCHED? If that's the case, those teachers can just fuck off. Something similar happened to me (no, it isn't my trigger event) and very little happened to said student. Best I can say for the teachers is that they didn't witness the event, but they fucked up in other ways after I came forwards. Kind of soured my relations with them afterwords."
Parahumans,34y02j,mexicanweasel,4,Tue May 5 17:50:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but what were they going to do? Grab a mentally disabled girl by her shirt collar and haul her off? Spray her with water like a cat? Truly a lose-lose."

Parahumans,34y02j,SometimesATroll,21,Tue May 5 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"I was in the eye of hurricane Katrina where it hit the shore.  Pretty much everything I owned was destroyed.  I don't think it would have been enough for a trigger on it's own.  Isolation is a necessary factor and I was with my family at the time, who all survived.  If this takes place in the Worm-verse, though, I think we can safely assume that things would not go so well.  I was 12 at the time.  I'm thinking water or wind based shaker powers."
Parahumans,34y02j,natsugo,6,Wed May 6 07:33:32 2015 UTC,Damn. I'm sorry to hear that. Pretty badass Shaker powers seem in order there.

Everyone I knew survived, I wasn't in the house at the time, and we were able to leave as soon as the roads emptied of water a few days later.  Several thing would have had to go much worse for this to be trigger event worthy."
Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,16,Tue May 5 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"Mine would have been when I was five or six years old. I was at my grandmas house playing by her pool with no one watching me, with the screen covering the pool. I fell in, and the screen wrapped around me, keeping me from swimming to the surface. I lay thrashing at the bottom of the pool, seeing my dog standing on the side of the pool. I had always thought of my dog as sort of a second mother, so I, being a small child, was hurt and confused that she wasn't jumping in to save me.   I think this trigger would have either brought on a water related Mover power due to the desire to escape, or a Master power due to being abandoned by my dog."

Parahumans,34y02j,natsugo,8,Tue May 5 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"I'm, thinking Master 6 - the ability to temporarily mutate non-human animals into humanoid minions.

You could possibly couple this with hydrokinesis to make a kind of Anti-Burnscar."

The worst part of it wasn't the random pains in my gut or the moments of nauseousness, or the fainting. It was being stuck in a hospital bed getting hungry, feeling tired, and only having my thoughts to preoccupy my time with."
Parahumans,34y02j,Wyntonian,7,Tue May 5 16:50:57 2015 UTC,Wow. That sounds the part. What do you think it would have resulted in? Master? Thinker?
Parahumans,34y02j,blames_irrationally,6,Tue May 5 15:57:38 2015 UTC,Probably some kind of Thinker/Striker mix.
Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,5,Tue May 5 16:11:38 2015 UTC,That sounds like the kind of combination that would be very unpleasant in an enemy cape.

Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,10,Tue May 5 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Eh I've shared mine before, I don't mnid sharing it again.    Senior year of high school was the worst year of my life.  I had been dating a girl for about a year prior, and we had an ugly break up.  The fights that resulted split our mutual friends in two, and this included me losing my best friend, who took her side.    Additionally, I have never been close to my immediate family, as we have some strong fundamental differences.  An exception was my grandmother, who I felt I could truly confide in when I needed to talk. Unfortunately, my grandma has dementia, and senior year is when it progressed to the point where she could no longer recognize me.    So dealing with the loss of these people sent me into a very dark period, where I considered dark things that are really dumb.  Months later, I was diagnosed with depression, which explains my thoughts at the time.     Meanwhile, I was losing interest in my own life.  My grades plummeted in some classes I bothered to go to, and some days I just didn't show up.  I would drive around for hours at a time, get a call from my mom saying the school had called, and just hang up. I stopped talking to most of the friends who still talked to me, I just didn't see the point of having friends anymore.  One night, I was considering something very dumb, and while I don't feel comfortable sharing the exact details, I'd say the only reason I'm alive today is a friend of mine called me.  I broke down on the phone, and with her help, I rebounded from the worst period of my life.  My trigger probably would have occurred right before she called.  With the feelings of isolation and panic, I'd probably trigger with a Master power."
Parahumans,34y02j,LigerZeroSchneider,10,Wed May 6 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"Well, this is pretty personal but I'm better with telling this to people now. Advanced warning though, it was bullying related, although at the time I convinced myself that this wasn't that bad for bullying (in all honesty, I don't know how bad it actually was).  As for the event itself, one day in the morning tutorial class of my second or third year of secondary (high) school the teacher decided to put on a dance video (""Follow the leader"" I believe, though I can't remember what was on it) and, under the assumption that this wasn't optional (I was literal like that) I eventually worked up the confidence and joined in with everyone else, despite hating dancing (the previous time I'd been made to dance for a ball thing I let myself collapse to the floor and was escorted out for the rest of the ball so I could calm down) or doing anything that personal in front of a crowd. After a bit I noticed that someone had decided not to join in and was sitting there recording me on their phone, as it seems I'd worked up a reputation as an amusing target. I, quite typically for myself asked for them to stop and was ignored. A little bit (possibly a few days) later people I knew would mimic a small dance when I walked by and I found out that someone had uploaded the video to youtube under the nickname my PE (gym) teacher had given me. Given how private I was I freaked out at this, and eventually pretty much everyone in my year had seen it. This was kind of made worse by the fact that in my first year or so I'd asked someone not to hit me on the head, as I'd read that it killed brain cells and I quite liked my brain cells being alive, I was of course ignored and it became a habit for random people to slap me on the head whenever they saw me. My requests for the video to be taken down were ignored (and I was told it had been taken down, only for new people to watch the video and mock me) and eventually (possibly about a year later), a girl (I still don't know who she was, though I have suspicions) in my class told my uncle about it and he told my mum. By this point a really large chunk of the school danced and/or hit me when they saw me. If hadn't of triggered in the first instance I would have then, as I had a huge anxiety spike waiting for her to come home and freak out about all the bullying I never mentioned out of fear of exactly that sort of reaction (I couldn't deal with other people being massively outwardly emotional).  Um, sorry for the huge block of text (and the excessive explanations), but there was a reasonable amount of backstory and it's worth noting that I couldn't touch youtube or stand being on the camera end of a phone for years after the initial event.  As for powers, the initial event would probably be a stranger or a (less-likely) tinker power, although the latter could be a stranger or mover power. I'll leave it to the subreddit to decide. I can't remember which event hit me the hardest at the time but the former was definitely the most traumatic and left me the most jaded."
Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,7,Tue May 5 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds hellish, and don't worry about the backstory, it just made it all more relatable. I think probably a Stranger power centered around vanishing from the perceptions of hostile entities, or being impossible to perceive or record using technology? I'm not sure what others will come up with though!"
Parahumans,34y02j,Pseudointellectualis,3,Tue May 5 16:39:22 2015 UTC,"I was considering some sort of stranger power somewhere between Imp and Nice Guy, if only because I always forgot the names of people or who was who, I went through most of school without being able to recognise my whole class it seems (I had a great memory for facts, just not people), but possibly with some form of power incontinence, making it even harder for me to actually interact consistently with people, I mean, if we're going for the whole ironic echo thing. But yeah, those are cool."
Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,4,Tue May 5 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"If were going shards give you what you need not what you want.  Some form of persuasion based powers making your suggestions seem reasonable, subjects undertake the command without thinking it was their own idea.  Since your a natural trigger, you get  some limits to keep you safe, say a key phrase like ""Could you please"" must precede every command.  Master rating 6-8 depending on how specific/vague you can get with commands how long term the actions can be.    Cape name is Simon says/Mother may I something like that"
Parahumans,34y02j,Pseudointellectualis,2,Tue May 5 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"This is actually really powerful, and it could essentially come across as Valefor lite, or better depending on quality of use, so it probably requires a little bit of tweaking, maybe with a little bit of stranger focus to reduce the sheer controlling power but focus on the evasion aspect or something. Cool suggestion though."
Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,3,Tue May 5 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah you would be easier to counter one on one and can't set trigger events but are a nightmare in a crowd.  I was thinking about adding some stranger, but to quote Wildbow ""if your trigger is getting punched in the face and your power is any armor plated face your a twat"", I couldn't think of something relevant without being a twat."
Parahumans,34y02j,Pseudointellectualis,2,Tue May 5 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking of the same sentiment actually, and the one regarding internal impressions reflecting a lot of the power. I see what you mean though. Hmm... Of course, if it's anything like Valefor there should be strangery ways to use it.  Fun fact, my friends automatically distrust 99% of what I say in trading card games because I'm prone to selective suggestions that, although true give the reaction I want. We tried a 5 player game once, I won by getting everyone else to wipe each other out."
Parahumans,34y02j,MinecraftMike16,2,Tue May 5 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"Your problem didn't seem to be getting slapped in the head or being recorded, it was no one listened to you.  Now boom everyone listens to you.  A lot of your power depends on how far you can push. Valefor levels and the ability to affect multiple people at once would be scary.  Below that still scary just not evacuate the area scary.  Sounds like you would be pretty scary with it then.  It would be really easy to recognize yourself having out of character thoughts, so overemphasizing certain aspects is definitely how you affect those trained to recognize mental manipulation."
Parahumans,34y02j,MinecraftMike16,2,Tue May 5 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, hence my perspective on that being the literal one, although I probably just skipped a step due to tiredness. Yeah, this would be pretty awesome though in terms of versatility, although it would be easy to get guilty about using a master power like this one. Still better than a lot of them though."
Parahumans,34y02j,Nexushawk,6,Tue May 5 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"Got mugged by a group of guys when I was like 13 or 14 along with my friend. I was quite a bit bigger than my friend so they didn't really focus on me, but they did knock my friend to the pavement and began wailing on him with kicks and punches. I just froze up and stood there while one of the guys punched me and tried to get my phone. To this day I still loath myself for not doing SOMETHING when all of this went down. Thankfully my friend made it out with no lasting injuries but seeing him helpless on the ground is an image that still sticks with me. Not sure if this would really qualify as a trigger since it wasn't really my own safety that was in danger but rather my inability to help my friend."
Parahumans,34y02j,pitaenigma,4,Tue May 5 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"That more than qualifies as a trigger, it's probably a mental power, likely a thinker power or something."
Parahumans,34y02j,blames_irrationally,4,Tue May 5 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense. Maybe stranger as well, or blaster since there was a group of guys that attacked us. And as much as I hate to acknowledge it maybe mover as well, since running was what I eventually did...  Edit: So I actually began thinking about this since it sort of works as a way to work through the memories and this is what I came up with. Richochet: Mover, Thinker. Capable of short dashes of up to 5 meters at high speeds. During these dashes he has increased durability and striking power. Should he hit an object during the dash he ""bounces"" of it, resetting the dash as well as gaining increased speed and range with harder hitting punches. Whenever he touches a person during these dashes (i.e punches) he immediately returns to normal speed, however the touch still retains the kinetic energy he had during the dash which means that it hurts quite a bit.  His thinker power is basically increased reaction speeds during dashes coupled with select clarvoyance. This means that he can focus on an action from either himself or someone else, he is then able to view the different results of these action depending on the change on a give number of variables. For example: If a ""bounce"" was the selected action he would change a few variables, like the angle of impact and the movement of his opponenents in order to determine the appropriate action. However the results of this clarvoyance becomes less and less clear with an increased number of variables, which is why he preferably uses it on his relatively simple dashes.   I thought that this powerset would be pretty accurate to the trigger. When it happened I really wish that I had been a bit more aware of my surroundings (walking through a rough part of the city, not paying any attention to the group of guys approaching) which makes the thinker power pretty appropriate. And the offensive mover power would pretty accurately sum up my 14-year old self's desire of running away but still  wanting to help my friend. I might be completely off on this however."
Parahumans,34y02j,pitaenigma,3,Tue May 5 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really awesome power, it would let you bounce between a couple of buildings to scale them or to power up massively, which combined with his thinker power would let him take out large numbers of people or travel absurd distances.  And yeah, at least you were both alright."
Parahumans,34y02j,blames_irrationally,2,Tue May 5 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was thinking that a reasonable weakness with this power would be that he loses accuracy and control with each bounce since more and more variables are added each time. That way he won't just be able to bounce indefinetely, maybe 2-3 times outside of extreme circumstances."
Parahumans,34y02j,Plecky,6,Wed May 6 11:13:55 2015 UTC,"Well, one Memorial Day weekend, I was going to a person's house for the first time. Their house had 3 floors, which were a basement, main floor, and upstairs. (The basement was built into a hill, so there was a door to the outside.) There was a huge Saint Bernard in the main floor, while the person we were going to see was in the basement. My mom and I walked onto the porch, waiting for the guy, who ended up going out the basement door, walking up and around to meet us on the porch. We talked for a second, while the dog was barking it's head off, before he told me to go right in. (I bet you can all see where this is going.) I opened the door, and BOOM! Dog biting my hand. Before I could react, he moved over to gnaw on  my arm, at which point my mom attempted to pull it off of my arm. Following that, she got a somewhat light bite on the stomach that just bruised. Went to the hospital after, and got a doctor who CLOSED THE PUNCTURE WOUNDS, which you aren't supposed to do. Also, he was cleaning them out AFTER the anesthesia wore off. After, the arm wound got infected, and had to get IV antibiotics for a week at the better hospital.  Probably would have been a physical power, I'm thinking Striker maybe?"
Parahumans,34y02j,pitaenigma,7,Wed May 6 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"Striker or Brute maybe - the danger was way up in your face, but the fact that you were injured and the dog was stronger was probably a big factor. Striker AND Brute would be badass."

Only left it when I started doing something after graduation and even then I had a hard time dealing with people for a few months and it took me a year to start eating normally again.  I was an overemotional shit in high school. Probably some form of master power. Those form from isolation right?  A comedic version- I have an intense fear of heights. A group of friends pretty much coerced me to go on the Fireball, a sort of slingshot that throws you around a hundred feet in the air. There's a tape circulating of me freaking out completely and a friend of mine sitting and laughing next to me."

Parahumans,34ycp8,THeWizardNamedWalt,3,Tue May 5 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at it.  August 6, 1945.   The war was coming to an end. The spirits could feel it. They felt a million connections pop into existence as their once proud town fell into the sights of their enemy. The spirits of the shrines and those that inhabited their objects steeled themselves. The humans they served went on their day. They went on their business if a little anxious about the coming day.   Up the coast, a radar pinged to signal the arrival of the Great Enemy's fleet. This wave passed, as many had in the past, after clearing the ground of any resistance. Then the weapon emerged. The spirits in Hiroshima felt a fear unlike any they felt before. The millions of connections focusing on a singular point above the city, 1,900 feet up. Time passed as slow as it ever has as the wind spirits tried desperately to blow this weapon off course, to slow it, to stop the slaughter of their people. They buffeted the plane and its cargo, not stopping until the detonation ripped apart their city, and with it, 80,000 individual souls.   Their ravished spirits cried out in anguish. The ambient radiation ripping, tearing at them as the land itself groaned, the city leveled. The spirits that govern the wind were blown far away, their essence scattered thin in their desperate attempt to stop this dreadful weapon. The spirits that inhabited the objects in the town, splintered, their own essence joining the humans souls in the air as they lamented their destruction.   Slowly, although to the spirits it was as if no time and an eternity had passed, they coalesced into something else. The irradiated area tearing into them, absorbing them even. They absorbed the energy of the bomb, the soul of it, and in turn were absorbed themselves. They grew bloated and fat, now strong enough to withstand the ambient energy in the air around them. They slaughtered each other. First 100, then 50, then 20, and finally 2. The two tore into each other, devouring the other, and finally settled into a final form.   They took the form of a man with tendrils of energy radiating from them in perfectly straight lines. The agonizing moans of the 80,000 dead echo within him. His body captures the essence of the Atomic bomb and its awesome destruction of Hiroshima. He wields an elemental power unlike any other, a power created by humans, and his very form reflects that. He contains the energy of the bomb that destroyed his people and affects the mortal realm by being an enormous source of radiation. His very presence tears spirits apart that are near him. He feeds on the accumulated power of all nuclear weapons, draining them slowly as he does.   This elemental man inhabits a forgotten monastery, the people seeking his advice in times of hardship. Their will must be tempered and tested before they step into his presence, lest they be destroyed as his people were.   This creature, this elemental, represents the ever present, ever destructive, fear of the human's nuclear arms. He follows his people and the destruction that created him, waking when another of his kind is going to be created, or when his city has been threatened as it was that day."

Appropriate solutions include suicide, pre-committing to incompetence, and summoning a bigger fish (biological fooming AI). Doom may be unavoidable because she is a retroactive threat. Death is boring, so let's just say it is a bad solution. In that case:  Contact PRT, explain my situation, and ask for a side-along teleporter, updates on Simurgh movement, about 10 tons of livestock at locations the teleporter can access, and planning help. Get teleported to livestock. Attempt to create copies of myself with my power (it worked for the S9000, and I'm not modifying myself). If successful, spread the copies out over the world using the teleporter, with instructions to commit suicide if influence by the Simurgh seems likely. If not successful, try to create copies of others and play hide-and-seek with the Endbringers. With these initial precautions in place:  0) Get secretaries and planners who can come up with good ideas and distill them into a to-do list. Get a list of capes with possible synergies, especially in the form of one-time enhancements. Dragon will probably fill the first two roles. They might come up with a different list, but the following seem important:   Try to enhance or create senses1 and intellectual abilities without changing the subject. After appropriate testing, be capable of turning normal humans into hyper-competent ones, and use this ability on PRT staff and capes, or design retroviruses which can cause these changes in future human generations, or even present ones. (Apparently humans are an unreliable source of AI foom, otherwise I would just make a biological AI). Soylent wheat - Grass which grows anywhere, which grows seeds which can be eaten raw by humans and provide perfect nutrition. (After consultation with ecosystems experts to make sure it doesn't grow out of control. If wheat is unreliable, use Soylent cows instead). More easily surviving CO2 capturing algae to undo/prevent climate change.  Bio-engineered trees and bamboo which grow quicker, have ideal grain structure, weird shapes, etc.. There's no reason rowboats shouldn't grow on trees. Also plants which perform any kind of biologically plausible chemical reaction, like hydrolysis, desalinisation, de-rusting, pigment production, etc. Retroviruses capable of delivering easily set dosages of medicine to patients' cells, or inserting arbitrary DNA codes. Discuss with biologists and medical specialists to find other good options for medical drugs.   [1] for example, eyes evolved for use under water.

Edit: Actually now that I think about it this is a really cool power. It would work subconsciously and only apply to your actions, and it wouldn't give you any information besides that fact that you would need this training at some point in the future. Maybe one day you get a feeling to start doing weird modified pull-ups, and then a month later you're hanging off a building using that exact sequence of muscles. Or invest a ton of time learning Russian just for some relatively unimportant event years later. Your power gives you way more promptings than you would ever have the time or inclination to follow, so you have to blindly pick which seems the most important (with some minor input from the intensity of the urge). If you were dedicated it would be a decent power, like a shitty Contessa. However, it wouldn't solve the laziness that triggered you in the first place (hey, it's why I'm here writing this too so I can be blunt), so there would be a lot of room for character growth."

Parahumans,34ucts,Alexemm,33,Mon May 4 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"Africa  Early in the story, Brockton Bay is described as a patchwork of nice and sketchy.  Africa is the same thing, but tends to veer from nice to desolate.  There's no balance and minimal boundaries - groups roam or get forced out and move to another area, people promise the moon only to become warlords, and there are a number of monsters akin to Ash Beast.  That said, Africa is a big, big place with a lot of variety, shouldn't be generalized, and there are stretches where things are as good as they are in the rest of the civilized world.  The cape dynamic is different, with a massive tendency towards mercenary work - relatively few groups larger than three individuals, but sometimes up to twelve or fifteen will work together on a short term basis before going their separate ways.  Parahumans don't tend to function well in larger groups (PRT and other Cauldron-assisted groups aside), but money is a great motivator toward teamwork.  Those who don't take money to use their powers will very frequently have a surprisingly hostile 'us vs. them' mentality, adhering to a faction or location, be warlords fighting for a place in a constantly shuffling battlefield, or both.  South America  That which is the case in America is almost the inverse in South America.  The government supports villains and heroes are working against the system and the general leaning of society to get a foothold.  They're frequently romanticized and played up, and image/public appeal is a weapon/propaganda tool/means of survival, when one might need frequent hiding places or assistance in getting shit done.  You know how Skitter dealt with the Mayor and Triumph?  That was business as usual in South America, if things weren't worse.  Then the local powers bent their heads and dropped to their knees and agreed to play ball.  There's a big divide between public and powers."

Has the power to control surface water and water in clouds. Can only control the liquid form of water. Was noticed by a local warlord and was forced to work for them. She is forced to use her powers to hold large areas of land ransom by dissipating clouds away from them or by threatening to flood areas. She has tried to escape many times but each time she has failed. Every time she was caught they would cut off a finger. She has lost 3 fingers so far.   Vrekmuis: Shaker (5?)   A local warlord who triggered when he was almost crushed in a riot. He has the power to create “waves"" of illness that gets more intense the closer you are to him and can cover an area of up to 2 city blocks. The effects of his powers cause symptoms of illness that he can control, up to and including headaches, nausea, projectile vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, muscle ache, cramps, migraines, etc. None of the effects are lethal but the closer you are and the longer you stay close to him the more intense you feel the symptoms and longer exposure can lead to permanent effects.    The Blessed One: Striker (2?) Master (5?)   Not much is known about the Blessed One and the area that he controls except that he is a White Afrikaaner in his late 40's. The Blessed One has started a cult around himself and insists that he is not a cape but rather that God has blessed him with powers, hence the name. His most “trusted"" followers are called The Blessed and they act as his “Ministers"" and his enforcers. The Blessed One can cause one of two effects on contact, feelings of intense euphoria or feelings of intense dread and depression. Those who experience the feelings of euphoria become addicted to it and to him to an extent and display all the signs and symptoms of a hard drug user. In the state of euphoria they are very suggestible and will do almost anything he says. Those that are the most suggestible become his Ministers. He punishes those who don't abide by his rule by giving them feelings of intense dread and depression and causing them to commit suicide.    Most of these capes triggered during the chaos of the attack by Moors Nag or during the evacuation attempts. After the attacks most rural areas and cities fell to chaos after large scale riots and looting, but the larger informal settlements and cities have a semblance of order. In Cape Town and other large cities in South Africa warlords control entire neighbourhoods and the police force is spread too thin to do anything meaningful to stop them. Not to mention that most people are very superstitious about capes in general. In most warlord controlled areas conditions are much better for people than outside. Some warlord controlled areas are open and people can travel freely while others like the one controlled by The Blessed One is closed off.

Having a solid metal exoskeleton might let you shrug off a hit if it absorbs/redirects the force around you while you remain stationary inside, and will mean that when you hit something it doesn't puncture or abrade your skin, but in a scenario where you're sent flying/falling, the problem is your own body weight smushing itself against the inside of the suit when you come to an abrupt halt."

I think it's pretty clear he just doesn't do the whole 'inertia' thing the same way everyone else does.  There may be some esoteric explanation, which probably involves his passenger working overtime in some complicated force-manipulation sham while we just see the end-result, or maybe his gear is distributing the force equally to every particle in his body, accelerating him without any danger of crushing, but it's within scope, regardless.  Hell, the fact that he got launched that far in the first place might be a clue that he only had a fraction of his normal mass at the time of impact.  Not that the whole thing isn't bullshit, but you know."
Parahumans,34to9e,Tarhish,6,Mon May 4 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"It is never disclosed what his Armor actually has the properties of, other than it being ""a virtual mountain of steel.""  Who's to say it isn't also as cushioning as a mountain of foam rubber?"
Parahumans,34to9e,mhd-hbd,3,Mon May 4 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"Worm often does play fast and loose with physics. ""Realistic"" is a decidedly relative word when it comes to superheroes, after all. Physics must inevitably be sacrificed in the name of awesome powers."
Parahumans,34to9e,AWorldW-OShrimp,3,Mon May 4 14:55:21 2015 UTC,"My guess, without knowing his exact capabilities (cape-abilities lol), is this. We can assume that since he got knocked so far, the armor's inertia wasn't in full effect. So what I see him doing is changing parameters just before impact to quickly increase the mass in how his suit interacts with the world. Done correctly, this would result in a massive speed drop to conserve momentum (or energy, either equation works.) and simply drop the last foot or two."
Parahumans,34to9e,tiny-alchemist,5,Mon May 4 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"Potentially lethal. Far from certain.  Maybe this happens a bit more in Worm than it would in reality, but it's still better than most fiction."

Parahumans,34to9e,munkeegutz,2,Mon May 4 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"Odds are good that he has SOME cushioning in his suit but not nearly enough. What we don't get to see afterwards is him limping to the nearest healer, barely able to stand.    Compared to some of the other high-toughness, we get a lot of scenes of Chevalier in the hospital. Some of that might be him being stubborn and getting others fixed before him, but some of that is probably also him barely being able to stand after getting smacked around."
Parahumans,34to9e,Valthek,21,Mon May 4 20:54:28 2015 UTC,"Chevvy's power is ""mash stuff of similar shape together and have the product have the properties of the components.""  His sword is a ceramic blade (for a superior edge,) a huge hunk of steel (for momentum,) and a titanium blade (for handling and flexibility.)  His armor is a ""mountain of steel."" But you never get to know what other things is in it.  If I was Chevvy, I'd go for:   A mountain of steel for protection and inertia. A similar amount of Lead for radiation proofing. Ceramic insulators for electrical protection. A faraday cage for EMP-protection. Teflon-coated for chemical hardening. A mountain of foam-rubber for impact-dampening. Titanium for light weight. Areogel for heat-shielding. Etc.   His armor is impossibly good, because it is explicitly bigger on the inside."

Take Canary though - she was mildly reluctant to fight, and that made her a huge outlier, given that nearly every other character continues to charge into fight after fight after fight.  Now, admittedly, that could be the passengers pulling shenanigans to make their hosts more conflict prone, or it could be that Taylor spends so much of her time fighting that we only see other people when they're fighting."

Canary is a case 53, therefore her shard is at least partially dead and jailbroken so this drive is diminished or lost."
Parahumans,34to9e,misterspokes,4,Mon May 4 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"There are a fair number of capes who lie low and don't get into much trouble. Taylor doesn't really notice them until she's Khepri-ing everyone. So not all parahumans charge into battle all the time.  I suspect there are passenger shenanigans involved with parahuman combat psychology, though. Maybe the deer-in-headlights reaction is replaced with immediate violence.  As for Canary, she was more than mildly reluctant to fight before getting Birdcaged. She was totally nonviolent. But time there would make almost anyone meaner."
Parahumans,34to9e,sanctaphrax,2,Tue May 5 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"Well it's exactly that. As it's been said, normal, happy, average Joes don't get shards or powers, unless from Cauldron.

Parahumans,34tfto,autowikibot,2,Mon May 4 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"Anopla:       Anopla are a class of marine worms of the phylum Nemertea, characterized by the absence of stylets on the proboscis, the mouth being below or behind the brain, and by having separate openings for the mouth and proboscis. The other class of Nemertea are the Enopla. Although Anopla is a paraphyletic grouping, it is used in almost all Scientific classifications. Anopla is divided into two orders: Palaeonemertea and Heteronemertea.  Palaeonemertea may be para- or polyphyletic, consisting of 3-5 groupings and totalling about 100 species. These worms have several apparently simple features and, as their name suggests, they are often considered to be the most primitive nemerteans. The primary body-wall musculature consists of an outer circular stratum overlying a longitudinal stratum. The group includes genera such as Cephalothrix in which the nerve cords are inside the body-wall longitudinal muscle, and Tubulanus, in which the nerve cords are between the outer circular muscle and the epidermis. Tubulanids are commonly encountered in rocky areas of intertidal zones in the northern hemisphere. They are often bright orange or have very distinctive banding and or stripes and can be many meters long, although only a few mm thick.  Heteronemertea is a monophyletic grouping of about 500 species, containing genera such as Lineus and Cerebratulus and including the largest and most muscular nemerteans. Almost all heteronemerteans have three primary body-wall muscle strata, an outer longitudinal, middle circular, and inner longitudinal. The lateral nerve cords are outside the circular muscle, as in palaeonemerteans, but separated from the epidermis by the usually well-developed outer longitudinal muscle.  A third subclass of Anopla called the Archinemertea was determined to be paraphyletic and is no longer used by most authors. A trace fossil genus called Archisymplectes from the Pennsylvanian found in central Illinois was formerly placed in this subclass, but is now considered a Palaeonemertea, if indeed it is an Anopla.

We know that at the start of Golden Morning, he was either powerful or lucky enough to survive the initial attacks, and that he was knowledgeable enough to find a portal to another world.

My guess is that Sleeper's main power is a Shaker-Breaker, with maybe a Master and/or Thinker subtype."
Parahumans,34rko9,NamedByAFish,2,Mon May 4 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"But... the word subsume was used by characters in reaction to Sleeper.  That means it could just be the Stranger effect at work. (For the record I agree with you on his actual power set, I just have more fun with the Stranger set)"
Parahumans,34rko9,thyrfa,6,Mon May 4 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Subsume is a pretty specific and uncommon word to be the result of fear. If it was the Stranger power at work, I'd expect a more generic word like absorb or consume.  I know most references to the Stranger power are tongue-in-cheek, I just like discussing it."
Parahumans,34rko9,NamedByAFish,5,Mon May 4 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, I would classify that as weak evidence against the Stranger theory.  It's possible that it's use is due to the effect, but I'd say it would be used more often in worlds with Sleeper having a more physical power than in ones where he has a Stranger effect.  People's general reactions to him could be either due to a Stranger effect or due to him being very powerful; there is no difference between the two states.  As such, yeah I guess there is SLIGHTLY more evidence that he isn't a Stranger, but honestly we have no basis to go off of lol."
Parahumans,34rko9,thyrfa,3,Mon May 4 04:16:13 2015 UTC,Stronger evidence against the Stranger theory is Wildbow's linked comment in the description. That's kinda hard to ignore.

Parahumans,34rko9,SnakeJerusalem,26,Mon May 4 01:09:14 2015 UTC,I think you missed a pretty big part of the end of the S9000 arc?
Parahumans,34rko9,misterspokes,6,Mon May 4 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"to be fair, it can sometimes be hard to keep track of what happens in intense fight scenes due to Wildblows writing style.  Multiple times throughout the series I was like ""wait, when the fuck did that happen?""  The part that sticks out the most to me is when Skitter was attacking the Governors house and 1 second she's on the street and the next she was getting kicked through a window or something.  Obviously I missed something, but that kind of thing happened more than a few times."
Parahumans,34rko9,HalbeardedDragon,3,Mon May 4 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"The only think I can recall from the end of that arc regarding Jack, is he being stuck on containment foam thanks to PRT agents. I can't recall him being carted out to another earth, nor being trapped in a time loop. I was under the impression that when he talked to Scion, that he was merely captured on containment foam.  In my defense, I distinctly remember being kinda sleepy while reading those interludes and feeling pretty confused during the Scion interlude."
Parahumans,34rko9,sanctaphrax,8,Mon May 4 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"Grey Boy nails him with his power the instant he stops being ""interesting"" this is AFTER he gets foamed and before he convinces Scion to go ham on the world"
Parahumans,34rko9,SexualPie,11,Mon May 4 18:45:29 2015 UTC,It's canon. It's all from the final interlude of that arc.
Parahumans,34rko9,sanctaphrax,7,Mon May 4 01:32:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Jack can beat anyone with shard abilities. Like, I wouldn't bet on him against the Ash Beast or Legend or Defiant. There just isn't anything he can do to hurt them, anything he can say to turn them, or anything he can do to escape them.  Number Man and Contessa have bad match-ups against him, though. And so do mentally weak characters like Grey Boy.  So even if Jack wasn't looped and contained, I doubt he could handle whatever the Sleeper does."
Parahumans,34rko9,SexualPie,3,Mon May 4 00:35:56 2015 UTC,Well he's a sniper right?  I think if he got the jump on them from a distance he could fuck  up Ash Beast or Defiant.
Parahumans,34rko9,sanctaphrax,5,Mon May 4 11:37:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, he could hit them both full force in the neck and do nothing."
Parahumans,34rko9,BlueberryPhi,3,Mon May 4 12:17:23 2015 UTC,i thought his implied power was much stronger than that?  Like he could effortlessly cut through walls and concrete and stuff.
Parahumans,34rko9,BlueberryPhi,3,Mon May 4 12:29:24 2015 UTC,"I don't remember anything like that, but you could be right.   He did cut through one of Parian's spider-silk dolls, IIRC. But I think he was using a Tinker-made sword for that. And when he cut Golem up, Golem was merely grievously wounded and not puréed.  So it's possible, but I don't think so.  If so, maybe he could take Defiant. But I'm pretty sure Ash Beast would laugh it off. Guy's very nearly an S-ranked threat, and through sheer brute force too."

Parahumans,34rko9,ughzubat,3,Mon May 4 00:41:27 2015 UTC,Does Wildbow actually have a power in mind?  Or just a level of destruction in mind?
Parahumans,34rko9,NamedByAFish,10,Mon May 4 00:46:23 2015 UTC,"Well, we can extrapolate from three things. One, when Sleeper entered one of the colony worlds that world was immediately written off in spite of that being thousands of people. Two, Khepri considered using Sleeper to fight Scion but decided it wouldn't be worth the effort; this in spite of being willing to invade China and kill Dragon for extra manpower. Three, Sleeper is always listed in the same category of ""well, we're fucked"" as the Endbringers.  Basically? Sleeper's not going down to chump change."

Parahumans,34rko9,SirKaid,2,Mon May 4 04:51:56 2015 UTC,That seems more a Master or Thinker power than Stranger.
Parahumans,34rko9,Gutzahn,2,Mon May 4 09:58:56 2015 UTC,"Nah, Stranger powers are often about sensory screwing and as a result contains some weird classifications. Possibly master/stranger if anything. August prince is one of the main examples here.  That said, his power just needs to be inconvenient enough for Khepri not to use him, she didn't act like he was that scary. So that theory really strikes me as unlikely (most people seem to use it jokingly anyway)"
Parahumans,34rko9,Plecky,2,Mon May 4 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"Actually we know that the Shaker has a chance of winning. That means, whatever his power is, it is weak against someone like Vista or Labyrinth."

Parahumans,34rko9,Whispersilk,2,Tue May 5 11:23:33 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the current issue in Jack's long-term plans, and ignoring his personality... Well, keep in mind he has an infinite range cutting edge (I wonder if it actually is infinite, if so it's kind of absurd. Even if it's just really long it's still kind of absurd). Sleeper would require a danger sense/precog, really obscure positioning, brute powers or constant reality warping to survive. The last one seems relatively likely so you can't really be sure. The main point is that if he wanted to go hurt sleeper and if he could, he could do it from quite a long distance away. Either way Jack would be able to walk away alive (unless this is denied by WoG, possibly to further shape our expectations of sleeper. Although given that slight chance a shaker had of surviving in that hypothetical situation which I don't know where it is, Jack should live), and therefore should have a non-zero chance of killing Sleeper with what we already know. Of course, this is all contingent on him walking, which won't be happening for a while."
Parahumans,34rko9,Plecky,6,Mon May 4 00:33:29 2015 UTC,His shard is the broadcast shard that the entities used to communicate with each other as they travel through space/alternate dimensions.

Parahumans,34pyrg,randolphkoma,47,Sun May 3 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"Another great piece of foreshadowing is that Armsmaster mentions that ""he'd give his left foot to be able to not sleep"", sure enough, he starts augmenting himself, giving up his body parts and loosing the need to sleep."

Parahumans,34pyrg,Jzadek,3,Mon May 4 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"The part where she has a life to live? Oh, and it's pretty obvious that no one reviles her as a monster, and I'd be glad to be in a situation where I'd never do anything as meaningful as saving all the Earths in exchange for saving all the Earths.  And let's see...on one hand, we have a Taylor who loses her mind completely and is nothing more than a broken husk, with no reason left to live. On the other, we have a Taylor who is a (inexplicably in perfect health) young adult with a life ahead of her in a not remotely post-apocalyptic world, with no connections to the fuckup which was her old life. No, she can't be a superhero or save the world, but look where that lead her. It's a happy ending."
Parahumans,34pyrg,GreatWyrmGold,8,Mon May 4 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to call it a bittersweet ending, a Pyrrhic victory. Taylor fundamentally won, yes, in the process saving basically all human beings everywhere. But she would be, I think, basically broken. Did you read Materia-Blade's ""She Seems Lonely""?

Going down any road labeled ‘death’ has to be the easier road.”  Taylor stopped, choking on the lump in her throat. Annette stood from her chair.  “Come on.” Taylor shook her head.  People were looking.  She stared down at the table, and the upside-down book cover.  “Y- you should go.  I- I picked this spot because I knew you’d be leaving to go back to work, didn’t wanna keep you too long.” Annette reached down, taking hold of Taylor’s wrists, where she’d jammed her hands in her pockets.  She stopped short as one hand came free and clunked against the side of the chair, limp and dangling. “Hav- haven’t gotten used to it. Had a better one,” Taylor mumbled.  “Before.  Embarrassed ‘self on the train.  Nearly dropping my bag on some lady’s foot because I used the wrong arm, hurt.”   ^ how is this happy?? 6 months later and Taylor is still a wreck, both physically and emotionally.  In a happy ending, she wouldn't be maimed and would have access to her friends.  By the way, am I deluded in thinking that Tattletale knows that Taylor is still alive but is keeping it quiet to keep her safe/ hurt Dinah?  If not, then the ending is even sadder than I thought :("

Killing her is the simplest, safest, most logical thing to do. It's not like Contessa to be just plain nice to people, especially dangerous people, and aside from how impossible bullet brain surgery is, the rest of fixing Taylor and removing her powers and all that stuff ranges from ""impossible"" to ""possible, as long as nothing messes up Cauldron's base and destroys all their stuff...oh wait!"""

She's also probably going to face some PTSD and will have to adapt to a peaceful role in life without being able to really talk about why it's so hard for her.  Also her arm's gone.  And the memories of what she's done will be with her forever.  This is kind've like how Frodo and company felt at the end of the LotR film(not the book, as that ended differently) where they're back in the peaceful Shire and everyone's happy and innocent and they realize they'll forever be changed and scarred from their struggles in a way they'll never be able to truly explain in a way their neighbors would understand.  And they have to live with that."
Parahumans,34pyrg,Bazuka125,-2,Mon May 4 05:52:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, like her cape status was ever a good thing. I mean, it offered an escape from bullies, but after that stopped being a problem, it brought new ones which made Emma's torment look petty.  Her friends are a problem, but that's basically all she lost. It's small potatoes.  She already had PTSD, sweet summer child.  The arm's still gone? Huh. Regardless, there are plenty of people who will tell you that it's perfectly possible to live a perfectly normal life one-handed.  Adapting to a peaceful role is something she'd have to do anyways, once the war was over. It's a bit different, since she doesn't even have police-cape career possibilities, but I don't see it as being that much tougher than adapting from ""no work except school"" to typical adult life.  ""And the memories of what she's done will be with her forever""? I'd count that as a bonus.  I'm pretty sure that Frodo and company's attitude was affected somewhat by the fact that magic was going away again, and with it some of their notable members."
Parahumans,34pyrg,GreatWyrmGold,2,Mon May 4 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"Her cape status was her identity, she moved out and became a full time villain, then lived at the Protectorate.

Now she's in a world where only one person kind of understands what happened to her, he's her father but they don't have the best relationship at the beginning.    Yeah missing an arm isn't the end of the world but lying to everyone who gets close to you about how you lost it does.  Taylor isn't going from adolescence to adulthood, she going from a three year tour as a navy seal straight to civilian life in a world where a lot of people don't believe the army exists.  Memories of sacrificing people like pieces on a board for the survival of humanity, memories of going insane, yeah she has memories of time before golden morning but those are going to be tainted by the knowledge she can't ever see them again.    Taylor survived but all the things that she that she identified as hers were gone.  Her friends, her city, her people, her place in the world are all gone.  She's around the age where you try to find your place in the world and what you want to do for the rest of life and she's already living a footnote to her own story, which she would love if she hadn't also lost all of the people she wanted to share her life with."

The best the government analogue would be able to muster would be cells of compatible capes with militarized or special op backup.  Less Justice League and Avengers, more along the lines of Hellboy and BPRD.

It's active uses are granting him increased strength, metal absorption, and limited shape shifting. Hatchetface would nullify those. But his metal physiology is the result of his power changing him when he got his powers. His shard doesn't have to actively work to keep him metal."

Taylor's Shard was the ""Administrator"" Shard. Glaistig Uaine called her the ""Queen Administrator"". Clearly they are similar and reference the Shard in their titles, but they are different. We should avoid mixing them up.   The Entities:   Zion/Scion: The Warrior, Attacker, Destroyer. Eden: The Thinker, Defender, Builder. Abbadon    Shard Names:   Taylor: The Administrator Shard. Jack Slash: The Broadcast Shard. Fletchette/Foil: The Sting Shard. Marquis, Panacea: The Shaper Shard. (WoG)   Glaistig  Uaine Titles:   Taylor: The Queen Administrator. Tattletale: The Negotiator. Eidolon: The High Priest. Contessa: The Champion. (Not confirmed, but likely) Dinah or the Clairvoyant: The Observer (Not confirmed, but likely) Bonesaw: The Chirurgeon. Chevalier: The Destroyer. Labyrinth: The Demesnes-Keeper. (Not confirmed, but likely) Panacea: The Shaper.  Legend: The Coruscant Knave. Nilbog: The Maker. Turanta: The Astrologer. Glaistig  Uaine: The Keeper of the Dead.   Cauldron Formula:   Genesis: The Deus Formula. Trickster: The Jaunt Formula. Sundancer: The Prince+Aegis Formula. Perdition: The Vestige Formula. Ballistic: The Robin Formula. Noelle/Echidna, Oliver, Satyrical:  The Division Formula.   Shard names seem to be one word and generally define what the Shard does.  Glaistig Uaine titles reference the Shard and the capes application of the Shard.   Cauldron Formula seems to be a general observation of what the vial has a tendency toward. Rather open-ended because powers are open-ended.  (I noticed Glaistig Uaine calls Marquis by his cape name sans title. Not sure if this means anything significant or not.)  (Note: I probably missed a few.)"
Parahumans,34pagf,Rillet,7,Sun May 3 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"I suspect that Glaistig's titles take the cape's personality and behaviour into account. Because if you just look at Chevalier's power, it's hard to imagine why anyone would call him ""The Destroyer""."

What else would you call Chevalier if you saw him like Valkyrie/Glaistig Uaine does? A being who pulverizes buildings by twitching hardly qualifies for a softer title. Remember that Shaper might not be the first thing that comes to mind when talking about Panacea, famous healer of Brockton Bay, for example. She dubs Legend the Coruscant Knave, and the second half of that title makes little sense. Knave doesn't really fit who Legend is, although it might fit who his powers were supposed to go to. An elusive trickster who uses his bizarre laser lightshows to dazzle and distract his enemies. But Legend isn't that person."

Second-in-command, villain. Duality: Two versions of the same thing. Not a leader, probably heroic. Bizarro: It's a bizarre power. Also a reference to Superman's evil twin-clone. Definitely a leader or solo cape, probably a villain. Doppelganger: What your powers are to theirs. 100% villain, 0% leader. [The] Broken Mirror: Fits an... unbalanced personality.

Dope: a pun, works for a team with the same naming sense as the merchants. Amyloid: as the fish's disciple has already suggested prions, I suggest amyloid to reference the tangled messes that appear in your brain after getting a prion disease. Radical Repair: this is for if you want to play up the cheesy angle, it's a really bad pun (mitochondria can be damaged by excessive free radicals (reactive molecule fragments so to speak) and so it needs repair mechanisms)). Calvin: this references the name of the carbon capture cycle in plants. Mitch/Mitchell: references this guy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_D._Mitchell Krebs is also a possibility of course, though it's pretty standard. The key chemical pathway of aerobic respiration. Capsid: ""head"" of a virus, holds the DNA. Cajal: guy who drew bits of the brain, widely considered to be the father of modern neuroscience. Galen: ancient greek doctor/philosopher.

I've got a couple of NPCs under construction for the game of Weaverdice I'm DM-ing right now, and what would you suggest for...  a) A Thinker who can drain mental power with a touch and add it to her own, dependent on how much she knows about the person (aka, brushing past a random person on the street would only drain and add the equivalent of a couple of IQ points, but draining your lover or parent would give an exponential amount of power).  (I was also thinking that she'd gain very minor precog if left unchecked, but I don't know..)  b) A Thinker who carries a totem in the form of a small rubber bouncy ball. She can ""charge luck"" to make plans and Rube-Goldberg-like events happen - their likelihood of succeeding is directly proportional to how complex and unlikely they are, as well as how long she's had to charge her luck. She can make simple and easy plans happen, or plans in a short amount of time, but it causes her to get crippling Thinker headaches that knock her out of commission for a while...  I've got a couple of ideas of my own, but I really want to hear yours! Not least because if everything goes according to plan they'll need a ""Hero"" name and a ""Villain"" name."
Parahumans,34ohs1,NamedByAFish,5,Sun May 3 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"Not the guy just OP, but here are my ideas:  A:  Hero: Sophomore, Apprentice  Villain: Conspirator, Plagiarist  B: Hero: Fluke(Could be hero or villain), Providence(The definition that means preparation for something that is coming)  Villain: Kismet"

Parahumans,34ohs1,NamedByAFish,4,Mon May 4 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"Between trying to study for exams tomorrow and answering a bunch of comments, it's taken me a while to get around to this. But, I do have a few names for you.  For Cape A:   Capacitex: Portmanteau of ""Capacitor"" and ""Cortex."" Refers to the concept of charge and the brain theme. A bit cheesy, so probably a politically minor player. Either a Heroine or a Villainess. Pupil or Student: Teacher's power gives Thinker powers, so the opposite could be a Student. Could be a villain or a hero. The Apprentice: Going with the Student theme, but a bit stronger. Apprentices eventually take over from their masters... Definitely a Villainess name, but could pass for Heroine if you drop the ""The."" Neith: A complicated Egyptian goddess, sometimes associated with wisdom. Also related to war, hunting, death, and conflict in general, as well as pathways to the underworld and the part of the sky mortals never see. Mysterious and definitely a Villainess. Seshat: Would work as a counterpart to Neith. Seshat was the Egyptian goddess of wisdom and writing. This would be a Heroine name.   For Cape B:   Gordian: From Gordian knot. A legendary knot that could only be undone by ""cheating."" A mysterious character, possibly much more politically relevant than she may seem. Villainess. Tyche: Greek goddess of fortune. Probably a Heroine. The Means: Possibly a member of a crime-themed trio of villains (The Means, The Motive, and The Opportunity). This is a pairing of names that I had an interesting idea for: Consider (Heroine) and Implause (Villainess):** The best way to corner the market is to be your own competition, right? Consider and Implause are arch-nemeses. Consider is a Heroine who spends a long time ""charging"" simple plans, and Implause is a Villainess who specializes in crazy, short-term plans. Providence: From Providentia, the Roman goddess of foresight. Could be a Villainess or a Heroine. Whammo: Yes, this one sounds strange. ""Wham-O"" was one of the first companies to produce bouncy balls (or, as they were called in the Sixties, ""Super Balls""). In addition, the name suits the kind of eccentric personality that could make good use out of the power. Probably not a Heroine.   You're DMing a Weaverdice game? Forget my names, that is awesome! I play DnD and Shadowrun with some friends, but those groups are falling apart because various players just don't show up anymore. I was interested in getting into Weaverdice instead. Any advice on how I might get into Weaverdice? I heard about the IRC room, is that a good place to start?  Edit for spelling. Still probably has typos."
Parahumans,34ohs1,DemosthenesKey,2,Mon May 4 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"I love Neith and Seshat! Mythological names are my favorite... heck, one of the other players has the name Talos, so it's a common theme with our group.  For Cape B, Tyche and Providence are both pretty awesome, as are Consider and Implause (which for some reason I keep wanting to put as Consideration and Implausability).   Now that you've put yours, I'll reveal that my ideas for them were:  (Villainous)  Cape A: Dementia Cape B: Ricochet  (Heroic)  Cape A: Inspiration (hiding her true power, as it's... somewhat unpalatable for PR purposes) Cape B: Skillshot  As for the Weaverdice thing, honestly it all came from one of my IRL friends saying I ought to get into tabletop roleplaying, and recommending Pathfinder. I said that that was all very well and good, but were there any other good ones out there? He recommended some others that I forget and then a few days later while trawling the Parahumans subreddit I saw Weaverdice. Immediately started to bug my IRL friends about giving it a shot, and managed to get QUITE a few of them to agree to it, even the ones who'd never done roleplaying before at all.   Nine agreed to, and four stuck it out, so there's a decent group, and we get together on campus when we can.   Honestly I've never tried the IRC room, and never tried online roleplaying at all - I've just always loved writing, so I buckled down and decided to start working out the details myself. It's a very loose campaign in terms of how damage is dealt and XP is gained and all that due to the newbies, but we all have fun and that's what counts."
Parahumans,34ohs1,NamedByAFish,1 point,Mon May 4 01:58:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's your cape. My names are just suggestions. If you want to change the names to Consideration and Implausibility, go right ahead. [Dementia and Inspiration] and [Ricochet and Skillshot] are pretty good too, and I like the character building you can get out of Dementia and Inspiration.  I don't have much online RP experience either, but I also only know one person IRL who has read Worm and three who are open to it as soon as exams are over (this Friday). But all of us are travelling at some point this summer, and not all at the same time, so a Weaverdice group with them wouldn't stay together... the online option is just so much more attractive right now.  But good on you for bringing some newbies into the world of tabletop RP gaming! It's always fun to watch how people approach it for the first time."

Honestly I'd be down for writing the occasional campaign for you to run a character through, though it'd probably just be one-on-one online ""individual"" campaigns, and what with finals coming up in a couple weeks for me and a summer job + internship after that I can't promise it'd be often. Still a fun thing to do. :)  Oh my gosh, it's HILARIOUS.

There's something about the way people work off, with, and against each other that I can only really get out of a group dynamic. Thank you for the offer, though :)  I both pity and envy the players who haven't read Worm. Pity because they're terrified of the Endbringers and S9 (""Oh god, how can I use my power against the... what was it? The Smurf?""); envy because they're terrified of the Endbringers.

Parahumans,34nxqg,Brothernature0,4,Sun May 3 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yes...rather too much fusion for comfort.  If it's on fire, regular combustion-style, it's got oxygen and carbon and things. Anything the size of the sun and made of those is going to have a lot more gravity, meaning a lot more pressure, meaning a lot hotter fusion.  Come to think of it, the ""more gravity"" might wreck the earth on its own.  And it would have to be even bigger to start with, since fire is much less efficient than nuclear fusion. So yes, Earth is going down."

Right now I'm thinking that that means you could turn them into automatons with specific task, but not any tasks they couldn't do before? i.e. make action figures walk around and punch people but they don't have any real power behind their blows and their guns still don't work, or if they don't already have articulated joints, they can't climb stairs?  If that's the case, you just need to give them weapons. Replace ninja action figure swords with real swords scaled for them and make them stab people in the ankles, get a ton of those monkeys that go in circle with the banging cymbals, coat the cymbals in a poisonous powder that will be spread through the air by the clapping and make them seek out crowds, etc.  Edit: Need to include a power idea as well.

Parahumans,34mjxc,notentirelyrandom,3,Sat May 2 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"There's an absolutely huge number of characters who would get high master ratings; Conquest, Rose, Maggie, really any practicioner who summons things. Stranger 4-5 for Fell maybe, since he can basically pull off Imp tactics with slightly more deliberate effort on his part and a different set of weaknesses.  Evan should have a Mover 2-3, changer or maybe breaker 1 for bird form.  Pauz is definitely a (lowish) shaker with his area effect radiation and animal Master 2-3  -Ur should be minimum Stranger 9, if not higher.

That sort of thing.

As for the Protectorate/PRT helper, I think it'd be really cool to have an anonymous ""normal"" foot soldier.

I said ""Hey there mister fish, will you be my friend?"" He didn't reply. I forgot that fish can't speak language. But then he surprised me by responding! He said ""Hi there little guy, will you really be my friend?"" I said ""Of course! You're big, and awesome, and a fish! You could teach me how to swim!"" The big fish started to cry.

What kind of tinker only has the one weapon?  And, yeah, I've heard about all that legal stuff with Dragon. Not many heroes who get around all that PRT trademark legal stuff. But she's Guild, right? Maybe it's different up in Canada. Still, imagine if we could market those dragon-jet things. You could do some sort of grudge match between her and whats-his-name, the Chinese dragon guy.  Lawyers, man, making our job harder than it should be."
Parahumans,34lgnl,Plecky,4,Sun May 3 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you only now have a marketing department.  Anyways, I think the best route here is to make a fictional hero; too many messy details with reality, too much potential trouble if the hero gets caught doing drugs or becomes a villain or dies or something. Fiction is cleaner.  A Ward would be best; kids identify more with other kids (even older kids) than with grown-ups. Definitely a bit older than the target audience, so they'll look up to him; maybe elementary school? Probably an Alexandria package cape, kids like simple heroes and everyone wants to fly. I'm thinking the story should involve some amount of the PRT providing something for the kid, so probably an orphan. As for the plot, it would be easy to make this a franchise, but we don't want to leave loose ends in case we don't (or if a family only buys one book), so definitely episodic. I think that having the character deal with or help other kids deal with everyday problems would be better than...well...what Wards actually do.  With me so far?"
Parahumans,34lgnl,pseudonarne,3,Sat May 2 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"We've always been here.  Marketing is better than PSYOPS without people screaming about PR is all.  Hell, be happy you didn't end up in PR -- having to deal with actual capes is a pain, let me tell you.  I'm with you, kid.  But the thing is, we're gonna want someone to actually be visible is all.  Someone that they can see on TV, you know?  Give them the ""this is real"" bullshit.  Extend the facade a little.  Maybe if we can find some two-bit who wouldn't ever amount to anything, and make them look real good, turn them into a proper PR device...  Ahem, sorry.  You're right, though.  I like how you're thinking it.  Slightly older kid, someone that they could aspire to be like in a few years, even if they don't have power.  Make them be a hero that they can identify with soon, right?  And I'm definitely with you on the episodic franchise.  Stories that the kids can identify with, but stories that you can close the book and walk away from happy, not waiting for the conclusion.  Like those Indian in the Cupboard books and stuff.  You're on the right track, yeah.  Tell you what.  I'll give you access to our lists of youngest Wards.  Find me someone we can turn into this kid, at least in public, and its all yours."
Parahumans,34lgnl,NamedByAFish,3,Sat May 2 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"I can see having a PR hero, but I'm not sure we need to use him for the 3-5 year-olds, and I am sure that I'd need access to a lot of secure PRT databases I'm never getting access to to find a good Ward for that. That list would help, though; I'll see what I can do.  This Vista girl would be pretty good if she was living somewhere that wasn't a hellhole."

It'll fit the agenda that the brass is pushing as well. Now for the villain. We don't want anyone too scary, nor any known villains, shame because Über and L33t fit perfectly. Some no name villain from another city will do.  As for the plot we don't want any of the heroes getting really hurt or inconvenienced, paints a bad image. It's a children's book so the plot should be simple. I'm thinking that the villain robs a bank, MM arrives. Convinces villain to give up. Happily ever after.    For the older audience I'm thinking we take the Battery and Assault story. Gold material, hero and villain fight so many times and then they realise that they actually love each other, again bringing the villain over to the good side helps cement the notion of the good guys being the obvious choice."

Parahumans,34jlz5,notentirelyrandom,3,Sat May 2 01:33:03 2015 UTC,Possibly.  hard to say.  we havent seen them interact.  I'm kind of inclined to side with Clockblocker here though to be honest.  frozen in time kind of trumps most other things.
Parahumans,34jlz5,SexualPie,4,Sat May 2 01:34:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, we see Siberian interact with Clockblocker in 26.5. Clockblocker stalemates her.  Clockblocker:   Clockblocker fired his threads from his gauntlet.  They surrounded the cube-carrier, and he froze them.  Unstoppable force against an immovable object.  Which won?  The Siberian made contact with the thread and flickered out of existence, and the thread went limp.  The cube fell with a crash.   Foil trumps Siberian, which lends itself to her trumping Clockblocker as well, and we've never seen where Wildbow stands."
Parahumans,34jlz5,Whispersilk,0,Sat May 2 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"wait so, clock is better than sib.  and foil is better than sib.  therefore foil is better than sib?  i dont get it."
Parahumans,34jlz5,SexualPie,1 point,Sat May 2 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"My reasoning is Clockblocker is equal to the Siberian and Foil is greater than the Siberian, so Foil is likely greater than Clockblocker as well."
Parahumans,34jlz5,Whispersilk,3,Sat May 2 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"I think it depends a lot on reference frames. Are clockblocked objects frozen relative to a point in the space Vista's distorting, or are they frozen relative to (say) the Earth?  Who knows?"
Parahumans,34jlz5,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri May 1 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"I think this is the right way to think of it. If the CB'd objects are frozen relative to the space that Vista is distorting then Vista would be able to move the CB'd objects because even though the space is moving the objects are still frozen to its reference frame. If the objects are frozen relative to the earth then Vista would not be able to move them. I'm imagining a zipper effect where the space on either side of the CB'd objects get ripped apart as the try to move past the CB'd objects. Also, why wouldn't the PRT try and test this?"

Parahumans,34jlz5,jellysnake,5,Sun May 3 08:39:58 2015 UTC,"I think as far as I'm concerned a CBed object can't be influenced by anything. It's locked in time, you probably can't change the space it's in until you have time for you to change it if you see what I mean? As in, Vista's power isn't an instant distortion, so it might be influenced by time powers."
Parahumans,34jlz5,Plecky,3,Fri May 1 23:41:51 2015 UTC,But what happens if scrub uses his power on Clockblocker's targets?

I could fly, heal people and disguise myself, but somehow in my dream I knew that I only had one power and those were only different applications of it. My disguise wasn't perfect but if my face was already slightly obscured (like with a veil) it would be hard to tell. So I decided to pretend to be Panacea for a day to give her a break and ended up attending a healers' conference in Brockton Bay. While I was there I tried to start a conversation with a girl sitting next to me but she seemed completely star-struck and disbelieving that someone as great as Panacea would want to talk to her.

In the first one, I was in an abandoned, very futuristic mall. There were functioning floating ""zen"" waterfalls. I remember specifically thinking ""Tinkers man, fucking tinkers."" I noticed that people were evacuating through the parking structure and went to go check it out. Turns out a serial killer cape with poisoned claws decided that sticking to the shadows wasn't good enough anymore and started tearing through the city. I remember thinking ""it's just an asshole with claws. Fuck this guy. He doesn't get to kill people just because he has claws."" I started running toward him. I got close enough to start trying to fight him, trying to grab his wrist when I felt my body slowing down as it got closer. Definite ""well, I'm fucked"" moment. He stabbed me in the gut.   The poison was slow.   I didn't have a ""trigger vision"" in the dream, but suddenly I could teleport, and when I landed between him and his next victims, a TK pulse rang out from the spot I zapped to, knocking him and the bystanders on their ass. As I got closer, his slowing effect seemed to double back on him. I grabbed his wrist and his poison started eating his flesh from the claws down. His veins were turning dark purple. He was in horrible, horrible pain. I did not feel good about it, but I felt right about it.   I'm not sure exactly what power that would be."
Parahumans,34gth1,ughzubat,4,Fri May 1 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he had some sort of shaker/striker power, maybe pure striker depending on how far out the slowed time effect emanated from him. Your power actually sounds a lot like hack job's - teleportation and a trump effect, but focused on turning other people's power against them. All in all, I'm very impressed at how much sense you dream actually makes - there's almost no ""dream-logic"" in it."

It was sort of like an alternative version of the fight that happened at the beginning of Worm. We were in a hotel and Lung had a bunch of hostages. Unlike the real Skitter, I couldn't do anything to fight Lung. I had here powers but none of her resourcefulness and quick thinking. Basically Lung ended up killing all of the hostages while I was powerless to stop him. Then he came after me and I was completely terrified. I ran out of the hotel and into traffic to try and die quickly to wake up from the dream, but unfortunately I was in armor and didn't die. Then Lung-who by now was transformed quite a bit-flew down from the top of the hotel into the middle of the street and killed me.  In the second one my family and I were having a nice BBQ and everything was really nice and happy. And then I looked up in the sky and saw the Simurgh.  This was her first appearance and nobody understood why I was so terrified. I told my family that we had to leave immediately and get far away, but they didn't listen. Nobody believed me when I told them to leave. I don't quite remember what happened after that but I think the Simurgh had some sort of Nilbog like power."

Either I triggered, or I had a power all along, but after they started attacking my family, I developed the ability to produce waves of water centered on my self. Unfortunately, it was a very weak power, and it only held them back for a little bit. I tried fleeing ""beneath"" the pocket dimension, they followed me and the Siberian ripped out my heart. It was a terrifying dream, but also a bit of an anti-climax."
Parahumans,34gth1,WooHooII,6,Fri May 1 04:03:24 2015 UTC,"This happened a few days ago. I was observing (from some sort of third-person perspective) a Master/Stranger named Harmony, who could put people under his/her control by looking them in the eyes. Anyone under Harmony's control would begin to mimic his/her movements exactly, and Harmony could jump into any of their bodies at any time. He/she had done this enough times that nobody had any idea what Harmony's original body looked like (hence the pronoun confusion), or if it was even still alive.  Thankfully, given how terrifying that power could be, Harmony did not appear to be particularly malicious. However, he/she was using this power primarily for stalking Bonesaw, which doesn't strike me as a thing sane people do."

Parahumans,34gth1,MedukaMeguca,3,Fri May 1 11:26:10 2015 UTC,"So not primarily Worm, but Ur fucked up a dream at least once. I remember I was in a long concrete tunnel you'd drive cars through with Tattletale and a bunch of other random characters, and all of a sudden the lights started flickering out, one by one. Tattletale was like oh shit they're here and we ran towards the lighter side of the tunnel. I made it out first, but as I turned back around to the mountain, the tunnel was gone... I somehow figured out that some of the character were Urspawn and maintained a human guise long enough to turn the lights out and guarantee a kill.  Anyway after that was a weirdly superhero sequence where I was with friends trying to defend our base from a team of obnoxious elemental anime villains. While the fight was going on, my friend realized they had a key they'd held onto for the entire story (which presumably happened before this) and that if they hadn't used it up yet it had to be used here. So they found a crack in the wall (of our house?), stuck the key in, and turned it, making a grey door with a static nameplate appear. The fight stopped as we turned to look at it. My friend opened the door, and there was nothing but darkness inside and the lights started going out. Anyway then Ur got my friend and I woke up.  So lesson: Ur is the worst."

I attempted to flee, but after successfully fleeing for a few minutes my subconcious asked ""How are we not dead or suffering horribly yet?"" and answered it's own question by having Manniquin get stuck in the construction materials.  With a hearty ""Fuck it, not like there's a better idea"" I turned, and started smashing him with a length of iron piping.  After a minute of smashing my subconcious again asked ""How the hell is he not yet unstuck and killing us?"" which broke SoD evenough to wake me."

Upon breaching the surface, R'lyeh releases waves of twisted, vaguely humanoid monsters with weak brute characteristics, and rarely nullification, stranger, or mover abilities. R'lyeh exerts a passive breaker effect, causing physics to break down around it. The strength of the effect decreases over time, but leaves behind permanent subtle effects afterward.

Parahumans,34gm3i,Igigigif,5,Fri May 1 16:07:24 2015 UTC,I want to submit a cape to be in the now-out-of-the-bird-cageddit.  Oblivion  Oblivion is a cape with no origin story as his origin story. He is a diagnosed Sociopath who has no emotions on an upfront level. His power (and why his not an origin story story) is because he is like imp on steroids almost. He has two active abilities and a passive ability. His passive ability is some what caused by his sociopath-ness because it is that people forget about him. It is like imp were they just slowly forget him ever existing unless they jog their memory. It is a slow effect though as it just waves over them such as they will forget when they first saw him then they will forget his name then they will forget his costume until POOF. He has two active abilities though which help him in combat and give him an assassin type power. He can cause temporary amnesia is his quick power. He can make someone suffer from a couple second amnesia thing were they just kinda zone out and forget where they are. His other power is though that if he focuses he can cause his passive power to be put on someone else. Forcefully. So if he focuses on this person depending how famous they are (a month if not that famous-a year for someone like a mayor or governor) he can make it so no one besides themselves remembers who they are. The downside to his power though is that he forgets who he is to with his power (besides the amnesia thing).  P.S. thanks /u/ughzubat for the futhark generator (How I made this guy)  P.P.S. Should I change the amount of time it takes for people to forget about other people or should I just change that power completely?
Parahumans,34gm3i,NamedByAFish,3,Fri May 1 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"Applying my new cape for membership in the Triumvireddit.  Hera  As a person, Hera is unnervingly calm (the result of literally years of training herself to control all emotion, for better use of her power -- I'll explain that later). Her powers are more or less combat-oriented, but her uncanny calmness makes her an excellent negotiator as well.  Basically, Hera's power has two parts: a combat-level precognitive ability that tells her where and from where she might get hit three [See 2nd edit] seconds before the impact, and the ability to ""absorb"" her own kinetic energy immediately before an impact that would otherwise disperse it and ""release"" it later at will. The first work on impacts from both her momentum and the momentum of other objects, and the second only works on impact from her own momentum. In other words: if you shoot at her, she will have dodged the bullet before you even fired; if you throw her into a wall at sixty miles per hour, she'll stop at the wall completely unharmed and her next hit could strike as if she was moving at sixty miles per hour; and if you somehow manage to hit her over the head with a baseball bat (which won't happen because combat precog), she'd feel it just like anyone else.  Her powers aren't limited to combat applications, though. She also has a decent Mover rating, because she can release energy to ""jump"" several hundred feet straight up to go from street level to the top of tall office buildings, or she could release energy to ""step"" with enough force for her to ""sprint"" at nearly fifty miles per hour (I haven't done the math on the forces there, I'm just going to say that that's her preferred travel speed because beyond that, her cape starts creating serious drag). She can also absorb the kinetic energy of a long fall, allowing her to drop off skyscrapers and land on the street with no ill effect to herself or the pavement.  The twist to her powers is that they only work like this when she's totally calm. The more emotions Hera feels, the harder it is for her to control the release of her energy (although, for obvious reasons of self-preservation, energy absorption is automatic). This is why she has conditioned herself, over several years, into almost complete stoicism. She still can feel emotion, but unless it's an overwhelmingly intense one, she can ignore most emotion enough to remain in a calm state. This has, unfortunately, made her a callous, cold-hearted bitch.    I've spent a lot of time on Hera, and I did a rough character sketch of her in armor this morning. I will definitely be subjecting this thread to the next iteration of that sketch when it's finished.    Edit: Oh, I forgot to mention a thing! Hera's name is a reference to, well, Hera obviously, but it's also an acronym describing her power: ""High-Energy-Recovery-and-Application."" HERA.  And of course, Zubat's cape is named Futhark. Of course.    2nd Edit: Thought about Hera's power some more, and decided that she wasn't quite Triumvirate-level. So I came up with some changes:   Increased combat precognition: Instead of a flat three seconds, Hera can predict potential impacts on her body passively (without focus; generally outside of combat and other inherently dangerous situations) out to five seconds and actively (with focus; generally during combat) out to fifteen seconds. To help process the extra information from her combat precognition, Hera has a superhuman grasp of short term cause and effect. This also makes her both an expert strategist and a grandmaster-level chess player.     Even More Edit: Sketch almost done, I just need a face. I'm also going to change Hera's cape name to... Something else. Also not sure yet. And there will be more changes to her power.  Oh and I should probably study for my exams next week at some point. Hmm. Nah, that can wait. Gotta make this OC perfect."

Parahumans,34gm3i,Gyddanar,5,Fri May 1 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"Well, to start I'd like as much distance as possible from a certain white supremacist group that trends toward Scandinavian naming.   A power involving the bestowing of power, while still able to fight at Triumvireddit levels, and involving the chaos and fortune of dice. My best thought is to charge one-off ""totems"" (that can be given to others, but he doesn't want it getting around too much the exact way his power works so it's in more dire of situations) with one of 24 different effects. A Dauntless that doesn't grow. Probably limited by the number of charged objects at a time.   A character that is ridiculous in a (mostly) self aware way, personality and mannerisms are frequently compared (favorably) to a dog."
Parahumans,34gm3i,NamedByAFish,4,Fri May 1 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"A suggestion, if I may.  Your cape could have fixed pools of energy, each themed around a rune. These can be combined in many different ways. (Eg. Ice rune and harvest rune gives an entropy field).  This energy can be used on people, things and yourself, but can also argument tinker-tech. Set the exact power levels as you want.  EDIT: removed weird manton limit"
Parahumans,34gm3i,NamedByAFish,4,Fri May 1 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"oh, and! if possible, a character that started off as mid-tier at best until they had a (possibly Thinker-assisted) epiphany about the interplay of the totems."
Parahumans,34gm3i,NamedByAFish,2,Fri May 1 01:50:33 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I love ""hidden"" uses! By interplay do you mean synergy for using multiple totems for something, or do you mean just how Futhark can use the totems? Or maybe something else I'm completely missing?  I'm honestly completely lost when it comes to Trump powers. For some reason, I can't get myself to think anything besides ""varying levels of Eidolon"" and ""varying levels of Manetellum,"" even though I know there are so many other possibilities via the Trump classification.  Perhaps Futhark can use multiple totems for himself at once, or can only use one at a time for any given recipient of a totem but gets the benefit of all the totems being used?  Sorry for taking forever there. I'm working on the second Hera sketch and it's taking quite some time."
Parahumans,34gm3i,NamedByAFish,3,Fri May 1 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"all good!  For the interplay, it'd be something like the classic alchemy -> smithing loop from Skyrim, at least once in order to get the runes well and truly figured out.   I like the idea of having others be able to use it but with a penalty to me. Like, it depletes my reserves considerably less when I'm the one using them, but if someone else fires a rune off I have to haul ass out of the danger zone until I'm useful again"
Parahumans,34gm3i,NamedByAFish,3,Fri May 1 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"Suggestion? Power set that functions in principle along same lines as Magicka?  Charge up a rune or a combination of runes, generate effects. More complex the rune combinations, the more complex the effect. Downside is that building a charge takes time. Big fire effect, or a complicated effect powerful enough to be of worth may take up to a minute to build.    Leads to a versatile Cape, but one who needs to be creative or good team synergy to build space to do the Eidolon level tricks"
Parahumans,34gm3i,Subrosian_Smithy,2,Fri May 1 09:32:16 2015 UTC,"Based on the description, I'd class that as a tinker-trump, or possibly just a tinker.

Now she's a bit like X-Men's Sebastian Shaw limited to kinetic energy and plus the combat precognition (which also got an upgrade).

Parahumans,34gm3i,farfromunique,4,Sat May 2 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"Here's a cape I've been thinking of to lead a Protectoreddit team: Chernoble, a Blaster.  He can create radiation and manipulate it with an extremely fine degree of control, enough to use his powers without civilian deaths. He's also a low-level brute in the same vein as Aegis; on the inside, his body is more like a homogeneous tumor than anything else."
Parahumans,34gm3i,Strategist14,5,Fri May 1 02:05:05 2015 UTC,"What the heck, I'm in.  This is the OC a friend designed for me.  Quincunx  Master/Trump 8 (subtypes listed below)  Quincunx is able to summon nondescript ""ghosts"", up to five at a time.  These can be sustained at any range, but start out as intangible duplicates of himself.  It takes about an hour for a ghost to become fully solid - they are useless until then.  During this time the ghosts are stripped of any identifying features, becoming a generic humanoid shape more akin to a mannequin than a person.  If killed, a ghost disintegrates, and Quincunx can reform them.  However, it takes another hour before they're functional, and he can't summon them at any real range.  Since he keeps his main body far from the action, this almost certainly means they're gone for that fight (and possibly future battles, depending on travel time).  Tactically, this means they function best as cannon fodder to defend their more powerful allies.  Quincunx shares senses with his ghosts, and can issue commands if he chooses to, but these commands are completed on 'autopilot'.  For example, Quincunx could tell them to ""fight these guys"" (mentally that is, not verbally) and they would decide how to fight on their own.  He has no special multitasking ability, so micromanaging them isn't really an option.  Quincunx's second power, the source of his Trump rating, is his ability to allocate a series of powers among his ghosts.  These five powers constitute the five sub-classifications detailed below.  Quincunx is able to grant multiple powers to a single ghost, leaving others powerless, or spread them evenly.   Brute 3: The Brute ignores pain and has a measure of regeneration, but is no stronger than Quincunx. Breaker/Striker 6, Brute 4: The Breaker has a small field of gravity radiating against its skin.  This has the effect of gravity always pushing against whatever it touches, which allows it to approximate super strength by making things fall as it pushes them.  This effectively makes things it lifts weightless, but isn't strong enough to deflect the vast majority of attacks. Blaster 2, Thinker 1: The Blaster has enhanced eyesight and reaction speed.  It is also capable of launching spherical projectiles that provide a light impact. Mover 3: The Mover is able to fly. Changer 6, Brute 3: The Changer is able to reshape its own body, with the exception that it cannot violate conservation of mass.  It can, however, absorb other ghosts into it to utilize their mass.   Again, these powers can be mix-and-matched as Quincunx desires, even going so far as to switching the powers applied to a given ghost in the middle of a battle.  Background information:  Quincunx has no costume, nor do most people even know there is a single person behind his ghosts.  For the most part, Quincunx works the same way Genesis does, summoning his five minions to act for him while he stays far, far away from the lines of battle.  In his mundane life, Quincunx acts as an accountant for the Protectoreddit, while his ""team"" is busy walking the streets and/or helping take care of paperwork.  He triggered sometime in the aftermath of Golden Morning - the logistics for mass genocide are a nightmare.  A quincunx is a shape made of four corners and a center, like the five on a dice.  This refers to the five ghosts, which most people think of as a team of mercenaries, similar to the way that Manton isn't as well-known as Siberian."
Parahumans,34gm3i,BlueberryPhi,2,Fri May 1 05:49:07 2015 UTC,"What happens if one of his Ghosts gets ""killed""? Can he just reform them? Does he have to direct them consciously or do they have free will?"
Parahumans,34gm3i,Plecky,3,Fri May 1 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"If killed, a ghost disintegrates, and Quincunx can reform them.  However, it takes another hour before they're functional, and he can't summon them at any real range.  Since he keeps his main body far from the action, this almost certainly means they're gone for that fight (and possibly future battles, depending on travel time).  Tactically, this means they function best as cannon fodder to defend their more powerful allies.  Quincunx shares senses with his ghosts, and can issue commands if he chooses to, but these commands are completed on 'autopilot'.  For example, Quincunx could tell them to ""fight these guys"" (mentally that is, not verbally) and they would decide how to fight on their own.  He has no special multitasking ability, so micromanaging them isn't really an option."
Parahumans,34gm3i,BlueberryPhi,2,Fri May 1 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"That's cool, I like it."
Parahumans,34gm3i,Plecky,2,Fri May 1 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"How big can a changer ghost get, do they remain operational while he sleeps and can he reallocate powers while a ghost with powers is already operational?"
Parahumans,34gm3i,BlueberryPhi,3,Fri May 1 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"The Changer needs to use mass from the other ghosts to actually increase in size - its maximum size is five times a normal person's.  Without doing that, it's only capable of rearranging its own flesh into new shapes, and needs to reduce the size of one body part to increase another.  EDIT: Quincunx is a Noctis cape, meaning he doesn't need to sleep.  I forgot those were a thing.  Quincunx is able to reallocate powers that are already active, even mid-battle.  For example, he could give each of them the Mover power in quick succession, letting them fly one at a time past a wall or something.  With sufficient timing, he could soften an attack against one ghost by giving it the Brute rating right before impact.  Again, however, he has no significant multitasking abilities, which means it's fully possible for him to accidentally kill the Mover by taking away its flying while in midair, or get the Breaker crushed by a car that it suddenly can't lift anymore."
Parahumans,34gm3i,Plecky,2,Fri May 1 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"So, if he were to preemptively make a ghost 5 times its normal size, would he be able to make new ghosts and give one of them the changer power to buff it up until it's 5 times the size, repeating until you have 4 giant ghosts and a small one? I'm assuming not, but if so and with prep time this could be quite powerful."
Parahumans,34gm3i,BlueberryPhi,2,Fri May 1 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"No.  Quincunx's maximum limit of five ghosts includes those that have been absorbed by the Changer.  That said, he is able to move the Changer power from one ghost to another, meaning he could have one double-sized ghost and one triple-sized, or two doubles and one normal, or any other arrangement of the five.  After the Changer power is removed, the body doesn't revert, but becomes unable to reshape itself further.  The strongest ghost he could make would be to use the Changer to create a giant, then putting all five powers on it."
Parahumans,34gm3i,Plecky,2,Fri May 1 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, OK. I was hoping this was the case."
Parahumans,34gm3i,BlueberryPhi,3,Fri May 1 17:13:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, being able to make a monster of functionally-unlimited size would be a good way to get S-Classed.  As is, combining all five is powerful, but not particularly gamebreaking when you look at someone like Alexandria, especially as the powers kinda counteract one another.  The extra evasiveness from the Blaster power won't be much good to something as big as the Changer, nor will the Breaker be able to do much while flying via Mover."
Parahumans,34gm3i,Plecky,2,Fri May 1 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"If one of the ghosts does while someone else has the ""absorb"" power, can he ""give"" the absorber the newly created ghosts mass?"
Parahumans,34gm3i,GreatWyrmGold,2,Fri May 1 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"No.  Dead ghosts disappear, and must be reformed with his physical body - a process which takes about an hour before they're able to fight again.  It would work if it manages to touch the Changer before dying, however.  He can re-allocate whatever powers the dead ghost had, potentially giving a new effect to the Changer, but not the body mass."
Parahumans,34gm3i,GreatWyrmGold,4,Fri May 1 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"After some tweaking based on that previous thread I made, allow me to submit my character!  The Progenitor (aka The Shapeshifter/Nature/LUCA/The Monster/etc.)  (note: as the identity of this cape is unknown, Protectorate logs make use of the term ""he"" as a placeholder pronoun.  True sex and age of The Progenitor is unknown at this time.)  A cape with multiple names due to a tendency to avoid the spotlight, to the point of rarely speaking when encountered, as well as extensive use of shapeshifting abilities.  Can control every cell in his body, as well as their makeup, behavior, and products that remain within constant contact of himself, with the same control as Skitter's power over her insects, and the versatility of Panacea's power over external biological systems.  It is believed that he cannot generate his own biomass, but must replenish lost nutrients and mass through eating.  First known sightings involve him hiring hitmen out on a fictional target which he then posed as to lure them into traps, where he would interrogate them for further underworld contacts, before leaving them bound in casts made of bone, wrapped in cocoons, etc.  On occasion leaves large amounts of blood at the scene, each time with differing genetic makeup (varying from goat, snake, horseshoe crab, to many samples that match no known animal).  Physical makeup varies, but witnesses describe certain trends such as an extremely overweight or muscular appearance when in disguise, an immunity to pain paired with quick healing, sounds akin to dolphin clicks, hissing, or whalesong, and commonly adopting a large and lithe body plan with two extra lower arms, a pair of wings, and a tail.  Most commonly of all is reported a ""face"" of a solid blank white bone plate mask, with neither eyes, nose, nor mouth, which is often revealed by removing an outer human face in an apparent attempt to intimidate.  Common tactics include surprise, isolation, and intimidation, using webbing or bone to block doors and windows and cutting the power, as well as the use of tape recorders placed inside walls to create sounds (typically of scratching) for misdirection.  Once or twice, once he isolated his prey he appeared before them and advanced without regard or reaction to any wounds inflicted, including having his head blown off, in what appears to be another intimidation tactic.  It is unknown if he has killed, though several cases report him fleeing the scene upon the arrival of police officers while he was in the process of wrapping already-bound enemies further in cocoons in a manner reminiscent of a spider wrapping its prey.  Records show, however, that the anonymous 911 calls that directed the authorities to the location have been often made from a phone belonging to one of the criminals, who when asked claim to have not had a chance to dial.  It is suspected that this is yet another attempt at intimidation, a common theme in this cape's modus operandi, though the reason for the continuation of this after capture is unknown.  He appears to favor targeting hitmen and sex slave rings, often acting as bait and/or customer before isolating and then hunting his targets, almost universally favoring intimidation and misdirection in his known encounters, though he has been known to be able to deliver overwhelming force on occasion.  Despite a predilection towards using his shapeshifting to create a sense of horror, sometimes involving surprising amounts of blood (assumed to be his own), he has no confirmed kills on record and most of his targets are recovered with little apparent physical harm."

Parahumans,34gm3i,Technical_Goblin,1 point,Sat May 2 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, though I personally think it needs some kind of limitation, or with sufficient time/planning the guy could basically just exceed top-class capes. A mental/personal restriction like what Panacea has could be a good idea here though, as it's harder to get around than power restrictions (e.g. the no budding stuff off things could be got around via self-injury). Or it could be something as simple as not wanting to go S class.  Regardless, unfortunately I doubt the horror aspect would do much to stop one of the capes I made with a friend wanting to fight them."
Parahumans,34gm3i,ErrantVagrant,1 point,Sat May 2 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"Well, he doesn't want to be viewed as enough of a threat to the major cape organizations that they send a band of heroes out to capture or kill him, that's for certain.  Though he might claim to be an S class in private.  Plus, while he can give himself excellent cardiovascular health for drawn-out fights, he still would have a limitation in that he slowly loses mass in a fight either due to stuff he makes from his own body or just simple blows/burns/etc inflicted upon him.  That, and I figure he might be as wary of messing with his own brain as Panacea is of messing with other people's brains.  Only, if he screws it up, it'd be a lot more personal and permanent.  So, he would have to protect and hide his intact brain while keeping it on him, so to speak.  (naturally, not kept in his head)  Out of curiosity, just from how I've described how he tends to act, what number would you give him?  And what's that cape you made up like?"
Parahumans,34gm3i,ErrantVagrant,2,Sat May 2 22:20:17 2015 UTC,"Those are good points, ones I tend to overlook it seems. He should be tough but no where near unstoppable unless he goes all Nilbog on everyone.  Possibly a 7 for the changer rating, I'm wary about putting him above that due to Marquis also sitting at that level, who is, as we know, absurdly competent. It could be lower than that slightly but not by much (can't remember exactly how the ratings systems work, so 7 seems the best position), also, this is a threat indicator system after all. Probably would get rated with a brute subclass at maybe 3 or 4 due to it being commonly used by him. Maybe a low level stranger, because he does disguise himself but not that well right now (great horror potential if done right though).  Well, for reference we generally just call her the crazy lady.  Bludgeon  Brute/Striker/Thinker/Breaker  Her power isn't exactly too dangerous, but it's a combo pack including the ability to bestow invincibility on held objects (below Siberian level but otherwise pretty tough), enhanced reaction times and a point-blank telekinesis (e.g. Browbeat and Blowout) limited to the object she's holding and the limbs used to hold it (which allows her to ignore the weight of any object below a certain size and the ability to swing it unnaturally fast). Or in other words she can kill you with literally any object she's holding. Now, for backstory.  Bludgeon is a former Ward who used to go by the name of Baton, fighting less for justice than personal entertainment. She left the Wards after being kidnapped by a largely unpowered villain group, upon which she broke out of containment, killed or injured everyone in her way and left the city, looking for something better (i.e. less boring) to do. Generally speaking, she doesn't kill unless irritated, nor does she attack civilians (there are a few notable exceptions, she caused one of our other characters to trigger when she was entertaining herself), but she has been known to go after other capes, ignoring distinctions of hero, villain or vigilante. Her targets are typically capes with a lot of potential, as she's typically curious to see what they can do if pushed, although movers and strangers are typically considered boring and she leaves many of them alone, her current favourite target being a cape who happens to be stronger when close to the brink of death. Despite no longer being a member of the Wards, as far as Bludgeon is concerned she never technically left, by virtue of not handing in her resignment. As for appearance, she's a small 17 year old girl who wears the remains of her old Wards uniform, a miniature riot police uniform with the name Baton written over the chest and a cartoon-bandit style eye-mask beneath the visor."
Parahumans,34gm3i,Plecky,1 point,Sat May 2 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds interesting!  I'd like to see their fight, too.  I think if he encountered a cape he'd try to disable them ASAP.  And yeah, I do tend to put absurd amounts of thought into very silly things sometimes.  Granted, he could jump up several numbers if he decided to go that far, and even go to S class if he figured out the ""pinch off living things"" trick and intended to use it, but I honestly think the main thing holding him back is the limit on not being able to mess with his own brain very much.  Even if he spread it out throughout his body, that would mean a hit to any one part of his body would give a type of brain damage.  Also, went and re-found that google doc with the classification system in it."

Admittedly we do have that villain who teleports through steam explosions and a heroic protagonist with an S-class power (think city-wide uncontrolled carnivorous mould infestation as one of the more dangerous outcomes of their power).  And that's not really a problem, overthinking things is fun. Honestly though, if the Simurgh gets this guy or Bonesaw has a little talk this could get pretty nasty.

Parahumans,34gm3i,BlueberryPhi,6,Fri May 1 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's a quickie.  Mori:  Master/Trump/Breaker  Mori is a fifteen year-old villain whose antics are more tolerated by the local Protectorate than most.  Little is actually known about him; due to the (relatively few) times he's been seen in person, and the times that those appearances have been made, it is believed that he either skips school frequently, or doesn't go to school.  Despite his antics, he frequently helps the local Protectorate and PRT with information, hints, and occasionally assisting them despite the (initially comedic) nature of his power.  Simply put, he animates toys.  Sure, he does action figures, but he can also animate toys that have no joints or parts.  Though the sight of a group of army men approaching is comical at first, one should still be wary.  Their weapons act as scaled-down versions of the real thing.  While those little green assault rifles may not pierce the skin, the rocket launchers can hurt.  At first, it was believed that this was the extent of his power.  Quickly, however, several surprisingly effective hacking attacks on PRT systems were revealed to have been perpetrated by Dragon herself.  Or, rather, a Dragon action figure, assisted by several other Protectorate action figures.  Protectorate members who were mobilized to where the hacks were originating from were repelled by a large army of wargaming figures.  With the secrets that he holds, and the figures under his command, he is officially listed as ""helpful, but ultimately unimportant.""  In return, he continues to assist both the Protectorate (and Cauldron) where he can, while only committing petty thefts.  He knows that if he pushes it, though, a mysteriously competent woman in a suit will show up on his doorstep...  and then he'll be no more.  The secrets he holds are what keeps him safe for as long as he never uses any of them.  Ryo Akikawa lives in an abandoned and sealed off subway station under a hotel.  He survives by using his figurines to go out and collect funds.  His power demands that at least three hours of his day be spent recharging his large collection of figures, figurines, and toys.  Many retain their skills and powers (or in the case of figurines that aren't capes, powers that mimic their canon powers), with appropriate damage scales for their size.  They have a particular loyalty to him; even cowards are willing to lay down their lives for him.  He ran away from home at the age of nine, and increasingly finds dealing with real people difficult as the years pass by.  But look at all the friends he has...  He doesn't remember how he triggered, but given what he's learned about trigger events, he's willing to bet that his mind suppressed the memories.  He's in absolutely no rush to regain them.  Edit:  Minor ones because I made that sound more irritated than I meant.  Work is pissing me off today, sorry."

Once it is turned off, the energy that was lost returns to the object, further heating it up. The temperature swap is relative to the heat of the object, and the increase of heat is relative to the ambient temperature. I have no idea if that made sense, but its a bit more fleshed out in my mind.

The orb is capable of flying at high speeds and redirects all damage it would take (were it not invincible) to surrounding (Manton-limited objects).

This power has some pretty nice uses, the following included:   Flight, typically by swapping forms repeatedly. Power negation. Pseudo-invincibility, contingent on prediction and keeping at least one twin safe or by blocking the attack with the other twin. Aiming allies powers, or causing enemy powers to backfire.   They are extraordinarily quiet, and, though they'll accept interviews with the press their answers rarely exceed a couple of lines.

Parahumans,34gm3i,TotesMessenger,2,Fri May 1 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"Is this pre- or post-Golden Morning? There's one cape from the ""now-out-of-the-bird-cageddit"" but I'm not sure about the rest... For now, though:  Yean  A villainous Master who can bud small figures (about 3 inches tall) off the most abundant material within three metres or her body, which ever there is more of. They obey her mental commands to the best of their ability but always attack via biting and chewing; anything consumed this way appears to be converted to biomass and used to regenerate herself. No upper limit on the number of minions she can control has been found, and she also has extremely fine control over their formation, being able to determine the exact speed of the process, which organs form first and their physical shape.  She second-triggered in the aftermath of Gold Morning from being controlled by Khepri. This enabled her to actively choose where her minions emerge and removed Manton limitations on her power.  EDIT: A faction based on some characters from my other non-Worm-related stories. They're open to new members (hint hint)...  The Explorers formed in the wake of Gold Morning after the founding members discovered that their powers interacted similarly to Scrub and Labyrinth's. They occasionally do paid work opening portals to other Earths, but their leader is far more interested in exploration and scientific research than making money. The fact that none of their current members actually need it helps.     Smute: A Shaker who can manipulate matter on a molecular level and transmute elements. He can't go too far up or down the periodic table when transmuting elements though, only two rows' of difference at most. Has a fascination with Khepri.  Quinn: A 14-year-old Alexandria package cape whose power makes use of pocket dimensions. He has several of them which he can choose to encase himself in, where he is immune to or can bend certain physical laws (e.g. one might grant immunity to gravity and friction, another might allow him to alter the flow of time inside and so on). ""The Bear Squad"": A collection of five teddy bears with rudimentary intelligence, movement and speech capabilities and above-average durability for a teddy bear. The Tinker who made them was killed in Gold Morning and they have been unofficially ""adopted"" by Quinn."
Parahumans,34g13x,coderman9,5,Thu Apr 30 21:00:46 2015 UTC,"It says that GU can take the powers of the dead, wounded, and dying. So I would say maybe a death touch just for those. But I'm not sure she could touch a fully healthy cape and just kill them."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,11,Thu Apr 30 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"Then how would she get going? It is not like cape corpses are lying around for her to claim.   ""dead, wounded, and dying"" are very different states for a person to be in.  When she first triggered the only power she would have had would be her sight. Not exactly a power-set to begin collecting people. Even the weakest capes could have beat her.   The big issue for me is that she couldn't have claimed Gray Boy without a death-touch. He is immortal, if she could only claim from the dead she could have never took him."
Parahumans,34g13x,Rillet,12,Thu Apr 30 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"On Gray Boy, he does actually stay dead for a moment when you kill him, so she could have stolen his power away during that time.  I totally agree on her getting started, though."
Parahumans,34g13x,Whispersilk,8,Fri May 1 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"Her power has a master element.  Possibly her trigger involved losing a powered loved one, whom she desperately wished wouldn't leave her alone.  She got that wish in a typical shard-derived way.  And as for Gray Boy, I always assumed that by the time she went for him, she had some cape capable of putting him down.  Lily can't be the only one ever able to beat his defensive power."
Parahumans,34g13x,Iconochasm,1 point,Fri May 1 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"As whispersilk said, Gray Boy is dead for a split second before he snaps back in time, so maybe she could regular kill him and then grab the power."
Parahumans,34g13x,thyrfa,5,Sun May 3 19:02:38 2015 UTC,As a trump she could have triggered at an Endbringer event or some other large fight. Collecting the shards of a few dying capes would be easy.
Parahumans,34g13x,AerosolHubris,2,Fri May 1 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"Fair. If she triggered near a large cape event, she could have claimed one of them."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,3,Fri May 1 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"I will give you the ""how did she start up"" thing, because that's a legitimate question. But I can't give you the gray boy thing. All she'd have to do is kill him (which is possible) and then claim his shard before he resets. He's not unkillable. He just resets. So all she has to do is kill him and claim it quick.   As for how she got her other powers at first? Could be a death touch. But I feel we should have heard more about her death touch if she can kill a completely healthy cape with just a touch. Like where is her striker rating?? Why isn't it mentioned outright? I won't say it's impossible. I stopped saying it was impossible awhile ago. I still don't buy death touch for a full health cape."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,2,Fri May 1 00:37:54 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that just give her a trump rating because it only interacts with parahumans (not PRT agents)
Parahumans,34g13x,dogninja8,5,Fri May 1 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"It would still be trump/striker. It's still a touch based power. Regardless of if it works on just capes or not.   In a nonconfrontational way, I'm done debating if she has the power. No big deal, but regardless of what we say we won't get to a real conclusion unless wildbow answers. If she has it, she has it. My question is, if she does have it, why didn't we hear about it? Why didn't she have a striker rating? Why didn't anyone mention it. If a cape how a power to kill a cape by touch alone, we should know. She could literally walk through a crowd of capes and kill them with just a poke. So why didn't we hear about it??   Maybe she has it. Maybe she doesn't. No biggie either way. Story is still amazing. I'm gonna personally stick with the whole she can only take it from dead dying or wounded. And if the person is alive still (the whole dying or wounded part) then yeah, it kills them. I'll stick with that unless wildbow says otherwise. If he DOES chime in, it's cool either way. I'm still just not 100% sold on it.   As for the striker rating, again it doesn't matter if it's just capes or not. Capes work with the prt. Capes use the rating system. GU is a master/trump/thinker and MAYBE a striker, though I've never heard of that rating."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,2,Fri May 1 00:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the first time Weaver and GU meet, Taylor comments that she could tear away the power there and leave her dead.  And Taylor wasn't near death at the time."
Parahumans,34g13x,Lexilogical,1 point,Fri May 1 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"Someone else commented with that. That's not what the quote said. Maybe it meant that, but it's not worded that way."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,1 point,Fri May 1 11:26:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I caught that argument as soon as I found the quote.  On the other hand, in my quest to find it I found a line that seems to support my Parian theory, so not a total loss."
Parahumans,34g13x,Lexilogical,1 point,Fri May 1 11:28:10 2015 UTC,Parian theory? Care to share?
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,1 point,Fri May 1 12:15:51 2015 UTC,"Well, apparently there's a true use for Parian's shard that just hasn't been seen at all in the story.  One that would actually allow her to delay Behemoth for a significantly long time, and somehow hasn't actually been guessed yet.    My theory has mostly been that what she actually controls is either air or a common gas (like nitrogen or oxygen).  It would explain why her telekinesis sort of explodes and dissipates when she tries to carry heavy things, and why it needs absorbent materials that it can soak into if she's actually controlling the air within the material and not the fabrics themselves.  Plus, if she's actually an airbender like A:TLA, then faced with Behemoth she could push aside his fire, disrupt his sound waves, and possibly even redirect his lightning with a good blast of air.  So while I was looking for that scene where Taylor meets GU, I stumbled onto the scene where Bonesaw switches allegiance, and Taylor is watching Grue and Parian get increasingly uncomfortable to the point of using their powers unconsciously. Grue just does Grue, but then she looks at Parian:   And Parian, her hair and frock stirring as if there was a wind blowing."
Parahumans,34g13x,Lexilogical,9,Fri May 1 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"She can touch a fully healthy cape and just kill them. From 27.4:   She reached up, placing a hand on the side of my face.  It was warm from the fire.  Her thumb brushed along my cheekbone, the long nail coming dangerously close to my eye.  She could kill me right here.  Pull my passenger away from me and claim it."
Parahumans,34g13x,sanctaphrax,3,Fri May 1 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"This quote has been tossed out before. That quote is 100% not clear. She says ""she could kill me. Rip my power out and claim it."" Now, if she were to say ""she could pull my power out and claim it, killing me"" THEN I would be 100% on board. But the quote says ""kill-pull-claim"" which perfectly fits the whole ""claims the powers of the dead"". It could also fit in the other way. But it is NOT good evidence. It could EASILY mean she could kill Taylor with one of her hundreds or powers and THEN take her power. So it just doesn't sell it for me."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,11,Fri May 1 01:34:55 2015 UTC,"Your reading sounds a bit tortured, to me. Given the way it's written, and the way that Taylor and Marquis alike treat Glaistig's touch as worrying, I think it's pretty clear that she has a death touch.  And I mean, why wouldn't she? It's a natural enough power for her to have.  If you're wondering about the Marquis reference, it's from his interlude.   “Agreed.”  Glaistig Uaine replied.  She extended a hand to Amelia, and Marquis tensed.  Do I stop her?  Every rational part of his psyche told him that the leader of cell block C had no quarrel with his daughter, that she was in no danger.  Every other part of him was telling him to stop her.   If she just killed people with her collected powers, Marquis's reaction wouldn't make much sense."
Parahumans,34g13x,sanctaphrax,2,Fri May 1 01:49:57 2015 UTC,"Another thing people have tossed out. Why wouldn't people be afraid to touch her? She's GU. One of the strongest and most dangerous capes in existence. Please, go ahead and grab her hand. Let's see how scared you get.   Of course everyone is afraid to touch her. I'd be afraid to touch her. I'd also be afraid to touch crawler, mannequin, jack slash, bonesaw, siberian, etc. Yet...none of them have a death touch.   And I'm not sure why my reading sounds ""tortured"". It just sounds like you want to argue it.   As I said, if she has it she has it. I won't be upset if she does. I'm just not sold on it. We haven't seen anything solid. The quotes are weak. She's scary. That's a given. If you wanna believe she has it, please do. I will believe she doesn't. If wildbow says she has it, then I'm wrong and I accept that. Not a big deal. But if she has it, I just want to know why it wasn't mentioned and why she doesn't have a striker rating. That's it. I'm not even saying it's impossible anymore. Just that I don't buy it."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,4,Fri May 1 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well, its not that I'd just be afraid of touching Mannequin, I'd just be afraid of him in general.  The reason a deathtouch seems plausible is that, on three separate occasions, its GU's touch that is specifically mentioned, and the catalyst for these thoughts.  The reason why Taylor's quote implies that GU has a deathtouch is because Taylor specifically brought up the idea of death when GU touched her.  Taylor didn't start worrying when GU started talking to her, Taylor didn't start worrying about that when sitting next to GU:  The two sentences,   She could kill me right here. Pull my passenger away from me and claim it.  Are italicized in the chapter  so its what Taylor thinks right when GU touches her.    If Taylor was just scared of GU in general, it seems more likely that Taylor would have had some sort of scared thoughts in the beginning of the conversation, not specifically when GU touched her.    And this same pattern happens for the other two quotes as well.  On all three occasions, people start freaking out right when GU touches someone, not before.  I have to disagree with your argument.  I disagree with your assessment that the quotes are weak.  It seems to be pretty clearly implying that GU's touch is specifically dangerous.    Also, how do you know GU's ratings?  Maybe she does have a striker rating, we never get to see her PRT file afterall."
Parahumans,34g13x,Interpretations,0,Fri May 1 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"I still find that argument incredibly weak. She's a scary person. It's not outlandish for you to be even MORE scared when she's touching you.   As I've said before, maybe that passage does indicate a death touch. If so, so be it. Cool. I still wanna know why we heard nothing concrete and why she doesn't have a striker rating. But I don't mind if she has it. All I'm saying is I've seen no good evidence. If she has it, she has it and that's great."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,2,Fri May 1 12:15:28 2015 UTC,"Source for her not having a striker rating?  We never see GU's PRT file in-story, we never hear a PRT assessment of her powers.    As for the not being outlandish thing, I'm assuming the author decided for a reason to specifically make people freak out when GU touches them, but not necessarily before.  Its not like those 3 reactions happened the same way as a coincidence."
Parahumans,34g13x,Interpretations,2,Fri May 1 12:16:41 2015 UTC,"The wiki, cast page, and TV tropes page. All pages I've ever seen have given her master/trump/thinker. I will, however, admit that those sources are tenuous.   The author could definitely have used those scenes to imply a death touch. BUT. The author could also use it to show how scared people are of her. To show that even Marquis is scared of being too close to her.  Not hard to believe.   What I'm saying is, if GU can go up to any cape, no matter how healthy and how strong, and just brush we fingers across their arm and kill them instantly, shouldn't we have heard about this before? Doesn't that seem like something that should have been mentioned?? I'm not even denying the possibility anymore. Just saying I don't buy it."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,1 point,Fri May 1 12:26:14 2015 UTC,Doesn't that seem like something that should have been mentioned??   Not really. Wildbow constantly witholds information throughout the story. Endbringers were mentioned numerous times before we had any idea of what they were. A lot of things we take as fact are also only ever implied.
Parahumans,34g13x,TildeAleph,0,Fri May 1 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"Those sources aren't just tenous, they're worthless.  And I think we have heard about it."
Parahumans,34g13x,sanctaphrax,2,Fri May 1 15:48:13 2015 UTC,I think this may be more of an in-universe issue.  People in-universe believe she has death touch based on how absolutely terrifying she is and how they've probably seen her do the death touch thing to dead/wounded/dying capes before and just assumed she could do it to anyone without knowing of the limitation on it like we do.
Parahumans,34g13x,Rein_Aurre,1 point,Fri May 1 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"""knowing of the limitation on it like we do""  What are you talking about?  Far as I can tell we have no evidence that there's a limitation on it."
Parahumans,34g13x,sanctaphrax,2,Fri May 1 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"I can't really search for it due to being at work, but wasn't there a quote from the text about her only being able to use it on the dead, wounded, or dying?"
Parahumans,34g13x,Rein_Aurre,1 point,Fri May 1 18:48:04 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. I'm also at work but that's the impression I was under.

Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,3,Fri May 1 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"GU's power is actually the retrieval mechanism used by the entities to recollect their shards. Her death-touch isn't actually death-touch any more than Panacea's healing is healing. Her shard can consume other shards, but ripping out the shard connected to a living human is essentially tearing out a piece of his/her brain, so basically always going to kill."
Parahumans,34g13x,Disposable_Face,1 point,Fri May 1 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"I like the explanation. Still not 100% sold on the existence of instadeath. But if it's true, I'd buy it this way."
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,2,Fri May 1 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, if Panacea or Riley were there, they might be able to fix it so the person losing their shard doesn't die, and Dragon could probably straight up survive losing her Tinker Shard."
Parahumans,34g13x,Disposable_Face,2,Fri May 1 20:41:06 2015 UTC,Interesting. I wonder what dragon would be like if she got her shard ripped from her.
Parahumans,34g13x,Ignis_ex,2,Fri May 1 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"Well she'd lose the ability to create new tinker tech, but her intelligence and self-awareness aren't tied to the shard, so she'd still be Dragon. The interesting question would be if perfect memory would allow her to rebuild tinkertech she had already designed  but prevent her from altering it or making new designs, or she just flat out lost all her technical knowledge.  That said, I think GU missed a huge opportunity by not grabbing  three tinker shards and using them to make awesome armor and weapons for herself, having tech to grant flight, armor, and utility would free up her ghost choices in the field. Even if the tinker ghosts would be largely useless in the field."
Parahumans,34g13x,Disposable_Face,1 point,Sat May 2 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"Oooh. Yeah. If she used the tinkers just to create and repair tech, she could replace the ghost that she would have used for flight with like a jet pack. That's smart. Frees her up to use something different. Interesting."

Many polearm styles can be used with a halberd in one form or another, both Asian and European.  Though, I always wanted to see Armsmaster go straight up against another halberd user.  I've seen various people go at it, and it's always amusing.  Two novices look hilariously gimpy.  Someone with a high degree of skill versus a novice is an amusing beatdown.  Get two highly skilled users, and it suddenly looks gimpy again to an outside observer.  Or at least, it always did to me."

He had lowered his hood and removed his glowing mask, revealing a middle-aged man with thick eyebrows, thinning hair and heavy cheeks.  He looked more like an average family man who was getting dressed up as Eidolon for a costume party than he looked like Eidolon himself.""  -Interlude 14.5   I've seen plenty of pictures of Eidolon being majestic and powerful, but the above is my favorite description of him in the series.  I wanted an excuse for one of his flowing sleeves to be awkwardly pushed back, so I gave him a tiny plate. I think if I clean this up a bit, I'll replace it with a coffee mug."

The glasses add a nice touch, which wouldn't have shown up in that interlude (It's Yamada's interlude, right?).    One thing that I think is obvious about Eidolon's power, which I think some people would disagree with me on is the flexibility of his powers with regard to its limitations. I'm pretty sure the story says at, one point, that he can consistently use one of this powers to get an Alexandria package, even though that's functionally more then one power. I imagine that the limit only becomes an issue for when he's selecting big level 10 powers, but if he just wants a cool echo to his voice or his green glow, then he can get something like that pretty easily, even if he already has 3 other powers."

People have studied this, and hell, there are entire research groups devoted to it.  And not just the PRT, colleges have departments devoted towards parahuman studies.  They can study certain powers and say ""We know how this operates.""  They might not be able to say HOW it operates, but they might know why it does.    ""This speedster can't hit as hard while going fast, why?  Because he's effectively displacing his mass to move faster.""  That sort of thing.    By claiming that it's magic, it undermines these studies.  Magic and science don't intersect in people's minds.  In other words, if folks think it's magic, then people aren't as likely to throw grants at studying it.  There are plenty of connotations that they average person draws when you say magic.  It implies grimoires, people learning new spells, the fact that anybody can theoretically learn it, etc.  This in turn causes folks to get all sorts of nasty connotations.  It's very easy for the common person to fall into all sorts of ideological traps with this.  This same issue comes up with claiming it's a power granted by (insert theological figure here).  But I'll save that debate for a future thread, after my coworker finishes the story.  In short, while there probably are a lot of people who do think that it's magic or miracles or work of (insert evil theological figure here), people are campaigning against it being considered as such just as fiercely.

I mean you basically have physics breaking powers that can be measured in controlled conditions.  There are many capes that very blatantly break several fundamental physical laws such as matter creation.  Of course we reader know that they get these powers from other worlds but the mainstream public doesn't know this.

Even though they might seem to contradict previous scientific rules, superpowers follow clear patterns, (trigger events, the Manton effect, 2nd-generation capes).

Something that I personally thought of was Dragon giving Alexandria a tool to cut off and contain a piece of Leviathan for testing. I'm pretty sure that Blasto had samples of leviathan so we know something like this was done at some point, and having Alexandria go in with some tool would be preferable because worst case scenario is that she gets hit and the tool breaks. After you have the sample you can start work on a chemical weapon of some kind, so it seems like a smart idea to me."

Parahumans,34bu6z,NamedByAFish,3,Thu Apr 30 00:27:26 2015 UTC,"In this headcanon, they operate entirely as part of their local police branch, just as a specialised unit tasked with dealing with parahuman crime in the area. Coordination for grabbing capes from multiple branches is done through the largest one - Birmingham West Midlands - which operates as a sort of 'head office' for the King's Men Divisions nationwide."
Parahumans,34bu6z,ElaraSilk,3,Thu Apr 30 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"So, this is interesting stuff. Doesn't quite match up with my headcanon (I am about 20k words into my own UK-based story), so I'm just going to go into my headcanon first, then I'll come back to my detailed thoughts on you ideas.  1) There is no official, government backed hero team equivalent to the Protectorate. There are two main government-recognised teams, the King's Men and the Suits, both of which get existent but inadequate government support (as shown in the fact Number Man ends up shifting money in to prop them up).  2) The King's Men are the older team - they came up in the first few years of capes in the UK. Initially ""the"" group of heroes in the UK, they got their guts ripped out fighting S-Class threats, and as time wears on have become more and more reactionary. Especially among ethnic-minority Britons, the Kings Men are seen as bigoted and untrustworthy.  3) The Suits are a newer team. They had their beginnings in the UK, but have spread to several other European nations, especially France, Benelux and Italy (possibly also the Nordics) - Germany has the Meisters, and I'm not sure about Iberia or Eastern Europe. They're more ""hip"" and ""cool"", also less racist, unfortunately no more solvent. The Suits partly fall into the trap that the UK Govt sees them as ""European"" and getting funding from everywhere, whereas other governments around Europe see them as ""British"" and mostly supported by the UK.  4) There is no direct equivalent of the PRT. Police Armed Response units carry containment foam these days, to deal with minor cape problems, and in fact are mostly called out to respond to parahuman incidents. However in cases of bigger issues local Army units are called in under MACP*, equipped with full military gear + containment foam and any other equipment.  5) In particularly cape-heavy cities, or in spates of bad violence like gang wars, there may be regular Army patrols of the area. These will generally have at least one Police constable accompanying, because soldiers don't have police powers (e.g. power to arrest someone, power to stop and search).  6) The King's Men and Suits will both have branches across the country. They may have one each in the same city (they'll both have a London branch, for example), but they mostly won't overlap; so the King's Men will have Leeds, the Suits will then go for Sheffield or Bradford. King's Men have Cardiff, the Suits set up across the Channel in Bristol. That sort of thing. A few places will have local teams of heroes - there will definitely be at least one in London, one in Birmingham, probably either a Glaswegian or a Scottish team, etc.  7) Suits and King's Men are paid as-resources-permit, based on things like seizure of drugs, donations from grateful local authorities etc. The government does give payments for fighting major threats. Of course, prospects for independent heroes are no better, explaining why people don't just leave.  8) Because of monetary issues, those who have powers with business uses are more likely to use them and do at least some rogue-work than US heroes. True Rogues are still rare, but ""Villains"" who mostly sell services to people and ""Heroes"" who do a lot of other work are quite common.  9) PRT classifications are somewhat known, but not in official use. The UK doesn't have Thinkers, Masters, Tinkers, Blasters etc. The classification I've come up with is having certain early, well-known capes (a lot of them early Kings Men) becoming type-names for similar parahumans. So Freeshot-Type or F-Type capes are a kind of Blaster/Striker (Ballistic is an F-Type, as is Legend); Tinkers are Shedmen-Type or S-Type; Thinkers are Clio-Type/C-Type. Brute/Mover combos are Alexandria-Type/A-Type, and so on. I don't have a complete list yet, but while some categories line up with the PRT classifications, some don't (for example Master is split between created minions and controlled minions).  10) While I'm talking language, Brits are more likely to refer to capes as ""parahumans"" or ""paras"" than ""capes"".  Now, as to thoughts on what you've come up with:  My main problem with it is that if the King's Men are official and part of the various police services, why are they so short of money that Number Man is propping them up? I mean, government departments can go through chronic underfunding, but not to the extent of having to shut down entirely. I think Number Man's interlude shows, therefore, that the Kings Men have to be independent.  They would clearly work quite closely with the police and other authorities, but as I say I'm really bothered by the idea of them actually being a government agency (not least because of the name - even if Liz II has died early, they'd be more likely to be called the King's Parahuman Service or something than the King's Men, and that's if they take a Royal title at all, rather than just being the Parahuman Service, Parahuman Volunteer Constabulary or whatever).  Beyond that, though I have gone for something different, I quite like the idea of the Suits being a secondary membership you can hold, over and above being part of the King's Men.  A secondary note about terminology - the UK doesn't have police departments. We have police services/police forces, usually named as either x police or x constabulary, where x will usually be one or more counties. For example, the Metropolitan Police, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, the West Yorkshire Police.  Akin to helicopters, Armed Response Units &c, multiple police services may share one group of parahumans. Remember that the UK is fairly small, and if they have a mover, tinker-tech vehicles or even just a mundane helicopter a group of parahumans can cover a lot of population in very little time.  I'm interested to see what more you come up with.  *Military Aid to the Civil Power - basically the civil power, in this case the Police, goes ""Oh shit I can't handle this"" and gets on the line to the local Army commander."

Parahumans,34bu6z,NamedByAFish,3,Thu Apr 30 03:10:33 2015 UTC,groan  Someone should put bullet ants in all your socks for that one.  /u/ughzubat is a nice person and does not deserve bullet ants in his socks.
Parahumans,34bu6z,ughzubat,2,Thu Apr 30 03:29:10 2015 UTC,I... feel like I missed my own pun. What was the joke??  I was talking about the literal deck of cards that we use today being french in origin
Parahumans,34bu6z,NamedByAFish,3,Thu Apr 30 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was me seeing a pun where there was none. Previous comment edited appropriately."

Parahumans,34bu6z,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:59:37 2015 UTC,"French playing cards:       French playing cards (jeu de cartes) are cards that use the French suits of trèfles (clovers or clubs♣), carreaux (tiles or diamonds♦), cœurs (hearts♥), and piques (pikes or spades♠). Each suit contains three face cards; the Valet (Knave or Jack), the Dame (Lady or Queen), and the Roi (King). Aside from these aspects, decks can include a wide variety of regional and national patterns which often have different deck sizes. In comparison to Spanish, Italian, German, and Swiss playing cards, French cards are the most widespread due to the geopolitical, commercial, and cultural influence of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in the past two centuries. Another reason for their expansion was the simplicity of the suit insignia which simplifies mass production and the popularity of Whist, Contract Bridge, and the recent Poker boom.

Parahumans,34bu6z,EatZelda_ShitAwesome,2,Thu Apr 30 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was under the impression that the Suits were another group in the UK working with law enforcement because the King's Men took too many losses against the Endbringers and couldn't keep themselves afloat financially."
Parahumans,34bu6z,DrOlot,2,Thu Apr 30 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"The Suits are stated to be a 'European super-group'. I just figured, well, what's the main reason to have a team of capes drawn from all across Europe, in addition to the local capes? S-class response - it means that all countries in the union have some form of easily organised outside backup if things escalate too far for them to handle, and said organised backup always has at least a couple of members with local knowledge to guide the response group and play translator. All governments have a vested interest in something like that, so I'd expect the EU administration in Brussels to invest heavily in the initiative, but that doesn't mean they didn't start out as a private organisation before being subsumed by government oversight."
Parahumans,34bu6z,TyrialFrost,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:11:42 2015 UTC,I think the naming scheme is less unlikely than the Kingsmen for an official government body in the UK.
Parahumans,34bu6z,Takver_,2,Thu Apr 30 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"Inducted parahumans are expected to undergo the same tests and training as are regular officers   If your going to have the Kingsmen become warranted officers, you should also look at those who cant pass becoming the equivalent to community support officers (CSO)    a uniformed civilian member of police support staff in England and Wales. They are non-warranted but are provided a variety of Police powers.   This way they build a 'hero' population, even if they aren't quite up to Kingsmen standards.   Underage parahumans are encouraged to associate with the King’s Men through an apprenticeship scheme.   I think you're missing an opportunity to co-opt the british tradition of full scholarships to elite boarding schools.   The Suits are a European initiative   If it was really Brittish, then the Suits would not be allowed to operate on British soil, but they would allow Kingsmen to be seconded to fill vacant Suits positions.  Im not sure I like the use of Tarot cards, I think traditional decks would be better, The Suits could be establish from an EU Charter with a static 52 parahuman positions with four divisions based in North, South, Eastern and Western Europe. Each suit has its speciality e.g Diamonds (North) is heavily Tinker/brute based and in a S class threat when the whole deck is shuffled they handle a lot of the close in work."

Parahumans,34co4u,natsugo,3,Thu Apr 30 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"Skitter once described his power as ""ferrokinetic shapeshifting"", so maybe shape shifting with a different material? If the child's shard bounced off of, say, Shatterbirds, then you could have a silicakinetic shapeshifter.  Let's try Jack Slash."
Parahumans,34co4u,Gnimhey,6,Thu Apr 30 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"Brand. Instead of broadcasting sharp planes of kinetic force, broadcasts thermal energy, with heat immunity and touch-range Manton-limited pyrokinesis (ping off of Burnscar). As a consequence, can inflict horrific burns at a distance by projecting heat off a hot iron or torch.  Chevalier."

Parahumans,34co4u,NamedByAFish,3,Thu Apr 30 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"A very similar power, except this exerts a force on anyone in the teleport-clones' path. If it grazes you, you get knocked over or shoved out of the way. If you're unlucky enough to be right in the way, you either get crushed by the initial blunt-force trauma or you get thrown up to several hundred feet (depending on the angle) when the child stops moving. The teleport-clones don't feel the forces exerted on them, and a small amount of that durability stays with the child when not teleporting, amounting to an additional Brute 3 rating.  Legend"
Parahumans,34co4u,Igigigif,3,Thu Apr 30 04:09:59 2015 UTC,Can rewrite memories on contact.  Faultline

Parahumans,34co4u,paradoxinclination,6,Thu Apr 30 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Hummm, Broadcast. A bud from that shard might give the ability to read others emotions, and to push your own emotions onto them. Would be kinda like Cherish, actually, only more limited. Otherwise maybe you'd get the kinetic projection ability, only from your own body instead of a weapon.  Shadow Stalker"
