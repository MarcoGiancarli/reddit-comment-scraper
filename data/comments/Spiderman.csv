Spiderman,3e3dba,teh_longinator,6,Tue Jul 21 21:16:27 2015 UTC,Did you even read it?

Spiderman,3e4y4u,katezor,4,Wed Jul 22 00:07:23 2015 UTC,I think the beginning of ultimate is good. Peter stays young and the art style is pretty appealing action wise. Also a lot easier to digest than amazing at times.

Spiderman,3e0obz,vhisic,4,Tue Jul 21 05:05:33 2015 UTC,I'd do it
Spiderman,3e0obz,YoureASquidNow,4,Tue Jul 21 06:34:07 2015 UTC,I saw this on Twitter and was under the impression that you only had to do it for a month and any extra months were optional. Disappointing.. I could've gone for a month.

Spiderman,3e0obz,jhk0215,4,Tue Jul 21 01:37:56 2015 UTC,If it were 15k a month I would take it
Spiderman,3e0obz,dragn99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"5K a month is over a quarter of a million dollars every year. If there was a point where I could quit (given two weeks notice) or even just accrue holiday periods where I don't have to carry around the Inflatable Spider-Man for a week or two out of the year, I'd be all over this.  But I feel like there's a very real possibility of me failing to keep the Inflatable Spider-Man at my side due to unforseen circumstances, and having to pay back all the money I've earned would be more impossible than carrying around an 8' Inflatable Spider-Man."
Spiderman,3e0obz,Jesse402,3,Tue Jul 21 14:34:24 2015 UTC,5K a month is over a quarter of a million dollars every year.   5000*12=60000  A quarter of a million dollars is 250000.

Spiderman,3dynr1,WickedMurderousPanda,24,Tue Jul 21 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Spider-Man (issue 1-160 plus annuals) is IMO the single best superhero story of all time. It hits practically every Spidey beat that has been made in his history and it is actually allowed to end. I know bc of how the comic book medium is, real proper endings don't happen often (and I am ok with that) but this is something special."
Spiderman,3dynr1,utlonghorn2016,11,Mon Jul 20 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Spider-Man was actually the first full series I read, some of the first comics I read too. I'm very very glad it was because it's such an amazing story. I recommend it to anyone who likes spidey and wants to get into comics, it's amazing."
Spiderman,3dynr1,Dumebuggy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"Same here. I was a huge Spidey fan for years, and by god did it touch everything I wanted it to, and more. Spidey's always been my favorite because, IMO, you see so much more of his human side than you do with so many other comic book characters, and that really helped me relate in a new way. I have to admit, I teared up a bit at some parts, and I miss reading the series for the first time. Art style was amazing, too."

Spiderman,3e01sj,griver94,6,Mon Jul 20 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Really, any of the Dan Slott run up to Spider Island, but yeah...Big Time is pretty rad, and sets up where Peter is in his life by the time Island takes place."
Spiderman,3e01sj,Kiltboy989,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, personally I would actually start at the Brand New Day arc, but that is pretty far back and it seems OP is not wanting to have to read a lot beforehand"

But regardless, all of those arcs led UP to Spider Island and THEN to Superior Spider-Man. I have to say, Spidey has been one of the most consistently good, momentum-filled books of the last five years."
Spiderman,3e01sj,Kiltboy989,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:13 2015 UTC,Up until Superior Spider-Man finished. That was really the height of Slott's work and everything post-Superior has felt like a letdown. Hopefully with the completely different direction this new #1 is taking Spidey reinvigorates Slott's writing.

Spiderman,3e1cys,mrglass8,5,Tue Jul 21 05:09:47 2015 UTC,"As with anything, it depends how and why it is done. People would have said similar things about Bucky being resurrected, but Winter Soldier managed it in a tasteful and satisfying way. If the same were done for Uncle Ben, it would be welcome.  That being said, I have difficulty imagining a satisfactory explanation for Uncle Ben being revived beyond being a plot device, so I don't really expect it to happen."

Spiderman,3e15vi,Xeno-ken,8,Tue Jul 21 04:00:07 2015 UTC,Probably by letting Raimi do his thing with the movie rather than the studio interference that shoe horned Venom into the movie.
Spiderman,3e15vi,StargateGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 06:02:20 2015 UTC,"There's way, way too much going on in the film. Of course, Sony realizes now that they should have just let Raimi make the movie that he wanted to make; he knows what he's doing. Unfortunately, it's two franchises too late for that now. I think having one major villain in this particular film is important. For the sake of sticking to Raimi's plan, I'll say Sandman (he never wanted Venom). So, leaving Venom out entirely, including the black suit, we can focus on Sandman rising as a villain, and Harry's amnesia/evil subplot where the film still ends in Harry's redemption/death. We can also now provide much more attention to other rushed subplots, such as MJ feeling invalidated and overshadowed by Peter, as well as Peters relationships with Aunt May, those at the Daily Bugle (perhaps introducing Brock just as an employee), and Ursula and Mr. Ditkovich.  I think Gwen should have been left out as well. A love triangle type situation could have been in a fourth film (as OP said), where Peter is introduced to venom and the black suit makes him play the field with the ladies. Perhaps Gwen dies in this film and results in Peter getting Venom off of earth for good.   Spider-Man 5 could have started work on the story that was once supposed to be Spider-Man 4. Curt Connors can finally become the lizard (as was Raimi's plan) and we are introduced to the Black Cat in some supporting role (perhaps not a main villain). Carnage Post credits sequence.   Spider-Man 6: Carnage. I don't have much more of an idea than that.  And bam. That's how the franchise would have panned out if I was helping Raimi instead of Sony. It's nice to think about what could have been."
Spiderman,3e15vi,moralless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:57 2015 UTC,"I really hope Marvel does Black Cat, she's my favorite of spidey's love interests, second only to Gwen."
Spiderman,3e15vi,jhk0215,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"They should have taken out the part where Gwen is hanging onto the side of a destroyed building trying not to fall to her death and her father, the police captain saying ""Huh, I wonder what Gwen is going up there?"" all casual like. Then Eddie Brock coming into the scene and being like ""yo I'm dating your daughter, I don't care about her almost falling to her death I'm just going to take some pics"""
Spiderman,3e15vi,rjpugs24,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"Take out Venom (keep the symbiotie) and save him for the fourth movie. Take out the Sandman, and just have the movie be Peter vs. Harry, and Spider-Man vs. Eddie Brock.   Have Harry be the main villain, but don't give him that stupid goblin gear, make him the Hobgoblin or give him a slightly different Green Goblin suit.   Have John Jameson take the symbiote to Earth, instead of a meteor just crashing by Peter."
Spiderman,3e15vi,mrglass8,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:08 2015 UTC,"The street dancing scene was hilarious. Keep that. The dance with Gwen was dumb.  Actually, just remove Gwen from the film. Replace her with Felicia Hardy and reduce her role.  Split the movie in 2, ending with Eddie turning into Venom. Change the actor, and adjust his story, such that Harry actually knows Eddie, and Harry's hate flows into Eddie's hate.  Get rid of the retcon. Have Marko rob and harm Aunt May instead."
Spiderman,3e15vi,Wallcrawler62,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:09 2015 UTC,"If Eddie Brock wasn't a b*tch If Venom wasn't constantly showing his face If they didn't have too many villains If Peter turned into more of a jerk instead of emo They completely ruined the mythos with the ""real killer"" thing Why the hell didn't Osborn's butler just tell Harry if he new? Why does almost every villain die at the end of the movies? Venom on his own has always been enough to screw up Peter's personal relationships.  It didn't need a love-triangle to do that."
Spiderman,3e15vi,mrglass8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people don't think Peter became a jerk. He tried to murder Sandman, he chewed out his landlord, he threw a Pumpkin bomb in Harry's face, and he danced with another girl right in front of MJ. He was a bigger jackass than he was in any of the cartoons."
Spiderman,3e15vi,mrglass8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:46 2015 UTC,Because (and I don't know if this was on Tobey or Raimi) it looked forced or comical for the most part.

His enthusiasm for Spidey is off the charts and I'm amazed at how he's willing/able to have in-depth conversations with every person instead of just cranking out signatures.

If you're unsure about how the webbing will look trace it on first with some tailor's chalk.  For the mask, just buy some black stretchy fabric (or cannibalize a blank black T-shirt), and print this image full size onto some white paper (you should break it up into separate parts the image is something like 27 by 18 inches), and trace on the design with the chalk again, and then paint the webs like with the shirt. and sew it up.  For lenses, there isn't a good way to get the eyes printed on. You'd be better making some lenses with black clay, hardening them, then adding the white part with metal mesh pulled from a strainer painted white. Then just superglue to the mask."

Now for ASM2, great to see some emoting from the face, but without Norman really being in the story, what's the point? I really love the Rami series, except for the third one, but it was time to move on. I loved ASM, but Sony deemed it a failure box office wise, and they didn't know what to do with the character.  I'm sooooo happy that Spidey is back with the MCU.  Let them do the characters right.  Spidey needs to crossover with as many properties as he can, just like he has done in the books.  It doesn't matter who they cast.  They just need to follow a few rules: Peter's parents are dead.  Uncle Ben dies and stays dead. Uncle Ben's killer is not Sandman. If Gwen is introduced again, she has to die. Please no clones. No organic web shooters.  The last version of Spider-Man that was done right that wasn't in the comics was The Spectacular Spider-Man.  If they can take all of that series, make it live action and make that a movie series, it'll print money."

Tobey looked the part but couldn't pull off the acting side of it that well.   Andrew Garfield was too handsome for Peter Parker.

It's a fun concept even if it is a little out there.   The themes of 'cutting loose' are great if used sparingly (example Red Hood from Batman).   So as an unbiased Spider fan I say it's good.

Spiderman,3dpjo0,Lox22,0,Sat Jul 18 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"That is the whole point of Back In Black, though. Peter is so enraged by Aunt May's attempted assassination that it shows what happens when he completely cuts loose. Its all about how, if Peter did just give up his moral responsibilities, he absolutely would go down into villainy. Its an exploration of his very character and how his poor actions directly affect people and the guilt that comes with that.  In Superior, its just Otto doing the exact same thing he's been doing for decades (being a super villain), just under a new alias. He doesn't develop in any way and the story isn't exploring his character. Its just more of the same. Surrounded by extremely poor writing and a bad job handling Peter's supporting cast."
Spiderman,3dpjo0,kiekan,8,Sat Jul 18 21:16:25 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the whole run. I have found that Spider-man fans seem to hate any changes the writers make to Peter.
Spiderman,3dpjo0,Weedhopper82,7,Sat Jul 18 11:24:21 2015 UTC,"This, people just really hate Slott. What I have come to learn is a lot of people hate a lot of the stuff before superior as well. I thought it was a great take on the character and that seeing spidey as an anti hero was awesome. Plus all the tech ock uses is amazing. I enjoyed how it was written and I loved how whenever you thought he was out matched he always had a plan. The Raft arch was incredible.  I bet if JMS did superior it would be praised"
Spiderman,3dpjo0,Lox22,0,Sat Jul 18 12:23:43 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I think a lot of people are ready for him to give up the book. I really enjoyed the Big Time story and Spider Island story line as well. The Superior tie-ins during Spider-verse were good too.
Spiderman,3dpjo0,Weedhopper82,0,Sat Jul 18 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that fans dislike change, its what specifically is being changed. In Superior's case, they turn Spider-Man into, essentially a straight up supervillain and no one bats an eye. Instead, they shrug and just say, ""eh, he must still be upset over Silver Sable's death. Just let him be."" Its utterly stupid.  There have been plenty of excellent changes to Peter over the years, though. Like when he became an Avenger (officially) and moved into the Avengers Mansion. Or when he was a teacher during Civil War. Or when he got a job at Horizon Labs. Etc etc etc. These (and plenty more examples) are all great and don't shit all over the character and his supporting cast."
Spiderman,3dpjo0,kiekan,7,Sat Jul 18 12:26:17 2015 UTC,Superior was Doc Oct trying to be the most efficient and effective superhero hence becoming the Superior Spider-Man. It was far from Spiderman becoming a super villain. It was the removal of Peter from Spider-man story that I think people didnt like.
Spiderman,3dpjo0,Weedhopper82,-4,Sat Jul 18 12:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm sorry, maiming your opponents, invading every citizens privacy through a detailed camera system, enslaving peoples minds and using them for your own purposes, blackmaiking government officials, murdering people in cold blood, etc is extremely heroic and has nothing to do with villainy."
Spiderman,3dpjo0,kiekan,2,Sat Jul 18 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"lol, you are missing the whole point. Of course its going to go wrong and his good intentions ended up going bad in the end. But he was trying to be a better Spider-man not a better supervillian. Go read it over again."
Spiderman,3dpjo0,Weedhopper82,-3,Sat Jul 18 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"No. Im not missing the point at all. I'm aware of what it was supposed to be. But it just doesn't work.   When you have to write the supporting cast as morons for your story to work, you're doing something wrong (seriously, the Avengers do a brain scan and all they can figure out is that he isn't a Skrull? I didn't realize that without Tony holding his hand, Steve Rogers was so incompetent, despite decades of having no problems running technology... I didn't realize MJ was perfectly fine being talked down to and being referred to as ""woman"" and despite intimately knowing Peter was totally cool with him murdering people. I also didn't realize that Black Cat was such a moron that she would think Peter would randomly lie about brain washing and immediately revert to villainy, despite being a straight hero for decades, etc etc etc).  The fact is, Superior should have been like a five issue mini series, not a 33 issue run. It was utter garbage throughout its entire run."

Spiderman,3dpjo0,Weedhopper82,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"What point exactly did I miss?  I'm aware that SpOck is supposed to be an opposite of Peter and the story is about overlooking morals and heroic responsibilities for meeting a specific end goal.  My whole point is that it's not particularly well done (Unless you count just turning Spider-Man into a murderous villain as being ""efficient""). There are other stories that have done this way better (see Back In Black or Sinister Spider-Man. Or heck, even Kaine's Scarlet Spider run).  Or are you just brushing anything I have to say under the rug and accusing me of ""not getting it"" because its easy?"

He would of never offered Vulture to get out of the villian business with millions of dollars.   And the government offical that he was black mailing was none other then JJJ who as we all know hates Spidey and abuses his politcial power for his own selfish amibitions. Spider bots were set up to ping when a crime was being committed. He never just sat there and watched the cameras. Those bots led to him stopping 4 times the amount of crime daily that Peter did.  He is an anti hero this is what they do. Ever read a punisher, daredevil, or spawn comic?

Well at least Otto was his own man, not held down by the so called ""childish"" binds that Peter had.  Superior was a great change of pace, it lead to a great segement of the spider-verse with he and Pete existing together. But people are going to hate its fine. You get the last laugh because its over."
Spiderman,3dpjo0,Lox22,0,Sat Jul 18 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"What is defined as a 'villain' in your mind? Because an evil character never views themselves as the antagonist or villain. In their own mind, they're the hero. And in many cases, they feel like their actions are both justified and for the better good. This mentality is wholly applicable to SpOck. Just because, in his own mind, his actions are justified, does not make them actually just or heroic.  Villainy is all about greed and self interest. Even if the end goal is a good one, if the method of getting there is based on self interest and not other people, that is villainy.  Going on that line of logic, being a villain doesn't mean the character automatically has to ally themselves with other characters of the same or similar moral alignment. Heck, they might view things in entirely different ways. So there is absolutely no reason why just because Spock's actions are evil, he automatically would see eye-to-eye with Norman. Or any other villain for that matter.  Just look at say, Doctor Doom of Baron Zemo. They would never ally themselves with another character (hero or villain) unless the situation meant they were in complete control.  The same is absolutely true for SpOck. In fact, that is actually perfectly demonstrated when he recreates the Sinister Six by enslaving the minds of the other members.  Following on that note, I was unaware that blackmail was considered just and heroic if the person your blackmailing isn't a nice guy. This is news to me.  The same goes for murder. Because you're told to, it makes it OK? If you ask me, that doesn't sound particularly heroic at all.  SpOck isn't an anti-hero in any way. The difference between SpOck and The Punisher is that The Punisher is killing crooks because he is genuinely trying to make the world a better place. He has taken himself out of the equation. He couldn't care less what happens to himself and is fully prepared to die. He is very much an ""ends justify the means"" type of guy. In his own mind, he is making the world a safer place to live for other people.  That is absolutely not the case for SpOck. The reason he is even bothering to be ""superior"" is to fluff up his own ego. Every decision he makes is made with the idea of making himself look better. He couldn't care less what happens to other people (and isn't afraid to tell them directly), as long as he comes out ahead. And if it comes down to it, if he had go sacrifice himself, he'd run off the very first chance he gets (and does in the book). He isn't selfless in any way."

Spiderman,3dpjo0,HaouLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"In the Marvel Universe, where there are countless races of aliens (many of which are on Earth), shape changers, people who can mind control, etc etc. Encounter any of these situations is basically just a standard Tuesday for the larger heroes in the Marvel U. Its completely unreasonable and beyond suspension of disbelief for anyone to just say, ""Spider-Man, a hero specifically for having high morals, is brutalizing his adversaries? Yeah, that seems normal.""  I'm not saying that they'd immediately know its Dock Ock or specifically a mind swap/reprogramming. But there is no excuse for not knowing that its not Peter Parker under the mask.  Additionally, how is that any other time throughout history that Spider-Man has acted out of character, his supporting cast picks up on it immediately. But randomly for Superior, they decide its completely normal and shrug it off? Its completely incongruous with over fifty years of established continuity for many of these characters."
Spiderman,3dpjo0,kiekan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I guess I try not to think too much about it. The Avengers did have a suspicion, but if I remember correctly they couldn't really read the readings with details because Iron Man wasn't with them. Later when they tried again, Otto had completely erased Peter's readings from his brainwaves. Sure it was kinda sketchy, but I just played along with it and I enjoyed it a lot. Nothing will be good if I keep nitpicking."

Which is completely stupid. Captain America has decades of experience dealing with super science and crazy tech, both on earth and alien, with the aid of accelerated learning. And he randomly cannot figure how to read tech that was commonly used by the Avengers during Secret Invasion? Just... because?  What about how Cap completely fell for SpOck telling him that the reason he'd been acting ""odd"" is because he had been possessed by Venom the whole time, despite having Agent Venom in the ranks of his Secret Avengers team and having regular contact with him during the time SpOck was around? It wasn't until Tony Stark called him out for being a moron (because the plot demanded someone else needed to know), that Cap had even considered anything else.  Its utterly idiotic and a disservice to all these characters.   Nothing will be good if I keep nitpicking.   I'm not nitpicking. I just wanted a story that was coherent and didn't have to shit on the supporting cast to even work. It would be one thing if it was just one or two instances of this happening. But I could, literally, pick up any random issue of the Superior run and find multiple examples of characters being written out of character or just overly dumb."

Spiderman,3dmjt3,FlamingSquirrel,2,Sat Jul 18 01:52:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if it was a nod from a writer who just loves Spider-man and didn't care if he could be in the films or not. I'm glad it worked out though cause it got me even more pumped!

Inhumans would be one. Truthfully if you read what I linked then you know as much as me.
Spiderman,3dmjt3,FlamingSquirrel,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:26 2015 UTC,I read it but it didn't mention who it was possibly referencing just that it was written way before they partnered with Sony

They just got the directors of Vacation to write the new Spidey solo, and I'm scared because I think they're gonna write it like a comedy. Spider-Man's life isn't a comedy, though. It's a tragedy: his parents died, he inadvertently got his uncle killed, and he was directly responsible for his girlfriend's death, to name the important ones. What I like is that he's still able to get back up and laugh in the face of his villains, despite what life throws at him. So I guess his willpower and tenacity are what I like, but the fact that he's the court jester in his own personal tragedy is a big thing."

Spiderman,3dmf5v,shimshamflimflam,4,Fri Jul 17 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"My draw to him has always been his hope and perseverance. Peter isn't a billionaire or a huge icon to the country.  He's just an incredibly unlucky guy who gained super powers and chose to use them for the greater good. For this he has suffered immensely. He has lost loved ones and many times lives in complete poverty yet he continues to spend money on his webs to be a better hero.   His personal life is frequently in turmoil and everyone who knows him thinks he is a smart mouthed layabout, even his fellow teammates! Yet he never stops. Even when beaten to a complete pulp, knowing nobody will be grateful and NYC may even hate Spider-man after while he can barely afford food or a place to live, he keeps getting up. Peter never asks for anything and has the courage to punch Galactus in the face. So for me, it's the hope he inspires in everyone whether they appreciate him or not.  This is a great way to create discussion in our little sub, thanks!"
Spiderman,3dmf5v,itsactuallyobama,4,Sat Jul 18 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"Presently in the comics a lot of the focus has sort if drawn away from Peter. We just got out of Superior Spider-man where we saw a darker take on our hero through Doc Oc's mind swap (it sounds lame, I know, but really is one of the better comics I've read). Coming out of that there has been a lot going on to distract from Peter, such as Spider-verse. I hope that with All New All Different approaching we will be taking the series back to what makes it so amazing, and that is the conglomerate action packed soap opera/drama that is Peter's life.   As for what makes the character great, it's easy to label Pete as the ""everyman's hero"" (don't get me wrong, he really is!), but there's something more at the essence that defines him. He's a man of action. Rather than letting his Uncle's memory fade through the years it is still driving him. Though, not to the point of obsession. It inspires him to pull through.   In the end, that is Spider-man. In a world of Hulks and Mr. Fantastics he is not the strongest or smartest character ever created. He really doesn't make the best decisions, nor do things go his way. He doesn't have all the resources nor the power to do the impossible-but he still tries.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, no matter what, he gives it his all. Isn't that what we truly want in our heroes? Someone willing to give it all they've got even if they don't succeed. Someone who scraps together everything they can gather to fight impossible odds. He isn't perfect, but that doesn't stop him from trying to be. That's what makes him, truly,   The world's greatest superhero !"
Spiderman,3dmf5v,serperior_spider15,3,Sat Jul 18 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"I love how much he can overcome through sheer force of will, which stems from his burden of responsibility."
Spiderman,3dmf5v,Scott_Creed,3,Fri Jul 17 17:44:09 2015 UTC,It's how average he is compared to others. He is prone to making mistakes like the every-man. He is willful to helping people regardless of everyone talking bad about him. He looks up to people like Captain America and Iron Man just like someone his age would. Spider-Man is someone that can be anyone under that mask once it's put on. He is just someone that is extremely relatable and awesome. Plus his humor is a way to cover up his fear just like me.
Spiderman,3dmf5v,Apple_Joel,3,Sat Jul 18 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think deadpool takes THAT cake lol. But I will say that he does deal with much/most loss and grief of any character. I think that with the death of the stacys, his family, himself, friends and comrades, it's tough to not respect him as a character because of even just his sheer fortitude. A lesser man would be broken, forever. I'm pretty sure I would."
Spiderman,3dmf5v,Ratswings,2,Sat Jul 18 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"He never gives up. No matter the threat, no matter the cost to his personal life, Spider-Man will always fight to protect others. This is why he is the greatest hero in the Marvel Universe."

Perhaps they assume you know why the franchise is getting rebooted only two years later. They both felt so uninspired and insincere. I don't want to blame the actors but the script and direction were absolutely terrible for both films. As a Spider-man fan, I'll probably watch anything with him in it and still be entertained... but those movies are just filled with cringe moments. They were poorly constructed messes. Honestly it breaks my heart knowing that these movies and Disney's cartoon has been some people's first exposure to these stories."

I grew up 616 and while the Ultimate universe has done some cool things, I can't stand the effect it has had on Spidey's rogues and I really didn't like that influence in ASM2. Why the hell can't we get a real fucking Green Goblin for fucks sake. Raimi almost had it, the suit just sucked. I am glad Venom never showed up in ASM, I hate the cancer cure origin. Venoms a fucking symbiote alien and that's all he should be.  I know the MCU draws from both universes, but so far I personally feel they have done so tastefully and in a way that makes sense. Lets just hope the trend carries over to Spidey (and I have faith it will).  EDIT: and for fuck sakes not every villain has to be birthed by Oscorp. Have some variety."

Spectacular wasn't very accurate to the comics and the origins for various villains were very different but the story was very good. Sometimes having it differ from the comics is actually a good thing so it is kind of refreshing and so it isn't too familiar to people who read the comics
Spiderman,3dk60c,jhk0215,2,Fri Jul 17 11:15:24 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not saying it has to stay true, but I found it odd that Raimi said he's excited that they're focusing on high school cause he wants to see Peter's relationship flourish with Gwen Stacy. He probably just wasn't aware that that's not how the original story was.  I'd be interested to see them bring Liz Allan and give Betty Brant a role as one of peter's girlfriends.

Spiderman,3dpk3q,livewire2k14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:31:32 2015 UTC,"Since the cinematic universe pretty much can do anything with the character's origins (I mean, Ant-man and Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty off), I would avoid making it that complicated and just have Gwen bitten by the same spider or something. As for the extra powers, its just implied that female spiders, biologically are normally bigger and stronger than their male counter part, hence Spider-Woman's ability to fly, use pheromones, etc. So if we assumed the radioactive spider bites has different affects on gender, that can somewhat explain why Gwen can do more than Peter.   But personally, not a fan of the idea of clones. I feel like the MCU would do much better with the idea that once someone is dead, there is no simple and easy loop hole to it. But note, it can be interesting, because it actually wouldn't cheapen Spidey's world as a whole, in fact, it can make him feel delusional and angry if he can't explain why Gwen is alive or why she doesn't recognize him. So its not necessarily a bad storyline, unless somehow clone Gwen retains her memories somehow and magically remembers Peter and decides to be a super hero, but if you ask me, a good way to introduce her with Disney's MCU universe, is to put her in a life or death situation, and when it looks like she will die, Peter agrees to do a blood tranfusion and thus she lives and she gains powers.  This will force the MCU to change the neck snapping that her death originated from, but I can see it happening that way (I mean, it worked with She-Hulk)."

Horrible Bosses was a non-stop romp, and Horrible Bosses 2 was a competent, and more importantly, funny sequel (in my opinion). Definitely think the new Vacation film has a chance at landing with audiences too. Haven't actually seen Burt Wonderstone.  This choice certainly makes sense, and is in keeping with the whole tone they're going for with this new series. Think it's interesting how Feige said they were going to go for this whole John Hughes vibe, and now they may be hiring the the guys who are writing and directing the reboot/sequel to an old John Hughes script. It's nice seeing these little tidbits come out and give us a better picture on what this movie will end up being. Excited to see if this ends up holding true."

The guide you just linked is by far the best reference for reading Amazing Spider-Man chronologically. The only annoying thing is that chronological is not release order, so some later stories that were written in the future but set in the past are included where they took place. I don't like that. Following Amazing Fantasy #15 from 1963 with Amazing Fantasy #16 from 1995 makes no sense.  However, ignoring the ones that are out of place, that is a great guide for reading through Spidey. Here's what you should read:   Amazing Fantasy #15 Amazing Spider-Man #1-99 and Annuals #1-5 as listed on that guide   After that you can read Marvel Team-Up and decide if that series is worth following as well. Then do it again when Spectacular Spider-Man #1 comes out and so on.  If you want any more insight, or just want to talk classic spidey, feel free to message me!"

Depending on how much of Ultimate Spidey is covered in your collection, you shouldn't really get any spoilers for the rest of your stuff if you stick to this order.   I would also skip Planet X since it is the last part of a pretty much self contained arc on X-men written by Grant Morrison, and you will likely be lost. Hell, you'll probably be lost if you read all of the Grant Morrison X-men run, so I would set this aside and maybe just look at the nice art, but not really read it until you can track down the rest of Morrison's New X-men."

Spiderman,3dec8a,relates_to_my_dick,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"I recently just got into ASM and can tell you at the very least to not start at the beginning. Many people may see this as blaspheme, but the style of both story and art are very aged. Most villains don't really have their characters fleshed until later. For ASM, the death of Gwen's dad is the best place to start as the story begins to seem to have a constant cohesiveness at this point. It's not long after meeting Harry, MJ and Gwen so you won't miss much there. Ultimate Spider-Man is a different universe that started in 2000. It starts with Peter's origin and stays with him in high school. It's a lot more modern and changes some arcs significantly while still maintaining the same general feel. Ultimate also shifts over to Miles Morales after a while. Ultimate seems to also have a greater focus on the personal aspects of Peter's life as we see him deal with balancing school, home, friends and being a hero.

I'm currently reading through the 1960s ASM and Peter initially uses Spidey to express his inner desired self. He sees Spider-Man as an opportunity to be all he wants to be as a man. Eventually, as Peter matures, he becomes that person as Peter Parker, and the line between Peter and Spidey virtually becomes non-existent."

Spiderman,3d96dt,Frozen_Canadian,2,Tue Jul 14 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"I want, above everything else, for him to be a regular kid with a conscience that is almost crushing. I want the jokes, and the intelligence, and all that makes him who he is, but what I really want them to drive home is the guilt he feels over the death of his uncle. One thing the movies tend to either gloss over or ignore completely is Peter's devotion to the cause, the best Spider-Man movie involves Peter abandoning his crusade because of emotional turmoil over his could be girlfriend. Yes, it was made clear that he has to be Spider-Man by the end, but up to that point the decision to not be Spider-Man was pretty damned shallow. ""I want love and my powers are finicky because of EMOTIONS! So I quit."" I want a Peter Parker who isn't struggling with it, I want a Peter who carries the burden of the responsibility that comes with his powers. That's something Iron Man doesn't deal with, or Captain America. Only Hulk comes close and that has more to do with the burden of being a monster. We need a Peter who, as in the comics, is the moral compass of the Marvel Universe, the single unyielding point upon which all other heroes should be judged."

Don't want to say too much but it's definitely not a continuation from 2099 -- just glad to know that this current 2099 continuity doesn't look like what we're getting in the Post-Secret Wars MU.

The exceptions going in to reading should be lower now so I'll enjoy it more than I would with higher expectations.    To be honest, besides Renew Your Vows, I'm really disliking the ""Secret Wars"". So many stories just stopped so Marvel could change things up. I hate when stories don't get finished. Makes me want to stop collecting because no knows when Marvel decides to pull another move.

Big events are fine -- I think it's just hard when a book ends without any real sort of 'ending'. If anything, I'd suggest just being a bit more selective about which you read.

TAS2:   Remove scenes about Peter's parents Minimize the role and screen time of one off characters like the Dr. Kafka, Felicia, etc.  More Peter/Harry scenes to build up belief they were actually childhood friends Remove Captain Stacey ""I see him everywhere"" scenes Minimize Max Dillon/Electro backstory scenes Gwen's dad was killed by Oscorp monster last movie, I doubt she would happily intern there.    Overall, TAS 2 was enjoyable, but filled with cluttered and pointless plot threads. Main plot should have been Max Dillon turning into Electro and getting revenge on Smythe and the Oscorp board members. Electro would have been a good foil to Spider-Man, as a regular person who gain powers, but pursues revenge instead. Secondary plot is Harry discovering Peter is Spider-Man, connecting the dots to the Oscorp research, and believing Peter's blood will help solve the Osborn disease. The timing of Gwen's Oxford plot didn't work out for me because candidates are notified when they have been accepted in January. I assume they graduate high school in May/June (which is when the movie starts) so it didn't make sense for her to be interviewing during the summer. The movie should have started with Gwen receiving the acceptance to Oxford already and Peter/Gwen deciding how to spend their last summer together and when to break things off."

Electro could have been a better rounded out character (""I love Spidy. No wait, I hate him now!"") A better less, cringy friendship with Harry The ""rules for friendship"" scene would not have happened. That tops the dance scene as being one of the most embarrassing things I have had to sit through. Dr. Kafka would be more like how she is in the comics. Not some cartoony mad scientist.  Finally, I wouldn't have butchered Peters character. When he gets his powers, he goes form being a shy nerd, to being a more confident nerd. More of your average Joe who tends to live in his head a lot. High fiveing the principal and dipping Gwen for a kiss in front of the graduating class is completely out of character.

I'm just tired of the declared soul mate from the start thing. This show made me side with Gwen, then put MJ on the list because she's MJ, and then suddenly Liz Allen was a serious contender with being the most chill girlfriend a secret super hero could ask for.

It will be too pandering and contrived. Maybe I'm biased, but I have been reading Spider-Man since I'm a kid, so I want to see Peter on screen, not a variation of Peter."
Spiderman,3d1m3s,bolognahole,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"To be honest, even if it were ""just"" for the sake of diversity, I still believe it'd be a good choice - diversity is important, and I think a greater effort should be made to include more diverse characters. The MCU should aspire to be as inclusive as possible, and it should represent people from all walks of life. I, personally, believe that Spider-Man makes particular sense for this change, in a way other characters might not - he's always represented the underdog, and he's depicted as being something of an outsider at school. When the character was originally created, this translated to nerds. Nowadays, given that nerds essentially run the world, I think it's actually closer in line to the way the character was originally envisioned to depict him as being on the LGBT spectrum. He's still Peter; his personality and character would remain the same. (If anything, the person I've really suggested changing is MJ!)  Still, I can understand why you wouldn't want the change - it makes sense to want to see the character you've loved for so long translated to the screen exactly as you imagined him. I did think that might have been a little controversial (which is why, I assume, I've got so many downvotes! Thank you for commenting, at least)  Did you have any thoughts on the other ideas I mentioned, by the way? The supporting characters and the villains and whatnot?"
Spiderman,3d1m3s,Lem_1230,3,Mon Jul 13 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"You're saying that changing the sexual orientation of Peter wouldn't change the character, but that's exactly what it would do. Peter Parker doesn't need to be more diverse, I agree that the Marvel universe should represent people from all walks of life, but Peter already represents a person from a certain ""walk of life"" so to speak. And introducing new types of people is what the creation of new characters is for, so you can have both the new and the old. Spider-Man can absolutely be gay or bi, but not Peter Parker. Miles Morales is an example of a diverse Spider-Man, (and Miguel O'Hara before him) without changing Peter Parker. And as for the films, where the aforementioned characters of Miles and Miguel may not appear, there are new opportunities to show already diverse characters, racially and in terms of sexual preference."
Spiderman,3d1m3s,HeavenPiercingMan,0,Tue Jul 14 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"Prior to the Peter Parker announcement, I was actually hoping they'd go for Miles Morales - again, for the sake of diversity. I also think it'd help to differentiate the MCU films more significantly from their Sony predecessors.   I know for a lot of people it's sort of a matter of preference - changes to childhood characters they've loved for so long are controversial - but I wanted to put forward the idea anyway, because I think that it might present some interesting story possibilities. For example, the MJ twist, or the parallels drawn between Flash and Peter.   Still, thanks for your feedback!"

This storyline takes place in ASM #568-#573 and is collected under the title ""New Ways to Die"". Naturally, I would assume his cancer storyline is pre-568. As for when he was diagnosed with it...

Spiderman,3cyaux,BeardWonder,6,Sat Jul 11 21:57:05 2015 UTC,Spider-Man 2 was GOAT on Gamecube back in the day.    I've recently been chipping away at Ultimate Spidey on the same system and it just... lacks the personality that 2 had.  I love Tobey Maguire's cheekiness.  I've also been thinking of picking up Shattered Dimensions on 360 as I heard nothing but good things.
Spiderman,3cyaux,BAMFThickness,2,Sat Jul 11 22:28:53 2015 UTC,I've already beat Shattered Dimensions. It's a really good game but it's pretty straightforward and there's no free roam around the city. It's a fun game so I recommend it.

Spiderman,3cvzrm,ad11397,5,Sat Jul 11 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"I think he does, the action set pieces were the best part of the film. The smoothness and speed and feel of it without quick cuts was incredible! The color palette for the movie was great as well. Although I do agree that he probably was still fresh with the first one and he wasn't ready for that one bit the second one showed how much he loved the character even though the story wasn't good due to all the edits Sony forced on the crew."
Spiderman,3cvzrm,ChickenPlunger,4,Sat Jul 11 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"You'd think they would have learned by now that there's a balance to be had between ""complete artistic control"" and ""we're going to edit it however the hell we want"".

Spiderman,3cvzrm,theHip,26,Sat Jul 11 06:56:00 2015 UTC,"Venom itself wasn't a mistake. Neither was the ""too many villains"" idea people like to assume. The mistake was that there was already a story there, and due to studio pressure, they had to cram Venom in too. It just didn't fit, and wasn't executed properly either."

I get so tired of hearing all that shit: ""Sam Raimi screwed it up"" or ""too many villains"" blah blah blah, I think if Sony had simply left Raimi alone and let him do his magic, he would have delivered a fantastic movie.   Despite liking Spider-man 3 anyhow, I think it could and would have been better if he was just left in control like he was previously but they (the fans and the execs) pressured him so much for Venom and he had to simply piece him in where he could. Such a shame because Spider-man 2 is still one of the best comic book movies to date, in my head."
Spiderman,3cvzrm,Abraveliltoaster,15,Sat Jul 11 09:11:01 2015 UTC,"I think it would have been better if Raimi had decided to do venom on his own and actually dedicate the movie to that, but I would have preferred a Sandman/Goblin focused movie to what we got as well.   Although, I'm not particularly happy with any of the Raimi films. Dialogue and acting is too cheesy and Tobey plays a bad Spidey and a much too stereotypical nerd Peter, one that didn't feel like a real person."
Spiderman,3cvzrm,morphinapg,2,Sat Jul 11 10:50:09 2015 UTC,Did you feel that way when the films were initially released or after TASM was released?  Idk why you have been downvoted. You added to the conversation and simply stated your opinion. That's pretty lame.

Once I saw Spectacular Spider-man and the ASM films, (and also became familiar with a lot more good movies) I could definitely see just why those always felt off to me.   Plus it's also an annoyance to me how they cast Mary Jane. Just... nothing like MJ."

I remember being ten years old at the movies and thinking that it was so cool. But we've got to grow up sometime. Once I started reading comics, then i started to dislike the film. To me as a fan its unbearable to watch. Its awkward, badly acted, out of tune for the characters, not particularly well written and its plot is atrocious, like someone smashed 3 bad cartoon episodes and called it a movie. But tasm2, although bad. Has a bit riding for it, it's well a acted (although I don't think foxx was performing to his best), well written, the characters and actors are spot on for a weird gwen/peter but post high school spideyworld and I think that comparing the two is not contest. That being said Spiderman 2 is easily the nest spidey film so I'm not picking on that team, I just think that being apologetic for Spiderman 3 is dumb, and liking it is even dumber.

Venom was crap. I love venom. I hate what they did to them. Sandman was turned ito some tragic villain, with a backstory, like they did with doc oc. I love how he redeemed himself in different versions of the character (sandman I mean) but he started as a crook. And i wanted a true villain from that series, but all their was were melodramatic sop stories, which isn't bad, but gets repetitive. Anyway this thread wasn't even about Sam rami's trilogy, it was about webs films."

Studio interference only changed a villain, they didn't push an extra one in.  Not to mention he knew BEFORE he started work on the movie at all Venom would be taking Vulture's place.  I feel all of the worst decisions of Spider-Man 3 came from Sam.  Sandman killing Uncle Ben, Mary Jane's entire characterization, the plot being so MJ heavy, the love triangle, Harry's amnesia.  If anything I felt Venom was one of the bright notes of that film, Topher played the character really well."

I felt it really fits Spider-man. Stafano Caselli's art may be the prettier one (in terms of faces and body proportions), but I felt his composition is a bit flat compared to Ramos'.  Camuncoli feels a bit darker. To a certain extent, he's the best fit for Superior Spider-man, but not in Amazing. His head/body proportions seems off at times, which I can forgive if only his art was ""cartoony"" but it wasn't.  I didn't quite dig Marcos Martin's art. Commenters felt that his art was Ditko-esque, but I'm in John Romita, Sr. camp, so there's that. Martin's art remind me of Javier Pulido's, who also does some Spider-man art once in a while.  Paolo Rivera-- now that one's a great artist. I wonder why he never gotten a regular Spider-man gig (i.e. interior art), instead went to Daredevil. Say what you will with ""One Moment In Time"" arc, but Rivera's art was great in there.  Joe Quesada does some great art. But his faces have no consistency."

Spiderman,3ct5g3,billzombie,2,Fri Jul 10 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"So, but, Marvel will have creative control....right?"
Spiderman,3ct5g3,mynameisspiderman,3,Fri Jul 10 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"We don't know exactly, but it seems to be that Marvel will have some control over the character. The solo movie will still be made by Sony, and it's possible that Marvel will be able to make some choices."
Spiderman,3ct5g3,hoodie92,4,Fri Jul 10 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Kevin Feige is the executive producer, so he'll probably be responsible for keeping it in line with the MCU"
Spiderman,3ct5g3,yeblod,2,Fri Jul 10 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yes but EP's usually have no input into a movie other than money.   While Feige probably will be involved, his role as EP doesn't actually mean anything."
Spiderman,3ct5g3,hoodie92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:46:59 2015 UTC,The contract is that Marvel Studios produces it. Him and Amy Pascal are in charge.
Spiderman,3ct5g3,ChickenPlunger,0,Sat Jul 11 17:21:05 2015 UTC,Well that's not confusing at all. So spidey will be in the cinematic universe but the Spider-man movies won't be?  Edit: it's much less confusing than I thought it was.
Spiderman,3ct5g3,PileMaster,9,Fri Jul 10 18:57:59 2015 UTC,Yes they will. All of Spidey's movies from now on (until otherwise noted) are in the MCU.   Basically Sony didn't want to give up the rights entirely so they struck a deal with Marvel to bring Spidey into the MCU. The Spidey movies are gonna be made by Sony but will also feature Marvel Studios on the creative team.
Spiderman,3ct5g3,Dumebuggy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:05:44 2015 UTC,This is the one in the MCU. Technically all spiderman movie stuff is MCU now. Sony just holds the rights to him but marvel studios is helping on the creative team for the movie(s).
Spiderman,3ct5g3,Dumebuggy,-10,Fri Jul 10 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"If there's going to be a black Spiderman, he should be separate from the original, or at Least have a different name."

Spiderman,3cvvsm,Man_of_Sin,3,Sat Jul 11 05:22:33 2015 UTC,"Woah! Have you noticed Superman looks identical to Spider-man, except he doesn't wear a mask and there are no webs!? They must surely be the same because of color?"
Spiderman,3cvvsm,bruh_dinosaurs,-2,Sat Jul 11 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"Very poor use of sarcasm there. Superman's costume is blue, red, and yellow. The last one Spider-Man which lacks.;)  Also, your reading comprehension skills are terrible. You seem to have only noticed me saying ""same colors"". I said same color scheme, as in the same amount and use of colors.  Both Mattie and Jessica's costumes are black with red lining forming symbols related to Spiders. You also overlooked me saying that they have the same type of mask.   And once again, I said ""kinda similar"" not identical. Further making your sarcasm unwarranted."
Spiderman,3cvvsm,Black_Suit_Matty,11,Sat Jul 11 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, it's almost identical except that they don't look alike."
Spiderman,3cvvsm,moralless,-3,Sat Jul 11 05:54:08 2015 UTC,"I said ""kinda"" similar, not identical.  -Black costume.  -Red lining through out costume and forming a symbol related to spiders.  -Same kind of mask.  Mattie Franklin in the 616 was one of three characters who went by the name of ""Spider-Woman"". So it wouldn't be far-fetch to say that Ultimate Spider-woman's costume took inspiration from that character."
Spiderman,3cvvsm,JZPotter,3,Sat Jul 11 06:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I really don't think these two look alike at all. I'll concede the masks are similar in that style, though the lenses are very different. But on the whole the costumers are quite far apart."
Spiderman,3cvvsm,leon__furious,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not saying they are identical. Just that Ultimate Spiderwoman's costume took inspiration from 616 Spiderwoman in terms of color scheme and mask(btw the lenses depends on the artist)."
Spiderman,3cvvsm,kaine_reilly_parker,2,Sat Jul 11 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"If by similar, you mean, not at all."
Spiderman,3ct4va,Spider--Dan,2,Fri Jul 10 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"Kind of embarrassed I can't figure this out myself, but how old is she supposed to be? She's a teen and not actually Gwen's age right? Or is she as old as Gwen was when she died?"
Spiderman,3ct4va,PileMaster,2,Fri Jul 10 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"We don't know exactly, but she's probably around 18/19 because her dad mentions her going to university in one of the comics."

Spiderman,3ct4va,hoodie92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:28:33 2015 UTC,I just want a story arc where Gwen deals with the Venom symbiote now after seeing that Guardians cover.
Spiderman,3cstr9,Spider--Dan,5,Fri Jul 10 14:18:05 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see Spider-man Unlimited, I still think of the cancelled 90's cartoon."
Spiderman,3csxtl,Spider--Dan,7,Fri Jul 10 14:51:10 2015 UTC,~~~ Everything we are assuming judging by a cover image that will likely have nothing to do with the story inside about Spider-Man 2099

Even our dreams. "" This quote? I would like to take a shot at it. Is there a specific pose you're looking for?"
Spiderman,3cta1m,Lox22,2,Fri Jul 10 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"This exact quote. A specific pose uhh, maybe something overlooking the city with a hanging spider-man if that's possible?"

Spiderman,3cqal0,bogaboy,33,Thu Jul 9 22:30:37 2015 UTC,I'm glad this was cut from the final film. It really emphasized the lack of importance Uncle Ben played in these two movies.
Spiderman,3cqal0,Blackout744,11,Thu Jul 9 23:17:02 2015 UTC,"The fact that ""With great power comes great responsibility"" was never said, not even in the last voice mail in the first movie (which I always thought would have been the perfect ending for an other wise terrible movie) shows that they didn't care."
Spiderman,3cqal0,al_ien5000,10,Fri Jul 10 00:23:04 2015 UTC,(which I always thought would have been the perfect ending for an other wise terrible movie)   Well damn.
Spiderman,3cqal0,Techno_Bacon,16,Fri Jul 10 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"They pretty much did what they did in the ultimate spider-man comic. They alluded to the famous quote. Here's what Uncle Ben says in ASM:  ""You are a lot like your father. You really are, Peter, and that's a good thing. But your father lived by a philosophy, a principle, really. He believed that if you could do good things for other people, you had a moral obligation to do those things! That's what's at stake here. Not choice. Responsibility""  It's there. They did care. Just a lot less straight forward.   Edit: for those interested, here's what is said in the ultimate spider-man comic #4:  “If there were things in this world that you have to offer, things that you can do better than anyone else... Things you can do that help people or make them feel better about themselves, then it’s not just a good idea to do those things. It’s your responsibility to do them.”"
Spiderman,3cqal0,JMNetwork,8,Fri Jul 10 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"Also in the original Amazing Fantasy, Uncle Ben doesn't tell Peter ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" he learns it on his own, as told to us by a text box. That's why I was okay with them leaving it out in TASM movie, I always figured that was what the movie was alluding too."
Spiderman,3cqal0,Nippoten,10,Fri Jul 10 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"an other wise terrible movie   Well, that's one opinion I suppose."
Spiderman,3cqal0,KJM321,3,Fri Jul 10 03:24:53 2015 UTC,Uncle Ben never said with great power comes great responsibility in the comic books
Spiderman,3cqal0,Apple_Joel,4,Fri Jul 10 11:36:31 2015 UTC,It has been retconned many times to him saying it.
Spiderman,3cqal0,al_ien5000,-1,Fri Jul 10 12:53:36 2015 UTC,I've read Amazing Fantasy and Asm #1 1963. He didn't say it.
Spiderman,3cqal0,Apple_Joel,3,Fri Jul 10 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"I feel silly having to quote myself, but it has been retconned many times since."
Spiderman,3cqal0,al_ien5000,2,Fri Jul 10 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"That's why he said retconned. It wasn't there originally, now it is his quote."

Spiderman,3cqal0,Lox22,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU! I've been trying to tell people this for as long as these two movies have been made, and this is why I liked the Raimi movies better."

Spiderman,3cqal0,instantromannoodles,19,Fri Jul 10 00:03:49 2015 UTC,Honestly I liked the movies. I know they have mixed reviews but it did things right that the original trilogy screwed up but it also lacked in areas that the original trilogy had right.
Spiderman,3cqal0,Blackout744,23,Fri Jul 10 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly loved ASM2, I didn't read anything about it before going in and came out loving it only to be completely surprised by the almost unanimous negative reactions to it. I actually bought it on Blu ray as soon as it came out"
Spiderman,3cqal0,BTennant1234,15,Fri Jul 10 01:34:36 2015 UTC,I walked into ASM2 expecting something okay and walked out feeling like it was the best Spidey film and one of the absolute best Marvel movies.  I loved it so much and couldn't wait to talk with people online about how good it was!  Boy was I wrong about how other people felt about the movie.
Spiderman,3cqal0,SteveRudzinski,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think it had it's flaws, but it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  Personally I think there was just a bias going against it of all the people who wanted to see Peter, and Tony high-five."

Spiderman,3cqal0,hoodie92,6,Fri Jul 10 13:44:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I get that. I just wanted to know what his opinion was."
Spiderman,3cqal0,Johomy,6,Fri Jul 10 16:17:38 2015 UTC,"This was a super well acted and powerful scene but I'm glad it was cut, as I feel Richard should stay dead.  As much as I love ASM2 I did feel there was way too much wasted time on Richard.  I still feel really bad that ASM as a series won't continue and won't get a conclusion.  I hope that one day Webb reveals who the trench coat man was (I assume Chameleon but it would be nice to know) and just where he planned for the story to go.  A wonderful way to continue it would either be for the stand alone animated Spidey movies to basically be the ASM universe, or at the very least for there to be a comic mini-series to be ASM3."
Spiderman,3cqal0,SteveRudzinski,9,Fri Jul 10 03:27:37 2015 UTC,Did they ever release the footage of Peter beating the piss out of Hairy for killing Gwen ?
Spiderman,3cqal0,CamTheGringo,7,Fri Jul 10 00:02:35 2015 UTC,I wish. So far we only have a picture from that scene
Spiderman,3cqal0,ThatMarkGuy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:12:35 2015 UTC,What picture?

Spiderman,3cqal0,CamTheGringo,4,Fri Jul 10 03:22:34 2015 UTC,"This was actually kinda interesting. I like the different approach.  I wish they had pushed the Sinister Six movie back until after ASM3, then this one would have been handled better. Not that I didn't like it, but they crammed a TON of stuff into this film that could have been pushed to the next one. Gwen's death could have been in 3, along with the back half of Harry's story. We could have gotten a little more Norman, and just had Electro as the villain, with a hint at Rhino like they had in this one. Electro could have been more developed, and it would have felt much better.  But, dreams are dreams I suppose. sigh"

Spiderman,3crcwm,RoiVampire,-1,Fri Jul 10 12:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's also responsible for most of the terrible 90s storylines, and for attempting to destroy Gwen Stacy as a character decades after her death."
Spiderman,3crcwm,Iokuas,3,Fri Jul 10 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"Wait, wasn't JMS the one who wrote the Norman/Gwen thing. Also I'm fairly certain Quesada wasn't working for on Spider-Man in the 90s. He came back to marvel in 1998 for daredevil and the marvel knights books."
Spiderman,3crcwm,RoiVampire,0,Fri Jul 10 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"By that point he was high enough up in the company to have editorial decisions. JMS may have written the storyline, but Queseda gave the order."
Spiderman,3crcwm,Iokuas,0,Fri Jul 10 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"I've already said this a few times today but he's done more good than bad.

Spiderman,3co8x2,Kitsyfluff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:23:46 2015 UTC,Does this happen more often later in the game?  Because I've been playing it a while and I find that doing just three or four sidequests is enough to be able to focus on just the story for a while.
Spiderman,3co8x2,SteveRudzinski,20,Fri Jul 10 11:31:35 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, I do not think its work 10 bucks."

Spiderman,3ckuw5,wilyquixote,0,Wed Jul 8 23:08:32 2015 UTC,That movie was depressive
Spiderman,3ckuw5,cherish_it,0,Thu Jul 9 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"Marisa Tomei may be 50, but she looks 40.  Should Aunt May be bangin'?  I love her as an actress, but I'm concerned about the thought process behind this casting.  What does it say other than ""we're not your FATHER's Spider-Man?""    This sounds more like something a non-Marvel Studios studio would do.  ""We're different!  We're hip!  Look at how smokin' our Aunt May is."""
Spiderman,3ckuw5,wilyquixote,9,Thu Jul 9 04:49:33 2015 UTC,"Except marvel doesn't do shit like that, and I trust their casting decisions. They are probably gonna make her look rather plain and even maybe a little older with more grey hair."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,Fruit_Pastilles,0,Thu Jul 9 04:53:19 2015 UTC,"Then why cast Marisa Tomei?  But you're right, they've definitely earned the benefit of the doubt.  Still, I think it's okay to have reservations."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,kiekan,8,Thu Jul 9 05:00:53 2015 UTC,You ever think maybe it's because she's a good fucking actor and they think she fits the role? I don't care if she's 40 or 80.  I do like how we may be getting younger Ultimate May now though.
Spiderman,3ckuw5,Fruit_Pastilles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"You should probably read Ultimate Spider-Man, which the upcoming Spider-Man adaptation is going to be heavily influenced by."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,kiekan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:34:16 2015 UTC,Did they say that or is it rumoured?
Spiderman,3ckuw5,kiekan,3,Thu Jul 9 11:48:40 2015 UTC,"Neither. Its implied. Ultimate Spider-Man is far more contemporary take on the character and would likely be much better received by general audiences. Additionally, casting a younger actor in the role helps support this.  Finally, most of the MCU movies have borrowed a lot from the Ultimate U. They're essentially an amalgamation of 616 and 1610."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,cherish_it,20,Thu Jul 9 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like they are going for Ultimate Aunt May, which I am 100% for. Ultimate May > 616 May, every time.  I think Marisa Tomei is perfect for that role, too."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,kiekan,3,Wed Jul 8 19:06:18 2015 UTC,except nobody makes wheat cakes like classic Aunt May
Spiderman,3ckuw5,cherish_it,2,Thu Jul 9 13:49:07 2015 UTC,"Touche.  So, Ultimate May > 616 May, every time. Except when wheat cakes are involved?"

Spiderman,3ckuw5,moralless,5,Thu Jul 9 06:50:10 2015 UTC,This isn't official though...I kinda hate it how Reddit treats every rumor as official news. Look how all the Butterfield reports turned out. Tomei isn't playing Aunt May until Marvel or Sony tells us she is.
Spiderman,3ckuw5,bogaboy,2,Wed Jul 8 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I get the feeling I'll be down-voted to the grave for saying this, but any time any rumor or report they see written in text gets put up, most people take it as confirmed fact. Hell, Spider-Man in Civil War has still not been officially confirmed by Marvel, but since there were reports claiming it confirmed he is, if you say otherwise, you're a leper."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,moralless,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're trying to say, but Spidey was confirmed for Civil War."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,itspronouncedbreaux,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is exactly what I'm talking about. You can see in this interview here Fiege is directly quoted as saying people are taking his appearance for granted. I.e., he is not confirmed for the film. And this interview was done about a week after all those ""confirmed"" posts happened.  Yet, because The Reporter's Gregg Kilday said it was so in the link you provided, everyone is treating this as an official Marvel announcement, and nobody cares about the interview where Fiege is stating something to the contrary. Personally, I'm trusting Kevin Fiege over this Kilday guy. Not to mention even the Wikipedia page and IMDB for Civil War says that spider man is just a rumor, not confirmed.  But as I said, I know I'm in the minority in not trusting Kilday of Fiege. That said, I do think Spider-Man will be in civil war, I just don't think it's confirmed yet. Like you said before, I'm waiting for official Marvel announcement, not a reporter. Maybe I'll convert someone with this post, but the last time I talked about Feige's statement people acted like I was crazy.  Edit: and again I get randomly down-voted for making claims like this. Always happens and I never hear a counter argument. There seems to be HEAVILY CONFLICTING INFORMATION on the subject, at the very least."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,Metfan722,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:31:43 2015 UTC,"To me the implication of what feige is saying (once again, just to me) is that maybe his appearance won't be quite as prominent as we are expecting. It could be interpreted multiple ways I guess but you're right. There hasn't been an official announcement on it and we should remain skeptical until there is."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,Fruit_Pastilles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:37:36 2015 UTC,Variety is a fantastic source when it comes to this kind of stuff though.

Spiderman,3ckuw5,Abraveliltoaster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"Lol I figured. Still, with me it messes with continuity. I mean, Ruffalo plays a good Banner, but I don't feel that connection with the character. Too many different faces. Same with Rhodey; don't get me wrong, I love Cheadle, but Terrence Howard was the guy that really put a face to the name for me.  I guess I just don't like when they switch actors on me."
Spiderman,3ckuw5,throwawayfodder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:53:56 2015 UTC,I don't think you're alone there. That's why production companies are so willing dish money to keep the same actors for roles to not mess with people. Except in Terrence Howard's case. They flat out told him they didn't need him.

Spiderman,3ckqzy,cjcrashoveride,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"No worries! I honestly disliked his wolverine, found it too cartoony, didn't really suit the style of wolverine in my mind.

Spiderman,3ckqzy,stjimmyofsuburbia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:41 2015 UTC,I actually think Ramos' art fits Wolverine so well. It almost reminds me of Sam Keith's wolverine in that he conveys how he is always so squat and heavy.

Spiderman,3ckqzy,kiekan,5,Wed Jul 8 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I wasn't a huge fan of Ramos' work on ASM to begin with so I'm a tad relieved he's not gonna be back. You're right about the multiple artist thing but I feel like lately ASM has shifted from that, last run they primarily used Ramos aside from Camuncoli for the Spider-Verse stuff. I guess we'll just have to wait and see!"
Spiderman,3ckqzy,BaconIsHappiness,2,Wed Jul 8 20:50:56 2015 UTC,Camuncoli for the Spider-Verse stuff.   He only did the last two issues. Oliver Copiel did most of the art during Spider-Verse.
Spiderman,3ckqzy,jhk0215,3,Thu Jul 9 11:09:06 2015 UTC,"You're right my bad! I actually like Coipel's stuff more than both Camuncoli and Ramos, would love to have him on the new ASM book"

Spiderman,3ckqzy,mwriteword,3,Thu Jul 9 00:20:05 2015 UTC,I don't get the insane hate for Ramos' art. I love it. He's definitely my favourite comic book artist and I think his art is perfect for Spidey.
Spiderman,3ckqzy,TheGhostAssassin,3,Thu Jul 9 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"I like Ramos but Camuncoli and Coipel did some amazing art in Spider-Verse, so I'm excited to see Camuncoli on the new series :)"

Spiderman,3ckqzy,jhk0215,5,Wed Jul 8 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Spider-Man has always thrived on artists with distinct styles, Romita, Romita Jr, Campbell, Mcfarlane, Ramos, Dodson have been some of my favorites through the years."
Spiderman,3ckqzy,ranhalt,8,Wed Jul 8 20:35:43 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer an artist who actually uses proper anatomy and can draw more than one face.  I'd rather have someone like Phil Jimenez or Lan Medina come back. Of recent artists, Oliver Copiel, Ryan Stegman and Stefano Casali are vastly superior."

It definitely held up, it's a perfect show. An amazing balance between high school life and fighting crime. The dialogue is incredibly good and I often forgot I was watching a cartoon. I really appreciate getting to know villains for a bunch of episodes before they become the villains that we know, it makes much more of an impact. I love think show, and I wish they'd made a 3rd season. I seem to remember s2 finishing on a cliff hanger. I plan to watch all of s2 today. My love for Spider-Man is currently at a peak after watching yesterday."
Spiderman,3cmay6,camomalamo,2,Thu Jul 9 10:32:48 2015 UTC,"I remember putting the idea out one time that Greg Weisman might be able to pick up the show from where it started again, especially since Sony got the rights to Spidey back (I think. Sorry, I'm iffy on copyright stuff and who owns whom.), but that would just be wishful thinking on my part.   I don't know about you, but Doc was my absolute favorite character in this show. Heck, both versions of the Sinister Six are my favorite (you'll see the second version when you watch Season 2). I just love the way the entire show progresses."

Spiderman,3ci1jh,XpRienzo,16,Wed Jul 8 03:59:06 2015 UTC,I never got why 616 Ben and May were so old. Shouldn't they be in their late 40 or early 50s if they are Peter's uncle? What's with the 20 year age gap between uncle Ben and Richard?
Spiderman,3ci1jh,hoodie92,9,Wed Jul 8 07:32:07 2015 UTC,Peter may have been conceived late because of spy business.
Spiderman,3ci1jh,XpRienzo,2,Wed Jul 8 08:13:26 2015 UTC,Yea I think because in 616 they are spies Peter was born later but in Ultimate his father was just a scientist which is why he was born earlier
Spiderman,3ci1jh,jhk0215,5,Wed Jul 8 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm 27 and my baby sister is 4.  Second, I always thought that they were Pete's parents' aunt and uncle. Is that incorrect?"

Spiderman,3ci1jh,JosephFinn,4,Wed Jul 8 11:37:04 2015 UTC,"I can't find anything on 616 Aunt May's age but I googled American life expectancy in the 1960's. It's 69.77 years, or 70 years by rounding. Nowadays (from 2010 to maybe last year), it's 78.54 to 78.74 years. So there's an 8 year difference. And this number is probably skewed by the amount of people who've lived less or more than the average.  What I'm getting at is that Aunt May may never have been as she looks, just that she was as old as people thought was already old at the time.  ... Then again, she has to have some sort of anti-aging treatment going on. I swear she's only been getting younger lately.  Also, using ""616 Aunt May"" makes me feel like an incredibly huge nerd. Sheesh."

Spiderman,3ci1jh,kiekan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:41:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like Aunt May was more focused on in the Ultimate Universe, plus the fact that she was younger is why a lot of people find her more appealing."
Spiderman,3ci1jh,JosephFinn,3,Wed Jul 8 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the case at all.  616 Aunt May acts and functions more as a sort of grandparent role, than a motherly one. In addition to that, with small exceptions here and there, she is really unchanged from how she first was shown in Amazing Fantasy #15. She's old and always clueless. And no matter how many times she dies, Marvel always feels the need to bring her back.  In the Ultimate books, May is a far more interesting character. She has an actual personality and directly affects the events of the books on quite a few occasions. Both as a guardian to Peter (in a much younger, hip (but not lame) and socially aware function) and to other members of Peter Parker's supporting cast.   tl;dr: Ultimate May is far more relatable and interesting than 616 May."

Spiderman,3ckift,Apple_Joel,13,Wed Jul 8 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"You can pick out a single page of almost any artist and find some stinkers.  Try drawing 24 pages a month 12 months a year, and that's if your only on one book.  Maybe you won't spend the most time drawing some random Mary Jane panel.  You may not like his style, but he's technically strong and he seems to deliver a level of quality and consistency that Marvel is going to keep using him for."
Spiderman,3ckift,Wallcrawler62,3,Wed Jul 8 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not judging the artwork of the artist. In the end though, it's irrelevant. You aren't marketing how long the artists worked on the comic. You market the end result. If the end result is subpar, it's subpar. Not excuses.   But of course other people may not see it as subpar nor mind those subpar bits."
Spiderman,3ckift,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying they market how long he's worked on it, just that from a publishing standpoint speed and reliability are more important than if everyone likes a particular style.

Spiderman,3ceksk,kickshaw,4,Tue Jul 7 13:02:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. Up until that moment, MJ was just a girl looking for fun. I'm not really sure if her dark past had come to light at that moment, but right there, MJ showed a lot of maturity, and compassion to Peter.  And think about it, MJ KNEW he was Spider-man."
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryuzaki49,20,Tue Jul 7 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"What do you care about straights like me and Gwen?   Ah yes, that time when Peter shamed MJ out of her gay lifestyle. ;)"

Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,8,Tue Jul 7 17:38:43 2015 UTC,I think he meant living a normal life unlike MJ's carefree attitude towards life.. but I get your joke =P
Spiderman,3ceksk,greenroom628,2,Tue Jul 7 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"i know, it's funny reading slang and jargon from very different decades.  the core of the stories and language is still there, but sometimes the terminology kinda takes away from the gravity of the situation."
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,30,Tue Jul 7 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"I know he was grieving, but Peter was kind of a huge dick to her here. :/"
Spiderman,3ceksk,I_HaveAHat,15,Tue Jul 7 12:13:57 2015 UTC,Its done to make Mary Jane seem that much more loving
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,6,Tue Jul 7 13:44:18 2015 UTC,True. It does accomplish that.
Spiderman,3ceksk,Moulinoski,30,Tue Jul 7 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree but note that up to that point, she was known as being the ""no drama, all fun"" party girl. Like Peter says, ""I know you don't like hospital beds"". It was the impression she gave everyone because she'd been running away from all the problems she had by dancing the night away. No one, not even the reader (at that point) knew anything else about her."
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,13,Tue Jul 7 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it was wrong for the writers to do this in terms of story exposition, but he was still inappropriately mean to her and I don't think we as the readers are suposed to be okay with it. Her reputation doesn't excuse being treated this way. Especially not right after she told him she felt torn up about it.  But like I said, I know he wasn't really thinking straight, but it doesn't really change things. In the end it only serves to make her look better, which is probably what the writers were going for anyway."
Spiderman,3ceksk,Moulinoski,10,Tue Jul 7 14:42:09 2015 UTC,he was still inappropriately mean to her and I don't think we as the readers are supposed to be okay with it   I agree completely! Peter's in that state of mind where he needs to be left alone because nothing good will come from anyone intervening but still needs to have an eye on him.
Spiderman,3ceksk,greenroom628,2,Tue Jul 7 14:46:04 2015 UTC,"also, keeping in mind, MJ was in love with peter and she'd been aloof with him to save her feelings for him while pete was with gwen."
Spiderman,3ceksk,Moulinoski,2,Tue Jul 7 17:37:26 2015 UTC,Huh. I don't remember that. I remembered that it was revealed that she knew he was Spider-Man all that time but never spoke a word about it. I even remember that he proposed to her once and she refused! Then it happened a second and we all know what went down then ;)
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,7,Tue Jul 7 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"He didn't know that MJ had lost her mother, he didn't know anything about her till now. His reaction was not wrong in his right."
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,4,Tue Jul 7 14:02:00 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with that. She was grieving Gwen's death and he completely shoved it in her face.
Spiderman,3ceksk,EHendrix,4,Tue Jul 7 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"I know that MJ's past wasn't existing back then, but later she tells of her story to Peter (few issues before the marriage I think), in this scan she starts crying when he mentions her mother, so you see."
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryckae,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:39:09 2015 UTC,Well yes I realize that. My point is that Peter was in the wrong.
Spiderman,3ceksk,ryuzaki49,7,Tue Jul 7 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"Is anyone saying he was in the right? He is acting realistically to the situation, and in that situation it is easy for people say horrible things. He is wrong, and he is acting the way any of us could facing such a loss. The come a point when you are so overwhelmed you can't even contemplate others feelings, you just want the pain to stop."
Spiderman,3ceksk,SeanSnow,2,Tue Jul 7 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"I never said this wasn't the case, though..."
Spiderman,3ceksk,ferncaz95,0,Tue Jul 7 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, he was out of place with MJ's mother comment."
Spiderman,3ceksk,JMNetwork,3,Tue Jul 7 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"Grief does terrible things to a person. He wasn't wrong, but he certainly wasn't right. He's just expressing his anger explosively, and more than likely, without knowing how horrible it is. It happens to people sometimes. This is sadly the most realistic part of Peter's life for me."

Spiderman,3ceo5e,Suffokation,15,Tue Jul 7 09:16:40 2015 UTC,"They were retconned recently to be a benevolent race of noble warriors corrupted by their hosts on Earth.  Which is a real kick in the crotch, considering the whole reason Venom was interesting is because of the constant struggle with morality between himself and the symbiote, Eddie was NEVER evil, that's the whole point of his character, he's just a broken man who essentially gets hooked on a drug that gives him super powers.  Then again, Venom is now a space marine hockey player so what do I know, eh?"
Spiderman,3ceo5e,HomelessBoxBoy,5,Tue Jul 7 09:35:19 2015 UTC,"They retconned it? Well, it used to be that they were a good race, but Venom was corrupted symbiote, so he was kicked out onto Battleworld, and all of his offspring were also corrupt. That's why Venom, Carnage, Toxin, etc. are evil by nature."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,darklordx123,12,Tue Jul 7 09:53:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Venom suit was originally considered insane by its race because it wanted to bond permanently with a host as opposed to draining them dry and moving on, it was never deemed more or less evil."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,HomelessBoxBoy,2,Tue Jul 7 10:39:52 2015 UTC,"Ah yes. Thank you for reminding me. To be honest, I haven't read a Venom story in a long while so my knowledge on symbiotes is very limited."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,darklordx123,2,Tue Jul 7 12:02:48 2015 UTC,"Correct, IIRC it was actually ""kicked out"" or locked away from its own race for being to crazy, and that its prison was what if came out of in battle world."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,Lox22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:38:28 2015 UTC,The current explanation was in Guardians of the Galaxy.
Spiderman,3ceo5e,ranhalt,3,Tue Jul 7 13:58:58 2015 UTC,Toxin's morality is debatable. Conversations between Patrick Mulligan and Toxin lead me to believe Toxin isn't evil.
Spiderman,3ceo5e,ranhalt,2,Tue Jul 7 09:58:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it's evil now that Eddie has Toxin. They're MIA."

Spiderman,3ceo5e,Bug911,2,Tue Jul 7 17:32:55 2015 UTC,Toxin will be returning in the post-Secret Wars Carnage ongoing! :D It was just revealed yesterday.
Spiderman,3ceo5e,kiekan,2,Tue Jul 7 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"Eddie was NEVER evil, that's the whole point of his character, he's just a broken man who essentially gets hooked on a drug that gives him super powers.   That's not accurate at all.  If you read some early Eddie Brock appearances, he is written is kind of a skeevy guy. A cheapskate who'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants (which is reinforced when Spidey talks to his ex-wife Ann Weying in ASM #375, when she talks about why they divorced). The whole reason he hates Spider-Man, is because, due to being a crappy journalist, he lied on a story he wrote. He outted some guy as the Sin-Eater, who Spider-Man later revealed to be 100% innocent. When the Daily Globe found out he didn't do all the research and just lied about some guy named Emil Gregg being Sin-Eater, they fired him. Brock hated Spider-Man and wanted to murder him. But knowing he couldn't do anything and feeling like his life was falling apart, decided he was going to end his own life in a church (since he's Catholic). At which point, he meets the symbiote (who had been hanging out in the chuch since Web of Spider-man #1).  I don't know if I'd necessarily say Brock was/is ""evil"", but he wasn't a terribly great guy. Even before becoming Venom.  The symbiote wasn't initially written as evil. It was written as a creature who actually cared about its host. In the Planet of the Symbiotes super specials, its revealed that it was extremely empathic and bonded to its hosts because it wanted to experience emotions, instead of enslaving its host like the rest of its race. The other beings of the Venom Symbiote's race viewed the Venom symbiote as a pariah and initially locked it away (which became the cell Peter Parker found on the Beyonder's Battleworld during the original Secret War story).  When they joined and became Venom, they decided to take revenge on Spider-Man because they both felt they were hurt and wronged (Brock being victimized and the symbiote basically being a scorned lover) by Spidey and swore to end his life (as in, murder) by any means necessary (which later changed)."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,HomelessBoxBoy,2,Tue Jul 7 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"Actually Eddie didn't lie, Emil Gregg was a compulsive confessor, and admitted (wrongly) to being the Sin-Eater. And yeah, Brock wasn't an angel, but he was never evil. His reaction to having his life destroyed wasn't to do anything malicious or get revenge but to try to end his own life, it was the symbiote that put the final cracks within his psyche when he became Venom.  And no offence, but I already knew the origins of Venom, it doesn't make Eddie Brock evil, just a shady guy."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,kiekan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Actually Eddie didn't lie, Emil Gregg was a compulsive confessor, and admitted (wrongly) to being the Sin-Eater.   There was already evidence that it wasn't Emil Gregg. Gregg was  a known drug addict and compulsive liar. Stanley Carter (the real Sin-Eater) was already a suspect before Brock ever had his interview with Gregg and was later verified when he's apprehended by Spider-Man, who nearly beat him to death because he was upset over Jean DeWolff's death."
Spiderman,3ceo5e,danhimself36,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:49:16 2015 UTC,it wasn't all Eddie's fault though either...sure he was a scumbag but then they explain that his cancer may have had an effect on the symbiote as well...then there was it getting rejected by Peter and I kind of think that may have been even worse than we know since Peter may have been a perfect match for it like Flash  http://imgur.com/a/dXL2Z

I like to think this is the calmer part of his duality in the driver's seat; which raises an interesting realization: the author of that letter (that... voice and reasoning) is the character we have going forward (after the events of ""Goblin Nation"").  I hope whoever writes the next Osborn story takes a good long look at it, and really does a good job. Could be a terrifying new look at the character."

Spiderman,3caxz5,hajsenberg,26,Mon Jul 6 14:14:50 2015 UTC,Character development like this is what's missing in a lot of comics lately. I've noticed that most characters just kinda get stuck Ina. Single position and they don't know how to forward them past their peak. I hope the new release of Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man have more moments like this.
Spiderman,3caxz5,Apple_Joel,4,Mon Jul 6 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"Kenny's one of my all-time favorite Spider-Man supporting characters. His development is just so good. From the issue where he lets Peter crash at his place without any question, I was totally on board with him as a character."
Spiderman,3caxz5,Mantis05,2,Tue Jul 7 05:04:36 2015 UTC,Very true. His character was a perfect example of a real character development within a story. Like I said I hope that make another character like his later on. It's a shame that his character was practically completely dropped in the Ultimate comics series.
Spiderman,3caxz5,Apple_Joel,13,Tue Jul 7 10:58:01 2015 UTC,"Shame she wasn't half as into him as he was into her.   Also, I always found it a little sad that Kong, who is basically Bendis as a teenager inserted into USM, dates Kitty Pryde, as Bendis seems to be obsessed with her."

Spiderman,3c9pjt,Blackout744,31,Mon Jul 6 04:55:30 2015 UTC,"You know, I thought the same thing.  People talk about Peter's origin like him being a teenager in high school was the majority of the comic. It really wasn't.  He spent far longer in college, and far longer as an adult."
Spiderman,3c9pjt,ryckae,19,Mon Jul 6 05:11:00 2015 UTC,"You're missing a few things here:  The first being that the MCU doesn't strictly follow 616 continuity. All of their characters are a combination of various versions of said character, usually a mixture of 616 and Ultimate. Lets look at Captain America, for example. A pretty sizeable portion of all the WW2 stuff is heavily influenced by the Ultimate Universe, but his origin story is 100% 616 Captain America. His personality is a mesh of both, etc, etc.  The other thing you're missing is that Marvel isn't making Peter in high school because it was such a huge part of 616-continuity, they are doing it to set Peter Parker apart from the rest of their characters. Every Marvel movie franchise has its own feel right now (Iron Man is scifi tech based, Thor is fantasy, Captain America is historical and political drama, Guardians of the Galaxy is a space opera, Doctor Strange is going to be heavily horror influenced, Ant Man is going to be a heist movie, etc). So what are they going to do for Spider-Man? Make him younger. This does two things: gives his movies their own little genre niche in the MCU and it sets Peter Parker as a character apart from everyone else.   A high schooler sees the world in a very different light than someone like Iron Man or Captain America, who have each been doing this for a while and have seen all kinds of things throughout the duration of their lives. Its going to create an interesting dichotomy between the ""new world view"" and the ""old world view"", for lack of better phrasing.  And lastly, yeah Ultimate Peter Parker spent over a hundred and fifty issues in high school. There is plenty of material to draw from."
Spiderman,3c9pjt,kiekan,5,Mon Jul 6 11:07:58 2015 UTC,I agree with what you are saying. I'm perfectly fine with a high school Peter in the MCU. I'm talking about in the comics. I think the MCU is going to handle this new movie very well.
Spiderman,3c9pjt,kiekan,3,Mon Jul 6 12:06:25 2015 UTC,"People aren't complaining that Peter needs to go back to high school in the comics, though. Which is why I thought you were pointing to the MCU Spidey. The big complaint right now, is that turning Peter Parker into, essentially, a Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne amalgamation isn't the direction the character needs to go.  If anything, as far as comics are concerned, people don't want to see more high school stuff. They want to see a more matured, capable Peter Parker. They want him to actually push past his standard status quo and do something new (the key, though, is that whatever new direction the character would go, it needs to stick to the ""core foundation"" of the character, which Slott's upcoming post-Secret Wars story currently doesn't seem (its not out yet, so just going off the teases) to be doing)."
Spiderman,3c9pjt,aslanenlisted,3,Mon Jul 6 13:54:46 2015 UTC,To add to your point Kevin Feige recently went on record and said they are aiming for a John Hughes coming of age type of film for Spidey. Source
Spiderman,3c9pjt,jhk0215,8,Mon Jul 6 11:41:07 2015 UTC,I think most people talk about it because Spectacular Spider-Man focused on him as a teenager in high school and that show was pretty popular
Spiderman,3c9pjt,schloopers,4,Mon Jul 6 09:36:21 2015 UTC,"That show was dang near perfect, but if it had moved onto college, it still would've been great. It was the writing that carried it, more than any one setting."
Spiderman,3c9pjt,jhk0215,2,Mon Jul 6 11:57:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that the high school setting was the only reason the show was great, I'm saying that a lot of the fans who think of high school Peter Parker as the definitive Peter Parker probably grew up with USM or Spectacular"
Spiderman,3c9pjt,SpartanLegend,7,Mon Jul 6 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"I think people harp on it because the origin story has him in high school. Even though most of the comics don't, people see his origin in movies and from reading the first few comics and want that kid.  I also think nostalgia kicks in a little, wanting to be young again and reading the first comics for the first time"

Daredevil could show up at the end of the movie, after Mysterio is defeated, and tell Spider-Man that he will take care of Kingpin).   2: Vulture (Spider-Man would have the symbiote in this movie, after getting it in Infinity War. Spider-Man would nearly kill Vulture at the end of the movie, and he will get rid of the symbiote). (Post credit scene is the Venom transformation).   3: Venom (Venom loses the symbiote by the end of the film). (Post credit scene is Brock meeting his cell mate in jail, Kasady. This sets up the Venom spinoff).   4: Green Goblin (Osborn would be set up in all the previous movies. The Vulture suit in the second movie would be a prototype of the Goblin armor)."
Spiderman,3ca1fc,rjpugs24,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:16:36 2015 UTC,"How do you think they could make Vulture work as a standalone villain?  In the comics he's very similar to others like Electro (although Electro's movie version contradicts this) in that he's mostly a bank robbing villain or a cog in a larger group, whose hatred for Spider-Man is due only to the latter's interference in crimes rather than pathological."
Spiderman,3ca1fc,RocketTasker,2,Tue Jul 7 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"I personally was never for Vulture as a main villain, but I included him on the list because we have never seen the Vulture, and because it could set up a Sinister 6 movie. I probably would include Shocker in the second movie as a side villain hired by the Kingpin or Osborn. Vulture could be a scientist working at Oscorp, but goes mad with power once he finds out what he can use the Oscorp technologies for (the Vulture suit)."
Spiderman,3ca1fc,rjpugs24,5,Tue Jul 7 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"Tom Holland is 19, so I really think they’re planning on him being Spidey for the long-run. I loved the film Boyhood and hope we get to see Peter grow from a high school student to a working professional/true super hero over the course of these films. I've had this typed out for a few months. (Disclaimer: This is just my opinion of what would work in a Spider-Man franchise)  1)   Age 16:  High school student, bitten by spider a few months ago. Spent the summer fighting small time thugs and criminals. Mysterio and Chameleon team-up to impersonate Spidey and commit robberies/theft. Chameleon could use the image altering tech used by Black Widow in The Winter Soldier. Side story could be about Peter fitting in at school with Flash, Kong, Randy Robertson, Liz Allan (minimize the romance). Peter becomes good friends with Randy Robertson, whose father helps Pete get a job at the Daily Bugle in the next film.  2)  Age 18: Post-infinity war and acquired the symbiote costume. Begin the film with graduation from high school. Peter spends summer as an intern at the Daily Bugle where he submits amazing pictures of Spider-Man making veteran reporter Eddie Brock jealous. (This film should focus on how the symbiote makes Peter more aggressive and reckless in his civilian life just as much as his life as Spidey). At night, Spidey pursues the Black Cat who has been committing a slew of thefts around the city. JJJ also becomes suspicious of how Pete gets the Spidey pictures and hires detective Mac Gargan to track him. Mac is given a suit and becomes the Scorpion in the final fight and Pete loses the symbiote which finds its way to Eddie Brock, creating Venom.  3)  Age 20: is currently a college student at Empire State University where he is roommates with Harry Osborn. Reintroduce his high school friends with the addition of Mary Jane Watson.  Pete’s favorite professor is Otto Octavius, who is a part time educator and full-time Oscorp employee. Norman Osborn continually puts pressure on Octavius to meet deadlines for their Goblin/Oz project. Octavius suffers an accident where he merges to his harness and becomes Doctor Octopus. Doc Ock attempts to get revenge on Norman Osborn, but is stopped by Spidey. The side plot could be Eddie Brock/Venom terrorizing Peter from a distance (i.e. Threatening Aunt May, pushing him into traffic, etc.) Film ends with final battle with Venom.  4)  Age 22:  Intrigued by Spider-Man’s powers, Norman Osborn begins testing technology on human subjects and creates Rhino and the Shocker to fight Spidey (keep origins for those two at a minimum). Spidey defeats both villains after a difficult battle, but is severely wounded. Osborn uses Spider-Man’s DNA to create the Oz formula and turn himself into the Green Goblin. In his civilian life, Peter is on the verge of college graduation, back at the Daily Bugle, and in a relationship with Mary Jane. Harry Osborn becomes envious of Peter and is angered by being neglected by his father. Norman discovers Peter’s identity and attacks him at his home in Forrest Hills, Queens. Aunt May is killed before the Green Goblin is defeated.  5)  Age 24: Following Aunt May’s death, Peter breaks up with MJ due to fearing for her safety. JJJ learns about May’s death and offers Peter a full time job at the Bugle. JJJ also offers a million dollar reward as a publicity stunt for whoever captures Spider-Man and unmasks him. Peter, still battling depression, reverts to a cloth version of his black symbiote costume. One night, he comes in contact with Morbius who bites Spidey (hopefully there’s a Blade Netflix show by then). Peter discovers he lost all his powers. Kraven the Hunter arrives in NYC intent on capturing Spidey and claiming the reward. He finds a powerless Spidey and easily defeats him. Instead of turning him in, Kraven shoots Spidey with a tranquilizer dart and buries him alive. Overconfident after easily defeating Spider-Man, Kraven (dressed in the black symbiote costume) frees Spider-Mans six most dangerous foes from the previous movies and challenges them to battle. Doc Ock, Scorpion, Shocker, Rhino, Mysterio, and Chameleon easily defeat Kraven and beat him within inches of his life. Spider-Man emerges from his grave, dressed in the classic red and blue costume with his powers back, defeat the Sinister Six. Peter reconciles with MJ (maybe even proposing to her with Aunt May’s ring). The final scene should be ambiguous, with Kraven holding a rifle in hand and on the verge of suicide."

Spiderman,3ca1fc,Wilibine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:12:23 2015 UTC,"For a first movie, I think Mysterio or Shocker could be cool.   Then the second movie focuses on Eddie Brock and Peter, with brief mentions of Cletus. Symbiote comes and that arc happens, with Eddie becoming Venom at the end and Peter and he battle briefly but Venom escapes.  The bird movie would be Peter vs. Venom vs. Carnage, and end with a Spidey-Venom team up. I feel like the only way to have Carnage as a main villain is to build up the symbiote arc in a previous movie so that Venom is developed and introduced already. And Venom gets to stick around for a while and still be a loose thread by the third movie. Keep Mysterio alive too. More villains need to be alive so that they can return with greater impact- I feel that is one issue with the MCU. I like villains that remain throughout a series.   My main dream is that Symbiote arc. But that aside, I'd want the villains to go- Mysterio, Kraven, then Morlun.  Having a Kraven's Last Hunt movie would be awesome to me. And I'd love a Morlun movie too. So many things I want. But two movies to deal with Venom and Carnage is my ultimate dream."

Gwen would be dead & Pete would be dating MJ & working at the Daily Bugle as a web designer. The villains would be Scorpion & Shocker. The 2nd movie would feature Spidey obtaining the black suit, which would have a similar origin as the Ultimate series (as such we'd be introduced to Eddie Brock, Jr.). The sole villain would be Mysterio. At the end of the movie, Mysterio is recruited by Doc Ock to join the Sinister Six. In the beginning of the 3rd movie, Spidey would discard the symbiote. He'd fight the classic line-up of the Sinister Six. The 4th & final movie would be Spidey vs. Venom, who is Eddie bonded with the symbiote Pete discarded in the previous movie. He'd also battle Alistair Smythe & the Spider-Slayers.   Each movie would also have minor appearances by other villains (similar to the Rhino in the beginning of TASM2, but way better)."

Spiderman,3c75b8,OLKv3,10,Sun Jul 5 22:56:35 2015 UTC,"I want to know Joe Q's logic with allowing this considering his previous mandates on Peter (a.k.a. One More Day). He's allowed to change 'cept a wife and kids.  So folks keep talking about how Pete's supposed to be relatable, barely making ends meet, juggling multiple ladies in his life, etc. So having a good job with a high-tech super science firm like Moddell Industries is SO relatable. Being a globe-trotting industrialist is SO relatable. Wife and kids? Totally not relatable at all, I'm sure no significant percentage of Spider-Man readers have had a wife and kids.  I'm not disagreeing with the direction Slott's taking. I'm not taking any sort of stance on the One More Day debacle. I'm just pointing out the inconsistency we seem to be getting with the idea of what Peter Parker is and isn't supposed to be.  I've enjoyed everything Slott's done so far with the character and I don't see that ending anytime soon. I just wish that folks would quit calling out Marvel and it's creators for making Spider-Man unrelatable."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Kenobi13,3,Mon Jul 6 00:46:58 2015 UTC,This so much.
Spiderman,3c75b8,ryckae,2,Mon Jul 6 05:04:23 2015 UTC,Those are my thoughts every time I think of One More Day. Apparently being a super genius who can make webbing and is great with machinery is more relatable than being married with a child.  It's the dumbest thing Joe Q has ever said
Spiderman,3c75b8,OLKv3,2,Mon Jul 6 05:56:51 2015 UTC,"Growing up =/= completely changing the character. He was Pretty grown up before OMD. Then BND reverted him back to adolescence, despite being in his 20's."
Spiderman,3c75b8,bolognahole,3,Mon Jul 6 11:56:43 2015 UTC,did you just ignore every other part of my post? Lol I talked about him living up to his potential for once instead of settling for small jobs
Spiderman,3c75b8,OLKv3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"He has always lived up to his potential. He built trackers that he could follow with his spider sense. Making him a millionaire/billionaire goes against the core of his character. He was never comfortable rubbing elbows with high society. He always put Spider-Mans responsibilities before any career. Making him a glob trotting business man kills the ""friendly neighborhood"" Spider-Man. And having him being so smart, yet at street level was another part of his appea, IMO. Yeah, he is genius who can build all kinds of tech and be a Jr. Stark. But he is a grounded genius."
Spiderman,3c75b8,bolognahole,2,Mon Jul 6 16:20:01 2015 UTC,Yes. Exactly.
Spiderman,3c75b8,ad11397,47,Sun Jul 5 19:35:59 2015 UTC,This is the last thing I want for Peter Parker. Peter is supposed to be the regular guy in extraordinary circumstances. I won't be able to relate to him as this character.

He's the character who struggles to make end's meet, to balance his personal and heroic life, has girl troubles, and never quite gets it right. That's Peter Parker, it's who he's been for his entire existence, even Spock had trouble with it all. I don't read Amazing Spider-Man for Iron Man junior."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Iokuas,43,Sun Jul 5 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"So you want a character that is permanently deadlocked and has no growth, story arcs, maturation, or end?  You're the reason for One More Day."

Spiderman,3c75b8,Moara7,21,Sun Jul 5 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'd like just to chime in and say what they're doing isn't really true growth or character development. If he's this one guy in one issue, and all of the sudden in the relaunch he is now totally different, that's not growth; that's a complete change. It's not development, it's a drastic curve ball.  We've had growth. We've learned about about his past, his motivations, and we've seen him go through numerous traumatic events that have caused a change in character over his Spider-Man career. We've seen him get older and move through jobs and marriage, and how he behaves in those situations. That's closer to character growth than what you're talking about.   Character growth does not have to be monetary, or about him getting rich and hitting the big time. It can be subtle, and it can be gradual. That's how you sustain character growth, otherwise it usually pans out as a gimmick."
Spiderman,3c75b8,moralless,7,Sun Jul 5 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"It isn't exactly out of nowhere.  We don't need to know the details yet, but it seems to be following the events of volume 3, which saw Parker Industries doing reasonably well under his guidance before Ghost."
Spiderman,3c75b8,RarelySpider-Man,9,Sun Jul 5 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's not entirely un-hinted. It's not like today he's still a photographer and tomorrow he's Iron Man. But I still feel like there's a huge leap between Parker Industries doing reasonably well and international billionaire global defender."
Spiderman,3c75b8,moralless,5,Sun Jul 5 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"it's not entirely un-hinted. It's not like today he's still a photographer and tomorrow he's Iron Man.   Based on what we know about the relaunch (which, admittedly isn't much), I'd actually argue that it is. Parker Industries was doing very poorly under Peter's guidance and was only being kept afloat by Ana Marie and Sajani being capable adults. The last time we saw anything from them, Ghost had completely devastated the company, destroying their HQ and showing that their main objective (super villain prison) was far from ready.  When Secret Wars ends, we're skipping eight months ahead, and Spider-Man is randomly rich and world famous. Completely incongruous with what was happening pre-Secret Wars."
Spiderman,3c75b8,kiekan,-1,Mon Jul 6 15:37:33 2015 UTC,Supposedly this takes place some time since before Secret Wars. I think they said 8 months but looks like a jumping off point. I think it is interesting and we have seen him become more of an adult figure in Marvel.
Spiderman,3c75b8,bingbangboomxx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:38:50 2015 UTC,Before Secret Wars? That's strange. I didn't realize they were having any of the new line take place before Secret Wars. I thought the whole point was bringing everything into the same time and place. Good to know.
Spiderman,3c75b8,moralless,2,Sun Jul 5 23:53:42 2015 UTC,I think it's 8 months after Secret Wars.
Spiderman,3c75b8,briancarknee,10,Mon Jul 6 03:20:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. Growth is an inherent part of a ""young hero"" of a ""regular guy in extraordinary circumstances"". The whole idea of characters like that is for them to rise to the occasion and learn from it, get better. Great potential and growth is coded into the DNA of Spider-Man, we have to see it at some point, it needs to be fulfilled.  I really hope this works out and this becomes a trend for the character. Steady improvement rather than perpetual backtracking and stagnation."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Redsigil,7,Sun Jul 5 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"100% agree, I love spider man but every new story arc involves him pretty much being back to nothing and having to struggle to make ends meat.   He's a grown man, an avenger, a genius, has seen and experienced more than most people in the whole marvel universe but I'm supposed to believe he isn't good enough to every actually learn from his mistakes?"
Spiderman,3c75b8,DeanIsAPro,7,Sun Jul 5 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"Maturation doesn't mean Peter has to become a jet-setting millionaire inventor. Some of us were quite happy with the growth of Peter as a teacher, a husband, and perhaps one day a father. That's incredible character growth that still keeps Peter Parker relatable to the everyman. Then Marvel ripped it all away."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Mantis05,3,Mon Jul 6 04:00:08 2015 UTC,Fair point.
Spiderman,3c75b8,SubtleMockery,2,Mon Jul 6 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm not completely condemning this. It's nice to see Marvel at least trying to keep Peter from stagnating, and it may very well be an entertaining run. But if you ask me about my Peter Parker ""endgame,"" if you will, that's it."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Mantis05,3,Mon Jul 6 04:17:18 2015 UTC,Fuck One More Day!!!
Spiderman,3c75b8,roninwarshadow,2,Mon Jul 6 00:04:46 2015 UTC,You don't need to completely change what people love about a character for growth. You can easily have his character grow while remaining relatable. They done it right up to OMD.
Spiderman,3c75b8,bolognahole,2,Mon Jul 6 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"So you want a character that is permanently deadlocked and has no growth, story arcs, maturation, or end?   You don't have to lock a character into a permanent status quo. But you also don't have to betray the very core of the character. I'm right beside /u/Iokuas . This new direction for Peter doesn't jive with his character. Peter is supposed to be Spider-Man out of a sense of purpose and responsibility. When he does it for financial gain and to show off, it completely goes against everything the character has been for since 1963.  Having said that, I don't think that Peter needs to always down on his luck. I thought having him get a job at Horizon Labs was a fantastic direction for the character to go in. It took the character in a different direction, but still kept Peter Parker, well ""Peter Parker""."
Spiderman,3c75b8,kiekan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"Parker's the everyman. That's what made him relatable. You strip that, you're taking away a huge part of what makes him him. His stories still had story arcs and growth and ""maturation."""

Spiderman,3c75b8,DangTaylor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. One of the primary draws of Spidey for me is that no matter what he goes through, he's still the same nerdy kid he always was in the end."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Hyperman360,6,Mon Jul 6 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"When an ordinary character succeeds in life, the people who used to relate to him can live vicariously through him and know where he came from.  Compare that to Tony Stark, Bruce Wayne, or Oliver Queen who fell into their wealth through their family. I'll still relate better to Peter Parker than I will Tony Stark."
Spiderman,3c75b8,ThatIckyGuy,15,Sun Jul 5 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"But in the last paragraph, he mentions that's exactly what Miles is here for. I personally think it's an excellent idea.  Of course there's going to be a part of all of us that wants Peter to stay the same Peter we've always known and grew up with, but the reality is its just more interesting to have a character that actually grows and develops. And besides that, doesn't it just feel nice to see a long time ""underdog""/""everyman"" character who struggled for so long and that so many of us related to on so many levels finally achieve this grand level of personal success?   Tony Stark is and always was Tony Stark. He's got incredible talent, genius intellect, and strength of will, but his father had already established quite a bit for himself and secured a more than comfortable life for his family (not exactly something we can all relate to). Peter on the other hand came from very little. We've seen him fight and struggle over the years, in ways that feel familiar to our own lives, and now we get to see him finally reap the rewards. We may not be able to relate to Peter as directly now, but we can feel a sense of pride in his accomplishments because we know where he came from, we know what he's been through, and this almost feels like a victory for ""one of us"" in a sense.  But we still have Miles as the Spider-Man hero who's just struggling to get by and do the right thing in all the familiar ways we feel connected to.  And lets not forget: while Peter's circumstances may now be less relatable to us than Miles' are; I'm sure he'll still have the same personality and face the same internal struggles we've made this connection with him through."
Spiderman,3c75b8,TransPM,3,Sun Jul 5 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"You have your opinion, and I respect that  The one thing is that Miles is a teen and Peter is an adult. Most ASM readers are Adults ( I presume ) and I find it really hard for a 36 year old dude to relate to a 16 year old kid. If they wanted Peter to be successful, and still NOT make him Batman Inc. levels, they could've kept his position at Horizon Labs, or make him a Professor as suggested by many. I just cant support Dan Slott making Spidey Iron Man and Batman's one night stand love child."
Spiderman,3c75b8,Corvo_DeWitt,4,Mon Jul 6 01:08:42 2015 UTC,You can still relate to a character if they are growing up and doing different things. I doubt you have been bitten by a radioactive spider and became a superhero too.

Spiderman,3c75b8,rosstimus,5,Mon Jul 6 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"Really liking this new look. Classic colors as always, but its got the under-arm webbing which creates a very old-school/classic feel, while at the same time presenting a sort of sleek, glossiness that gives off a more advanced high-tech feel to reflect his new circumstances. For some reason, the general design is really making me think of his ""Ends of the Earth"" armor, but a more traditional take on it (which seems perfect considering the new technological angle they're describing), and of course the glowing spider emblem is reminiscent of his ""Big Time"" look (another very high-tech suit)."

Spiderman,3c75b8,OLKv3,5,Sun Jul 5 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"I don't want to boo hoo this.  I want to read and give a chance.  However, I am a bit leery about everything.  I've been wanting Peter to step up and start acting like a proper grown up for a while now, so it kind of seems like a whole big ""beggars can't be choosers"" type of deal.    But I do think they jumped too far too fast.  I would rather see Peter try to pick up the pieces of Parker Industries and be there to watch him rebuild it.  I'm not sure about everything already being established. And I want him back with MJ, not in another love triangle.   But to be honest the only thing that really bothers me is the stupid Spider-mobile.  Spidey in a car is just weird.  The original was always a joke, but I feel like this one is serious.  Just no. :(  But idk, as long as he starts being a competent grown up I guess it's all good."

And while that is important, the movies make him look to weak and vulnerable way past the point necessary to relate to him.   Truth is, Spider-Man has a dark and serious adult side. He's actually part of the Avengers, is on par with the Fantastic Four and fights crazy insanely powerful villains like Carnage, Venom, Demogoblin and such.   I like this Batman-esque and 2099 approach to Spidey."

The only quibble I have (besides still no mj), is that as a scientist, it bothers me that they lump all science together, usually under computer engineering. Pete.s field was always chemistry, which has a ton of interesting applications, but enough is,I guess, harder for the layman to get their head around.  Would,t that be a great trio: Reed Richards on physics, Tony stark on tech, and Peter parker on chemistry. Just needs someone for bio; banner maybe?"

I hope they keep in mind how this deviates from the core character concept and address that in some way.  And I hope there is an exit strategy.  Spider-Man as Iron Man sounds pretty cool... for a while.  Just like Doc Ock as Spider-Man was cool as a temporary tweak to the status quo.    I do think they missed an opportunity for SUPERIOR to totally trash Peter's life, instead of him waking up into a far better situation than he typically left himself.  Of course, that's interesting too, Doc Ock teaching Peter a thing or two about how to be a better Spider-Man."

Spiderman,3bw6g8,ranhalt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:50:43 2015 UTC,Well half of the staff at Marvel and DC go back and forth between companies so it makes sense that you'd get writers like that from time to time.
Spiderman,3bw6g8,ranhalt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:16:57 2015 UTC,"I mean...that's why they made the title.  Spider-Man Unlimited--even when volume one came out--was a double-sized book published quarterly. It typically featured one-off, self-contained stories (with a few exceptions--the first and second issues kicked off and completed, respectively, the ""Maximum Carnage"" stoyline, and during the Clone Saga all the Spider-Books interlinked).   They revived it with volume three, and it was the same type of thing: double-sized issues, published every few months, containing two or three stories each, featuring writers and artists that weren't typically on Spider-Man."

Spiderman,3bx3mw,IAmTheZeke,20,Thu Jul 2 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"That would be incredible, but the thing is, they'd need to get good writer. That's a major part of what made the Arkham games amazing, aside from the revolutionary fighting system. It's the story. And I would love for them to do it, but I think they are partners with WB, which works with DC. So it won't happen.  Activision needs to step up their game though. It's either great gameplay, bad story, or bad gameplay great story. Give us a combo."
Spiderman,3bx3mw,TheopholosWhenntooda,9,Thu Jul 2 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"They need to drop Beenox for another developer; Beenox hasn't made a great Spider-Man game in quite a while.

Batman is amazing, but he can only do so much. Using Peter's webshooters to sling around the battlefield or to attach to a crook would be absolutely awesome.   The problem would be what the story could be about. You could always do the founding of the Sinister Six or perhaps an event similar to Maximum Carnage. I would be eager to see what they could do with Spider-Man, but I highly doubt they'd do it."

A Spidey game developed by Avalanche Studios would be the best though. They're the studio behind the Just Cause games, and if you've ever seen/played them, you know there's a lot of aerials and tethering/grapple hooking. Very similar to web shooting.  Not to mention that along with Just Cause 3 and a movie video game (Mad Max), it was announced that they'd be developing a comic book game. What if that game is Spider-Man? We can only hope."

But I'm still bitter about the whole Mary Jane thing.  But I get why Marvel went with a younger Spidey. They want to keep him around for a while and the current crop of Avengers are at the end of their contracts and in their 30s and 40s. Plus it would be kind of neat to see a young Spidey geeking out and meeting Tony Stark. Because in that universe, Stark has probably his hero for years since he's usually a science geek. Stark is like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Telsa turned into one awesome guy with a flying suit of armor. Give me that scene and I'll be happy."

Spiderman,3bshv5,hoodie92,5,Thu Jul 2 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"True but that's not what they want in the MCU. They want a young Peter struggling with school and powers.  One day I'd love to see an older Spidey, but for now we gotta be happy with what we're getting."
Spiderman,3bshv5,Justice_Prince,7,Thu Jul 2 00:56:33 2015 UTC,"If confuses me when people are acting like this is the first time we're getting a highschool age Peter.  Sure the last two series had twenty something guys playing teenagers, but they still both started in highschool.  I get why the MCU wanted to go younger they needed to contract all their other 30 something actors, but when I hear Feige talk about how we're ""finally getting a highschool Parker"" it makes it sound like he things the other movies all started with Peter graduating college."
Spiderman,3bshv5,hoodie92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:35:54 2015 UTC,"They pretty much did. Raimi's series had half of a film of high school Pete. Webb's had one film. Overall it's 1.5 films out of 5. Considering his teenage years are really important to his story, I don't think that's enough."
Spiderman,3bshv5,MasterLawlz,2,Thu Jul 2 14:25:36 2015 UTC,Yeah but keep in mind it takes a few years to make a movie so they age out of high school really quickly. This is why a Spiderman TV show would make more sense because seasons come out every year.
Spiderman,3bshv5,hoodie92,2,Thu Jul 2 14:29:24 2015 UTC,I think that's why they cast such a young-looking guy. They could probably make 2 Spider-Man films and he could appear in maybe 3 or 4 other MCU films before he actually looks 18.

Spiderman,3bshv5,whitey-ofwgkta,5,Fri Jul 3 13:20:57 2015 UTC,Apples and oranges. Tony Stark is in a metal suit that does all the work for him. He could be elderly and still use it.
Spiderman,3bshv5,itspronouncedbreaux,6,Thu Jul 2 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Also he's not locked into ""high school age""."

Spiderman,3bvo0w,aus10_t8um,8,Thu Jul 2 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"They're trying to make Miles the grounded Spider-Man, which is a shame as he's not as interesting or as well developed a character as Peter. I think it's something they'll learn as time passes, it may seem like a good idea to move Miles to the 616, but did anyone at Marvel stop to look at his sales? They average around 37-40,000 a month, that's not even close to Peter's lowest as Ultimate Spider-Man. They're looking to push him as Spider-Man, yet Miles has sales numbers that would have got him canceled as a mainstream series. Peter regularly sells triple that number, his big selling issues he brings in quintuple or more."
Spiderman,3bvo0w,Iokuas,2,Thu Jul 2 16:51:47 2015 UTC,Lol. Marvel definitely wouldn't cancel a book doing 40k a month. Their cancellation like is ~20K.

Spiderman,3bvo0w,suss2it,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:46 2015 UTC,Miles has a lot of potential for only being around a few years. I enjoyed his series (minus the last arc).
Spiderman,3bvo0w,IAmTheZeke,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:26:18 2015 UTC,A few years? He's been around 4 years and has had little development as a character which makes him uninteresting and very lackluster. His dad has had more development than him.
Spiderman,3bvo0w,Lox22,6,Thu Jul 2 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"His dad has had more development then him.   Haha, maybe not altogether - but I'll admit that he needs some work - he seems kinda vanilla sometimes.   One of the things I liked most about Miles is his desire to live up to Peter - and I have to imagine that it's been a crazy for him. Every time he allows himself to feel like ""the"" Spider-Man, Peter comes back (in some form or another) and now he will share a universe where Peter is going to be a world-wide huge hero - I think it will make the dynamic interesting.   How do you live up to that? How can you feel like Spider-Man, and good about yourself - when that other guy is casting his shadow.  tldr: I like the potential it has with this new dynamic."
Spiderman,3bvo0w,IAmTheZeke,3,Thu Jul 2 20:33:03 2015 UTC,I like that they already set the ground work for 616 Peter's and 1610 Miles' relationship in Spider-Men.
Spiderman,3bvo0w,NOBLExGAMER,8,Sat Jul 4 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"I like that Peter has been going more... ahem... Big Time. Like someone else said, he's super smart and has been in many crazy adventures that aren't ""street level"" in any sense of the word. He's not a high schooler anymore. He's had a Masters and now, through Doc Ock, he's got a Ph.D. When you're at that level, does it really make sense to keep him in high schooler mode?  Plus, Miles is still around. I like Miles. He's cool. His costume is cool. He can be the new high school Spider-Man.  I've recently been wanting some sort of rotation for our heroes like Super Sentai and Kamen Rider have in Japan. You can have a bunch more super-heroes like this (so, more toys, yay) and you can have many different characters too. It'd also bring about finality to their stories."
Spiderman,3bvo0w,Moulinoski,7,Thu Jul 2 17:35:16 2015 UTC,Correct. We've had 50 years of Peter not making much progress. It's time for him to grow up a bit and not get in his own way.
Spiderman,3bvo0w,epraider,3,Fri Jul 3 16:30:16 2015 UTC,When you're able to hack Stark tech you should be above just fighting crime in the streets of New York.

Spiderman,3bvo0w,jhk0215,8,Thu Jul 2 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"Which... is actually kinda a good way to go about it, if you do have two spider-men."

Spiderman,3bvo0w,RarelySpider-Man,10,Thu Jul 2 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"this is something i agree with but im confused because if someone asked me to write spiderman with a 20+ year history what else can i do? Think about it.. he always punches above his weight class and is supposed to be a super genius. so how long can he remain where he was.. the only reason i am reluctantly accepting this move for Peter is because we have run out of things to write for him (as the golden age parker). I will always cherish peter as the underdog/fight the streets/unsung hero. But i am afraid, in my eyes, his true golden age is done.. so i have a mosaic of my best fragments of peter and i understand what makes peter parker the best goddamn hero ever but we cannot do those story lines again :("
Spiderman,3bvo0w,snowblind1985,18,Thu Jul 2 16:03:40 2015 UTC,I probably enjoyed Spider-Man the most when he was a married high school science teacher.
Spiderman,3bvo0w,XMenOrangesTangerine,5,Thu Jul 2 16:26:32 2015 UTC,That is what I consider to be Spider-Man's peak. Nothing Slott has done/will do will ever top JMS era Spidey.
Spiderman,3bvo0w,darklordx123,6,Fri Jul 3 08:40:14 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. JMS's run is my favourite run of Spider-Man, as well as what got me into comics in the first place."

Spiderman,3bvo0w,Hydro757,2,Thu Jul 2 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought they didn't make Garfield funny enough. What they did was good, but they needed more of it.   And, while the direction and writing is a factor in how many jokes and stuff Tobey says in the movies, Tobey himself just couldn't really pull them off in my opinion. The few jokes he does say just come off as awkward and forced.   I think my perfect Spidey sense of humour (sorry for the pun) is from the Spectacular Spider-Man tv show."

Doctor Doom created Battleworld over in Secret Wars, which is a patchwork universe, made from fragments of other universes. Renew Your Vows is set in one of those other universes. It has nothing to do with the rest of Amazing Spider-Man, despite it having the same title."
Spiderman,3bvlza,kiekan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"You seem like you might no the answer to this, what is up with the spiral storyline? I think the last ASM before secret wars was 18 (i could be wrong). But I see there was a 19.1 and 20.1 to continue the spiral story. Are they just skipping ASM 19 and 20?"
Spiderman,3bvlza,RANDALLFLA666,3,Thu Jul 2 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"Its not 100% accurate, as its placement in continuity is kinda hard to pinpoint 100%, but just think of Spiral as what happens after ASM 18 and before Secret Wars. Spiral is wrapping up all the stuff with Black Cat going back to being a villain.  Its also extremely well written. Gerry Conway is an awesome writer. He's been around for ages and has written some extremely iconic stories, such as the death of Gwen Stacy or creating The Punisher (right in the pages of ASM, and then going on to his own solo book), etc.  Definitely read Spiral. One of the best Spidey stories in a long time."
Spiderman,3bvlza,kiekan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"Okay cool. I've read the 1 and 2 but couldn't really remember what happened when 3 came out.

Spiderman,3bvlza,RANDALLFLA666,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, the Black Cat story shouldn't even exist. It was stupid from the get go. Lets break it down:   Black Cat completely randomly decides to go back to stealing, after being a straight hero for decades and being Spidey's ally and on/off again lover. She throws a temper tantrum after SpOck (who, to her was very clearly not Peter, she even brings up how odd he's acting) punches her in the face and sends her to jail for being a crook. She gets out and wants to ruin Spidey. Peter tells her he was mind swapped with Ock and she calls him a liar. Continues to have a hate boner for Peter now and wants to ruin his life any way she can. Even kidnapping and torturing his friends and acquaintances.   ....wat.  It makes zero sense.  Having said all that, Conway really does make lemonade out of lemons, with Spiral. It was a horrible premise to begin, but he some how managed to make this conclusion great."
Spiderman,3bvlza,kiekan,2,Thu Jul 2 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"There hasn't been a conclusion yet.  Spiral isn't even done.  I just read part 4, but there's still more to come.    But yeah, Spiral has been fun, despite me hating what had been done to Felicia before hand."
Spiderman,3bvlza,ryckae,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:01:19 2015 UTC,I know there hasn't been a conclusion. But the story as a whole is supposed to close that story arc by its end. That's what I was referring to.

Spiderman,3bvlza,briancarknee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Marvel has flat-out said that they're switching to a ""season"" approach to their series like with television. So expect relaunches like this pretty frequently from now on.  Some books have only made it to 5 or 6 issues before being relaunched. It's dumb and short-sighted in my opinion but hey, it keeps sales high and that's all they care about."
Spiderman,3bvlza,RarelySpider-Man,2,Thu Jul 2 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't mind.  I started with Volume 3 and it feels cool to know i will have the complete collection.   I'm collecting older issues too but it is quite daunting."
Spiderman,3bvlza,briancarknee,3,Thu Jul 2 21:15:31 2015 UTC,"it feels cool to know i will have the complete collection   I don't mean to diminish that but how cool will it feel when they're on volume 11 of Amazing Spider-Man? Volume 3 will be a drop in the pond eventually.   I mean, if they're going for the season approach I think that ""season"" should be longer than a year (a lot of the books they're relaunching only made it to 5 issues or so). Even those 18 issues of Vol. 3 of Amazing Spider-Man were hardly anything. It was basically Spider-Verse bookended by a couple stories. It felt like a half-hearted run before they came up with a new status quo shift and then just dumped volume three to the wayside.  At least other seasonal comic books like Angel and Buffy go for around 24 issues before starting a new season. They have a clear direction for the season and the close of it feels satisfying without being final.  But so far the Marvel approach lately is ""go until we come up with a new idea to promote and then we relaunch.""  Superior ended. So Marvel's approach to volume three was basically ""the relatable Peter is back in the classic red and blues!"" And then 18 issues later the new thing is ""Peter's life is completely different! new costume! new job! new everything."" They promoted a return to form only to reverse gears so quickly into another experimental run.  Wow, what a rant. But look, there's still a lot to enjoy and I'm curious to see how they handle relaunches going forward. I just felt volume three was pretty underwhelming and misleading in its intent."
Spiderman,3bvlza,briancarknee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"yeah I feel like the idea behind slapping ""#1"" on a cover is just like you said a high selling way of gaining new readers that can technically say they'll just start from there.   But if they keep slapping ""#1"" on issues it takes any VALUE out of HAVING a definitive ""#1"" physical copy which kinda sucks."
Spiderman,3bvlza,kiekan,2,Thu Jul 2 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"Right, exactly.  If they're going to keep doing this I'd at least appreciate a separate number somewhere on the cover or inside keeping track of what the actual issue number is.

Choose stuff with art you like, choose arcs that you've heard about, choose anything you want cause most of it is good. Just don't read Blue first.

It sounds to me like OP is referring Amazing Spider-Man #600, where MJ is first reintroduced during Brand New Day. During that, Peter goes to Aunt May's wedding (which continues from Amazing Spider-Man Annual #36 ) and the final page is a full page splash of MJ in a pink dress, kinda mirroring her first full appearance in ASM #42. its been a while since I read the whole issue, though."
Spiderman,3bs9tp,bat-reddit,2,Thu Jul 2 11:27:37 2015 UTC,The one with the red and gold suit and the spider legs would be from the Civil War storyline. Was the one where he meets Mary Jane an old comic?
Spiderman,3bs9tp,kiekan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"I have no clue! Now that you mentioned it, it could be."
Spiderman,3bs9tp,jhk0215,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"Peter Parker was at home getting dressed for some party (could have been prom). His aunt is repeatedly telling him to hurry up so he doesn't get late. As he heads downstairs, Aunt May tells him there will someone arriving to pick him up. Peter then opens door only to see Mary Jane in a wine red colored dress and blushes. (Very first time he meets her, I think).    This kinda sounds like Amazing Spider-Man #600.   While MJ sleeps Peter would dress as Spiderman and sling out of the balcony of their bedroom window.    That's a rather generic scene. There are hundreds of comics like that.   Im sure this one is from another series but Spiderman has a completely different suit. He has a red and gold armor suit and has four golden spider legs sticking out of his back.   Again, could be any number of comics, but its definitely when he was wearing the Iron Spider suit that Peter Parker wore for a bit before and during Civil War."

Spiderman,3bmite,Whats_fapenin_now,13,Tue Jun 30 15:12:58 2015 UTC,ASM did some but not a ton. SM didn't even touch his banter and I disliked that a lot.

Spiderman,3bp3q7,pseudomucho,5,Wed Jul 1 00:21:48 2015 UTC,I think Aunt May witness Ben's murder in nearly all forms of the origin story. The only ones that Peter was there instead of May was in the movies.
Spiderman,3bp3q7,SuckaFreeBaust,3,Wed Jul 1 06:23:46 2015 UTC,Yes.
Spiderman,3bp3q7,Dr_Adopted,2,Wed Jul 1 00:24:25 2015 UTC,"I think Amazing Spider-Man #200 states that she did witness the murder (I'm not 100% certain about this, correct me if I'm wrong). However, a much later issue in the JMS run completely contradicts this by having Ben go for a walk right before he is shot (May says she never saw him again after leaving the house, implying that she didn't witness his death)."
Spiderman,3bp3q7,WQTosh,2,Wed Jul 1 09:57:23 2015 UTC,"In ASM the murderer breaks into the Parker's house and kills Ben, so Auny May does witness it. In all the movies though its out in the city and Peter is there."

Spiderman,3bnesz,mrglass8,4,Tue Jun 30 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"I'm quite excited to see what comes of this new Spider-Man. I know this is a bit controversial, but I felt the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man was the more charismatic and relatable Peter Park, although the Maguire Peter Parker had its merits.  With this, I think it's gonna be an even better Peter Parker. The article talks about the actor being much younger and the character being able to interact with the rest of the Marvel Universe. This will certainly improve Spider-Man considerably since it brings it just that much closer to the character in the original comic books.  I hope that the plots of the new Spider-Man movies relate a lot more to his school and personal life. I think part of what makes Spider-Man such an adored character is that he seems much more human than the other characters, with problems in school, relationships, and plus he isn't rich or supernaturally intelligent (although he is pretty smart)."
Spiderman,3bnesz,NearLawliet,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:19 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. He's human who just happen to have spider-powers.

Because in this very interview here Fiege has been directly quoted as saying that it's anything but confirmed really. That people are taking Spider-Man's appearance in Civil War as a given and he doesn't want false hopes arising. He just said the opposite of that really.  Edit: Here is the direct quote from Feige, with the prompt for context.   Can you tease at all Spider-Man's role in ""Civil War""?   ""No. Everyone takes for granted that he's in it, but I don't want people to have false expectations.""    Sounds like everything else has been wild speculation thus far; this is the first time he's been directly quoted on the subject of Spider-Man so far.  Edit edit: why the down-votes when I'm simply pointing out the fact that Feige hasn't confirmed it himself? There's still room for skepticism here, trust me. It's not like I don't want him in the film, I'm just reserved."

I wanted to believe it, but my beef with this is that there's no direct quote, they just say it. There's a world of difference between these two things. Direct quotes are incredibly important, imperative really, in the field of reporting. They even have a direct quote when they mention the discussion of Ava Duvernay. But they didn't for that claim, and I wonder why.  This seems sensationalized, so I have trouble trusting it. The only direct quote I've seen from Feige is the one I listed above."

Holland uploaded pictures, and Feige confirmed that Holland screen tested with both RDJ and Chris Evans. The thing is, he could have just been in Atlanta to audition and screen test with the actors who were currently filming Civil War.  Do I think Spider-Man will be in Civil War? Yes, I do. But it doesn't seem like it has been confirmed yet, like everyone is taking for granted. As said by Feige himself in the interview I quoted above."

Although I'd like them to keep Ultimate Kitty Pride as well. They worked well together. I also really liked when she teamed up with Kaine and Ben Reilly during Spider-Verse so they could go that route too.

He brings a certain realism to the comic that Ramos does not. I agree Ramos ""cartoon"" style does fit well, but in the more gritty and darker moments in Spidey, Camu takes the cake. I feel his art just translates the situations more effectively"

I've loved his stuff so far but it seems odd to me that he's the only one who hasn't been moved around.

Spiderman,3bet5e,Felix500,36,Sun Jun 28 16:36:04 2015 UTC,I don't think there's an argument that it isn't the best one
Spiderman,3bet5e,BeardWonder,11,Sun Jun 28 17:25:28 2015 UTC,People on this sub seem to like the Amazing ones more
Spiderman,3bet5e,Felix500,39,Sun Jun 28 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"I like Andrew Garfield better as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but I think Spider-Man 2 was a better movie."
Spiderman,3bet5e,internet_observer,11,Sun Jun 28 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"Andrew Garfield was more had the snarky spider-man down almost to a tee, but the writing for the Peter Parker side didn't have as much tension and doubt. Being a nerd today isn't like it was in the 60's but he shouldn't be the cool kid who gets the girl by default and not being with her over fear and guilt of her father wasn't fully panned out in ASM2.   The villains in ASM also weren't as good as Molina and Dafoe. Spider-Man 2 had the best mix of action, a solid villain, and a personal story. The only other ones to come close are X2 and the dark knight. All of them are sequels done by the same director as the first. I don't think that is a coincidence."
Spiderman,3bet5e,spig,18,Sun Jun 28 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"Andrew Garfield was never the cool kid. If you pay attention at all, he was an outcast without any friends before he meets Gwen.   Of course becoming spiderman changes him a bit, as it gives him more confidence, but he still has some social awkwardness, which imo is the defining trait of the unpopular crowd."
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,13,Sun Jun 28 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"Andrew Garfield's Peter wasn't ""cool"" but he also wasn't truly ""uncool"" either. He was just there until Gwen swept him off his feet. Peter becoming Spider-Man is supposed to bring some confidence to Peter, which allows him to have a change with Gwen, MJ, etc., but he still has the insecurities and pressures of living the double life. He went straight from just having no friends for no reason, to dating Gwen and later Harry showed up as his friend in ASM2. His confidence as Parker just felt unearned. He should have all the confidence in the world as Spider-Man when the situation calls for it, which I thought he did well.   I think Tobey Maguire sold the nerd persona in SM1 and the double life amazingly in SM2. He failed miserably with the ""confident"" Peter in SM3.  TL;DR: Tobey is the better Peter, Andrew is the better Spidey. Hopefully Tom Holland will bring a bit of both and/or something new."
Spiderman,3bet5e,spig,7,Sun Jun 28 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"Tobey was the stereotype nerd, Andrew was the more realistic version."
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,13,Sun Jun 28 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I definitely know nerds like Tobey Peter. But Andrew Peter with the cool personality, skateboard, and supermodel hair? That loneliness is self-imposed."
Spiderman,3bet5e,AwesomePocket,2,Sun Jun 28 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"I feel Andrew just didn't play a super nerd, he played a smart kid who was an outcast, Nerds are definitely not what they used to be that's for sure, I know people that are exact copys of Andrew's peter. A lot of people now a days care about their hair so having Supermodel Hair isn't unheard of, same goes with skateboarding and also if you're an outcast who doesn't necessarily want to be then yeah you might try and put on a cool personality. It's not unheard of, it's just a different rendition of the Peter Parker character and that's okay."
Spiderman,3bet5e,Interwebzking,2,Mon Jun 29 01:38:45 2015 UTC,"Looks don't make someone popular or cool, and skateboarding isn't cool anymore. You have to think about what makes someone a nerd in today's world, not in the world you grew up in."
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,4,Mon Jun 29 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"Tobey's Peter Parker felt very out of touch with what it is to be a ""nerd"" or ""outcast"" kid nowadays. I was waiting for him to be given a wedgie by Flash, or get his head flushed."

Spiderman,3bet5e,JZPotter,2,Sun Jun 28 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"Not really. Sure he gets punched out for standing up to a bully, but Peter was supposed to be this shy, awkward, wallflower before he becomes Spider-Man. While he is not really popular in the beginning of TASM, he is still just a regular guy. As u/spig noted, there is no real reason for him not to be popular or at least have a few friends. The Peter before the spider bite, and the Peter after the bite are the same."
Spiderman,3bet5e,bolognahole,0,Mon Jun 29 10:17:27 2015 UTC,"When Gwen asks him his name, he can BARELY speak to her. That's complete shyness."
Spiderman,3bet5e,JZPotter,0,Mon Jun 29 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"Neither one nailed either side completely. Tobey may have been a better Peter Parker, but he was not a perfect one.  Garfield was a better Spiderman, but he wasn't a perfect one.   What Holland has to do is grasp both sides, and perfect them."
Spiderman,3bet5e,Redgohan147,3,Sun Jun 28 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"He was awkward the same way Terry McGinnis was awkward. In other words, he was a punk archetype, not a nerd archetype.  And he didn't even do a good job at that. At least with Terry you got to see his genuine good qualities. Garfield spent almost the whole movie either moping, complaining, or talking with Gwen.  I never thought ""man, this Peter Parker kid has a really good heart. He genuinely cares about people"". I thought ""man, this Peter Parker kid is a selfish brat. Almost everything he does has some element of self-interest"""
Spiderman,3bet5e,mrglass8,2,Mon Jun 29 14:00:39 2015 UTC,I never once felt he was selfish.
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,0,Mon Jun 29 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"The whole reason he became Spider-Man was to get revenge on his uncle's killer.   His big motivation for stopping the lizard was that he felt responsible for creating it.  At the end of the movie, he basicalled defies Cap. Stacy's dying wish and tells Gwen they'll get back together.  All of those acts were partly in self interest."
Spiderman,3bet5e,mrglass8,2,Mon Jun 29 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"Partly, sure, but they're not the main focus. Yes he feels responsible for the lizard's creation, but the reason he wants to stop it is because he doesn't want innocent people to die be a use of something he did. He feels guilty for putting innocent people in danger. Once he starts saving those people he starts realizing the responsibility he has to help people, going back to ben's words."

Spiderman,3bet5e,Kitsyfluff,27,Mon Jun 29 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of people say Spidey 3 was better than TASM2 but that really annoys me.  I honestly love all of the movies but Spider-Man 3 is the only one that infuriated me. Like an entire third of the movie not only entirely out of character for multiple people, but it was shot like a shitty network tv show. TASM2 might have been a bad movie as far as script goes, but the movie still captured the spirit of its characters pretty awesomely and the atmosphere was absolutely perfect. I honestly think with a proper cut, it could be neck and neck with Spider-Man 2 for best movie."
Spiderman,3bet5e,IAmATroyMcClure,15,Sun Jun 28 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"I agreed with you until the end.  I don't think ASM 2 is a few cuts away from being comparable to a classic. It still just isn't a good movie, and it's far from being one.   It gets a lot of hate, most of it deserved, but it isn't as bad as Spider-Man 3."
Spiderman,3bet5e,stackshot,7,Sun Jun 28 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Ok yeah maybe I exaggerated a little bit. But I do think TASM2 had a lot more awesome ideas than people give it credit for, and a couple of scenes (the clock tower scene specifically) are the best I've seen in any Spidey movie."
Spiderman,3bet5e,IAmATroyMcClure,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"Never have Harry go full Goblin, save Gwen's death for the third movie, and give a little more development to Electro.  With those changes it would have been a pretty solid movie.  Or maybe just adding back some of the deleted scenes might have done the trick as well.  Really as is I'd give the movie at least three stars.  In my opinion the movie gets way more criticism then it deserves most from people who went into the movie looking to pick it apart due to their bias of wanting to see Peter and Tony high-five."

Spiderman,3bet5e,RandomJPG6,6,Sun Jun 28 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"They shot different scenes which they didn't use which were also not released as deleted scenes that would make the movie cohesive and very well made but since Sony wanted to expand their stupid universe they decided to end it the way they did which sucked. Harry was gonna end up dead by the end of the movie. There was also a scene of him attacking Oscorp after emerging as the Goblin, that would have been better than popping out of nowhere. They had peter's dad coming back, which imo is a pretty bad ending but like I told you they filmed a lot of different scenes where the story could've taken a drastic turn and make it a good stand alone movie. That's why people would want to see a director's cut because it would show what Marc Webb would have done if there was no executive meddling(i.e. Sony, Avi Arad)"
Spiderman,3bet5e,ChickenPlunger,4,Sun Jun 28 20:37:55 2015 UTC,The fact that they actually used resources to film something as stupid as Peter's dad being alive the whole time isn't a good sign at all in my opinion. I really don't think any of the deleted scenes would fix any of the core issues I have with the reboot (namely the way they shoehorned an element of destiny).
Spiderman,3bet5e,RandomJPG6,2,Sun Jun 28 21:11:39 2015 UTC,"That is Sony's fault, the director already has a vision on how he wants things to go, Marc Webb is a good director. They filmed more than enough to make a good movie. Executive meddling was its downfall. If you see the Spider-Man parts they're incredibly well done. Then you look at the story and feel like it's disjointed. Why? Sony's meddling. Same problem with Spider-Man 3 except that one didn't have any extra filmed scenes to warrant a director's cut. ASM 2 does. Would I like to see it? Yes. Will we see it. I'm almost certain we never will.   Edit: I agree with Peter's dad, wasting resources like that is stupid. But that's Sony's fault."
Spiderman,3bet5e,ChickenPlunger,7,Sun Jun 28 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree with you on the TASM 1 and 2 getting characters right. The main reason I loathe those movies is because of how wrong they get Peter Parker. The whole father-son ""mystery"" (I put it in quotes because no shit Oscorp is evil) ruins the relatability of Peter for me. They added in a unnecessary element of destiny that takes away from Peter as a character.   One of my professors was a producer on the first one and I have let him know plenty of times how much I hate those movies."
Spiderman,3bet5e,RandomJPG6,10,Sun Jun 28 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'll have to agree on the parents mystery thing, but I would like to point out that was actually inspired by Ultimate Spider-Man comics. That wasn't some shit that Marc Webb pulled out of his ass for the movies.  But I honestly think they got the personalities right. Everyone says ""Andrew Garfield was a horrible Peter but a good Spider-Man"" but that's a pretty ridiculous thing that's gotten out of proportion. Peter isn't Clark Kent. He doesn't have to change his entire personality to stay hidden. He has a mask for that. His superhero personality and his personal one have never been drastically different, he just deals with different types of people in those separate lifestyles. As someone who has lived and breathed Spider-Man since I was a baby, the Raimi films are the only instance I've seen where Peter was some kind of socially inept nerd who nobody gives any attention to. I think people think of Raimi's interpretation of Peter as the ""true"" interpretation simply because his movies were so groundbreaking and captured the 60s campy atmosphere. But Raimi made a LOT more changes to Peter's personality than people realize. In the comics, Peter rode a motorcylce. In the movies, it was a scooter. In the comics, Gwen and MJ were always fighting for Peter's attention. In the movies, Peter was lucky to ever get even a smile from MJ (who was also massively fucked up in those movies). In the comics, his social life was only disrupted by his second life as a crime fighter. In the movies, it was because he was borderline autistic when talking to people. Raimi went WAAYY out of his way to make Peter more of a pathetic dork than he ever was, and I know it was intentional because so many of the changes were tweaks of actual things from the comics.  I think Andrew and Marc did a good job with Peter. He was a regular dude with a big brain and an obessive compulsion to help people. So what, he skateboarded. If you think that's ""too cool for school"" for Peter Parker, then you might as well tell Stan Lee he didn't understand the character either because he put Petey on a motorcycle.  And usually I don't wanna be the guy who's like ""Bleh the movies didn't do a 100% accurate portrayal of the comics,"" but I do completely think that TASM's Peter felt a million times more like a true Peter Parker than Raimi's did."
Spiderman,3bet5e,IAmATroyMcClure,9,Sun Jun 28 22:05:58 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I don't think a lot of people who say Tobey is a better Peter read many of the comics, if at all, but base what they think Peter should be as a result of watching the Raimi movies. To them, that's the Peter they know. As you mentioned, in the comics, he's not really anything like Tobey's portrayal. I felt Garfield was a normal kid and, as you said, was much closer to the Ultimate version. He had a few friends, but mostly MJ and Gwen. He did normal teenager stuff and got into a fight with Uncle Ben after getting busted. Peter in ASM1 was a lot more like this."
Spiderman,3bet5e,JoragaWarcaller,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"Pete's pretty dweeby in the first few comics, which I'm pretty sure was Raimi's source material."

Spiderman,3bet5e,Justice_Prince,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"I think it was a cool idea but it kinda went nowhere. I was very intrigued by it in the first movie, but the way it was continued in the second one just fell flat. I feel like I didn't really learn anything new because it was already obvious that Oscorp was pretty evil.  If they had done more like Ultimate Spider-Man though, that would've been really cool."
Spiderman,3bet5e,IAmATroyMcClure,4,Mon Jun 29 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"It's times like these that I loathe not being able to upvote to infinity.  Spot on - rami's spiderman AND parker were horrible to anyone that actually read spiderman. For a standalone comic book movie they were cool and fun.  ASM was spot on for Peter Parker and Spiderman. Anyone actually READ the comics? He wasn't that big of an outcast. He was actually sought after by friends but he liked to keep to himself - then he went to college and became even more popular - but with less time for friends.  Garfield did a fantastic job as Parker and Spiderman - and TBH, spiderman is only interesting because he is parker."

I understand what kind of argument you're trying to make right now, but I don't understand why you chose to have it with me just because I said I was annoyed. Besides, what ANNOYS me about those people's opinion is that they tell me TASM2 is a ""bigger piece of shit"" than Spider-Man 3, not necessarily that they liked Spider-Man 3 more. It hurts to be called a moron for loving a movie I love. So honestly, we're on the same page here. All I did was explain my frustrations with Spider-Man 3, and my enjoyment of TASM2."
Spiderman,3bet5e,IAmATroyMcClure,6,Mon Jun 29 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"I kinda like Spiderman 3 because amongst it's few problems that Sony created, I can admire the great things that Sam Raimi put in there.

Spiderman,3bet5e,GroundhogNight,3,Sun Jun 28 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was ever in question? It's always been my favorite superhero film because it's the only one that successfully humanized the hero, both figuratively and literally. 1) Took away his powers, 2) Put his teenage (or student/photographer/nephew/friend/lover) problems at the forefront of the story. For me, this as true to the comics as it gets. The point of Spider-Man is that he is an everyday guy who has issues like all of us."
Spiderman,3bet5e,Jimm607,8,Mon Jun 29 05:41:58 2015 UTC,"I still really like the movie.  But...Doc Ock wants to talk to Peter Parker.  So what's he do?  When Parker isn't looking, when Parker's sitting in a cafe, Ock throws a taxi cab at him.  It's legitimately one of the stupidest things I've ever seen."

Spiderman,3bet5e,The_Elder_Steak,4,Sun Jun 28 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think so because Spiderman 2 is a Peter Parker movie, which is a character Andrew Garfield was never good at portraying.

Spiderman,3bet5e,GroundhogNight,5,Mon Jun 29 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I think the writing was the downfall of the newest, most recent Spidey movies. Combine the writing and directing of the first two movies with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, plus their chemistry, and that would've been a fucking incredible movie. I loved Garfield's Spider-Man. His Peter Parker wasn't as good, but still, I was content with it."

I duno, I thought they were all right, but I felt TASM was a huge step in a better direction.  I'm sad TASM is getting cut short, but I'm hopeful the reboot is the stuff we all wanted its predecessors to be."
Spiderman,3bet5e,Justice_Prince,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:25:31 2015 UTC,Yeah my issue was Ock never actually being a bad guy.  All his villainous actions were pretty much just him being slave to the will of the arms.

I'm not really sure which I would rate higher Spiderman, or Spiderman 2.  I think they did a much better job with Goblin.  I bought his progression into being a villain much more then I did Doc Ock's.  I would have liked to see Ock being legitimately evil rather then just peer pressured by his sentient arm things."

Spider-man losing his powers for psychological reasons is stupid. In all three movies Tobey just seems super awkward as Spider-man and gets too pouty as Peter, in an unrealistic way.   I just don't get why people love it so much, beyond nostalgia."
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,3,Sun Jun 28 20:59:08 2015 UTC,You do realize him losing powers for psychological reasons happened in the comics?
Spiderman,3bet5e,cherish_it,-3,Mon Jun 29 04:30:33 2015 UTC,It's still stupid. I don't compare movies to comics as some kind of perfect standard. I look at them as they stand on their own.
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,2,Mon Jun 29 04:31:25 2015 UTC,Also..you know...it's a comic book movie and a work of fiction. It's a faithful adaptation of the comic. Also as a movie it's very stylized and has some great moments from sam raimi's directing style. If you can't see that then that's your problem I guess
Spiderman,3bet5e,cherish_it,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:37:40 2015 UTC,I don't like his directing style. It just makes everything feel cheesy and forced and I can't empathise with any of the characters.
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:56:03 2015 UTC,I can also see from your other comments that you dry hump the ASM series in your spare time so there's no point in debating with you

I have a feeling it's mostly nostalgia for the older movies. The few people I've met who saw the ASM movies first said the older movies sucked. I don't agree with that but I think it's clear to note people tend to prefer the first version they see."
Spiderman,3bet5e,morphinapg,3,Mon Jun 29 04:54:27 2015 UTC,"You say the new ones did Spider-Man right, yet you say you don't compare movies to comics. So what is your criteria? How can any movie do it right if you disregard the source material? It sounds like you've just decided that the one you like better is right, and the one you don't like is wrong."

The costumes don't actually have blue on them at all.   but it was retconned    I think you're using the wrong term here.  ""Retcon"" is short for ""retroactive continuity"". Its basically when a writer comes and says, ""Hey, remember that one story that was really pivotal to the character? Yeah, it didn't happen like you remember!"" and then rewrites said story and has every character only acknowledge the new version.   or people didn't really grasp that it was blue?   Because it wasn't blue. It was purely a visual effect to make the characters easier to see on screen. Only using solid blacks would make the characters slide right into the background, visually speaking, and be hard to see on screen."

I mean look at the ""Black"" Cat in her first appearance. My theory is that it was black and red but because the original Spider-Man was red and blue, they decided to refer to 2099 in those colors as well.

And when Spider-Man 2099 was made, they decided to homage Spider-Man and make the costume black with blue highlights.   But because of how much blue was on the suit, every thought it was blue and the creators just ran with it."

I'm a Spider-Man purist when it comes to some things. The costume is a grey area for me. I wouldn't be angry if they did make it red navy blue/black with blue in certain lights.

Spiderman,3bhoa3,Xeno-ken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:41:01 2015 UTC,"With this pattern specifically, it happens to fit the patterning. If you look at the TASM suit, it has veins running through various parts of the suit to look more slimming, and the zippers follow those veins. Plus, no one really looks UNDER your groin anyway, so they shouldn't see the handles for the zippers.  EDIT: I just looked at your suit, it may be noticeable on that pattern. Take a look on the RPF or look at some online to see how they handled the zipper."

Spiderman,3bgmvz,rickgrimesfan123,6,Mon Jun 29 01:31:52 2015 UTC,If youre talking about the ultimate universe it is visibly seen that occasionally Peter has some sleep issues during school from late night crime fighting. Edit: found one such case in ultimate spiderman #6 (2000) Edit 2: found another one in ultimate spiderman #51 (2000)
Spiderman,3bgmvz,snipercrow3,3,Mon Jun 29 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"He doesn't patrol all night, and given his power set it's reasonable to assume that he requires less rest than the average person. So he's likely out a ways past midnight and home on time for a few hours or shut eye."
Spiderman,3bgmvz,Iokuas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"I've actually never really thought about this. My assumption was that he was always sleep deprived. But his abilities might mean he doesn't need quite as much sleep. Also, I have no idea what the sleep habits of spiders are."
Spiderman,3bgmvz,moralless,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:04:08 2015 UTC,"It's not the sleeping patterns of spiders, it's his physical enhancement. He has a stronger body all around, including  his metabolism. He heals from severe injury quickly and his respiratory system and musculature are much stronger and more efficient than any ordinary person. We can extrapolate that due to these physical enhancements he does not require rest as often or to the extent that we do."

Spiderman,3bf4yq,incredibleamadeuscho,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:27:16 2015 UTC,I really want to see a lot of action in these new spidey movies. More brawling with enemies instead of the love story which I'm hopeful they will do.

Spiderman,3bdk5b,Goosie,32,Sun Jun 28 05:10:06 2015 UTC,"I actually like the idea of making that sound for Spidey Sense much more. The squiggle lines work well as an indicator in a purely visual medium. But in a film, any lines or visual addition in live action make it look cartoony. I would personally prefer if they kept to the sound motif used by the past two franchises, followed by him turning to see what the cause is. I also would enjoy there being a camera motif for spider sense, where the camera always goes to a particular style of shot or angle whenever it goes off. But surely when it comes to visual, no VFX."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,moralless,21,Sun Jun 28 05:59:24 2015 UTC,I really liked the slow-mo that was used in tasm 2 such as in the first electro scene that shows how Spidey actually saw things happening.
Spiderman,3bdk5b,rodblt2221,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:34:50 2015 UTC,"I actually think some VFX would be important. Like the other guy suggests, use a bit of slow motion. I visualize a pulse of slightly red tint across the screen, then the slo mo"

Spiderman,3bdk5b,JZPotter,6,Sun Jun 28 13:26:05 2015 UTC,I saw someone do a redesign of the costume and they showed a kind of spidey sense in the head. It looked like chemicals spreading through his brain and I thought it was epic. Maybe something like the sound they played in Amazing Spider-Man with the chemicals spreading in slow motion? I'll see if I can find the photo.
Spiderman,3bdk5b,Spider-Nerd,7,Sun Jun 28 05:52:29 2015 UTC,"Here. I think if it went into Slow-Mo like in TASM2 and the chemicals spread through his brain in either a Jimmy Neutron Brain Blast or just across a transparent mask, it would work really well."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,Spider-Nerd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love that costume."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,x-manowar,3,Sun Jun 28 13:51:44 2015 UTC,"I want something quick and simple. No ridiculous flash forwards or anything like that. The spider sense is not as exact as ASM made it out to be. I would literally be satisfied with a scene involving Peter facing an opponent who cannot land a hit.  The way I picture it is in Civil War during a tussle or some kind Spider-Man and Cap wind up on opposing sides of a fight between Pro and Anti Reg forces. Cap winds up facing Spidey and even though he's one of the most skilled combatants we've seen so far he literally cannot land a hit. After the fight Cap states that it was like Spider-Man could see his punches coming, and we call it a day."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,Iokuas,2,Sun Jun 28 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"That's what I would like actually.   Something that's unobtrusive, and subtle. We allude to it in Civil War or something, then in the actual Spider-Man movie, Peter gives an off-the-cuff explanation to a friend or something so people who don't know aren't confused.   Though I really want him to say his ""Spider-Sense is tingling""."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,XMenOrangesTangerine,3,Mon Jun 29 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"It's definitely hard to figure out what to do, because it has to be something that wows an audience but doesn't wear out. I like the idea of the Spidey Sense being something he relies on a lot, so I personally would like to see it in movie quite a bit. I think the slow motion thing in the trilogy worked, but only because they didn't use it so often, but the tray scene showed how amazing it is. What I personally think would work instead of the visual lines (at least not in costume) would be an eye color change. Like having his eyes turn red and blue or do something spider like.   As for in costume, there's not much I can think of, because the whole point is that he's completely covered, so for that it should be either a noise or a slight slow motion. In suit is really tough though."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,nigrplz,3,Sun Jun 28 07:10:47 2015 UTC,I'm also a fan of the spidey sense in Spider-Man TAS. Something like that would be cool if used right.
Spiderman,3bdk5b,Spider-Nerd,2,Sun Jun 28 11:18:13 2015 UTC,I'd say make it a distinctive noise and a depth of field thing where everything except his head and the immediate space around it goes soft focus.
Spiderman,3bdk5b,XMenOrangesTangerine,0,Sun Jun 28 11:32:27 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree, some kind of tone and noticeable, but still pretty subtle blur around his head.  Something like this could work, but it's probably not that subtle. Although technically I used a dents distort in paint.net  http://imgur.com/787mjVy  On a bonus note if they did a effect like that, it could look like hairs are standing on his head with the right costume."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,atomic1fire,2,Sun Jun 28 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"I always thought having half his face obscured and a sound would be a good indicator, a nod to the comics where half of his face would have the Spider-Man mask appear when his Spidey sense went off."
Spiderman,3bdk5b,karpinskijd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:24:26 2015 UTC,A blurred camera distortion to form the squiggly lines would be quite good. I think that would match the original comic depiction without being jarring in film.

Spiderman,3bdk5b,Screwy26,4,Sun Jun 28 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"Let's just cast RDJ as Peter Parker, that would make the Tony Stark and Peter relationship very interesting on film"
Spiderman,3bg7ii,Kathmhen0,3,Sun Jun 28 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"Very nicely written, but the problem with having a Spider-Man who isn't Peter Parker is that he's kind of the main attraction (Best way to describe it) for a lot of people. Anytime I read a marvel crossover where Peter Parker is never seen and it's only Spider-Man the character just becomes kind of a generic superhero for me and while I love Miles Morales, a lot of his character development comes from the events of Peter Parkers death."
Spiderman,3bg7ii,BeardWonder,3,Mon Jun 29 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Miles doesn't work the same way in a world without Peter. Even if what you really want is to tell Miles's story, you simply have to do Peter's first."
Spiderman,3bg7ii,moralless,2,Mon Jun 29 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, guys! I really appreciate it :)"
Spiderman,3bg7ii,moralless,3,Mon Jun 29 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"Of course. That problem aside, I'd personally love to see Miles come to the screen someday, I'm just not sure now is the time. I think you're 100% right about audiences being done with the origin story though. It's been done so many times even non superhero fans know it. Which is why I'm glad they're forgoing the origin this time around and going straight to the good stuff."
Spiderman,3bg7ii,PracticallyAnonymous,3,Mon Jun 29 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Eh, nicely written, but we don't need Miles at all.  Without Peter we never even get miles so going to miles without peter immediately is a dumb move that would spark a very negative reaction to many fans.  Sure, tumbler would like it but they aren't the people who are the fans of Spider-Man. When you think Spidey, you think Peter Parker.  Plain and simple.  Ask anyone.  You have to specify you're talking Miles and that's just the way it is.  Pushing the envelope for Miles will and should take forever.  We don't need him.  Now, if we don't want retread ground, then we should take a break from even that time period.  2099 is the way to go.  We could rediscover Peter at some point, but ultimately we get a new spider-man.  He has an interesting origin and unique abilities.  Not to mention, he's a diverse and different Spider-Man.  He's mexican american.  It gives the chance for all new villains and stories we've never seen before.  So don't give Peter a rest.  Give the whole timeline a rest."

Spiderman,3bdn5x,darklordx123,2,Sun Jun 28 06:37:57 2015 UTC,I know Infinity Wars is a two parter but I want the symbiote to be explored front and center. Even in Spiderman 3 it was still underplayed and muddied by other conflicts. Infinity Wars will have pretty much every MCU character.
Spiderman,3bdn5x,darklordx123,7,Sun Jun 28 06:45:05 2015 UTC,"In the original Secret Wars, Spider-Man got the suit. That was it. It was explained in his own series.  So perhaps they could introduce it in Infinity War, and explore the suit/venom maybe (I hope they do a movie with the suit, then have a later movie dedicated to Venom) in Spider-Man 2."

So in the end of the movie, he'll still have the suit, he'll love it and by the next Spidey movie he'll be patrolling the streets in the Symbiote suit! Slowly noticing that he's beginning to have behavioral problems because of the suit which leads him to getting rid of it mid-movie, making Venom the antagonist for the rest of the movie. They shouldn't end Venom's life in that movie though. I just hope they give the Symbiote suit some justice this time."
Spiderman,3bdn5x,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"No behavioural problems, that was something the film did.

Spiderman,3be4mb,raulmiranda09,2,Sun Jun 28 10:49:27 2015 UTC,"I like Miles, I think he's a good Spider-Man. But I honestly don't understand, what's gonna happen to Peter? They can't just forget about him or put him on the sidelines. Peter Parker is and has always been Spider-Man! I'll always care more about Peter's story than any other Spider-Man out there and I think a lot of fans will agree with me on this and feel the same way no matter how cool other Spider-Men are, you just cannot replace the original."

Spiderman,3bben4,XMenOrangesTangerine,7,Mon Jun 29 14:46:57 2015 UTC,I find it tough to read Miles' stuff. Not because it's bad necessarily. But because he's not Peter Parker.
Spiderman,3bben4,XMenOrangesTangerine,2,Mon Jun 29 15:29:07 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  The ultimate universe never even really appealed to me that much.  616 is all I ever cared about really. Always just seemed more compelling

The ""why can't heros be white!"" ranting and generally exaggerated language make you sound like you need to goddamn chill. I have no grudge that's just how that part comes off.  Moving on to the rest though I prefer Peter too despite liking Miles but Miles is popular and I guarantee you it's not just because he's black. You heavily contradict yourself by praising 2099. Guess what? That's not Peter so he ruins Spider-man right? He's just there for diversity right? No. There are many other spider-men and there always have been. That's perfectly fine.   As for the movies we already know it's Peter and we know who's playing him so you even got what you wanted. Anyone bitching about who's playing spiderman just because of what race he is or who is calling you a bigot is an asshole. They are a small minority and you should ignore them. Peter is still in the comics and will very likely have his own book so don't worry and don't become just as ignorant as the people that are bothering you. There will always be people spouting dumb stuff but don't forget you aren't superior because you like Peter more than Miles."
Spiderman,3bben4,Matsuyama-Takeshi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:13:26 2015 UTC,The difference is Miguel is from the future.  Not the same timeline.  He's also a genius as well.  It makes sense and fits.  Miles just makes it not special.  Just like Silk does.  It's lame
Spiderman,3bben4,BaconIsHappiness,3,Sun Jun 28 02:56:23 2015 UTC,And miles is from an alternate universe for most of his run and doesn't replace Peter outside of it. How is a separate universe closer to the same timeline than the future of the same timeline? They may both be in the same universe now we don't know.  just think your bias against miles is blinding you to the fact that there is no difference. So what if miles gets a title. He's one of of like 8 spider heros to have his own title and already at least one other spider title post sw is confirmed.
Spiderman,3bben4,ReallyNotACylon,2,Sun Jun 28 03:04:53 2015 UTC,I'd be annoyed that a better spider other than peter didn't get it.  2099 comes to mind

Spiderman,3bben4,CaptainRea,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's half of why I'm so angry today.  I got told by a coworker I'm a bigot and ignorant for wanting Peter.  Peter has been and always will be Spider-Man.  When someone is referring to Miles they still need to specify as they should.  It's stupid and they only do it for diversity.  I will no longer buy if this stays this way.  Hell, I'll take Superior back forever over Miles."
Spiderman,3bben4,bobwoodshed,10,Sat Jun 27 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"If you guys honestly believe Peter Parker isn't getting his own book alongside the Miles book where he mentors Miles you're so unbelievably ignorant to this situation. Marvel is launching over 60 new titles and you really think not one of them is gonna be a Peter Parker, Spider-Man book? Peter is capable of mentoring Miles in one book and being Spidey in another, its honestly not that difficult of a concept to grasp. In terms of there being two Spider-Men, no one gave a shit when there were 2 Hawkeyes. Clint's popularity and spotlight never got stolen, neither will Peter's, so calm down."
Spiderman,3bben4,bobwoodshed,2,Sat Jun 27 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"Didn't Marvel announce there would be three Spider-Men after the new launch? There's a picture of Miles and Peter in costume. I figured both would have their own comics, but Peter would be a mentor in Mile's."

Its called preference. But you've got to calm down on the miles thing. Some of the things you've written on your post are a bit insulting or just plain wrong. If you find that Miles isn't as interesting as Peter, then yeah, i'd agree with you. But you're overreacting."

Spiderman,3b6kn2,Cpt_Coleslaw,11,Fri Jun 26 11:29:10 2015 UTC,"Well, the MCU was created with Iron Man back in 2008 and I assume without any knowledge that Spider-Man would eventually be in it.  Marvels obviously trying to skew younger with Tom Holland so maybe they'll stick to late high school/ college age Peter Parker.  As to his age in the actual book I think it's late 20s early 30s."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,ichyknee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:11:26 2015 UTC,Spiderman is 28 or 29 i think. One of the comics says the spider bite happened 13 years ago. Idk how long before that was civil war so i'll guess 2 years? 26 maybe 25?
Spiderman,3b6kn2,bruh_dinosaurs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:14:37 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, Pete is actually only 28 as of the beginning of volume 3 of ASM. So, we can deduce that Pete was 25-27 during Civil War."

Spiderman,3b6kn2,ichyknee,3,Fri Jun 26 12:30:51 2015 UTC,Yea marvels been really weird with casting Spidey really young.  I wonder if they're still afraid of emo jazz hands Peter Parker...
Spiderman,3b6kn2,FlippantFox,5,Fri Jun 26 12:38:40 2015 UTC,"Nah, they're being smart. All the previous Spideys have been in their twenties-thirties, which is fine for a short series, but Marvel obviously wants a movie series that will last a long time, which means a young Spidey. Tom Holland can keep being Spider with no issues for like, twenty years. If they had gotten someone older, they'd have more trouble having a long lasting Peter."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,darklordx123,2,Fri Jun 26 17:56:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. Now they have someone who will look young for 10+ years.
Spiderman,3b6kn2,thewisefoolHHH,2,Sat Jun 27 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Well, each Spider-Man franchise so far wasn't meant to be a short series, that's just how it turned out. TASM was supposed to be Spider-Man 4 before the studio decided to reboot. And Sony had been planning a Spider-Man universe with Andrew Garfield's series before they decided to go with Marvel."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,moralless,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yep! Was reading through stuff about this the other day. Raimi already had a solid concept for Spider-Man 4 down. It, again, had multiple villains. Dr. Connors was finally going to transform into the lizard after being dormant for two movies. They wanted to introduce the Vulture and Anne Hathaway as Black Cat (which is interesting since later in her career she played Catwoman). They had also hired a writer to do scripts for Spider-Man 5 and 6! But in the end, after trouble finding ground for a Spider-Man 4, they decided to reboot the franchise. and we all know what happened with the reboot."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,StolenHam,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"They rebooted because they wanted Raimi to finish the movie for a 2011 release date.

Spiderman,3b6kn2,Lighetto,5,Fri Jun 26 13:07:58 2015 UTC,"Peter was in his 20s during the Civil War comics, but Marvel is trying to do a high school Peter for the movies"
Spiderman,3b6kn2,dcnewbie21,3,Fri Jun 26 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, it makes sense if the only thing you know about the Marvel Universe, you've learned from the MCU. If you've read Civil War already, this change makes it really interesting, and almost more believable the way things turn out. Don't read the rest if you don't want Civil War comic spoilers, btw:  You have all of these amazing, established heroes. Then, you have this teenage kid that has no experience being a superhero yet, really. New powers, but no superhero friends. Looking for direction, looking for a role model. Suddenly, Tony Stark is there. A man who shares his love of science and technology. A charming, established superhero with money and zero problems getting the girl. He befriends Peter. Gives him a fancy suit. Tells him he needs him to support his side of the whole, ugly Civil War business because he can't do it alone. Convinces him it's the right thing to do.   Like in the comic, we are Peter Parker. He's a stand-in for us. As Peter begins to have second thoughts, so do we (ideally, from a writer's perspective, at least). I mean, Cap might be too much of a boy scout to do what needs to be done, right? And Tony is willing to do that. But maybe Tony's taking it too far. And, maybe for the first time but certainly not for the last, kid Peter Parker has to make a tough decision to abandon his friend and do what he believes is right. Think about when you were 13. Think about how you'd react if someone you idolized told you what to do and what to believe. Would you have had the strength to make that decision? I honestly don't think I would have. I'd let the onus of responsibility fall on Tony, and honestly probably have followed him the whole way because I wouldn't have known any better. Especially as a young, unestablished superhero just trying to pass high school classes, talk to girls and make a couple bucks at the local paper."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,RocketTasker,3,Fri Jun 26 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"I've been racking my brain about how Spidey would play a role in Civil War, since it's going to be very different in the MCU (most/all heroes identities are public, Spidey has not been introduced until now, etc.), but this sounds like it would be an incredible story!"
Spiderman,3b6kn2,kiekan,2,Fri Jun 26 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"In the comic, Peter was in his mid to late-20s.  However, time moves more slowly in 616, so that equates to Peter having about 50 years of comics history by then.  That's part of why choosing a side was so difficult for him, because he had time to forge relationships with heroes on both sides.  The movie version, however, will have the character (not the actor, mind you) being about 15 or 16, with his superhero career having only recently started.  As a side note, somewhat unrelated to your question, this leads me to believe that he won't be publicly unmasking in this movie, because it'll be too soon and the Iron Man family friend guilt trip isn't there to push him to do so."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,pseudomucho,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"Its unclear as to what his exact age is during the comic. In the comic, when he reveals his identity publicly, he says he has been Spider-Man for fifteen years. When he first appears in Amazing Fantasy #15, he is in high school. So that puts him anywhere between 14 and 18. So as /u/ichyknee said, he's in his late 20's or early 30's.  In regards to the movie Civil War, do not expect it to be even close to the comic plot line. The version of Spider-Man that is going to be in the movies is going to be far closer to Ultimate Spider-Man, so he'll be high school aged. Thus the reason they were looking for such a young actor."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,DeathN0te,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure Peter was always regarded as being 15 when he got bit by the radioactive spider."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,Apple_Joel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say he was about or a little older than 25, since he's currently about 28."
Spiderman,3b6kn2,GnarlsD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:54:43 2015 UTC,I believe he said he was 28 in the most recent comics considering it says he was not by the spider 13 years ago and he was 15 when he was bit. So I'd say he would've been 26 if the event was in 2006.

Spiderman,3b3n0m,Alexedward00,9,Thu Jun 25 21:03:12 2015 UTC,It's not really old news. This is the first time it's been OFFICIAL and not a rumor.
Spiderman,3b3n0m,rizefall,-1,Thu Jun 25 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"This article has been posted on every MCU/Spidey related subreddit confirming this as official. I've gone through the article a couple times now, and I feel like I'm missing something. Where exactly in the article does Feige confirm that Spider-Man is appearing in civil war?"
Spiderman,3b3n0m,moralless,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"""It's only been hours since Tom Holland was announced as playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man for Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, and now there's confirmation that he'll make his debut before 2017's Spider-Man.  In a The Hollywood Reporter interview with Marvel Studios' President Kevin Feige and Ant-Man star Paul Rudd, THR confirms that Holland is reporting to the Captain America: Civil War set in Georgia to film scenes for the 2016 film""  How can you go through such a short article several times and miss it, LOL."
Spiderman,3b3n0m,rizefall,0,Fri Jun 26 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"I've seen that, but that's just a line to grab heads, not a direct quote from Feige. In the actual part of the interview where they discuss Spidey and the civil war, Feige side steps the question and talks about the Sony Marvel deal for the Spider-Man film instead. I realize it says that, but I'm a skeptic, so really want it straight from the horses mouth. He was not quoted talking about Spidey in Civil War. He was, however, quoted saying a lot of other stuff, which leaves me feeling iffy.  Edit: Also, I just realized you're talking about the Newsarama article. No, I mean the actual interview that is cited in the article you're referring to, which is where the information is supposedly coming from. I'm not taking things from a third party at face value."

Spiderman,3az0fb,GrandmaFetish,3,Wed Jun 24 20:41:55 2015 UTC,"Unless Fox and Marvel come to an agreement like Sony and Marvel did. So I don't really understand your reason?  My reason? I don't know much about Avengers, X-Men, or Wolverine, but I do know that the X-Men's whole schtick is that ""mutants bad!"" Having Wolverine, a mutant, join the Avengers is bad publicity for the Avengers. Or worse publicity considering how bad it already is in Age of Ultron. That said, Scarlet Witch is now an Avenger and she's a mutant.  That is, if ""mutant"" is allowed in such an agreement. Otherwise, I always thought of Wolverine as that guy that gets angry really quickly. The Avengers are always debating amongst each other in these movies. Wolverine would probably sooner fight it out with Hulk (or... well... someone else who's still in the team) than to come to a peaceful, spoken consensus. If they go with the current Wolverine who, I think, is a little more level headed and mature, then he may have the same problem that the current Avengers have: He doesn't do the street level stuff that Spidey and Daredevil does.  These are my silly whatever reasons anyway. :P"
Spiderman,3az0fb,Moulinoski,3,Wed Jun 24 20:43:25 2015 UTC,Wolverine has been abused by Marvel as a linchpin in the comics for the past 20 years due to his popularity.  They've semi-retconned Scarlet Witch's origins so it's not mutant powers but anything could change in the next few years.
Spiderman,3az0fb,Plowbeast,2,Wed Jun 24 21:55:02 2015 UTC,His reason is that he can't be there and Spider-Man can.   It's really that simple :B

Spiderman,3az0fb,Moulinoski,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:00:27 2015 UTC,Fox won't make a deal considering they have no reason too so that's the biggest reason really. Wolverine can't be used.

Spiderman,3b1ddz,mwriteword,3,Thu Jun 25 05:01:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that I think they have any actual plans for it. I just think they are giving themselves the opportunity. With the resurgence of Gwen's popularity after the Amazing Spider-Man movies and the success of the Spider-Gwen comic, if she is in the MCU Spider-Man movie and retains her popularity, they may want to make the comics resemble the movies and have them together in the comics. Right now he has a lot of chemistry with Silk, but there is no telling what Marvel will want to do with these characters a few years from now. I just think they are keeping their options open."
Spiderman,3b1ddz,epraider,4,Thu Jun 25 05:55:12 2015 UTC,"I think Gwen and Ben are people that should never truly come back. Ever. Gwen's death has been central to Peter's character for decades, and it just makes it all pointless to give him a new Gwen. If they ever interact, ever, they shouldn't know who each other really is under the mask."

You forget that they're rebooting the Spider-Man film franchise again. Who knows if Peter and Gwen are going to be a couple in this new adaptation. Thus far, from what very little information we have, the MCU Spider-Man seems to have the most in common with Ultimate Peter Parker, who started with and had a far longer relationship with MJ."

Spiderman,3b1ddz,ReallyNotACylon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it was to collapse the multiverse into a singular universe. Its not removing previous continuities. I.e. everything that happened to Miles in 1610, still happened. But the 1610 reality no longer exists.  It still remains to be seen whether that is just a temporary collapse for the Secret Wars event proper or a long term deal. For all we know, at the end of Secret Wars #8, all of the other universes may return."
Spiderman,3b1ddz,neoblackdragon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:46:26 2015 UTC,It's like Fringe rules. Universes and timelines are separate things.  But I think they are mainly trying to combine the Ultimate universe with the 616 universe. Not get rid of all of them.
Spiderman,3b1ddz,kiekan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:03:23 2015 UTC,No not really. Probably some cleaning of the house but they made a bunch of continuities just for secret wars. It's not like what DC did way back when.   I am 100% convinced Marvel will be starting up new alternate worlds by next year.

The hardcovers are much further into the series (volume 16, which reprints ASM #156-168).  These are the TPBs I get. They're a bit more expensive (and some of them are a bit harder to find) than the Essential TPBs, but all the issues are in color (sourced from new scans of the original art where possible or best scans Marvel has in house, with retouched and cleaned up colors) and printed on a much higher grade, glossy paper. In addition to this, all the issues printed are organized chronologically, not by print order. Which is nice.  You can see a list of all the hardcover Masterwork collections here."
Spiderman,3b1k95,kiekan,3,Thu Jun 25 12:25:06 2015 UTC,"Marvel Masterworks is the way I've been going about getting ASM TPB's as well. I only wish they were churning them out a bit faster is all.

Spiderman,3az538,Itzon,20,Wed Jun 24 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"Reasons I personally like Miles:  • His origin and his backstory run parallel to Peter's, but still gives a different perspective on the ""great power"" aspect of Spider-Man.  • Because he followed Peter as Spider-Man, it adds another layer to his character, not only trying to find a balance between living up to Peter and respecting him, but also a sense of guilt that plagues Miles from time to time.  • That being said, he's very much his own person and has enough that doesn't make him ""just another spider-man"".  • It's also more interesting to see Miles and Peter interact, versus Peter and another Peter.  • His race/ethnicity isn't treated as a gimmick in the story. Being a 'black spider-man' isn't a huge theme in the comics, despite him being a symbol of diversity in the meta-MU. And that sort of normalization, almost ignoring the fact that he's black/latino, is the exact thing we need and the right way to bring about diversity (versus drawing attention to it, and making a big deal out of it).  • His suit is pretty badass.  All in all, there's nothing particularly extraordinary about Miles. He's another hero the same way everyone else is. Some people find him interesting, others don't, and that's fine."

Spiderman,3az538,mwriteword,5,Wed Jun 24 18:18:22 2015 UTC,Her origins and ties with the cults and the totems really made it interesting. I hope she has a more solid future in the new Marvel Universe.
Spiderman,3az538,Ratoo,2,Wed Jun 24 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"Same; though it was somewhat brief, her background made her a pretty important part of Spider-Verse, and I'm glad they moved her story forward a little by having her stay in Loomworld with Spider-UK and Karn. I definitely hope we get more or that during or even after Secret Wars."
Spiderman,3az538,Flocosta,2,Wed Jun 24 18:40:15 2015 UTC,I loved the last few issues of Avengers Assemble she showed up in.  I keep hoping that one day Marvel put together a Spider team just so we can see these character more then once every few years.
Spiderman,3az538,Lox22,8,Wed Jun 24 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you, now THOSE are some valid points."
Spiderman,3az538,mwriteword,2,Wed Jun 24 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"I had this same question about a year ago. I had only seen Miles appear in other series in the ultimate series, specifically Cataclysm. I came to this sub and asked if it was worth reading his series. Everyone ranted and raved about how great Miles was awesome and I should def read through it and how much I would love it. So I ran through it on Unlimited and boy was I disappointed. Not only was it one of the slowest series I've read. Not only do we not even see his suit till the 5th issue, he doesnt even get web shooters till like 8 or 10 issues in. To put on perspective if you bought the first trade, you wouldnt see the suit until the last page of the entire trade, and if it wasn't the trade thats 5 months of nothing if you followed as it first came out. I was bored with the character. I found myself enjoying everyone else in the series more then Miles. Honestly I had the most draw to his Uncle aka the Prowler and who to date is the best villian to appear in his run.   Now where you say he had a different perspective how is that? All he ever did was ask himself what would Peter Parker do? He just emulated Peter, and then gave up being spider-man when his mom died. So ""great power"" mantra was something he literally would take from Peter thus having the same out look, only making it sound more of a drag to have this responsiblity where as Peter show much more excitement in not only seeing the extent of what he could do, but also was passionate about his duty.  Villians was a problem in the run. Lets draw readers with Venom as the first ""big baddie"" he will fight! Arc was horrible, Venom ended up being a ""Who the hell is this guy?"" reveal and then right after Miles quits being spider-man... Then you have scorpion, just a guy with a chain. Sweet. Then the battle with Hydra, he has a fight with Giant woman. Venom strike and thats all over. Then you have Roxxon, ya this is sweet arc if you like cloak and dagger, because that is literally all its about their little love story, and Miles helping them. Vol 2 starts and what do they do? They complete Peter's story just so people will read the brand Miles Morales:The Ultimate Spider-Man. Yea it was cool to see Pete again, but at the same time isnt this supposed to be Miles story? Honestly I was content with how they originally finished Pete's tale. Then in a last ditch effort Miles is bit again and gets more powers right before secret wars. I felt its like they were thinking ""what more can we do to get people to actually read this after the whole universe is destroyed?""  His race/ethnicity doesn't matter to me, I wouldn't care if he was purple or a skrull there really just isnt much to good ole Miles. I have never understood his allure or why people feel he has soooo much depth. The fact he is surviving Secret Wars and getting his own run titled Spider-Man is beyond depressing and sadly if he takes Pete's spot I'm going to stop reading spider-man. I really wish they would just send him to go where heroes die and send him to the west coast avengers or something. Now we have Pete, Miles, and Silk running around in NYC, and maybe even more Spiders. Why did they not think a 2099 or Kaine series would be a better option?"
Spiderman,3az538,Lox22,3,Wed Jun 24 20:06:49 2015 UTC,"Like I said, some people are interested and some are not, and that's okay. I was answering OP's question with reasons that I personally like him, and not touting my opinion as fact. You don't have to try and sell me on your opinion, but thanks anyway."
Spiderman,3az538,mwriteword,2,Wed Jun 24 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinon for sure, I was just saying I didn't see how you thought he had a different persepctive on the ""great power"" theme. Since he was always asking WWPPD. I wasn't trying to seel anything just giving an opinon as you did! I respect that you like Miles, even though I will never understand why. I was a huge fan of superior and look at all the hate he gets, so I feel and understand the struggle!"
Spiderman,3az538,Lox22,2,Wed Jun 24 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"I, too, love Superior so we agree on something. I just got a little defensive -- sorry!  On that note though, I think I just mostly liked the Prowler arc as well, and that's what got me invested in the character. Peter started because his uncle was shot and felt he had a ""great responsibility"". Miles' Uncle extorted him instead, which was definitely pretty different.  While the WWPPD is pretty present, I think the reason why he does that is a specific strategy on Bendis' part. The way I saw it was a juxtaposition by the two -- the expectation was to do exactly as Peter would do, because in Miles' (and probably everyone elses') mind, Peter is the ""real"" Spider-Man. Constantly asking what Peter would do, weighing his options, and ultimately having to just make his own decisions is what pushes him to grow and realize that he is Spider-Man.  In turn, that always spelled out to me a different kind of responsibility. Not just to the people of New York, or his friends, or his family, or the Ultimates – but a responsibility to himself. Not to live in Peter’s Shadow, but to be his own person and his own Spider-Man. That’s something that (at least I like to think so) he’s come to terms with by Secret Wars, and has grown to realize."
Spiderman,3az538,mwriteword,3,Wed Jun 24 21:05:11 2015 UTC,Maybe that's whats missing for me as far as Miles/Peter comparision is that I'm just waiting for him to man the hell up and be his own spider-man. Miles to me comes off as such a push over and not his own man. He doesn't own the mantle like he should. Bendis just loves taking his sweet ass time with this stuff. Here we are 4 years later and Miles too me is just still a whiney teenager with the desperate need to be pointed in the right direction to do anything.
Spiderman,3az538,kiekan,2,Wed Jun 24 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"That's what feels rather unfortunate to me about storytelling in comics -- it takes a long time for stories to develop and progress. And it's true, Miles is taking quite a long time to develop. He's definitely grown and is better, but still has a ways to go."
Spiderman,3az538,mwriteword,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:25:42 2015 UTC,"That's what feels rather unfortunate to me about storytelling in comics -- it takes a long time for stories to develop and progress.   That isn't true for all comics. Its entirely dependent on the writer and how they choose to reveal that story. You can learn a lot about a character in just a couple panels. There are plenty of examples of origin stories or first issues that get going right away and are engaging from page one.   Bendis has a problem with decompression, though. Its really a problem in all the books he writes, not just Ultimate Spider-Man. Its part of the reason that so many people aren't very fond of his work. He feels like he needs to show the reader every single detail of the character's life. Which isn't always necessary. Sometimes he needs to just get to the ""meat"" of the story and move the story along. He has entire issues where nothing of actual importance happens and skipping them wouldn't hurt the larger narrative in any way.  A good example of that is in the first five issues of Miles' run. Bendis was trying to emulate his own work in the beginning of Ultimate Spider-Man, with Peter. In both cases, the hero doesn't become ""Spider-Man"" until the very end of the arc (so not for a whole five issues). The difference, though, is that with Peter, the comic was successful because it spends its duration showing Peter's personality and puts a strong focus on his supporting cast. The entire first arc is detailing why ""Peter Parker"", as a character, works and is relatable and why he is interesting before he ever even puts on the costume. In Miles' case, the first arc is spent trying (unsuccessfully) to show how Miles and Peter differ. And that's really it."
Spiderman,3az538,mwriteword,2,Thu Jun 25 12:42:31 2015 UTC,"Very true -- I haven't read a LOT of Bendis' work, but I can see how that would be a recurring thing."
Spiderman,3az538,kiekan,2,Thu Jun 25 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"That's what was really stood out during Spider-verse. Every other Spider was ready to take charge and knew their roles. Miles and teen Parker was like ""whatever just tell me what to do"" Overgenralizing"

And then today reading they retconned Ultimate Peter's Heroic Sacrifice was truly disappointing.  But for all the people saying hell yes on Miles, I have yet to see a truly great arc for him. Even with all these major cross over events, he's really done jack so far.  From what I speculate, you'll have Pete, Miles, Silk, Spider-Gwen running around. Spider-Woman is off on her own with a punky new look. Spider-Girl (Anya C) and Spider-UK is still off in the Spider-Verse web. Kaine's technically dead but revived by The Other yet to know what happens? And Spidey 2099 went back to his timeline, assuming it still exists.  And then there's the setup for the return of Doc Oc's Spider-Man because you know Dan Slott has a hard-on for him, but with Bendis taking over, who knows?"

Every encounter is identical. He meets one of Peter's rogues, has trouble defeating them, uses his Venom Blast and wins. Heck, he even defeated 616 Peter in Spider-Men using the Venom Blast. Which was completely idiotic.  The Venom Blast is like some cheap God Mode ability that is a one hit kill. Its obnoxious and comes off as ""See, look at how COOL Miles is! He is even better than Peter! Rite guise!?""  Its extremely irritating."

I like how he's just trying his hardest to do right, even though he's way out of his league. And that's really what we're all trying to do at the end of the day, right? Adds a bit of relatability that Peter hasn't had for a while IMHO.  I like how he's a Spider-Man not named Peter Parker and that he's not just some gimmick, and hasn't been swept under the rug like some other spider characters. And I swear to God if Anya Corazon gets her own series out of Secret Wars, I will buy every issue of that mofo even if I have to drop the rest of my pull list.  And his costume is pretty bad ass."

He was given the power unintentionally like Peter but doesn't have the same big reason to be Spider-Man. He became Spider-Man because he felt he needed to continue Peter's legacy. So he's always trying to live up to Peter but at the same time he wants to be his own Spider-Man. It's interesting to see that he was practically forced to be Spider-Man by S.H.I.E.L.D and thus makes him feel uneasy being Spider-Man at the same time. He's kind of a nervous wreck which brings depth to his character and not making him the all perfect character that some are like Captain America and others. He is still learning to coup with who he has become and it's interesting to see how he is dealing with everything. I never see him as a black Spider-Man, I see him as a new Spider-Man or the legacy that was being carried on by another."

Spiderman,3az538,8bitkevin,2,Wed Jun 24 20:37:50 2015 UTC,Pretty much yeah.  616 Spider-man is seen by other heroes as nothing more than a joker typically.  And the other big thing he is known for is giving some version of the superhero responsibility lecture/talk.  So I'm happy to see a version where his legacy is much more idealized than that.  And having someone step up to take over that idealized mantle is something that interests me.
Spiderman,3az538,8bitkevin,2,Wed Jun 24 22:17:25 2015 UTC,"But that's a part of what makes spider-man great, he's like the fun uncle.

I like what Miles is trying to do, and it would take him renouncing the name and other characters not bringing it up for a long time before I would accept that he failed at it.  I think Spider-men did a great job with that, and it is one of my favorite Spider-man stories.  Regarding not liking that bit, for me, its not that I don't like it, I just think its overdone to the point of making Peter a bit of a one trick pony.  I find it annoying that other heroes often don't take him seriously consider the fact that he been on the street fighting crime and exactly what a superhero is supposed to do since he was in high school.  And for most his career, he's been doing it solo, maybe with a single partner for a short, all without backup or a support network.  And no formal training at it.  Looking at what he has done, he is a self taught veteran who has been doing it since before he was an adult, both in street level stuff and helping out with bigger stuff.  The fun uncle is important part of him, but I feel like he should be so much more.    I'm hoping with bringing Miles to the main universe, they might start moving Peter in that direction."

Spiderman,3b1uia,moralless,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"That guy has a bit of a miles hatred that extends past reason. It's far from ""obvious"" that they will kill him. Peter is young because young Peter has always been the most marketable and marvel has often tried to keep him young before. Not because they are determined to do miles Morales. Peter is by far the most marketable hero and its obvious they won't end that anytime soon"
Spiderman,3b1uia,Try_Another_Please,0,Sun Jun 28 05:57:05 2015 UTC,It's so obvious.  Anyone who knows Spider-Man can see it.  I hate it
Spiderman,3b1uia,PracticallyAnonymous,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"My assumption was that they wanted an actor young enough so that they wouldn't age out of the role. Garfield, for instance, was 30 when TASM2 came out, in which he was playing a kid who had just graduated high school. Similarly, Tobey was 29 at Spider-Man 2's release, and 32 for Spider-Man 3. That's fairly old for someone who supposedly is only a year or so into college (straight from high school, I should add).  Considering Feige has stated that he wants this to be a high school centric story, my thought was that casting young means they get someone who will be 27 by the time a third movie is rolling around, so he is still young enough to pull off the senior in high school look.   As to what they'll do after, your Miles theory certainly holds ground. My only question is how they could do it without going too dark, because Feige has also stated that he doesn't plan on the MCU ever taking a dark turn."
Spiderman,3b1uia,moralless,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"They've already killed characters off.  They'll do it again.  Just look at quicksilver.  It won't go dark, but deaths will happen.  That's a given"
Spiderman,3b1uia,PracticallyAnonymous,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:52:17 2015 UTC,It may be pointless because of your previous thread but this is false. Young Peter has always been what marvel aimed for. Anyone who knows spidey knows better than to think they are going to kill the most marketable hero anytime soon. He's young because he'll last longer that way. It's decidedly Peter in the movies and there is no reason to believe miles will happen soon at the cost of Peter...

Spiderman,3b1uia,PracticallyAnonymous,-1,Sun Jun 28 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"Not to talk about you of course, but I feel like a lot of people liked Garfield because he was a pretty boy, and wanted O'Brien because he was as well. Christ, Holland looks like a regular teen in HS, and Marvel will bulk him up so don't be dumb, remember Chris Pratt?"
Spiderman,3b1uia,Frozen_Canadian,3,Thu Jun 25 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"People wanted Dylan O'Brien because they thought he was the best candidate for the job. I can only really speak for myself on this, but I thought, based on his acting reel, he really had the feel of the charter down. His portrayal of his character on Teen Wolf, for example. He played that character with the same bravado and attitude I would expect one to play Peter Parker. Yes, looks are part of that too, because he looked the part, but the most important aspect was his acting ability and his ability to portray this type of character. We already knew Dylan met all of the requirements.  Does that mean Tom Holland doesn't have those requirements too? Absolutely not. I'm sure Marvel and Sony saw something in him we couldn't possibly see, due to our lack of involvement in process."

Spiderman,3augaw,88MilesPrower,10,Wed Jun 24 02:09:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know the numbers off hand, but apparently ASM2 bombed, at least by the superhero movie standard. That, and Garfield had some opinions about how the films could be improved that some higher-ups at Sony didn't take kindly to. Suddenly, Mr. Can-do-nothing-wrong MCU shows up asking for the rights to use Spidey in Civil War and a few other things, offering Mr. Needs-money-dearly-and-could-also-use-an-excuse-to-kick-garfield-to-the-curb Sony an excuse to reboot again and make a lot of money. They obliged.  This is my understanding of how things went down which might be a little inaccurate. I was personally hoping that they would keep Garfield around and just blur his past a bit to make the ASM films not canon but close enough to be headcanon if you so chose. I have nothing but faith in Marvel but I agree it's such a waste to see ASM go to the wayside."

Spiderman,3audib,bogaboy,17,Tue Jun 23 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought Toby did a pretty good Parker, and a pretty bad Spidey. But I thought Garfield did an okay Parker, and a fantastic Spidey. IMO Garfield's Spidey way overpowered his imperfect Parker, and more than made up for it. I can't say that Garfield was perfect, but I'd say he was by far the best on screen Parker/Spidey we've seen, and I have trouble imagining Holland beating him."
Spiderman,3audib,the_boomr,3,Tue Jun 23 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty similarly as well, although I would go as far as saying I think Garfield's Parker was actually really good, even fantastic. I think he embodied that quirky teenager vibe that Spidey always had in the comics really well, and of course his chemistry with Emma Stone was wonderful, since they are actually dating in RL.  But definitely, I'm not particularly optimistic about any future Spidey actors. I liked the first two Tobey movies, mostly because I was a kid and it looked cool. Third one was absolute crap for me personally. Then Garfield completely revitalized the whole Spidey universe for me, and they just tossed him away without a care. Pisses me off so bad."

They tried to modernize him or make him into a normal teen, when he wasn't."

My perfect scenario would have been for them to simply tie Andrew Garfield and TASM movies into the MCU. Continue with their current plans for the franchise, and have Garfield join up as an Avenger.   I get the reboot. I understand it from a business perspective. But it still really sucks.

Then, because he's not a big name (yet), they can twist his arm a little to manipulate how they want the sequels to be done a little more than they could with an already established director."
Spiderman,3auf61,neoblackdragon,2,Tue Jun 23 16:51:33 2015 UTC,Honestly how many directors actually come out with a bunch of high budgets? Isn't think the story of many of them.  Also Marvel loves it's low budget directors. It allows them flexibility with pay. Of course this also allows folks like Jon Watts to command other large non marvel movies.
Spiderman,3auf61,IAmTheZeke,11,Tue Jun 23 22:14:24 2015 UTC,TL;DR -- I need help reacting to this.
Spiderman,3auf61,IAmTheZeke,7,Tue Jun 23 16:25:27 2015 UTC,Be excited!
Spiderman,3auf61,MoonSpider,14,Tue Jun 23 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"I am! Marvel's been on point with their casting so far, and this is just in time for him to be in Civil War, or at least I would assume so, so that's always good.   I'm just nowhere near as familiar with him as I was with Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire when they were cast, so I have no idea how he'll fit in. I was kinda rooting for Dylan to make the cut, but this kid has the looks and probably has the acting chops too."
Spiderman,3auf61,silver1289s,6,Tue Jun 23 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"I liked Dylan too - but considering some of the other options, Tom is great.   I want to see anything. I'm so excited to see more than a headshot!"
Spiderman,3auf61,incredibleamadeuscho,3,Tue Jun 23 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely better than Asa. I remember watching The Intersnhip in theaters and thinking Dylan could pull off Peter, seeing how he was doing a nerdy, motivated, sort of quiet character (the same way Andrew played a similar role in The Social Network) but I guess we'll have to wait until Tom makes his big screen, wall crawling debut to see how he'll do.  But, if I'm being honest, I was really hoping/almost expecting Marvel and Sony to announce they'd mended things with Andrew Garfield and he'd be returning. His Parker/Spidey is going to be a hard one to beat, from the mannerisms to the suit."
Spiderman,3auf61,SogMuffin,5,Tue Jun 23 16:58:37 2015 UTC,Relevant.     I'm on board.
Spiderman,3auf61,S_O_I_F,3,Tue Jun 23 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"As sad as I am about Andrew no longer be Spidey, I believe that Tom has a chance to be the definitive Spider-man. Theres a chance for him to bridge the gap between Tobey's Spider-man, and Andrews. Nerdy/dorky, and very well mannered with quips and sarcasm as Spider-man. He already looks the part in my opinion. He has a young, but mature look. As long as we can get a decent script, I honestly think Spider-man could return to the top."
Spiderman,3auf61,rockfan7777,2,Tue Jun 23 17:06:30 2015 UTC,He (Tom Holland) was my pick so I'm glad to hear it. I hope Jon Watts has some comedic sensibilities to his directing.
Spiderman,3auf61,CuckyAsInCookie,3,Tue Jun 23 17:03:10 2015 UTC,apparently he used to work for the Onion so i think he'll be solid
Spiderman,3awqfa,rockfan7777,4,Wed Jun 24 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"You are likely getting the original secret wars and some of DC's convergence confused.  Basically Secret Wars takes place on a world made up of the last remnant of alternate realities. Doom and Strange have created memories to make the survivors think this is the status quo.  Of course it's Doom and heroes gonna be heroes as villains gonna be villains.   Right now there is no ""fighting"". There is conflict but it's relatively peaceful.   Renew your vows Spider-man is an alternate universe spider-man. So right now, he has no impact of the current Spider-man.  So it's one of a few separate runs like Thors.   The story is ongoing and still in the questions stage."
Spiderman,3awqfa,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. Sounds confusing but really cool at the same time. So basically the renew your vows spiderman has nothing to do with secret wars then?"
Spiderman,3awqfa,Connor0218,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:23:33 2015 UTC,"It's just an alternate reality from the 616 (the Amazing spider-man) spider-man. This peter is not affected by the events of the secret wars, though I wouldn't call it completely unrelated"
Spiderman,3awqfa,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:45:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think it will all play a role. Right now though the 616 Peter is just standing around."
Spiderman,3awqfa,darklordx123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, Renew Your Vows may have an impact on the future of Spider-Man."
Spiderman,3awui5,pseudomucho,6,Wed Jun 24 03:34:51 2015 UTC,Definitely gotta be the Earth-7161 Peter Parker.
Spiderman,3awui5,DeathN0te,5,Wed Jun 24 03:57:25 2015 UTC,"Wow. Was unfamiliar with this version until now, and I've gotta say that this is incredibly depressing. I don't know how I feel about it."
Spiderman,3awui5,DeathN0te,3,Wed Jun 24 04:21:38 2015 UTC,"Haha I was unaware of it too till I just went on the wiki & looked at all the alternate Peters (there are tons, of course). In all seriousness my favorite non-616 Pete is the same as yours (Ultimate). I also like, mainly for very nostalgic reasons, the Tobey Maguire movie Pete."
Spiderman,3awui5,DeathN0te,4,Wed Jun 24 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"Nice. Tobey Maguire's is not entirely comic-book accurate, but those movies will always hold a special place in my heart. Haha. Even the third one."
Spiderman,3awui5,BrennanBr,5,Wed Jun 24 05:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while he's not much like the comic Spidey, I still love Tobey's version due to growing up with those movies/games, & his suit looked completely rad.  Also, I kinda like Spider-Man 3. If they kept Sandman, New Goblin (but changed the suit), & the black suit but saved Venom for a sequel it could've been as good as the first 2. Oh well, too late now. :/"
Spiderman,3awui5,DeathN0te,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:25:43 2015 UTC,"I really dislike this version of Peter because I think even if he were never bitten by the spider, he would still be a really successful guy in some way or another."
Spiderman,3awui5,NazoXIII,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he'd still very likely grow up to be a teacher or scientist even if he was never Spider-Man."
Spiderman,3awui5,DeathN0te,2,Thu Jun 25 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"Yknow, on the inverse, let's not forget that Peter was a bullied outcast with no friends, even before he had an excuse to not make any.  The spider bite really added depth to his character, and even then, he was cynical and snarky as all hell.  I feel like this is a believable reality if he didn't get bitten, because all the things that came after the bite really molded him into a well adjusted character.  Now let's see, if everything still plays out the same way, Uncle Ben would still die, Aunt May would coddle the hell out of him, he'd likely have an odd sense of entitlement, and grow into this Peter... That or Otto Octavius"
Spiderman,3awui5,gravyboatcaptain2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"Good point. I could imagine him growing up to become an Octavius-esque villain or something, since this is the Marvel universe after all. I suppose it could go either way."
Spiderman,3awui5,Moulinoski,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this version kind of makes it out that everything special or different about Peter revolves around getting bit by a spider. That's easily proved wrong in 9/10 Spider-Man issues, considering how many times Peter has saved the day using his intelligence. Sure, he'd be an entirely different person. Maybe more cynical, or selfish. But a miserable loser? He had too much potential."
Spiderman,3awui5,Moulinoski,5,Mon Jun 29 05:36:24 2015 UTC,Horror Spidey was cool.
Spiderman,3awui5,bat-reddit,2,Wed Jun 24 06:52:52 2015 UTC,"Either Miguel O'Hara, Miles Morales, or Doc Ock. I like them.  Miguel's like this darker version of Peter. There's a bit more direction to his story, too, than just being some hero guy. He's not even that heroic. He's just some guy who wants to take revenge on Alchemax and ends up doing hero stuff because he's not a bad guy... but he's not the same kind of hero that Peter is. He's like... Like a more heroic version of Tony Stark?  Miles is funny and sorta real. At least up to my most recent memory of him, he's still trying to figure out everything he's but thrust into. He's trying to fill in the shoes of Ultimate Peter, whom he admires, but he keeps doubting himself. Like, I want to cheer him on whenever I see him. Of course, I'd like for him to progress past that and it looks like he's getting there.  Finally, Doc Ock as Spider-Man is really cool. He's like a heroic Master Planner (heh). I like that he uses all this tech to help him and even applies his villainous habits towards heroics, like having henchmen. It's a different twist to Peter and I liked it.  But the thing I like most of all three are the costume. They're awesome!"
Spiderman,3awui5,MwamWWilson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"Wait, about the Miguel O'Hara thing. Peter's Spidey is like the archetypal guile hero; using his intelligence to defeat his physical superiors. I'm not too familiar with all of 2099's lore, so I'm wondering what you mean by  ""he has more guile."""
Spiderman,3awui5,darklordx123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"I... uh... I wonder what you're talking about! O:)  Spidey 2099 is the same way, I think, using his intelligence to best his foes. But I don't know why I said that. It was early morning for me. :("

Spiderman,3auzjs,redditleaker23456,23,Tue Jun 23 18:48:40 2015 UTC,Dylan O'Brien's going to be a big movie star even without Spider-Man.
Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,11,Tue Jun 23 19:12:02 2015 UTC,I agree. He doesn't really need Spider-Man but it's still really annoying he didn't get it. But I'm sure he'll play a superhero somewhere down the road.
Spiderman,3auzjs,spidermann1233,11,Tue Jun 23 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"He will get a comicbook role, and DC would be smart to snatch him for Dick Grayson."
Spiderman,3auzjs,Redgohan147,5,Tue Jun 23 19:16:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. Can't wait for Scorch Trials and Deepwater.
Spiderman,3auzjs,MarvelousWeb,17,Thu Jun 25 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"Dear Friends,   It has been a fun journey, full of suspense, endless speculation, and talking about miscellaneous topics.  I joined reddit because I was excited that Marvel got back Spidey.   When I heard that it could be an actor I never even heard of before, I was intrigued. When I learned more about the actor, and the man, I was floored.   My excitement grew exponentially after watching his movies, his interviews, and the fan made posters and trailers. Over analyzing the interviews turned my excitement into an unquenchable flame...I started to join in the conversation here on an almost daily basis, on an obsessive level.  I expected the announcement would have been done in a bigger way, at least a press conference or post credit scene. This is all so anticlimactic.   I'm sorry if I have contributed in any way to any negative feelings any of you might be feeling as a result of the recent announcement. The good news is, we don't have to ask when is the announcement lol. I tried, no, I DID my best to keep everyone who supported the cause and myself motivated. Maybe it's not too late for me to start a career as an attorney LOL.  I've said this many times before, that this will be my last post of the day and so on. I'm sort of relieved that this will indeed be my last post here. There is no more reason for me to post here anymore.   This reminds me of when Clive Owen didn't get to be James Bond.   In my 32 years in this life, I have found that reality has not matched my expectations on countless occasions.   In this case, the actual announcement did not match the amount of hype I had coming in to the announcement.   Congratulations to Tom Holland and best of luck to Marvel on their reboot.  I will post a link to my Facebook page here should you choose to want to stay in contact with me.   It has been a pleasure to meet you all, you know who you are.  God bless you all.

Spiderman,3auzjs,terriblemajesty,9,Wed Jun 24 05:47:12 2015 UTC,"Dude you have no idea how much talking to you guys over the past months has meant to me and the constant watch over that thread was the most intense wait I've ever had for anything comic or movie-related ever. I've loved Dylan since last year, when I managed to finally watch Teen Wolf after years of avoiding it. I'm so glad you got to discover what an amazing actor he is.   As for the anti-climatic ending... If being old has taught me anything, it's that not everything has to have a massive party to mean something.   Take care and thank you for being one of the most amazing posters on Reddit I've had the pleasure of talking to!"
Spiderman,3auzjs,piconet-2,6,Wed Jun 24 11:19:09 2015 UTC,"Aww man! I'm going to miss you so much. You really helped me in my darkest hours back there. It was an honor to post alongside you. I'll never forget what you've done for me. Good luck, and take care buddy."
Spiderman,3auzjs,UltimateLegend,5,Wed Jun 24 11:49:34 2015 UTC,Noo there's still a huge future with Marvel and Spidey you can't leave yet! Who's gonna help me judge/fanboy over it?

Spiderman,3auzjs,justmespidey,13,Tue Jun 23 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"I just have so many questions, why did he act weird at paleyfest? Why didn't he go to the MTV awards? Why weren't they allowed to talk about spider-man? Why did he bother with that interview? Honestly I bet he had it, like was in heavy talks and they backed out because the rumors and the comments at paleyfest and everything"
Spiderman,3auzjs,bohemiancats,10,Tue Jun 23 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"I like how we've all kind of gotten closer since the announcement was made, heck even the bickering has stopped between one another, and even though it didn't turn out the way most of us wanted, its easy to see we're all (for the most part) pretty excited about Tom and his role in the MCU. So I'm glad this casting has brought us all here together (~￣▽￣)~"

You've been very respectful to us unlike all these other scoopers with inside info. Plus you did say you'll confront your source and own up to it if he's wrong, so I appreciate you for doing that as well. Thanks for all that you've done and I hope we get to hear more from you very soon."
Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,11,Tue Jun 23 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"its just too bad 8/8 new sources were correct...and on the thing we wanted, turns out his new sources were wrong. I have no negative feelings towards DBS. He didn't confirm anything official, he wanted DOB as bad as we did, and in general didn't seem overjoyed either that Holland got the role. So if you're out there DBS, thanks for keeping us hopeful the whole time, after all he did warn us not everyone gets a happy ending. We got Spidey in the MCU, just not the actor we wanted to play him."
Spiderman,3auzjs,redditlurker789,9,Wed Jun 24 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"As a brown kid, I've never seen the reason to change Peter's race.   I bring this up, because, I've just seen a news post where they list down a bunch of social media reactions' consisting off negativity toward Tom's race. Also what's the point of making Peter black when down the line you get Miles and Miles coming first just doesn't work... Like where the heck was Peter? And Fiege himself put it (as he always does) in the best way, this is the first time we're going to be seeing Peter in the MCU. Let's be realistic, that's so much better than seeing Miles even if it would be his first. But, after a trilogy, absolutely give Miles his own movie(s) I would love that but after Peter's trilogy."
Spiderman,3auzjs,VisualMaximus,4,Thu Jun 25 01:25:00 2015 UTC,I would like to actually see Peter go beyond a trilogy. Simply because there is so much to see with Peter especially if they wanna get a lot out of him just being in high school for a few movies
Spiderman,3auzjs,DanRamos95,3,Thu Jun 25 01:39:04 2015 UTC,"I'm down for seeing Miles Morales as well later down the line, but I want to see Peter Parker first and I'm glad we are. Thank god Jeff Sneider was wrong about Spider-Man not Peter Parker. Even at the time he said that I knew he was full of shit. I've got nothing against Miles it's just that we need to see the MCU version of Parker first 'cause we never got to. I agree with what Stan Lee said, it's not necessary to change an already established character's race and sexuality plus those leaked Sony emails confirmed that Peter would stay exactly the same."
Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,8,Thu Jun 25 01:42:52 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/redditleaker23456, it's been an amazing 4 months and as promised, no hard feelings whatsoever! I'm really peeved you're got all those terrible messages.   I got really excited for Dylan as spidey after I heard rumors on tumblr, that there was someone on reddit who was claiming that Dylan's the new spidey. And that led me to /r/spiderman and then subsequently camping here for months. The people i've met on this sub and that thread have been super amazing and in every sense of the word, a family of choice. i hope you guys take care even if you no longer visit reddit or come back to this sub anymore. reddit is an amazing place and it's been my home for the past 8 years. so i'm gonna be here, even if i change names haha.   months that have taken me from an extremely depressed and bored unemployed person through job apps, resume changes, interviews, a new job - that thread kind of became a daily socializing spot and I loved it.   i know Dyls has an amazing career ahead of him and I wish Tom luck too. Here's to the movies of the characters we've loved for decades!"

I'm fine with the casting in terms of how he looks but I have no idea on how he can do it so we have to wait until his first solo because in civil war, he may just have a cameo but thats still a bit away. Also I feel like we overhyped this announcement on how it would be done and such and such but also I felt burned out after waiting for so long, deflecting the trolls/haters and to just find out about it while walking to my class was anticlimatic. I'm also left with more questions than answers. Was Dylan ever considered? Did he audtion at all? What was up with palyfest? If these questions are answered I think some real reaction will kick in. Anywho sorry if this looks like a rant but I just wanted to get my feelings down because this is the only place I can do it. I hope some old excitment comes back soon to get me pumped"

Agreed, there was so much weirdness with Dylan around Paleyfest. I'm not sure if it just genuinely was because he's awkward and was maybe disappointed to not have a chance at the role, or if he really was involved in some way (like he auditioned) and it fell through."

Maybe he'll talk about Spider-Man for a bit now since it's already been announced. He might acknowledge that he had talks with Marvel and Sony about it but maybe he left because they didn't want him or he didn't feel like being tied down to it. Maybe they had their differences.

Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,3,Thu Jun 25 02:17:07 2015 UTC,That would be the perfect role for him. Next to spider-man of course.
Spiderman,3auzjs,patientmamba,6,Thu Jun 25 02:23:42 2015 UTC,SoOooOOoo I haven't really visited this thread since the announcement was made and I'm not sure how often ill come around or if ill be back anytime soon so just in case I'm going to take this time to say thanks for the past 4 months and you guys made waiting for the announcement bearable!   And I don't back down from a challenge so here is my pic (took me about 5 minutes to actually submit this cause eeeek posting a picture is nerve wracking). I don't do any social media besides snapchat and its my full name so probably won't be giving that out so i just uploaded an image real quick! Its from spring break so yes I had reddit open on my phone haha.

I keep refreshing it to see if anything new has happened... most of the time, nothing has. It's been like this for months, even before I started posting on it, which I have obviously started doing much more frequently lately. It's like an addiction and now, the announcement is over, but I am still here... so what are you guys up to? Lol"

Spiderman,3auzjs,paulzhan,7,Tue Jun 23 20:14:56 2015 UTC,We definitely gave Marvel waaaay too much credit in their secrecy and announcement skills. And here we were thinking that they were feeding people the wrong information and were gonna make a big splash with the announcement lol.
Spiderman,3auzjs,steverogerstho,6,Tue Jun 23 20:45:08 2015 UTC,Yeah we really gave them too much credit. However I still have questions about paleyfest
Spiderman,3auzjs,DanRamos95,7,Tue Jun 23 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"Aw man, I really wanted to reach 40000 comments on the other post :'("
Spiderman,3auzjs,Ahmed11105,4,Tue Jun 23 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"Has DBS said anything on Twitter? I just really want to see a video from him, explaining everything. I'm confused that since Dylan isn't Spiderman, why he didn't go to the MTV awards, why did he get really weird about all the Spiderman questions, and why he shot down rumors regarding the role right away. Also, why was the announcement for Spiderman so underwhelming? I thought they were going to do a huge event for it. Normally, doesn't Marvel usually want huge surprises? That's why I'm surprised Holland got the role since the rumors of his supposed casting weren't kept on the DL. Where was the ""shaking the foundations""?  BTW I'm not hating on Holland he was actually my second choice, I'm just really confused lol"
Spiderman,3auzjs,lrado,5,Wed Jun 24 00:17:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be mad if they had Dylan play either Nova or even Ben Reily (if they went that direction). Just hopefully he plays a superhero that he can use his craft with.
Spiderman,3auzjs,iconboy15,4,Wed Jun 24 01:02:41 2015 UTC,Dylan O'Brien for Richard Rider! Let's make it happen Reddit!
Spiderman,3auzjs,_CaptainMurica,5,Wed Jun 24 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"I think Dylan O'Brien would've been the best choice for the role as well, but it's ultimately the studios decision not ours. Besides, Tom's not a bad choice either. I see a lot in him that he can bring to the role."
Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,5,Wed Jun 24 02:24:48 2015 UTC,"I just watched DBS's video (hey - I'm mentioned! Does that mean I'm famous?). Anyway - pretty compelling. Seems he did know what was going on the whole time. One thing I wish that we could find out is whether Dylan O'Brien was actually ever screen tested, or even considered, and if so - what happened?  That is what I'm curious about. I would have loved to see him in the role, but I don't think Tom Holland is a bad choice. Can't wait to see what this cameo in Civil War is all about.  Edit: I put it on the other thread, which is gone now, but in answering /u/RealPunyParker 's call - I'll do as /u/SpideyLew did and just put out my Twitter: @SuzyQL  I'm not very exciting on there though, but it is what it is."
Spiderman,3auzjs,Maysie66,3,Wed Jun 24 12:46:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm still curious to know why he acted the way he did at Paleyfest. Or why he decided to refute casting rumours so early in the game instead of milking them for all they're worth. It probably means Dylan had been more honest than we thought he had been - but it's bittersweet to think he, Logan, etc. didn't even audition for the role (perhaps because of their age). Ah well - here's to Tom in CW :)"
Spiderman,3auzjs,Wollander77,4,Wed Jun 24 12:52:20 2015 UTC,I feel like punching every single person from Marvel and Sony!
Spiderman,3auzjs,drdr45,5,Wed Jun 24 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"Dylan O'Brien could still play witty funny roles.  What do you think of the idea of him playing Han Solo in the next Star Wars Anthology film?  Or Nathan Drake in the live action Uncharted movie?  I'm sure he'll get something to show his wit, and Marvel will feel sorry for not listening to the fans and hire him for Spidey! The guy is like the next RDJ and Chris Pratt, he'll be huge!  A lot more than Tom Holland, for sure!"
Spiderman,3auzjs,drdr45,6,Wed Jun 24 18:48:38 2015 UTC,Nightwing.
Spiderman,3auzjs,RealPunyParker,5,Wed Jun 24 18:56:31 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Dylan O'Brien in the DC Cinematic Universe playing as Dick Grayson / Nightwing.

And guys, seriously, stop insulting him or sending him death threats over the fact that he got the casting wrong. It's just a simple casting.  And congratulations to Tom Holland, I'm sure he'll make a great Spider-Man."

Spiderman,3auzjs,SumDumFuk1420,4,Tue Jun 23 18:53:13 2015 UTC,I'm disappointed it's not Dylan.  Also disappointed that it's not Rowe (according to Variety he was one of the two finalists).  Hopefully I'll come around to Holland.
Spiderman,3auzjs,SpideyFan24,5,Tue Jun 23 19:28:30 2015 UTC,I honestly think that Holland will do an amazing job. I've been watching all the various movies and shows that he's been in and I see what Marvel/Sony saw in him. He's talented.
Spiderman,3auzjs,Spider-Man101,3,Tue Jun 23 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"You know what?  I actually like this Tom Holland kid, I wish him the best of luck :)  I just might make a fan trailer about him...hmmm"

Spiderman,3auzjs,Maysie66,4,Wed Jun 24 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"Man, can we see the suit already? I mean, we got to see Black Panther's costume when Chadwick Boseman was announced, so what's the hold up? Isn't it already designed for us to see the finished drawings?"
Spiderman,3auzjs,UltimateLegend,4,Wed Jun 24 04:18:15 2015 UTC,"I gotta admit, although I'm okay with Holland as Spidey, Marvel/Sony are not doing an exceptional job of selling the new franchise to us. The announcement was underwhelming, we still don't know for sure if Spidey's in Civil War, and we haven't seen even a sketch or something of the new suit!! Give us something, people!!!"
Spiderman,3auzjs,justmespidey,4,Wed Jun 24 04:34:26 2015 UTC,I think they might hold a press conference this weekend with the actor showing up and they might even show a concept design for the suit and everything.
Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,5,Wed Jun 24 04:46:06 2015 UTC,This Tweet was from four days ago. Rofl  Check out @DanielRPK's Tweet: https://twitter.com/DanielRPK/status/611931950886993921?s=09
Spiderman,3auzjs,ryckae,4,Wed Jun 24 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think the best and simultaneously the worst pat about Tom Holland as Spiderman is he's relatively untested on a mainstream level. No one goes into a film with him expecting him to play a role a certain way or a pre-conceived notion. Asa Butterfield is no stranger to the mainstream market, and people have a sense of what to expect from him, which leads to pre-disposed opinions and expectations.   With Holland, we're totally in the dark on what to expect from him, as we have seen him in very few roles, and even fewer major ones. However, we do know he has a ton of talent, and he is just waiting to showcase it. It can be a scary thought, it may turn out great, or it will all blow up in his face.  Anyway, who is now going to go check out Heart of Sea to see his chemistry with Hemsworth? We wont see them together in the MCU t'ill possibly Infinity War Part 2. At the moment, not necessarily excited with Tom as the choice, but moreso on how it will all turn out."

Spiderman,3auzjs,RealPunyParker,4,Wed Jun 24 15:08:02 2015 UTC,I hope this eases some peoples worries. It seems that the screen tests with Downey & Evans is what sealed the deal. He obviously mixed in well with them & I think Evans already tweeting out his congrats to Holland shows that. All good signs.
Spiderman,3auzjs,spideyfan13,4,Wed Jun 24 15:14:14 2015 UTC,I wish Tom could be doing his stuff with Cap instead of Iron Man... Idk but Cap's the type of guy I'd look up to with the biggest smile not Tony... At all.

Spiderman,3auzjs,DieselDG,4,Wed Jun 24 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"I was reading this article on The Hollywood Reporter and in an interview Kevin Feige had said:    ""A very high bar has been set with Robert Downey in Iron Man. That idea was, find the best actor for the part, regardless of whether they've been in a movie like this before. Great actors, charismatic actors, who can connect to the audience on a deeply emotional and on an entertaining, charismatic level and also be able to pull off the action and look cool in a suit – the inherent likability you can't train for...""   I have full faith in Feige and trust that Tom Holland was indeed THE best choice for Spider-Man whether we can see it now or not. Hence, commence project #shakethebooty and get excited for Spider-Man in the MCU :))"

Spiderman,3auzjs,drdr45,4,Wed Jun 24 18:03:44 2015 UTC,I'm at least thankful that they didn't get an actor under the age of 18 to play the part. That would've have been weird to see. Plus all the hassle of Marvel and Sony dealing with child labor laws.
Spiderman,3auzjs,sinas35,4,Wed Jun 24 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"To those of you out there who think redditleaker was lying? He wasn't. He was just misinformed, it happens. I don't think I'd put my 100% trust in him after this though. Even though I respect RL, DBS was really the only who stayed true and honest with us throughout the whole casting process. I'm glad he's retired now so he doesn't have to listen to the haters complain about him anymore."

Spiderman,3auzjs,DanRamos95,2,Tue Jun 30 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. Jurassic World in IMAX was almost as good as being in the actual movie.  Afterwards I went out on patrol. What follows is a very lengthy post, so read at your own discretion:  Journal Entry for 2015-07-01: Last night (Tuesday) I went out for the first time with the new friendlier mask. The reception was pretty positive. Didn't get too much attention from the police. In fact I didn't even have to call in to the police station. There was one instance I suspect someone had called the police on me after someone spotted me but I was already unmasked and had moved from that area. The night truly began when I started patrolling in my car. I went through the clubbing area, and it was busier than usual on a Tuesday night due to Canada Day. I noticed the clubs on Queen St were dead. King St was still busy and clubbers were flocking in the streets and sidewalks outside the club. I noticed a fight was already in progress and I pulled over and got out of my vehicle. According to one eyewitness, there were between 5-6 adult males attacking one adult male, whose brother jumped in towards the end of the fight. He sustained a large bump on the back of his head. Possibly a hematoma or a concussion. The cause of the fight is unknown. I suspect those involved were under the influence of alcohol and possibly drugs. Nobody lost consciousness and the two who were outnumbered sustained cuts to their face above the eyebrows and forehead. They moved on after speaking with police and had a second altercation with some citizens, two adult males, who were passing through. The story was that two other citizens were being antagonized by the two victims of the previous fight. One of the pedestrians ended up striking the man who had sustained a hematoma. Four police cruisers fled to the scene and an ambulance came to assess their wounds. The peak time for these events similar to the previous entry all occurred after the clubs close - from 0230 to 0430. I believe that I helped to diffuse the situation and prevent more serious harm to the two men who sustained injuries in the first fight. I had to step in and separate and redirect those who were the most aggressive and pursuing a fight and trying to antagonize the other person to get involved in an altercation."

Spiderman,3auzjs,terriblemajesty,6,Fri Jul 10 06:16:53 2015 UTC,"Had a dream about the new Spider Man movie last night and it was AWESOME! In my dream, I was watching the film and Tom Holland was perfect as Spider Man and Peter Parker! He dropped his accent really well and he sounded like he was from New York. He was really funny as Spider Man and the suit was a classic Spidey outfit with the web underarms. I know some people are 50/50 about the underarms (even I am) but the way they did it was so badass in my dream! Chloe Grace Moretz was Gwen Stacy in my dream and Tomei was Aunt May. They were both perfect too. Overall, it was just all so awesome. Ugh, I wish it wasn't all a dream! Can't wait for more details about the new movie, especially the reveal of the new suit!"

Would have helped if it just came out of nowhere, but now no one seems all that excited or surprised about the news."
Spiderman,3auzjs,Redgohan147,3,Tue Jun 23 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"It did kind of come out of nowhere though. Like, nothing was particularly exciting about today, there was no build up to this date.

I don't hate it, but I also don't love it.   I haven't seen a single movie or tv show with Tom Holland but I have watched an interview with him and he seems like a pretty cool guy. He was 16 in the interview and he sounded very intelligent.   I'm hoping he really does bring something special with new spidey. I'll get back to you on my throughts and opinions later on!"

I didn't know who Dylan was before this thread popped up.  I'm glad I got to know his work, and am filled with regret that it's not him after all this time and research invested. I really grew to love the idea of Dylan as Spidey--he was the actor the character needed, but alas here we are. . . Best of luck to Tom Holland.  I'll try to reserve judgement and hope that he can prove all doubts and fears wrong and embody the character in a way I don't expect.   If it doesn't happen, I'm sure the movie(s) will still be fun, but I'll be left with a thought and a dream of what may have been... . . Such is life."

Im not gonna call the guy out, but if you actually look and make connections as I have it becomes obvious who he is... Seriously I'm not being an asshole...Im not trolling you... I'm not trying to be ironic by making some bullshit up by ""pulling a RL"". I've actually figured it out... and I totally respect his privacy. Honestly I hate to be cryptic, because that was one of the things I had once hated about DBS videos, and regretfully admit that was one reason that caused me to not believe him (which is no longer the case).

Yes he does and he's more active than many of you might think which makes this thread much more exciting in a post announcement world."

I don't really get people who are... it's just not his time yet. Now is the time for us to get the definitive Peter Parker on film, and alongside the Avengers! And after we've been through a good chunk of films with him, then Miles will get his chance, and it will be even cooler to see this young kid of color come along and put on the suit.  And in the meantime, while we're watching Tom Holland kick ass, Miles will grow as a character in the Marvel comics. And there will be more history to pull from when he does come along in the movies (or TV shows)."

Spiderman,3au0rf,erikthinks,22,Tue Jun 23 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"Only on Reddit will you find hate for Raimi's first two movies. They are almost universally acclaimed outside of places like /r/spiderman or /r/marvel. Check out their Rotten Tomatoes ratings - 89% of reviewers and 94% of reviewers enjoyed Spider-Man 1 and Spider-Man 2 respectively.   They are both in the top 5 Rotten Tomatoes scores for all Marvel films. (List.)  Roger Ebert called Spider-Man 2 the best superhero movie since the genre was launched with Superman in 1978.  And yet you come to /r/spiderman and people are like ""oh actually I think you'll find that Raimi's movies are much worse because of organic webbing"". Yeah, history will not remember things like that. They will remember the Raimi films as films which helped propel the comicbook movie industry into what it is today. As far superior films to the enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying reboot that came after. As great movies, rather than comicbook movies."
Spiderman,3au0rf,hoodie92,8,Tue Jun 23 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"Everything in Spider-Man 2 was great, except the fact that he lost his powers because of.... stress? Depression? That was definitely the weirdest part to me."
Spiderman,3au0rf,Spidon,3,Tue Jun 23 18:11:51 2015 UTC,I suppose it's weird if you're really familiar with the comics because nothing like that has ever happened as far as I know. But it's a really nice subplot for a film. That's one of the reasons it's such a good movie. You really care for him and his problems.
Spiderman,3au0rf,hoodie92,8,Tue Jun 23 19:06:51 2015 UTC,Actually exactly that happened in the comics. He lost his powers for a while quite early on and then later discovered that it was all psychological.
Spiderman,3au0rf,Sitnalta,3,Wed Jun 24 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it occurred in the first annual, where he fights off the Sinister Six. He finds out he had his powers the whole time after getting struck by one of Electro's blasts."

Spiderman,3au0rf,Lox22,6,Tue Jun 23 19:48:59 2015 UTC,"I just really didn't like Toby Maguire. He's irritating at best and I found myself siding with the villains more than once. And then the third one came around and I just wanted it to end more than anything. That's just my 2 cents though. I really want to like the Raimi series - he's a great director and I'm a fan of his other stuff, but I just can't get over Toby being such a whiny wuss. His jokes aren't even corny."
Spiderman,3au0rf,glensgrant,7,Tue Jun 23 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"I have to blame a combination of the writers and possible Raimi for this, because Tobey did the voice acting for the video game versions of Spider-Man 1 and 2, and... he told jokes. He was funny. Where was that Tobey in the movies?"
Spiderman,3au0rf,Spidon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"Toby Maguire ruined the Raimi trilogy for me. I find it hard to even watch. He looks like a mating frog and appears to be completely unable to alter his facial expression. Dunst was awful as well, although with her it wasn't so much her acting as just being badly cast and written. There just wasn't a scrap of MJ there, which is a shame because MJ has a very interesting personality in the comics. That is in fact why she became an integral part of the universe instead of Gwen Stacy: Gwen's perfect good girl character who happens to be a sluttily dressed blonde bombshell was nothing more than a cypher; a simplistic male fantasy brought to life as a gift to Peter Parker from Stan Lee, whom obviously other writers took the first opportunity they had to throw off a bridge, and good riddance too. That's why the fact that Gwen is little like her comic character in the Amazing reboot is not a problem for me as a fan of the comics. Spoiler       It's been years since I watched the Raimi films but every time I want to I picture Maguire's stupid face and I just can't bring myself to do it."
Spiderman,3au0rf,Sitnalta,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:28:40 2015 UTC,Spider-Man 2 is the best Spider-Man movie. The best SUPERHERO movies has to be Superman 2.
Spiderman,3au0rf,munkeybeerd,6,Thu Jun 25 08:42:12 2015 UTC,Spider-Man 2 is pretty much single handedly responsible for kicking off the superhero movie craze. Or at least that's how I see it.

Spiderman,3au0rf,KJM321,2,Tue Jun 23 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say its bad parts weren't as bad, but ASM2 was a tonal mess. And I cared for zero of the bad guys in it, whereas at least SM3 had a pretty great villain in the Sandman. It's a tossup."
Spiderman,3au0rf,statist_steve,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:41:05 2015 UTC,Sandman was good. New Goblin and Venom were terrible.
Spiderman,3au0rf,KJM321,7,Wed Jun 24 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"Why do we all have to agree on that? I mean, I did like it. I'm just saying that we can all have our different opinions. We shouldn't attack others for having different opinions, though. That's what I would agree on."
Spiderman,3au0rf,Moulinoski,18,Tue Jun 23 17:41:38 2015 UTC,I liked it well enough. I thought Andrew was the better Spider-Man.
Spiderman,3au0rf,ryckae,12,Tue Jun 23 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"Raimi's Trilogy and ASM each have their strengths.  My primary reason for preferring the ASM movies was the quality of certain performances.  I never liked Tobey McGuire as Parker--he's an excellent actor but he brings a certain inauthentic condescension.  Andrew Garfield always seemed so sincere. I just liked him.  So too for Emma Stone's Gwen.  I could have watched an entire movie of Gwen and Peter being angsty and in love because the chemistry was so right.  The same goes for Aunt May--Sally Field made Aunt May into a person instead of a caricature of an old lady.  But the ASM movies were poorly plotted, and made some questionable decisions to distinguish themselves from Raimi's.  And in ASM2 they were in such a rush to set up Sinister Six that they blazed right past the wonderful on-screen dynamic Peter and Harry shared in their only scene together."
Spiderman,3au0rf,hephaestusroman,3,Tue Jun 23 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel.  Sony had a real gem on their hands and they let it shatter.  It's such a mess.  And everything you said about Tobey is how I feel about Tobey.  He always bothered be, even back when the first movie came out."
Spiderman,3au0rf,ryckae,23,Wed Jun 24 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"Your post will probably get lots of hate but I'd like to say that I liked a lot about each ASM movie. Yes there was A LOT I didn't like but I just focus on the good things.  -Awesome webslinging  -Spider-Man making quips  -Gwen Stacy  -Web-Shooters  Yes both movies had flaws but they are still worth watching for the good parts, same as the original trilogy."
Spiderman,3au0rf,RANDALLFLA666,8,Tue Jun 23 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"I thought BOTH movies where great, and this brings me to another thing- why does one bad movie or flopped movie call for a reboot? this can be said for Spider-man 3 and TASM2, why when you fail at making it do you need to start all the way over? why not just try better with the next one and try to make up for the last one?"
Spiderman,3au0rf,jordanfromjordan,4,Tue Jun 23 15:54:56 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people hate asm2 are people who didn't have to grow up with batman and robin as the only comic book movie released for years
Spiderman,3au0rf,toenailcigarette,3,Tue Jun 23 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"I thought that ASM2 had a lot of great individual scenes that didn't blend together well at all.  Outside the context of the silly plot issues, the clock tower fight was really, really well done."
Spiderman,3au0rf,RocketTasker,11,Tue Jun 23 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"I'm actually the complete opposite. I hated the first film, and felt angered when I left the theater. The suit looked terrible, and dark and gritty just doesn't suit Spider-Man.  ASM2, however, is far and away my favorite Spider-Man movie. I saw it 3 times in theaters and probably a dozen more since I got the bluray. Loved it, and am still shocked this sub hates it."
Spiderman,3au0rf,epraider,9,Tue Jun 23 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"ASM 2 has the most visual appeal in my opinion. The suit was awesome, web slinging was cool and the fights were great. Very comic book feel to it. However, the plot line and character development really weren't that good. Electro's motivations/personality didn't really make a whole lot of since (maybe could've been done better, but it was really a rushed transition from weirdo to full on super villain. Harry also got way too evil too quickly. Another poster in this thread made a great post detailing the flaws with the film  But it does LOOK awesome. The comic nerd in me looked past all its flaws when I first saw and I loved it. Even went and saw it two more times. I like to watch it, but I certainly wouldn't talk about it seriously with anybody because there just doesn't seem like there's much to talk about."
Spiderman,3au0rf,BosstheVisigoth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"The main issue with the film is really just the amount of content they had to shove in to make it work. Sony was forcing them to set up for Sinister Six, so they had to do that, and wrap up the Gwen and Peter story as well. The movie needed to be longer, is all. But they apparently didn't want to make it too long. I would have preferred it if it were 2 hours and 45 minutes."
Spiderman,3au0rf,KJM321,5,Tue Jun 23 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"If TASM 2 didn't have the over used romance, Electro music, and if they didn't spoil the whole movie with posters/trailers/tv spots it would be decent."
Spiderman,3au0rf,legopieface,25,Tue Jun 23 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, ASM2 is my favorite superhero movie. I cannot figure out why people hate it."
Spiderman,3au0rf,all5persons,26,Tue Jun 23 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"The film has great acting, great visuals, great music, great sound effects, and great direction. But the story was terrible, and for that, I found the film only just passable. There are a few main reasons:   The story was packed with far too many plotlines, giving us less time to resolve the actual important plots, meaning that a lot of it felt rushed. Most of the smaller plotlines were left open. Which leads us on to... The fact that the entire film was an advert for sequels and spin-offs. It barely felt like a film in its own right. Yeah, it had a couple of stories which opened and closed, but it also introduced a load of villains for later, introduced a load of plots for later, introduced a load of backstory for later. Compare to Batman Begins, which was an entire self-contained story and then had a single scene at the end where Gordon hands Batman a Joker card. ASM 2 introduced about 5 or 6 potential bad guys? And showed many more in Oscorp. Which leads me on to... Annoying over-reliance on Oscorp. Webshooters come from Oscorp. Peter is bitten at Oscorp. Gwen worked at Oscorp. Lizard worked at Oscorp. Peter's parents worked at Oscorp. Peter's parents were murdered by Oscorp. Harry's tech is made by Oscorp. Electro is born at Oscorp. All the suits for villains for the now-dead sequels were seen in the basement of Oscorp. It's like every time the writers didn't know what to do, they just wrote ""fuck it, Oscorp"" in the margin of the page. Terrible, undeveloped character motivations. Harry and Electro have almost no reason to do what they do. They are just evil for the sake of it. It doesn't feel organic, it's just a sudden change just because the plot required bad guys. They weren't believable in their motivations like Green Goblin or Doc Ock.   Many more reasons. I haven't seen the film for a while but this is as best I can remember."
Spiderman,3au0rf,hoodie92,9,Tue Jun 23 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head with the last one, that's what ruined the film for me.  No character had reasonable motivations for their actions, it made it near impossible to care about or relate to anyone of them."
Spiderman,3au0rf,yourprognosis,5,Tue Jun 23 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe I have to rewatch it, but I thought Electro's motivations were played laid out. He finally had power and could bully his bullies."
Spiderman,3au0rf,Zanderlod,3,Tue Jun 23 18:28:27 2015 UTC,I think the issue with Electro was he wasn't convincing as someone who nobody ever saw before he became Electro. A bad choice of actor for the role really.
Spiderman,3au0rf,vatechguy,3,Tue Jun 23 18:45:55 2015 UTC,The Amazing Oscorp 2: Oscorpier.       A film about a madcap corporation run amok that single-handedly turns New York in to a battle ground for superheroes.
Spiderman,3au0rf,Sitnalta,5,Wed Jun 24 01:33:17 2015 UTC,"There is an over-reliance on Oscorp. You could say the same is true of Osborn in the comics though in the same way. However, the web shooters didn't come from Oscorp, Peter designed them himself. He sampled their synthetic silk in the beginning of ASM1 so he could create his own cable, but the web shooters are all his. There's a scene dedicated to his invention of it. Yes, Peter was bitten at Oscorp, but he was also bitten at Oscorp in the Ultimate Comics. So, if anything, that's just truth to source material. Everything else, however, I do believe you're right in saying is an over-reliance on Oscorp. Why they didn't branch out an Introduce ESU earlier, I don't know, as that would have at least given them one other source for things to come from."
Spiderman,3au0rf,moralless,5,Tue Jun 23 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"ASM2 is definitely my favorite Spiderman movie. I was a huge fan of the first two Raimi movies when I was a kid, and I still enjoy them, especially because there are some great fight scenes (which, surprisingly, a lot of superhero movies lack), but they seem quite campy to me now. I'm sure that's all intentional, but the tone of them turns me off a bit now, even though I'd still say I enjoy them. I found the acting, story, and visuals in ASM2 to be fantastic, and I'm not afraid to say that I found Andrew Garfield to be great as Peter Parker and as Spiderman."
Spiderman,3au0rf,ForwardBound,5,Tue Jun 23 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"I loved asm2 as well but on multiple viewings, I could see why people disliked it. Still love it but it had its flaws"
Spiderman,3au0rf,itspronouncedbreaux,4,Tue Jun 23 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"My only complaints are the airplane scene that doesn't come up again, and that ""I'm Electro"" line."
Spiderman,3au0rf,all5persons,7,Tue Jun 23 15:36:02 2015 UTC,"It was very comic book, but strangely not in the way marvel has been giving its movies a ""comic book"" feel. It felt sort of like 90s spider-man comics which could be very over the top. I love that feeling but I kinda thought some people might not lol"
Spiderman,3au0rf,itspronouncedbreaux,2,Tue Jun 23 15:40:59 2015 UTC,That's because marvel didn't make the movie.
Spiderman,3au0rf,Fershick,3,Tue Jun 23 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it for the most part but one thing that I disliked which pops up in my head is the song they used after gwen died, and Peter is in his room ""gone gone gone""  I think?   I just felt it was kind of over the top in your face ""Hey do, do you get it? She's gone/dead, so here's this upbeat song to remind you.""  On the other hand, the ""Raindrops keep falling on my head"" song that played in Spiderman 2 was properly used in my opinion."
Spiderman,3au0rf,Moist_Vanguard,3,Tue Jun 23 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that song used more in the middle of the movie, after they broke up or something?"

Spiderman,3au0rf,BrokuSSJ,3,Tue Jun 23 22:30:16 2015 UTC,I loved both of them. My only gripe was that TASM2 tried to cram in too many things as set-up for sequels/spin-offs that will now never happen.
Spiderman,3au0rf,DeathN0te,5,Wed Jun 24 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"it was good, don't understand all the hate."

Spiderman,3au0rf,bogaboy,2,Tue Jun 23 18:20:09 2015 UTC,If it didn't have a crappy cliche villain it would be one of the best Spider-man movies so far. Really disappointed with that series choice of villains.
Spiderman,3au0rf,legopieface,2,Tue Jun 23 16:36:09 2015 UTC,I love the ASM movies. Both of them.
Spiderman,3au0rf,XMenOrangesTangerine,2,Fri Jun 26 12:31:30 2015 UTC,"I watched the first TASM about 4 times in theaters. Because I was 17 at the time, Peter was 17 in the movie. And during that age I suffered from depression from loneliness, and my God the movie felt like it was made for me.  My personal favorite scene from the movie is when after Peter asks Gwen out and she accepts, he goes to a warehouse and practices his swinging while enjoying that his life is starting to get better. I really loved it because it shows that your life, even if it sucked, will get better one day."

And what's crazy is that I'm a huge Spider-Man fan.  I mean, really.  I took days off from work to watch the Raimi entries (yes, I hate the third one like most folks and think the second was the best, like most folks).  By far, Spider-Man is my favorite superhero and my desk and home and at my office proclaim as much.  And I have no interest to watch ASM2 for the first time or ASM for the second time...  Something in ASM just didn't click with me and I am done with that series.  So obviously, I am ecstatic that the series is rebooted once again and with Marvel at the helm."

I'm surprised posts like this aren't banned. If not banned, maybe successful ones like this recommended on the sidebar or something."

Spiderman,3au0rf,jessicadrew94,3,Tue Jun 23 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, we can. And I think we also agree that the hate was just fanboys/fangirls being butthurt because Marvel Studios wasn't responsible for the movies. Andrew Garfield was 100% dedicated to the character and I loved the fact that he used to do some of his stunts. I defended him from the moment he was cast and he will always be my favorite Spidey. TASM was sweet and endearing, TASM2 was all over the place but it felt like the Spider-man movie I had waited all my life."

Spiderman,3au0rf,ziggyzogg,0,Wed Jun 24 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"Nah. It was purely made so Sony could keep the rights and suffered because of that. The first one exists to show off the Lizard and keep the rights, the second one exists because Sony wanted to try and create an Avengers type film with sinister six. They lacked heart because they were made so Sony could keep film rights. I will never agree that either of the amazing spider-man films were quite good. I would say the first one was at least slightly passable, but was undermined because we didn't need another origin story. The second one was just a train wreck of ideas strung together as an intro for Sinister six.  In short they were made by Sony for Sony, not for the audience."

Spiderman,3au0rf,mrglass8,-1,Tue Jun 23 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, I can't agree with that at all, sorry.  The truth of the matter is that the movie completely mauled what makes Spider-man Spider-man. That is, his sense of guilt and the responsibility that comes from it.  TASM Peter isn't motivated by that. TASM Peter is motivated by first revenge, then Justice. And if you ask me, it robs the character of all his meaning.  It doesn't help that I thought Andrew Garfield's character was a complete prick. He didn't come off to me as likable at all, especially when every interaction he had with an adult was cold and rude.  If you ask me, Peter Parker is an earnest character. He cares deeply for his friends and family. And I didn't see anything remotely resembling that in TASM.  Yes, Spider-man tells jokes, and yes Peter is more confident and less of a straight up dork, but those details were never the important part of Spider-man for me."

Spiderman,3avzhf,SmokeyTheBear420,6,Tue Jun 23 23:54:04 2015 UTC,Take a look at all the other Marvel movies and you might notice something.   Marvel isn't too big into casting well knowns for the biggest roles and the directors chair. I think Thor may have been the only film where the director had some nice clout behind him. Of course Thor had pretty much an unknown.   But Marvel pulls the strings on all their films. Again look at who they get.   The issue with Sony's studio intervention if they first tried to control the wrong director and then tried to start up several different films in one movie. They had no idea what they were doing.   For all you know this director could begin commanding big films after this. Hell he might be the guy who does Avengers 4.
Spiderman,3avzhf,neoblackdragon,2,Wed Jun 24 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"Jon Favreau and Joe Johnston had some notable credits with Elf and Honey I Shrunk the Kids. And Joss Whedon was, well Joss Whedon.  But I can see your point. I guess the difference is that the guys pulling the strings at Sony were the suits managing their pocketbooks."
Spiderman,3avzhf,GnarlsD,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think since that's what killed the last Spider-Man franchise they will avoid that, and I think Sony trusts Marvel to know better."
Spiderman,3avzhf,hartwell_w,3,Tue Jun 23 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think studios ever ""avoid that"". Even Marvel does it (see Avengers: Age of Ultron).  The reason you didn't see it initially is that the studios are just trying to put out a movie they think people will like. They hire a good director and trust them to make a good movie.   But as franchises go on, studios start to get greedy, and start to try to engineer a movie that will make money according to what THEY think the public and their main audiences demand.  My fear is that Spider-man is far down that rabbit-hole already, and that this guy, regardless of his actual talent, is going to turn out to be a puppet."
Spiderman,3avzhf,dannzo_29,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:34:05 2015 UTC,This is exactly my fear too.  Age of Ultron and Guardians are the biggest examples of where studio intervention is most noticeable with so much set-up going in Ultron for Civil War and Infinity War and Guardians with the introduction of the Infinity Stones and expanding on Thanos.  I'd actually rather Spidey be back with Sony but Sony actually care about the films they're making instead of churning out mediocre movies and raking in as much money as they can.

That universe started quite realistic with Iron Man, but since then, all the powers and superheroes and alien weirdness has all been escalating.

Spiderman,3aus0m,bogaboy,2,Tue Jun 23 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"I'm probably in a small minority but I'd love to see vulture finally be a main villain. First off, he's great juxtaposition for a very young and wisecracking spidey. And one of my favorite spiderman runs is a Roger Stern's, and he did awesome work with Vulture there by basically portraying him as an elderly, past his prime villain trying to retain his youth. It was really cool.   But mysterio or kraven would also be awesome to see as well!"
Spiderman,3aus0m,stormz96,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"I could dig Vulture as a main villain. Kinda as a way to take Spidey back to his roots with small scale crime, before he joins The Avengers and starts saving the world. Mysterio could be quite cool as well.

I think they could do a real noir pulpy type of thing with him and spider man playing detective which he commonly does. they would probably opt out of that idea due to lack of cgi fun. Mysterio is interesting because he could be a means for them to show a bunch of super villains in holographic form, good excuse for crazy cgi of a bunch of recognizable baddies.

Spiderman,3aus0m,SuckaFreeBaust,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:42:37 2015 UTC,"ALRIGHT! For the exact reasons Rockettasker said and more (and because of the spectacular spider-man cartoon) Mysterio would be a phenomenal choice. I think Vulture could work too. Now in order to world-build and also allow the movie to make use of multiple bad guys (which we can admit has been a problem in the poorer movies) there really should be a netflix series instead but I digress; in movie format they could have lesser villains who don't need back stories or villains working together, but there only being one main actual super villain and then someone behind the scenes pulling the strings. Now this could work in a lot of ways. you could go the norman ors born route, bankrolling the creation of super villains, or the tombstone or Kingpin route, etc. You could then include other lesser bad guys, like the enforcers and hammerhead etc, and then the real fighty big bad and then reveal who was really behind everything. Mysterio would be fantastic cus it would be an interesting cinematic idea. Make the audience think theres real magic (especially after Doctor Strange came out) have spider-man be up against something he doesn't have any hope to beat. maybe have him visit doctor strange, and he's meditating and he runs into Wong instead who tells him mysterio isn't real magic or they would have sensed it or something. and then you see its really tech, which fits along nicely in this universe, and all the advanced tech that pops up. or you could go with two different villain ""groups"" butting heads, norman osborn vs (insert crime boss) or helping crime boss, or norman osborn vs vulture (cus he is angry at him for stealing his tech design). you could even have a main bad guy and then on the side have lesses villains get introduced who don't need much backstory, like chameleon or shocker or tinkerer with spider-slayers or something, or boomerang or smythe. if they set up jameson they could even make a scorpion story and then have the person who made that suit be the real villain. there's so many options, especially if they want to introduce multiple villains or start their civilian stories at least, they can do that, but they just need to do it right."

Spiderman,3at1x1,Wallcrawler62,-4,Thu Jun 25 07:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people see it this way. It's blatantly obvious that the intention of JMS was that Norman manipulated her, and basically used mind games to impregnate her intentionally. This is more a statement of Norman's character than hers, and in that way it's spot on.  Poor story or not, let's stop slut shaming Gwen for being taken advantage of. Bit of a hyperbole so don't come at me like a rogue SJW, but hopefully you get the point.  EDIT: Just reread your post, and I wanted to touch specifically on the fact that I think they did it SPECIFICALLY because it was the creepiest thing ever. Poor choice or not."
Spiderman,3at1x1,AwesomusP,3,Tue Jun 23 14:07:16 2015 UTC,It's a poor story that tarnishes one thing that should have remained a pure and innocent memory for Peter Parker.  Fans are just as mad as what it does for his character as it did for hers.  And it was an otherwise unremarkable throwaway story that now means nothing except for being a bad memory.
Spiderman,3at1x1,AwesomusP,0,Tue Jun 23 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the story jeopardizes the innocence of Gwen, but rather magnifies the monstrousness of Norman. I honestly think the worst thing about this story is it's brevity. Three issues was too short to do the story justice, and in the end it's cheapened by it. If this had been a background plot point for a year or so, coming to fruition in a 3 issue arc it might have earned it's emotional asking price."

Having any kind of physical disability would render him almost completely useless in a fight. I'm all for characters of varying nationalities and origins, but there does not need to be an asian Spider-Man, or, really any Spider-Man aside from Peter Parker. He is Spider-Man, it doesn't matter who they slap the mask onto, at the end of the day there is no Spider-Man but Peter Parker. If there is to be a superhero of asian descent, then come up with an original character. It's bad enough Miles appears to be supplanting Peter after Secret Wars, we don't need more spider themed characters as too many exist already."

That in the myriad realities full of alternate versions, gender swaps, offspring and anthropmorphic talking pigs, Peter Parker is the one, true Spider-Man. Issues of that crossover flat out tell us that he's the real deal and that all others are reflections and aftershocks.  You seem to be missing my point entirely, however, as I'm not saying that other versions of Spider-Man do not exist. What I'm saying is that when you ask people on the street who Spider-Man is, they say Peter Parker. When you look back at decades of continuity it's Peter Parker. Spider-Man is Peter Parker, all others are imitators, pretenders, or tributes to the real deal.  I'm sorry if you can't handle it when people do not make purely factual statements, but I would refrain from calling someone childish when you clearly misunderstood the post you're ripping on."

Spiderman,3am6cd,lame_corprus,10,Sun Jun 21 19:54:26 2015 UTC,The action scenes were well done. And Harry's death scene at the end gets me teary eyed every time.

Spiderman,3am6cd,pseudomucho,9,Sun Jun 21 22:20:29 2015 UTC,Personally I didn't mind New Goblin too much. If I recall Harry did have a brief stint where he was the Green Goblin in the comics and I think it wasnt really implemented in the movie as poorly as people think. However I feel Venom should have just been a cameo and not in the movie directly.
Spiderman,3am6cd,8monsters,6,Sun Jun 21 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"The new goblin was pretty good, but Harry in almost every other scene, not so good."

Spiderman,3am6cd,Kitsyfluff,10,Mon Jun 22 00:32:27 2015 UTC,The scene where Sandman discovers his powers is a masterpiece.. It tells you everything you need to know about the character without a single word being uttered. The soundtrack hits every emotional queue as well. I remember hearing gasps in the theater when he reached for the locket.
Spiderman,3am6cd,HansCool,8,Sun Jun 21 19:14:44 2015 UTC,That's what happens when Danny Elfman is writing the themes for your score. The man's a musical genius at capturing and portraying emotion. The music in all three movies was incredible.

Spiderman,3am6cd,ChickenPlunger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"Its definitely possible that I could be wrong, but from what I remember he was involved in all music that would be considered a ""theme"" of a character.

Spiderman,3am6cd,gwright110,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think that's Elfman's style, he's way more cartoony and has a certain charm to it.

Spiderman,3am6cd,ChickenPlunger,8,Mon Jun 22 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"It certainly showed the fans and the studios how too many villains can be a bad thing. Which I would say setting a precedent on that with the rising popularity of the ""superhero"" genre  at the time was a very good thing."

Spiderman,3am6cd,Frozen_Canadian,15,Sun Jun 21 17:22:20 2015 UTC,Can we consider Rhino a villain in that movie though? It's always helped me keep peace of mind thinking of him more as a...minor teaser?
Spiderman,3am6cd,HylanWarior224,6,Sun Jun 21 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"Even two seemed like too many in TASM 2, because none of the characters had believable motivations. The film seemed so cramped because rather than trying to actually make a satisfying stand-alone film, they wasted time by starting loads of strange and confusing plot-threads, meaning that there was no time for things like character arcs or motivations.  The whole thing felt like an advert for some future Spider-Man film which will now never happen."
Spiderman,3am6cd,hoodie92,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:28:05 2015 UTC,And honestly showing that split second on the previews of the ruined that scene for me. When that screen cut to black I was fuming.

Spiderman,3am6cd,Lox22,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:26:45 2015 UTC,"Thats always what I said! I just pictured rhino as a replacement for a petty street thug (which he basically is in the 1st scene) then at the end it was like what, 2 minutes? I love TASM series and was pissed at the termination of it."
Spiderman,3am6cd,morphinapg,10,Mon Jun 22 01:40:12 2015 UTC,"TASM2 pulled it off much better, and they really only had 2 villains, and even then, goblin was more a set up for the sequel than a main villain for that film (done way better than venom in sm3). I don't count rhino because he was mostly just there to show how Spider-man lives his day to day life, not a focus of the story. Normally his scenes would have just been filled with a nobody thief, but they decided to put in a character we know instead."

Spiderman,3am6cd,lancebaldwin,20,Sun Jun 21 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be hard to watch. Raimi is a master of cheese. He made that scene (and the dance) intentionally cheesy, because his interpretation was that when Peter tried to be ""cool"" when he had the black suit on, he would come off as creepy and weird.  If you cringed during that scene, it means that Raimi did exactly what he wanted to achieve."

Spiderman,3am6cd,soupdawg,4,Sun Jun 21 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"Here's my counter: I get tongue in cheek humor. I agree that it would even make sense for someone as lame as Tobey's Peter to think that was cool (if he really is that lame). But here's what's up: Just because something makes sense, that doesn't make it a good scene. Regardless of how much it makes sense to the story, a scene still has to be good. That is one hard scene to watch, and is one of the most cringe worthy moments of the film.  As a side note, I think Raimi had his version of Peter smarter and cooler than that through the first two movies. At no point is it hinted that he thinks black haired emo is cool. As a matter of fact, if anything, it's shown that (prior to the emo scene) he has a very conventional idea of who and what is cool, based on his jealousy of Flash in Spider-Man (1). I just didn't want to include this in the main part of he rebuttal because I think it's more of a matter of opinion."

Spiderman,3am6cd,hoodie92,8,Sun Jun 21 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"You've got to be kidding me. At the very least the writing in ASM2 was much better, but I think that movie actually had great structure. It did a great job relating everything to Peter's relationships and the effects they have on people, which in turn did a great job setting up Goblin and Gwen's death, which in turn would have been great set up for a next movie where Peter wants revenge on Harry. You have to think about these movies in terms of what they were trying to do as a series in addition to individual movies, and these movies had some great world building in them. I'm disappointed we never got to see it all pay off."
Spiderman,3am6cd,morphinapg,12,Sun Jun 21 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"At the very least the writing in ASM2 was much better, but I think that movie actually had great structure.    It's funny you should mention these two things, because I think the writing and structure in ASM 2 are by far the worst thing they do.  Visual effects, sound effects, direction, acting, music, all of that stuff is great. The story and dialogue were terrible. None of the actions any of the characters did made sense. Everything was either ""we are doing this because the script says so"" or some kind of weird set-up which was meant to be explained in the sequel but now there isn't a sequel."
Spiderman,3am6cd,Frozen_Canadian,-4,Sun Jun 21 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"Everything that happens in the movie is directly related to Peter's relationships and how they affect people. The overall story arc is about Harry and Peter's relationship, and the way it crumbles throughout the movie. Practically everything that happens in the movie can be traced back to that. There is a clear focus in the movie and it's on character development.   Tell me what you think doesn't make sense, because I can't really think of anything. And I think the dialogue is really well done. Way better than 90% of the Raimi movies, which were ridiculously cheesy throughout."
Spiderman,3am6cd,morphinapg,8,Sun Jun 21 21:57:32 2015 UTC,Better writing? Remember when SCIENCE GENIUS PETER PARKER HAD TO GO ON YOUTUBE TO FIND OUT HOW BATTERIES WORK? That is such a lazy way to explain stuff to the audience.
Spiderman,3am6cd,thesink,0,Sun Jun 21 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"His expertise may have been in other areas. At some point, you have to learn the things you don't already know. He was still fairly young, so it's completely believable that he might still not have understood the relevant information about batteries and electricity at that point in his life regardless of his scientific ability. In fact the ending reinforces that idea when Gwen knows more about the power grid than Peter does."
Spiderman,3am6cd,morphinapg,0,Sun Jun 21 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"You have to think about these movies in terms of what they were trying to do as a series in addition to individual movies   No. I will not judge a movie based upon what it might possibly do in the future because, as we've seen with this very example, a sequel may not be forthcoming."
Spiderman,3am6cd,thesink,0,Mon Jun 22 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"It's not about what might happen in the future, it's about what they were doing in that movie to set up that story. If it's okay for Lord of the Rings (which absolutely do NOT stand on their own), then why isn't it okay for Spider-man?"
Spiderman,3am6cd,morphinapg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"It's about what they were doing in that movie to set up that story   Which you absolutely should not do at the expense of the story you're trying to tell in the current movie. Part of the reason why Harry falls flat is because the conflict we're given has so little setup that the payoff is weak. Harry is supposed to be Peter's best friend and we have no investment in the relationship between the two because he comes out of nowhere. Why? Because TASM2 wants to world build rather than focus on telling a good story.    If it's okay for Lord of the Rings   I'd say it isn't as I saw the first one and hated it. But, for those who did enjoy it, I'd guess it's okay because LOTR was one story told over three movies that were all pretty much guaranteed to be made whereas TASM was a series of movies that had no overall relation."
Spiderman,3am6cd,TheGreatBatsby,0,Mon Jun 22 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"Which you absolutely should not do at the expense of the story you're trying to tell in the current movie.   I don't think they did.

But, for those who did enjoy it, I'd guess it's okay because LOTR was one story told over three movies that were all pretty much guaranteed to be made whereas TASM was a series of movies that had no overall relation.   If you can't see the relation between ASM1 and 2 then I don't know what to say. And yes, ASM 3, 4, and Sinister Six were already greenlit by the time ASM2 came out. The fact that they got canceled was completely unexpected. Sony dug themselves in a hole with the ridiculous level of marketing for both movies. When you show people too much, they don't care as much about going to the movie and when they do go, they've already been spoiled on so much that they won't have a great experience. Thankfully I saw the movie without having seen any of the trailers. Maybe that's why I liked it so much more than everyone else.  Although people on this sub were loving it on release day. Things have changed..."
Spiderman,3am6cd,JZPotter,5,Mon Jun 22 23:13:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed, easily better than TASM2"
Spiderman,3am6cd,TheGreatBatsby,0,Sun Jun 21 18:37:50 2015 UTC,You're actually gonna say a movie with EMO HUMPING PETER is better?
Spiderman,3am6cd,JZPotter,6,Sun Jun 21 18:52:28 2015 UTC,Easily. I enjoyed Spider-man 3. TASM2 was not good to watch.
Spiderman,3am6cd,legendarybreed,-1,Sun Jun 21 19:09:38 2015 UTC,...I don't know what to say to that.
Spiderman,3am6cd,JordansFilms1,4,Sun Jun 21 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"He's completely right, ASM2 failed on every level (for me at least). Spiderman 3 has plenty of cringe moments but ASM2 is still shit compared to it. Im not going to check but I'm certain critics and fans both gave Spiderman 3 a better rating than ASM2."
Spiderman,3am6cd,Frozen_Canadian,2,Sun Jun 21 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. About 45 of TASM2 is perfect Spider-Man for me. But the rest of the movie is a total mess and totally atrocious. Spider-Man 3 is fairly consistent although there are a few things that suck about it. I feel a lot of the stuff people complain about in Spidey 3 is blown a little out of proportion. Especially since there's a lot more ""Batman Forever-y"" stuff in TASM2."
Spiderman,3am6cd,JordansFilms1,4,Mon Jun 22 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"Spider-Man 3 failed as a Spider-Man movie (It also had to follow Spider-Man 2, still one of the GOAT comic book movies). TASM2 failed as a movie period. Piss poor writing, editing and too much trying to make a cinematic universe THAT CAN ONLY HAVE ONE SUPERHERO"

Spiderman,3am6cd,mrglass8,4,Sun Jun 21 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"live action media or everything? because TAS was very successful is showing the effects on Peter, like steroids/roid rage, and the inner monologue (which you can't do in live action because it's hokey) showed how he wanted to get away from it."
Spiderman,3am6cd,lvest,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"All media. TAS was really sudden with it. SM3 does a really good of gradually building up. The sandman fight in the subway does a really good job at showing Peter's rage steadily grow up to the point that he actually tries to kill him. And I'll be honest, I thought emo Peter did a great job of making you hate him. It really made Peter seem like an arrogant, selfish, prick, which is exactly how he is supposed to be."

Spiderman,3am6cd,RyanTheCannon,9,Sun Jun 21 18:17:10 2015 UTC,I kinda thought Topher Grace was a poor fit for Venom. The Eddie Brock from the 90s cartoon was jacked on roids and Topher is.. well Eric Foreman.

To get another power?! Reaching so miles fans will jump on the hype train to support this series which I'm sure will once again need Peter to carry it to get people to actually read it. Seriously why do we get this garbage when we should be getting another Kaine series."
Spiderman,3al4aq,TheGhostAssassin,6,Sun Jun 21 14:21:46 2015 UTC,What I feel would be interesting is a  book like Cable and Deadpool except with Agent Venom and Scarlet Spider. I personally enjoyed their partnership in Minimum Carnage and think that those two would have a good balance between them since they are both rather morally gray (Kaine more so than Flash obviously). But this could just be me.
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,4,Sun Jun 21 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"a book like Cable and Deadpool except with Agent Venom and Scarlet Spider   ALL OF MY WANT. Instead, we get shit like a zero personality character like Miles forced down our throats."

Spiderman,3al4aq,XpRienzo,4,Sun Jun 21 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no problem with his race. I love Miguel and Hobie Brown (Spider-Punk from Spider-Verse) is black too. The thing is, those guys have personality. They offer something unique. Miles is bland as fuck. I'm just baffled by his popularity. I just don't want him to sideline Pete (the greatest comic book character ever, imo) in any way."
Spiderman,3al4aq,TheGhostAssassin,3,Sun Jun 21 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"Hobie Brown was the original Prowler, lest you forget."

Spiderman,3al4aq,TheGhostAssassin,0,Mon Jun 22 12:30:47 2015 UTC,Maybe Miles is too subtle for you but he has a lot of potential to grow as a character.
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,5,Sun Jun 21 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"Well, now that he has joined 616, I hope he does. I want him to have an interesting, unique personality."

Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:25:38 2015 UTC,Did you? They never came out and said it but it's implied. If his new power was brought on by stress don't you think he would of used it when his mother died in front of his eyes!  http://imgur.com/a/xGT90
Spiderman,3al4aq,Lox22,-2,Sun Jun 21 16:24:36 2015 UTC,How the hell would his new power have helped his mother who was shot in the chest from a stray police bullet? His mother died in his arms.
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,2,Sun Jun 21 18:18:57 2015 UTC,Because he was being absorb by venom

Spiderman,3al4aq,zslayer89,3,Sun Jun 21 19:35:14 2015 UTC,Clearly going right over your head with this one. If the new power is triggered by stress especially while being absorbed he should of been able to use it as it would be apart of his original power set. Did you not see the pics it is implied he was bit by another spider. I don't see the confusion

Spiderman,3al4aq,Lox22,8,Sun Jun 21 21:10:47 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Miles is such a forced character. Miguel and Kaine are WAY more interesting.

How he doesn't jive with a group."

New York City's huge, so 2 Spider-Men, identifiable by different suits, is totally fine. I highly, highly doubt they're going to replace Pete again."
Spiderman,3al4aq,neoblackdragon,8,Sun Jun 21 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"First off I am of color, and the fact that Bendis makes it sound like he is writing this just so kids of color can play spider-man out on the playground because their white friends won't let them be superman or batman is kinda a strange excuse to write the book. Why couldn't he just say he wants to continue miles story?"
Spiderman,3al4aq,CallMeMoo,3,Sun Jun 21 14:26:35 2015 UTC,Currently not making a character white or using a nonwhite character for a skin color neutral story requires a conscious decision. It's the United States. This country is not yet color blind. We just had a racist shooting that killed a lot of people.   You have plenty of folks who still have an us vs them mentality. One day I hope we can truly be color blind but we are not there yet.  Bendis is over 47 years old as well which matters.
Spiderman,3al4aq,EDGY_USERNAME_HERE,5,Sun Jun 21 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"No one gives a shit about white superheroes. No one ever says, ""why do they have to pander to the masses?""   You would have a point if Bendis wrote it in a pandering, condescending way. But he doesn't. Miles is a person of color and it's left at that. No other mentions of race is really mentioned.   It's not pandering to just have a person of color if they're main gimmick isn't that."
Spiderman,3al4aq,EDGY_USERNAME_HERE,4,Sun Jun 21 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"Even if someone's race is brought up, that doesn't make it ""gimmicky"". Most obvious character that comes to mind is Black Panther. But Luke Cage bringing up Jim-Crow era life in Civil War was a pretty cool moment."
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,3,Sun Jun 21 21:27:52 2015 UTC,Having a super hero that looks like you is cool. When I was a kid I wished there would have been more south-asian superheroes.
Spiderman,3al4aq,Lox22,3,Sun Jun 21 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"Why can't Bendis acknowledged that he wants to continue Miles' story because of how powerful the character is to himself & tons of people who have told him so personally?  I don't care if you're ""of color""(you don't know what color you are?), calls for ""color blind-ness"" are stupid."
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,4,Sun Jun 21 15:27:49 2015 UTC,Just saying doesn't have to pull the race card as a reason to continue he specially address that as the reason. Would of been fine with what you just said. You don't have to be ignorant yourself because you have a boner that this lame Spider-Man is getting his own series
Spiderman,3al4aq,Lox22,-4,Sun Jun 21 16:10:46 2015 UTC,So you don't know what color you are? LMAO   You don't need to hate Bendis because he's thinking of people that you don't want to think about or whatever your issue with acknowledging that race IS a big deal in America is
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,4,Sun Jun 21 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"Just saying if you are playing with kids that don't let you be whatever super hero you want to be based off your race you need some new friends. You're over reacting on my statement. The whole point of miles was so to say anyone could be spider man. Not hating bendis. It's just that shouldn't be the focal point of the character and the reason that his story must live on. I don't have to tell you my race or ethnicity or as you would say ""color"" I am to justify anything. People like you are the reason statements like Bendis has to make statements like this, because you address the problem like people have an identity issue. I'm just saying it's not needed. Take it how you want dude, you clearly just want to attack people"
Spiderman,3al4aq,Lox22,-5,Sun Jun 21 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"you brought up your ""color"", as if to qualify your statement before you made it. Now you don't have to justify yourself; which is it?  I just think it's stupid to say, ""I'm of color"", as if you don't know what color/ethnicity you are"
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:09:52 2015 UTC,Because that how Bendis put it...do you read anything. you are the one trying ask me repeated times if I know what color I am. You are the one on the attack like some arrogant asshole. All I did was ask why does Bendis have to say that as the reason to continue Miles? You blew this up for what? What's your end game?
Spiderman,3al4aq,Lox22,-4,Sun Jun 21 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"sounds like you are the one that has blown up, Lox.  I just responded to your posts. I'm sorry you are so sensitive that being asked about the things you say are taken as an attack"

Spiderman,3al4aq,glovemachine,0,Sun Jun 21 20:13:20 2015 UTC,because of how powerful the character is to himself   Maybe because the character isn't?
Spiderman,3al4aq,SpectralEntity,2,Mon Jun 22 11:59:29 2015 UTC,"Bigger question for me is Miles over in 616 with all his supporting cast etc or is it just him by himself.  He'd be in a much darker place if his Dad, Ganke etc had all died at the end of the ultimate universe. So much so that'd he'd be a very different character and not one that Peter would be able to mentor very easily. Peter has no parents but he still has his aunt and everyone he knew when he was growing up. Miles might be the only person who came from the ultimate world."

Miles has almost no personality. I don't know what it is, but he's boring. The only reason I kept reading was seeing MJ and Gwen and the others still runnin around. I'm really surprised he's as popular as he is.   I'll give it a shot, but they really need to do something to inject some life into that character."

MJ and Gwen continued to be interesting and were the sole reason to continue reading USM. Miles brought zip to the table and was thrown to the wayside of his own book with his dull, uninventive or interesting personality.   I'm really surprised he's as popular as he is.    Most of his fanbase consists of people who have never even read his comic. They just like him because he's ""different""."

Ultimate Peter Parker was probably my favorite comic I've read and Aunt May's house of misfit super-heroes was awesome. I was sad to see it end."
Spiderman,3al4aq,PM_ME_YOUR_IRIS,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"Bendis is either pretty good, or terrible.  His main problem is all the talking. There is an entire issue of the Ultimate Spider-Man that is just one conversation in MJ's bedroom where Peter's trying to say ""I'm Spider-Man"". In the context of the tpb collections it sort of works, but still... It's a ridiculously long conversation."
Spiderman,3al4aq,kylechrise,4,Tue Jun 23 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"Look I understand the viewpoints but there are many.  Some people of color don't care about the race of the character. They didn't have issues playing Superman or Batman as a kid. They don't need a fictional character to be their skin color to enjoy them.  Some people of color do care about the race of the character. They did have issue playing Superman or Batman as a kid. Now they can enjoy the character but there is something about the hero being like you. In the Avengers movie, there isn't exactly a black guy saving the world for instance.  Fury isn't an Avenger and War Machine get's upstaged by Vision(played by a white guy).   Then you got white people who may or may not understand how much the majority they are.  The you got those who aren't white or black and don't understand what it can be like to be black in the US.   Now in the end, someone is going to ask. White Peter was replaced with a black kid. So even if race really isn't his intent, he's gotta spin some bs. You underestimate how people can see the color blue for the color blue."

Spiderman,3al4aq,jec2384,3,Sun Jun 21 07:00:22 2015 UTC,How many spider-titles can we have post secret wars?? We'll have a miles book. I assume a peter book by Slott. They've said Gwen will return (I'm guessing in her own continuity). Will there be at least one more spidey title? I'd give up Silk and Miguel books in exchange for a spidey team up or some kinda spidey inc. Somebody get Kevin Schnick a spidey book to write!

If so, I'm really intrigued as to who they'll get to replace him. I'm hoping Remender. His Spidey in Axis was fantastic.   They've said Gwen will return (I'm guessing in her own continuity).    Axel Alanso already confirmed that Gwen will be in her own continuity."
Spiderman,3al4aq,dangvozden,0,Mon Jun 22 12:40:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you Bendis and marvel for letting me know that my twenty years of loyalty to your brand and the character of Peter Parker was for nothing. Here's how this scenario will play out. We will have miles as the ""primary"" Spider-Man while Peter is the secondary. 12 months in Miles book will continue to sell in the lower 30000 while Peter's book will continue to triple the total. Marvel will then kill off Peter or strip him of his powers."
Spiderman,3al4aq,jec2384,2,Sun Jun 21 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"I have a question. I have heard a lot of people talk that way when a former big name or pretty much any well known marvel character is taken out or replaced and i honestly need to understand it. Why do you feel like this? First of all, just because a big character isn't getting a book to himself anymore doesn't mean he's being treated poorly or that he wont be appearing in books anymore. And what's this about loyalty? You're acting as if its somehow a personal offense to you that Marvel isn't staying the same in the way you specifically want. Some things move forward or change, and it is their property. I'm not trying to sound rude so sorry if it comes out that way, I just don't really get it. I've been reading spider-man for years just like you and believe me i love the character, but i don't feel betrayed like you are feeling."

Spiderman,3al4aq,dangvozden,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Bendis states that Miles will be ""the Spider-Man"" which implies Miles is replacing Peter. As for Spider-men, that was a limited series where Peter visited the ultimate universe, not the new status quo."
Spiderman,3al4aq,real-Heisennerd,4,Sun Jun 21 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry to burst your narrative but Bendis never says he is ""the Spider-Man."" He's talking about using a non-adjectival title for the book and why they named the book ""Spider-Man."" He's making a point that this isn't just some off-shoot character, he is Spider-Man for all to enjoy. This is a point being made because for so long minority characters have been criticized as being ""me too"" additions to the Marvel universe, just look at Spider-Woman, She-Hulk, and Falcon's introductions. This is a way for them to say, ""This character gets to be just as much a Spider-Man as any other."" Miguel O'Hara is Spider-Man and Peter is Spider-Man and now Miles is Spider-Man. Him being Spider-Man is different than him being ""the Spider-Man."" That said, this narrative will likely be burst when the Octobers solicits come out.  Not to mention that Marvel wouldn't cancel one of their hottest titles that is selling better than it has in 10 years and replace it with a title that continued due to Bendis' tenacity and good graces with the company."

Spiderman,3ahoj6,Iokuas,15,Sat Jun 20 16:16:54 2015 UTC,Who cares
Spiderman,3ahoj6,stjimmyofsuburbia,10,Sat Jun 20 08:16:06 2015 UTC,"Lol that article was not journalism it was opinionated complaining. I personally think race doesn't matter when it comes to casting because to me I'm looking for a good performance from an actor. That being said its not racist to have race as a character trait. In casting you look for actors who are tall, short, black, white depending on what the character is, why is this person demonizing that?   I don't understand why Spider-man has attracted all this bs of changing Peter's race. I'm just curious why hasn't anyone botched about Superman or Batman staying white? The article mentioned the previous iterations being the same race as a reason to diversify Peter now but Bruce and Clark have had far more Caucasian  portrayals. I just hate that this is the only thing people talk about when Spider-man movies are brought up into question. And this was a shitty passive aggressive article lol"
Spiderman,3ahoj6,princesspongconsole,3,Sat Jun 20 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Spidey has been the one that's attracted all the attention because of Miles Morales. It made people realize ""Oh shit, super heroes can be any race under that mask."" I personally don't like Miles but it cause a lot of people to want a non-white spidey since they realized it could be a possibility."
Spiderman,3ahoj6,TourretsMime,5,Sat Jun 20 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"Um Miles Morales is not the first black super hero. And he's not the first black legacy character either. They did the whole ""you can be any race under the mask"" thing in the original 1984 Secret Wars with Iron Man"
Spiderman,3ahoj6,princesspongconsole,2,Sun Jun 21 01:26:32 2015 UTC,He's not no but he's a more recent one that both comic reader and non reader knows of that still hasn't been casted. The controversy when they revealed it was pretty big due to the popularity of Spider-man.
Spiderman,3ahoj6,TourretsMime,3,Sun Jun 21 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"What about John Stewart? He's a lot of people's Green Lantern because of his use in the 2000's and he's a Green Lantern, a very popular character. Yet Ryan Reynolds got none of this when he was cast and that was before Miles Morales. I would argue because diversity is only a recent fad"
Spiderman,3ahoj6,princesspongconsole,2,Sun Jun 21 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it's a bit of both but Spider-man is arguably the most popular superhero (at least in Marvel). He's just going to get a lot of attention due to the whole Sony and recasting Andrew Garfield debacle. Miles just introduced the idea that Spider-man could be someone that isn't white and like you said with the diversity thing happening, people are just running with it."
Spiderman,3ahoj6,TourretsMime,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"The only reason that anyone even knows about Miles (on a larger scale) is because Marvel did lots of misleading advertising before the character premiered. Saying in news articles that ""PETER PARKER IS DEAD!"" and trying to play off like it wasn't in an alternate reality that had zero baring on their main continuity.   Marvel was 100% trying to pander to people who were crying about their lack of diversity. As a result of all those awful news articles, we had people who were completely removed from and had nothing to do with the the comic subculture giving their opinions on something they had no idea about. Marvel was just creating controversy for controversy's sake. Because controversy sells.  And sure enough, those first few Miles appearances sold like hot cakes. Which, just most (not all, but most) legacy characters, was preceded by the character quickly dropped in sales. Currently, his solo book doesn't even break the top 100 sold comics each month.  I have no doubt in my mind that Spider-Man #1 will sell a buttload, because first issues always do (that's the reason Marvel and DC like to renumber their books so often, it gives new readers a jumping on point). By issue #4 or 5, no one will care and sales will plummet."

Spiderman,3a8imr,pseudomucho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"I am in no means an expert on the subject but here's what I've gathered in my time exploring Mego. First off all the condition of the costume and the joints on the figure is key, for example if he has his little metal clasp on the back that defiantly increases value. Also if he has metal wrist he has a type 1 body which can increase value. The box defiantly increases value and a mint box can be worth hundreds and a sealed thousands. Really it's the combination of a complete figure, figure condition, and a decent box that adds value, and for what you have for $80 sounds like a pretty solid deal."

Spiderman,3a2cn6,moralless,-3,Tue Jun 16 19:28:23 2015 UTC,Well because he is not in the running for the role.
Spiderman,3a2cn6,Expired_Bacon,11,Tue Jun 16 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Says who though, exactly?   Almost everything we see is rumor or speculation. There are very few things that are confirmed. From Feige's mouth, we know that Marvel and Sony are casting together, that Spider-Man will be Peter Parker and a teenager, and we will explore his early years, skipping the origin. A suit is designed, and Spider-Man is set to appear in an MCU movie before he has his solo film. That's really it. As far as I know, the first actor to really comment on this is Chandler Riggs, and all he said was that he auditioned months ago, but didn't get the role. So I'm curious as to what you're citing that's said Dylan O'Brien isn't in the running."
Spiderman,3a2cn6,moralless,7,Tue Jun 16 21:37:08 2015 UTC,We know he wasn't announced to be in the running. Ben Affleck wasn't announced to be in the running for Batman.
Spiderman,3a2cn6,karpinskijd,3,Tue Jun 16 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"The short lists And running announcements were likely never intended to be accurate anyway.   The reason I see them making those shortlists and running announcements is likely so they can gauge public reaction and give them a general idea of what they're looking for.   I can see them wanting to get people talking on social media and whatnot and see what names get thrown out there. Then they can see who is popular and who is not.   O'Brien might even still be in the running and they are using the shortlist announcements to create pressure on him so he will not drive up his asking price due to his popularity.   They can also be testing fallback options, and can be seen if their preferred choices hold up to newcomers in the public opinion."

Spiderman,3a3d2d,pseudomucho,17,Tue Jun 16 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"I would definitely hope so. It seems wherever you go people always praise Sam Raim/Tobey Maguire for portraying nerdy, dopey, bad at everything Peter Parker. That's all well and good, except that's not really who Peter Parker is (at least, in my eyes). Yes, he has that Parker luck that brings bad things his way, but Peter begins to really excel on the whole once he becomes Spider-Man. He isn't perfect, but he gains confidence, he goes to school and impresses and dates girls (hell, he impresses A LOT of girls really). He must be an attractive and charming guy to get people like Liz Allan, Betty Brant, and Gwen Stacy going his way, and that's all in the very, very beginning of his story. He makes friends and gets a job where his work is needed. This idea of needing to have Peter this ugly, rejected nerd throughout the movies is pretty inaccurate.  I really hope Marvel can be the group to help get Peter's personality right. I thought (other issues aside) The Amazing Spider-Man series did a better job on the whole getting his behavior right, but it was not perfect."
Spiderman,3a3d2d,moralless,5,Tue Jun 16 22:57:10 2015 UTC,"This is what I tell people as well. People are always saying Maguire is a better Peter while Garfield is a better Spider-Man, which I disagree with. Like you said, Peter does have confidence and gets the attention of ladies. He's pretty outgoing and makes jokes. He gets angry, he yells, he says stuff he shouldn't, but he's human. Maguire just has this quiet, whisper-like voice most of the time, and I get he's trying to go for ""shy and nerdy"" but like you said, Peter is supposed to come out of his shell. At least Garfield's Peter comes off more as a regular teenager and is closer to Ultimate Peter Parker (which the Amazing Spider-Man movies were based on anyway)."
Spiderman,3a3d2d,JoragaWarcaller,2,Wed Jun 17 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I think they need to realise is that he has three personas - Peter Parker, Peter's/Spidey's thoughts and Spiderman. Everything you mentioned is true (I am still trying to get TAS as it was my favourite Spidey but I enjoyed SS too recently). If they can incorporate a balance between this bad-luck/shy but intelligent guy, his inner-turmoil and doubts as well as his sarcastic smart-ass(ness) while wearing the suit all at once they'll have him down."
Spiderman,3a3d2d,Xirious,2,Wed Jun 17 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is he was a sixties nerd. Being a geek these days is more a sort of Scott-Pilgrimy emo akwardness rather than a likes-science-and-is-clever-but-rejected-by-the-swinging-60s-kids type of thing. Unless someone is brave enough to actually set a super hero movie in the silver age where they should be Peter Parker is always going to be different as a millenial. A further hindrance is lack of time. The films generally show the start of his career, as in the first two or three villains that try to fuck his shit up. If you look at the comics, Peter was still a nerd after his whole damn roster was established. The type of character evolution fans of the old comics want is not really possible in film format.       It seems clear to me that an HBO style long running series would be a much better way to do Spider-Man correctly, but of course then you have the problem of budgeting the action sequences."
Spiderman,3a3d2d,Sitnalta,2,Sat Jun 20 02:00:39 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, man. His story, starting out as a comic, would be served much better if it were told in an episodic format. But there are two huge problems with that, which are the budget (web swinging, all the stunts, and the crazy amount of cgi would drive prices to most likely unprecedented levels), as well as the popularity the Spider-Man name bears. He's too big of a hero to be ""reduced to TV"" when they could make movies and get more viewers and so much more money. From a business standpoint, a show makes no sense. As long as he's popular, the movies will always take precedence, leaving the TV to bear the child-friendly and watered down animated content."
Spiderman,3a3d2d,moralless,3,Sat Jun 20 06:14:17 2015 UTC,"The way I think about it, Peter Parker is basically that guy. He never really talks to anybody. And when he does, it's usually the type of one-sided conversation where he just shuts up and listens and the other person does the talking. The guy might have interesting subjects he could bring up, but he's too riddled with anxiety to really do it. So he just comes off as boring or uninteresting/freaky.  He doesn't really have any friends, aside one or two people. In a high school setting, he's the loneliest guy in the class. Everyone else sees him as a weirdo. And the only real time he's really himself is on the way home. Everyone is kinda worried he'll snap one day and bring a gun to school because the louder guys always tease him/pick on him. This is all pre-spider bite though. After he gets his powers, he gets insane amounts of confidence. But even if he gets more guts to open his mouth, his reputation is still mostly the same because after the bite, he doesn't really have any time left for a social life  Spider-Man on the other hand is a loud-mouthed jerk. Not a mean person. But he's tell you what he thinks of you in your face. He's very cocky and over-confident. Hilarious at times, even. Just because of his blatant carefree attitude of what you think of him, which makes you love to hate him! He's a thrill-ride adventurer with a rockstar attitude. And he's everywhere. All the time. It's like the dude doesn't sleep.   Basically like this: Peter Parker is George McFly, Spidey is Marty McFly"
Spiderman,3a3d2d,RestlessCreation,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"He was pretty nerdy for the first 38 issues in which he had powers. It wasn't until John Romita took over that he became good looking, muscular, popular, and kind of an average joe"
Spiderman,3a3d2d,BeardWonder,0,Wed Jun 17 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but Andrew Garfield played an AMAZING(heh) Spider-Man, but not an amazing Peter Parker, and it's not his fault it was the writers and the direction they were taking those films.   When Peter Parker walks in a room, 9/10 girls don't drop their panties for him, and that's what the Webb movies had wrong.   There is,  like you pointed out, what some people call that 'Peter Parker Charm', but that doesn't appear till after the spider bite.   Hopefully we see this done by right in the MCU"

Stop fucking including worthless villains like Rhino and Electro. Now it's Vulture and Sandman? Add the thrilling ones! Kraven, Venom, Carnage, Green-Goblin, Hobgoblin, Mysterio. Please don't cast a teen actor as Spider-Man, PLEASE. Feature his real powers. In AS1, he gets shot by a bullet. The hell? What kind of super-hero gets shot by a bullet? Especially one that has a power (spider-sense) designed to avoid stuff like that."
Spiderman,3a3d2d,oscardeleo,-2,Wed Jun 17 19:01:38 2015 UTC,I'm just scared for his future because it seems Sony is fighting Marvel on casting choices and if they fuck up Spidey that'll kind of be it for me. But I guess if they fuck up Peter they'll still have Miles to fall back on.
Spiderman,3a3foh,jakemufcfan,4,Tue Jun 16 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see a crossover like that happening, really. None of the heroes have been in the shows so far, because Marvel doesn't want the shows to influence the movies as much as the movies influence the shows. They want to keep it a one way street, it seems, to make it easier on the film-going audiences."
Spiderman,3a3foh,moralless,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:01:10 2015 UTC,It could be cool though and I mean I'm pretty sure the obelisk is a symbiote so Gemma Simmons could become the MCU scorn
Spiderman,3a3foh,moralless,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:02:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, no doubt it would be very cool. I'd personally love for more crossovers to start happening, incorporating show characters into the movies and movie characters into the shows. This is exactly the kind of stuff I would hope to see. I'm just not sure Marvel is on the same page as us, because we are a very hardcore audience and it's hard for them to cater to us while pleasing the mainstream.  I for one, would kill to get Ben Urich from Daredevil into the MCU Spider-Man film as a reporter."

Spiderman,3a3foh,kiekan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:42:08 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the obelisk is a symbiote   Its not. Jiaying blatantly says its an ancient Kree artifact. Its far more likely to be something like a Celestial Monolith or even an actual Inhuman (Eldrac the Door seems like a pretty good possibility and ties right into the Inhumans plot happening right now in the show.)
Spiderman,3a3foh,kiekan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"how do you want a crossover to happen    You're acting like this is a sure fire thing. Its not likely to happen. As /u/moralless said, the Marvel tv series takes a back seat to their film offerings. In the off chance that Spider-Man does show up in Agents of SHIELD (something I think is pretty unlikely, if not just from a licensing stand point. Remember, Sony still holds the Spider-Man license, Marvel is just allowed to use the character in approved situations), it'll just be a short cameo.   also thoughts on the obelisk from shield is it a symbiote like many including myself believe    Its not a symbiote. They flat out said its a Kree artifact."
Spiderman,3a3foh,kiekan,0,Wed Jun 17 12:31:16 2015 UTC,they said it was of Kree origin so it could be a symbiote captured by the Kree and used to kill in humans how it swallowed Simmons up was similar to a symbiote anyways though what about spider woman Jessica Drew has always been a character associated with shield so maybe she could show up
Spiderman,3a3foh,TheTaoOfBill,2,Wed Jun 17 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, first off: Punctuation. It helps if you use it.   of Kree origin  could be a symbiote captured by the Kree and used to kill in humans   Symbiotes are not of Kree origin. Nor do they have anything to do with the Kree history in general.  They also have nothing to do with Inhumans. It would be a completely random plot device that has zero context or reason.  Additionally, the device in the carrier resembles a symbiote in no way. Symbiotes don't shift back and fourth between rocks and liquids.  See the links I gave here for stuff that is far more likely for the Kree device to be. Stuff that actually makes sense.   how it swallowed Simmons up was similar to a symbiote    How? It wasn't anything like a symbiote. Symbiotes don't cocoon people, they act as clothing.  Something else to consider: symbiotes are tied to the Spider-Man license, which Sony still holds the rights to. Marvel can only use symbiotes if Sony allows them to.   anyways though what about spider woman Jessica Drew has always been a character associated with shield so maybe she could show up    Are you trying to say that Simmons is going to become Jessica Drew? If so, I can 100% guarantee that will not ever happen. If not just for the fact that Simmons and Jessica Drew are not the same character in the comics. In fact, they meet each other in the SHIELD comic series. This theory is really reaching. Spider-Woman also has nothing to do with symbiotes or Kree."

Spiderman,39z3ty,ketsugi,3,Tue Jun 16 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite villains as well. My favorite story is when Spot comes back after being supposedly dead, I think it's the issue that this cover is from. He fights Spider-Man with stronger, more competent abilities, eventually handing Spider-Man a note. The comic then shows what happened to him and basically says he was trapped in the pocket dimension he creates and it drive him insane. It was a great, tragic story. Then it cuts back to Spider-Man holding the note which is just written in various dots. So Spider-Man couldn't read it and had no idea what happened to Spot."

Spiderman,39us11,JoragaWarcaller,3,Sun Jun 14 23:31:30 2015 UTC,from what Bendis has been saying Ultimate End is VERY essential to what's going to happen to Miles....it is the last Ultimate Universe story and in future issues we'll find out a lot of things that so far we only have questions to like we don't actually know that these aren't the actual 616 characters yet...to us logic would state that they aren't because we've seen them in Secret Wars but Bendis says that there's answers to come....I for one am not jumping to conclusions just yet
Spiderman,39us11,danhimself36,2,Mon Jun 15 04:10:46 2015 UTC,Spider verse took place one day before peters return and as for ultimate end it features altered versions of 616 and 1610 characters whilst the 616 survivors and miles morales are in the main secret wars book
Spiderman,39us11,jakemufcfan,2,Mon Jun 15 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Spider-Verse occurred right before the latest Miles Morales series.  Ultimate End is something I recommend you read if you are interested in the ultimate universe. While I have no way of knowing, it will probably provide some sense of closure for the Ultimate Universe.  You should also know that the characters in Ultimate End are NOT the real versions, but alternate versions. The ""real"" Miles Morales (and 616 Peter Parker) are actually in the main Secret Wars book.  TL;DR - you should get it."
Spiderman,39us11,darklordx123,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:24:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses. If the story is good enough I'll read it, but if it's not essential, maybe I'll wait to read it on Marvel Unlimited. To be honest, having the Secret Wars tie-ins not be about the main versions of the characters makes me not care about them as much. Renew Your Vows is an interesting story, but it doesn't have the same impact on me."
Spiderman,39vq2e,WingsDeluxe,2,Mon Jun 15 04:45:49 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, as the upcoming MCU reboot would suggest, I think forgoing the origin story is more than acceptable. Everyone (and especially everyone who would watch a web series) knows the story backwards and forwards. If there's any part that ends up being pertinent to YOUR version of the story, you could always tell it through flashback later on. Otherwise, you just begin with your Spider-Man fighting crime in New York and it's as simple as that.  As it's low budget, it's hard to imagine super cgi heavy villains like the goblin or doc Ock done well. But that doesn't mean there aren't other villains that could be done well. You could explore incorporating people like Daredevil, Iron Fist, Electra, Black Cat, Moon Knight, Kingpin, Hammerhead, etc. Badass street level heroes and villains that all could easily be done with minimal effects, and their abilities  (and combat skills) would match up well against a street Spider Man, and make for a very entertaining a watch. So, when it comes to a web series, I'd have to say keeping it grounded and street level is your best bet.  As for costume, I really have to say I love Bagley's Ultimate Spider-Man with the large, white, expressive eyes. But there's many great suits out there, as long as it's true to at least some incarnation in the comic books I'm sure fans would respond well. It might also be cool to see an on going struggle with the black suit for a story arc. I feel that Spider-Man 3 didn't do justice to the black suit at all.  And finally, just as a question of personal interest - Where would this web series be shot? Where are you located?"
Spiderman,39vq2e,moralless,2,Mon Jun 15 08:21:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've certainly been reading up on more ground level villains that we could incorporate more easily than bigger guys. And, we're actually located in Minnesota. As crazy as that might sound, considering there aren't a ton of huge cities. I have access to some places in Minneapolis and St. Paul that I can use. I live in a small town located outside the city so I feel that it MIGHT be suitable? If we get to shooting this thing, we'll test out different areas and locations to fit. Thank you for the input!"
Spiderman,39vq2e,bat-reddit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:11:10 2015 UTC,Are you going to be able to do any cgi at all? I'm just wondering before I suggest villains.

Spiderman,39uibp,ForcibleKnight,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:19:35 2015 UTC,nope that was one of my main inspirations as I feel that spectacular Spider-Man is the best adaptation of Spider-Man yet so I took some inspirations from that and the original comic run and I little from the Ultimate universe
Spiderman,39uibp,ForcibleKnight,2,Mon Jun 15 00:21:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I just saw the similarities is all. But my only complaints are that u seem to have shoved a lot of villains in (as that has shown to kill past Spidey movies, and the love interests."
Spiderman,39uibp,ForcibleKnight,2,Mon Jun 15 00:32:11 2015 UTC,"But other than that, good plot layout."
Spiderman,39uibp,ForcibleKnight,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:32:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I get the lots of villains thing but the reasons they killed those movies is they get clogged with back stories which many spidey villains like sandman and rhino just don't have and what about the love interests I thought about using Liz Allen as she's well a different character to use but I can see why some people wouldn't be to keen on her
Spiderman,39uibp,ForcibleKnight,2,Mon Jun 15 00:34:49 2015 UTC,"Hopefully marvel have learned from Sony not to make that mistake, and yeah Liz hasn't been very popular in and out of the comics, but maybe the big screen can change that"
Spiderman,39uibp,ForcibleKnight,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:41:40 2015 UTC,I agree plus marvel has no trouble of just throwing villains in look at Batroc in captain America winter soldier and It would be nice to see someone else other than Gwen and Mary Jane gain prominence but I suspect that Mary Jane will be the films love interest
Spiderman,39uibp,Mike5482,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"I have high hopes that they will get Mary Jane right as in the Sam raimi films, she was just a damsel in distress and nothing more."
Spiderman,39uibp,Mike5482,2,Mon Jun 15 00:47:38 2015 UTC,And you're right about Marvel and their knowledge of villain use.

Spiderman,39qbu1,Apple_Joel,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:46:08 2015 UTC,Teared up there at the end. The little reference to the original video got me there. Plus we got us a peek at a real Spider-UK! Over all it was done really freaking good. I loved it.
Spiderman,39q3fc,Sharblebard,12,Sat Jun 13 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"(eyes widen)  (clears throat)  (pulls out podium and shuffles cue cards)  I'm glad you fucking asked.  Ultimate Spider-Man is one of the most perfectly crafted comic book stories of the 21st century. Right along up there with JMS' run on Amazing, Ultimate Spider-Man created the version of Peter Parker that we all know and love. It is the version that Andy Garfield tried(and failed) to portray. It is the version that Dan Slott tried(and failed) to portray in Amazing. It is the perfect example of a real life Peter Parker, given powers, suffering tragedy, and trying to help other people.  I cannot emphasize this enough. Fuck the rest of the Ultimate U, but GET THE ENTIRE ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN SERIES. That's my goal. 'Bout halfway there.   And don't stop with his death. Miles Morales is definitely a worthy successor to the title."
Spiderman,39q3fc,TheopholosWhenntooda,2,Sun Jun 14 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"Lol it's great to see so many people giving such passionate answers and my just black and white ""yes"" or ""no"". You've all convinced me to get the first volume. I'll always love and read 616 Peter to be sure, but there is room in my heart for another. I'm also glad you specified to keep reading into Miles. That seems to be the only thing fans of the Ultimate universe disagree on. Now that the Ultimate universe is over(?) it makes it way easier to get the entire story, and not worry about current issues like I do with Amazing. Thanks again!"
Spiderman,39q3fc,TheopholosWhenntooda,2,Sun Jun 14 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. You can thank me later after you've read the series. I've been lucky enough to read the entire series, even if I don't own it all... yet."
Spiderman,39q3fc,Zsaber,13,Sun Jun 14 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"Ultimate spiderman (Peter parker) is my favourite version of spiderman. It's such a well crafted story and world and it shows more than just his hero antics, but also his school life and everything. Definitely my favourite take on Peter parker. Worth the read. Has some of the craziest story arcs. And also because ultimate isn't the main marvel universe they can try different things and it works. Heroes die and stay dead. People lives get ruined and it's permanent, not everything gets reset to keep everyone happy.  Many people don't like ultimatum, I loved it because it was so crazy. The whole ultimate world keeps happening and parts of it flow into Peter parkers life and you see how he often has no idea what's happening, but because his heart is in the right place he is out there kicking ass. Read it! Worth it!"
Spiderman,39q3fc,Zsaber,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure my heart will always be with 616 Peter, he was my first after all. But I'll definitely buy it and try it out! Thank you for the recommendation!"
Spiderman,39q3fc,VilifiedMercy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:46:13 2015 UTC,Yeah 616 was my first. And the back in black arc after civil war was awesome for me! But ultimate stole the top spot for me just from how the story unfolds! But yeah enjoy it!
Spiderman,39q3fc,curious_skeptic,6,Mon Jun 15 17:36:32 2015 UTC,"I was in your boat about two years ago. Then I started the series and binged it in a couple months. To this day it's one of my favorite series and absolute favorite version of Spider-man. There are few series that I legitimately can't wait for a re-read, but I already feel the hankering for another one.   Yeah, it's good."
Spiderman,39q3fc,jsfights,2,Sat Jun 13 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"It's a really fun story, very good."
Spiderman,39q3fc,Dumebuggy,2,Sun Jun 14 00:23:40 2015 UTC,Very much so. It's actually my favorite Spidey series and I'm my opinion Bendis' best work
Spiderman,39q3fc,0gre_L0rd,2,Sun Jun 14 00:26:45 2015 UTC,"do it. It's SOOOO worth it.  Ultimate Spider-Man was the first series of comics I actually read.  To this day it's still my favourite.  Peter is just portrayed so well, and it's such great read."
Spiderman,39q3fc,danhimself36,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"You are going to love it. Bendis did an incredible job developing the entire cast of Spider-Man and taking things in new and interesting directions. I think that the most impressive aspect of the run is how Bendis managed to pivot around stupid ""events"" that affected the whole range and stay true to his vision.  The pace is much slower than 616, which is why the series thrives in a trade format. You'll see that all of the characters have time to live and breathe, making them feel like real people (even Jameson!)."
Spiderman,39q3fc,0gre_L0rd,0,Sun Jun 14 14:02:50 2015 UTC,It is a phenomenal series just stop right before the death of spider-man event.
Spiderman,39okm9,Moist_Vanguard,6,Sat Jun 13 06:57:58 2015 UTC,"Took a bit to click together. I thought you meant it foreshadowed renew your vows, but then I realised it was about Peter and MJ running away together"

Spiderman,39okm9,Sharblebard,2,Sat Jun 13 08:11:37 2015 UTC,Oh my.  Connected to the Renew Your Vows series?
Spiderman,39okm9,ryckae,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:17:47 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing! I could see the 1610 Peter and MJ being the new them full time!
Spiderman,39okm9,G4RB4G3M4N,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:42:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I absolutely hated that they brought him back. I thought he was given a beautiful hero's death made even better by the fact that it would be permanent. His passing made Miles have and even stronger motivation to take up the mantle and it really helped drive the book for me. That being said, this makes it a little better."
Spiderman,39okm9,Mastercheese274,0,Sun Jun 14 06:20:39 2015 UTC,I think it made miles a stronger character it was like the superior Spider-Man run being designed to prove Peter was the superior Spider-Man his return showed miles that he had become a worthy successor plus it gave at least one Peter Parker a happy ending ( until the incursions destroyed his world but according to bend is we'll be seeing ultimate Peter very soon
Spiderman,39pzg3,AvengeSp,2,Sat Jun 13 16:59:16 2015 UTC,"Well the series can be considered on a hiatus for a while due to Secret Wars. The story will continue, but I don't know if they ever rename it into The Amazing Spider-Man #1 or continue with #19"
Spiderman,39pzg3,SengalBoy,2,Sat Jun 13 17:32:54 2015 UTC,So there's nothing I can get to keep reading 616? /: what's renew vows? I haven't really looked into it
Spiderman,39pzg3,darklordx123,2,Sat Jun 13 19:08:53 2015 UTC,"Renew Your Vows is sort of a ""what if"" of if Peter and Mary Jane remained together (except it isn't).  It is a series a lot of Spider-Man fans have been waiting for since One More Day.  It is about a world where Peter remained with Mary Jane, and they had a child together. The importance of this story is that it will actually shape the future of the All New All Different Marvel Universe after Secret Wars.  If Marvel wants, they can bring elements from this story into the main continuity if they want to.  I suggest you buy it if you are a Spider-Man fan."
Spiderman,39pzg3,SengalBoy,2,Mon Jun 15 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"If you're a fan of Peter and MJ's relationship, Renew Your Vows is definitely for you. It's a What-If story about what happened if OMD never happened."

Spiderman,39odj2,Sharblebard,3,Sat Jun 13 05:33:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's really far back before Superior, but Brand New Day is a solid place to start off for new readers. I started there when I first started really getting into Spider-Man comics."
Spiderman,39odj2,Sparky-Man,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"I know it's way off, but I tend to binge read comics so I'm wanting a lot. And with secret wars kind of being a snore, I've got plenty of time and money to get it all. Thanks a ton for the advice though!"
Spiderman,39odj2,Spider-Nerd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:44:44 2015 UTC,I started with One More Day cause it just gives a bit of backstory as to how a bunch of stuff happened but you can start with either. Plus if you've read lots of old spidey then you'll hate how it all happened.
Spiderman,39odj2,Spider-Nerd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, everything I hear makes it seem like One More Day is going to make me more angry than it's worth. I'll just start with Brand New and read up to Dying Wish. Thanks though!"
Spiderman,39odj2,darklordx123,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:37:00 2015 UTC,I'd never read any Spidey prior to it so it was good to get a little Civil War knowledge in but yeah not worth the anger or the feels
Spiderman,39odj2,Spider-Nerd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:47:21 2015 UTC,"While you may want to start there to get more of a feel for the character, I just can't let you walk away without recommending JMS' run on Spider-Man.  It did give us the horrors of One More Day, it also gave us some of the greatest modern Spidey stories."
Spiderman,39odj2,bolognahole,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:17:54 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely check out JMS' stuff. They're great
Spiderman,39odj2,bolognahole,2,Mon Jun 15 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"It's a good starting point for the current status quo. But if you ever get the chance, you should read the full Amazing run from the 60's. There are a lot of great stories, especially in the 70's and 80's."

It's best to become familiar with the original classic version of the character before reading the modern re-imaginings like ""Ultimate Spider-Man""."

Original story run was written from 2000 to 2011, introducing a new Spider-Man around that time, Miles Morales. Unlike many comics, it's managed to have one writer throughout the entire series, Brian Michael Bendis. This comic has great artwork and a fantastic, classic Spidey story.  Very approachable story to start the comics with."

Spiderman,39nny3,rockfan7777,3,Sat Jun 13 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"Man I wrote this post and realized you were asking about ""Amazing"" Spider-Man games   Playstation 1 ones (all of them): Not open world, very fun games as I remember them. Lots of costumes. Levels aren't similar lots of variety Spider-Man 2 (PS2): Best Web Slinging, (rest of the gameplay isn't that bad either) with upgrades you get sooo fast and with skill you'll pull very satisfying moves Ultimate Spider-Man: Overall really good game, good campaign, good combat, good web slinging Web of Shadows: Nice variety of combat moves with cool effects, God of War of Spider-Man games   I didn't like TASM and SD because of poor web slinging, I heard their sequels are better on that aspect"
Spiderman,39nny3,needo2reddit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:58:47 2015 UTC,Ultimate Spider-Man and web of shadows are in my opinion the best but my favourites are the ps1 games it's true what they say about nostalgia and one that's often overlooked the 360 version of Spider-Man 3 is pretty good and it has most of the movies voice cast and has a much better story than the movie ( for example Peter and mj don't break up she just convinces him the suit is bad and sandman only helps venom because he kidnaps his daughter)
Spiderman,39nny3,jakemufcfan,2,Mon Jun 15 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"The second one has better web swinging and side missions, Hero or Menace system aside, but the first one had a better story and overall gameplay."

It's basically a re-skinned Spider-Man 2. The actual game is fantastic and the story is amazing and actually canon to the comics, which is pretty nice. Bendis actually wrote it and everything. It's pretty rad."

Spiderman,39lzic,Radx_Konkin75,2,Fri Jun 12 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. Sony exec's get final say on matters Spidey related, if there were to be a disagreement between the two.

Spiderman,39jzsj,bat-reddit,2,Fri Jun 12 14:22:09 2015 UTC,I would be happy if they did a credit scene with Spiderman spying on Fisk from one of the high windows of his building. All the while kingpin is talking about killing Murdock.

Spiderman,39jzsj,Iokuas,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty easily, I think. Your idea would defo work. But the way I'd do it is, the Kingpin never goes away. He does. But not really. He still very much controls the entire crime scene in the city. He just nicely does out of a (very luxorious) jail cell. Matt Murdock knows of this, obviously. He would've caught on eventually. So he does the only thing he can do. Stop Fisk's lackeys. The Spider-Man movie ties in the 3rs Season of DareDevil, much like The Flash and Arrow are connected at the CW. Eventually, Spider-Man, who would appear in both his own movie, duh, and DareDevil, would team-up with Matt. Meanwhile, Fisk would've hired two assassins to take care of them both. The assassins would also appear in the show. Kraven would be mostly featured in Spidey's movies, and Elektra in the show."
Spiderman,39jzsj,RestlessCreation,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:09:38 2015 UTC,"The movie obviously will have a ""main villain"" who Spidey defeats and hopefully sends him to prison.  In the post credit scene, show the villain and then pan to the next cell showing the Kingpin"
Spiderman,39jzsj,SuckaFreeBaust,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:15:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, except maybe as an easter egg. The MCU's Fisk is so dark and brutal that I can't imagine Spider-Man directly appearing with him.

New Warriors got cancelled way back in November.   but at this point, aren't some of them like Kaine and Speedball much older than the ""newest"" New Warriors?   While the New Warriors started off as a teen team, they haven't been teens for a very long time. Age is pretty irrelevant at this point. Otherwise, nearly all the members wouldn't be apart of the team.  Instead of being a team of teens, the New Warriors are basically just Avengers-Lite. Its been that way for a really long time, too. Since the days when Darkhawk, Rage and Silhouette were members of the team, back in the mid-90's.   but it looks like they've been de-aging Kaine to be on par with Peter, who's back to being like 20-something.   Going by what I was saying before, Kaine's age is entirely irrelevant.  Having said that, how precise do you want to be? Because technically Kaine is only like six or seven years old (if we're using Marvel's sliding timeline), since he was created artificially in a test tube. He would have the body of someone in his mid-20s or 30s. Whatever age Peter is, plus a couple years due to having cellular degeneration pre-Spider Island."
Spiderman,39g2kp,kiekan,4,Thu Jun 11 17:01:33 2015 UTC,I'm sad we never got the reactions of the New Warriors to finding out that Grumpy Uncle Kaine is only like six years old. There would be so much teasing.

Spiderman,39hflz,NazoXIII,7,Thu Jun 11 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"616 Pete is over in the main ""Secret Wars"" book, which leads me to believe that none of the characters in ""Ultimate End"" are the originals from their respective universes."
Spiderman,39hflz,real-Heisennerd,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"We don't exactly know that. In UE#1 it seems to be further in the future than the main SW story, as Pete has worked with Ultimate!JDrew, Bombshell, Cloak and Dagger.   I get the sinking feeling that it takes place in the middle but not before the event is over.   And the whole point of issue #2 seems to be how the Ultimate and Mainstream universes are coping with there being copies, which I love by the way, Ultimate Tony giving up drinking to work to be more inline with Mainstream Superior Iron Man Tony was a nice piece of character development."
Spiderman,39hflz,BaconIsHappiness,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:14:30 2015 UTC,"But that isn't Superior Iron Man Tony, thats Bleeding Edge Armor from the Invincible Iron Man run. Superior doesn't even have a problem with drinking so he wouldn't have cared about 1610 Tony drinking. /u/real-Heisennerd is right, these are just copies, not actually 616 and 1610 characters, because they are all dead save for a few. This explains Peter not remembering the Spider-Men event, Tony not wearing Superior Armor etc."
Spiderman,39hflz,princesspongconsole,3,Tue Jun 16 16:51:46 2015 UTC,I brought up similar questions after I read the first issue and people gave me answers on this thread: https://m.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/36nmp5/very_confused_about_ultimate_end_1_spoilers/ But I wasn't satisfied with the answers.   The worst part is its the same writer (Bendis) ignoring his own and very recent continuity :/ my new theory is that the Peter from Ultimate End is the same Peter from Renew Your Vows so he doesn't remember going to 1610 but that doesn't explain all the other plot holes. It's really bothering me lol
Spiderman,39hflz,PKM_Trainer_Tye,3,Thu Jun 11 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"The characters in the Ultimate End series aren't necessarily from Earths 616 and 1610, but they are all at least based on them. Earth 616 Spider-Man was actually teleported onto Reed Richard's life raft without his knowledge or consent. The one in Ultimate End is similar, but it is only a copy created by Doom and Strange or from a very slightly different alternate universe. Also, the characters in Ultimate End are not all necessarily from the same point in time, ""616"" Iron Man isn't in his superior suit and is still sober, which goes against his recent arc. In Secret Wars #3, Ultimate and 616 Spider-Man meet and remember each other, so there's that as well."
Spiderman,39hflz,PeterParkerWasRight,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"How do we know for sure it's the RNV Peter? I mean, if I'm to look at RNV #1, it's seems like a flashback from before Secret Wars, and there's a noticeable time skip by the end of RNV 1, that Pete isn't spiderman by the time the multiverse was shattered.   So how can that be possible."
Spiderman,39hflz,PeterParkerWasRight,3,Thu Jun 11 22:06:41 2015 UTC,Why are you looking at it as a flashback instead of another section of Battleworld like Inferno or Hala Field?
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"Because in the beginning, Annie is an infant, and by the last page, she's at least 5 or 6, that would mean time flows differently in that particular segment of the world, than anywhere else, which is weird, but possible.   I just see it as Peter telling a story about how he quit being spidey in that issue, and now the rest of the issues will be present day, and along side the rest of secret wars.

Well, you have to also remember that Battleworld is a patchwork universe, constructed of segments of different universes. Its already weird. For all we know, the physics and rules of each territory are entirely different, including the passage of time.  Either that, or its just Slott being Slott. He has a really bad habit of just ignoring completely what other writers are doing in an event (even if its his own event, just look at all the contradictory stuff in Spider-Verse) and doing whatever he wants."
Spiderman,39hflz,PKM_Trainer_Tye,2,Fri Jun 12 11:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is true, I mean, we've got 2099 happening concurrently with modern universes like Mainstream and Ultimate, so time and space may very well be flowing differently.   Weird of Slott not finding some way to screw Pete over during that time skip, he's good for stuff like that."
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,3,Fri Jun 12 13:07:24 2015 UTC,"The Spider-Man in Ultimate End, the one that appeared in Secret Wars 3, and the one in Renew Your Vows are all different. Each are in a different part of Battleworld, and therefore going through different things. You can tell RNV Peter is from a different universe due to the fact that he is married and has a child, the design of some of the heroes is different, he has never been an avenger, and the team itself is made up of people that weren't part of the regular avengers team before the incursions. Hopefully this all makes sense.  EDIT: The time skip with his kid as far as we know happens in Battleworld. Something like three or five years have passed between Secret Wars #1 and #3. And even if it didn't, he's still a different Spider-Man, the transition from pre to post-Battleworld just wasn't observed in the comic."
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I get that their all different, But the whole point of UE #2 seems to have a 616/1610 vibe, with all the characters meeting with their other universe counterparts, and for that it did well, I loved the interactions between the two Tony's most of all.  But the thing with Peter/Spidey in UE, he's still Spidey, whereas at the end of RNV, Pete has as far as we know hung up his webs, so to speak (But as there are about, what 3 more Issues of RNV, thats gonna change). I got the feeling it was 616 Pete until Battleworld or something else proves it otherwise.  And that's what I'm saying about the pre and post timeskip stuff, I feel like the Pre-Timeskip stuff happened before battleworld, and now the post TS stuff will cover how this pete is taking all the craziness that's happened. I just don't feel like that was the Pete from RNV or some new pete that wasn't introduced until UE #2, just given the context."

It shows exactly what happens to Earth 616 Peter so we know without a doubt that he is neither RNV or Ultimate End Peter. The reason we know the Peter in Ultimate End isn't our Peter is because he shows no memory of surviving the incursions, when we know for a fact he is aware of them because he was teleported onto Reed's life raft. Also, look at the other heroes in Ultimate End and Renew Your Vows. They have different costumes, personalities, and different rosters, so we know they aren't the same. The reason they all feel like the same Peter is because they're supposed to. Bendis wanted to write what would happen if a Peter just like 616 was in Ultimate End so he did, and Slott wanted to write what would happen if a Peter just like 616 pre One More Day was in Renew Your Vows so he did."
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"Wait, I wasn't saying RNV!Pete and 616!Pete are the same, sorry if It came out that way. I also, didn't know there was a third peter, but you did bring up a good point, he doesn't remember about the Incursion or the raft. But it did just seem like the whole issue was about 616 Meets 1610, thats just the vibe I got, but there are a couple of inconsistencies.  I don't get why they wanted to make a Peter exclusive to UE, but I'll buy it. Kind of takes away from the whole 1610 meets 616 vibe though, but it still works."
Spiderman,39hflz,PKM_Trainer_Tye,2,Fri Jun 12 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"Aright my mistake, I understand now. And yeah, some people are kind of miffed by the lack of explanation and general confusion surrounding Ultimate End. It supposed to give off that vibe without actually being the vibe as far as we can tell. Was there anything else you're not sure on?"
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"Nope, I just want there to be some kind of Explanation from Bendis as to why he wants to play so close to 1610 and 616 and then toss a big ""Gotcha"" in our faces.  The whole thing just seems weird without a prior explanation, so I guess I just gotta wait for the gotcha, where Bendis reveals that this is Earth 61610 a completely different continuity."
Spiderman,39hflz,PKM_Trainer_Tye,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"But it did just seem like the whole issue was about 616 Meets 1610, thats just the vibe I got, but there are a couple of inconsistencies.   In Secret Wars #3 Strange tells the crew on the Raft that Doom saved or recreated what was missing, with Strange's help on the stuff he couldn't remember. Its entirely possible that since 616 Peter is on the raft and missing that Doom and Strange created a construct to fill that void in Battleworld."
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,2,Fri Jun 12 11:17:41 2015 UTC,"This is news to me, and it fills in those blanks,  So this essentially means that all the segments of battle world, are made of of what Doom and Strange remember about the multiverse? Such a simple answer makes all the difference."
Spiderman,39hflz,SlumdogSeacrestLaw,2,Fri Jun 12 12:55:31 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no.   Doom and Strange saved all the parts of the actual multiverse they could. But since they couldn't get everything, they filled in the gaps from memory. And I'm sure that neither Doom nor Strange have visited or are super familiar with every AU. As a result, there are going to be lots of things that differ from how they were originally. Its unclear as to the ratio of original and created stuff in Battleworld yet.   I'd guess that there is a good mix of territories that are pretty accurate to how they were pre-Battleworld, as Doom and Strange were able to salvage lots of it and territories that are entire constructs created by Doom and everything in between.  100% speculation on my part: Its entirely possible that the entire 616 and 1610 universes in Ultimate End (minus their respective refugees who survived via the life rafts) were completely wiped out during the incursion in Secret War #1. But because both Doom and Strange had some exposure to both realities, they just created what they remember.   We just don't know what is original or newly created at this point. Which is made harder to decipher by the fact that Doom and Strange wiped the minds of everyone in Battleworld (regardless of territory) and implanted memories that make Battleworld's inhabitants think that they have always existed on Battleworld.  The only people we know for sure are immune to the mind wipe (aside from Doom and Strange, themselves) are:   616 Spider-Man 616 Reed Richards 616 Carol Danvers 616 Scott Summers 616 Peter Quill 616 T'Challa 616 Namor 616 Thanos 616 Terrax Black Swan (a survivor from some other unknown universe) 1610 Reed Richards (The Maker) 1610 Miles Morales   As of Secret Wars #3, the above are all confirmed. There may be a few more, like Manifold (since we saw him on the life raft in SW #1), as the series goes on. 616 Owen Reece (Molecule Man) may or may not remember, we don't know."
Spiderman,39hflz,StolenHam,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"What happened to Molecule Man? I didn't recall seeing him on Battleword, but he's with Doom and Strange, which would mean that he too survived the destruction."
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"The reason we know the Peter in Ultimate End isn't our Peter is because he shows no memory of surviving the incursions, when we know for a fact he is aware of them because he was teleported onto Reed's life raft.   I'm not disagreeing with anything you're saying. Ultimate End Peter is absolutely not 616 Peter. But I also want to point out that no one in Battleworld remembers the incursions. If you go back to what Strange says when explaining Battleworld to the 616 refugees, he and Doom wiped everyone's mind and implanted memories that make Battleworld's inhabitants think they have always been in Battleworld."
Spiderman,39hflz,kiekan,2,Fri Jun 12 11:20:20 2015 UTC,My reasoning is 616 Peter learned about them in Secret Wars 3 iirc. You are right though.

Kaine first shows up way back in the clone saga (1994's Web of Spider-Man #119 is his first appearance). He runs through the entire clone saga and then is only seen occasionally (he has an appearance in the Raptor story (ASM #608-610) and Grim Hunt for example).  Then he was a big part of Spider-Island, and is renamed Tarantula after by Jackel, after he is unwillingly mutated.  Spider-Island leads directly into the second Scarlet Spider series and that leads right into the most recent volume of New Warriors  He was last seen in the not super great Spider-Verse."

Spiderman,394693,OnBenchNow,5,Tue Jun 9 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"You have few choices depending on what you're looking for:  Ultimate Spider-Man - if you want to start from scratch, enter a world you won't be lost in and don't mind not being familiar with the ""original"" Spidey (616) and what's going on in his world.  Amazing Spider-Man #546 - this is a big reboot, being familiar with the character and maybe just reading a bit about what happened in the story before, in One More Day on wikipedia or something, is enough. It's a bit more reading, over 150 issues but it's very straightforward and quite rewarding as there's quite a few setups for recent stories during Brand New Day.  Amazing Spider-Man #648 - Lot less reading, you'll have to be ok with being confused a bit from the start but it'll get you familiar with modern Spidey stories quite quickly (52 issues from which few stories are quite forgettable, then Superior Spider-Man and new Amazing Spider-Man #1)  Amazing Spider-Man #1 (v3) - most recent reboot, should get you reading the new stuff quickly but you're missing on some great Spidey stories from recent years and might be confused even more."

Then you can read J Michael Strynzskis run from the early 2000s till I think after civil war.  I recommend reading the early Lee/Ditko/Romita stories, the dialogue may be corny for a ton of issues but they get better and better as the years go on and its amazing to see how much foundation was there from the beginning."
Spiderman,393nnu,Inspace96,5,Tue Jun 9 02:09:32 2015 UTC,I too switched from Ultimate to Amazing. I started with the Big Time story arc. Its on the side bar. Its a good start point. The art is great and the story is Peter's life finally getting good. Some things are a little odd to just be thrown into but not so much so that it takes away from the story.  Civil War has a lot of Spider-Man in it. It also introduces you to a lot of the 616 heroes. There is a Amazing Spider-Man tie in trade paper back too.
Spiderman,393nnu,IrishEv,2,Tue Jun 9 01:46:33 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind reading over 150 comic books, I would agree with starting at #546, that was my jumping point couple years ago when I wanted to read modern Spidey and I found Brand New Day stories quite enjoyable, for the most part at least, which then naturally progresses into Slott's run.   I was already reading it weekly when Big Time came out so I'm not entirely sure how good of a jumping point #648 is, but I feel there may be some things that are confusing (Osborns, Aunt May, JJ...) Just make sure you know what happened in One More Day (ugh) and start with #546."

I really hope it's going to be Dylan O'Brien for acting ability reasons, but I'd understand passing on him if they find him too old. Asa is a great choice, and could definitely play high school age for 2-3 film if the rumors of that setting are true. I just couldn't see any of the other names that have been thrown around doing the character justice."

So I guess an anime inspired alternate costume

Spiderman,391601,ItsDannyFields,-1,Tue Jun 9 00:59:16 2015 UTC,I have to agree with Mark - it was fine up to the end. The last issue was a bit crazy.
Spiderman,391601,IAmTheZeke,3,Tue Jun 9 05:29:32 2015 UTC,"He makes the point that JMS has his fingerprints all over OMD up to the very end, and the end is exactly what everyone hates it for.  I loved JMS's run, he understood everything that made Spider-man great, and evolved the character. Made MJ substantial and involved in Peter's dual life rather than say just another person waiting for him at home. She drove parts of the story then.  The reviewer also makes this point. JMS was a great Spider-writer, and for that reason JMS hated what was about to happen to Spider-man. It regressed so much of the story with a wave of an editorial wand. So even if it is JMS all the way until the final issue, it is that final issue that is a black mark on Marvel's permanent record, and it is a problem they keep repeating because we couldn't stop them this time. We wanted to see Peter bounce back and kept buying the comics, so Marvel didn't get punished for this."
Spiderman,390quc,mf7585,4,Mon Jun 8 12:09:49 2015 UTC,There are tons of placed to get custom sized spiderman suits but it depends on what you're looking for.  For a really good price to quality ratio I would go to zentai zentai. Its a website that has a very large selection of superhero costumes primarily of spiderman.  My personal choice would be TheRPCstudio. They are very pricey but the quality is movie like. It will usually run about 400-600 dollars but I highly recommend it.  Anyways I hope this helps.
Spiderman,390quc,planet-MarZ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:29:17 2015 UTC,Have you bought a suit from zentai zentai? I've looked at that website and it seemed like a good deal but wanted to ask someone who had used the site before a couple of questions before I committed.
Spiderman,390quc,moralless,2,Mon Jun 8 15:41:53 2015 UTC,I have! What questions do you have?
Spiderman,390quc,planet-MarZ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Sorry if this is a little long. Here's the exact suit I'm looking at, just to clarify.    Did you have to buy the print file from someone online for the suit, or is the design included when you purchase on Zentai-Zentai? In other words, you didn't have to submit any design, right? It doesn't seem entirely clear to me. I have no prior experience with suits before, so I'm not sure if this is a stupid question, but does the spandex material prevent you from using a touch screen phone (iPhone, android, etc) through the gloves? It would change whether or not add detachable gloves. For Options on the Zentai-Zentai site, it mentions that EVA Chest and Back Spider Logo (detachable) are available for 10 bucks each. Are these some sort of 3d puff that can be used additionally? If I order the suit without these EVA bits, I'll still have the spiders printed on it, right? I don't care much about having 3d parts. Now that you've had the suit for a while, are there any mods that you didn't get that you wish you had? A crotch zipper for bathroom breaks, different back zipper, etc? Are there any of those on your costume you definitely recommend? I'll for sure be getting a detachable hood."
Spiderman,390quc,moralless,2,Mon Jun 8 17:49:20 2015 UTC,They have the print already paid for along with your order  Its difficult but not impossible. I suggest getting forearm zippers so that u can actually use your phone.  U will still have the spider with or with out a chestpeice  I suggest that u limit zippers on the suit. I personaly do not recommend detachable hood. U can just zip your suit down a bit to expose your face.
Spiderman,390quc,planet-MarZ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:00:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, this was super helpful. I actually did think of some more if you have the time. Did you do the attached shoe soles from their website, or did you attach soles yourself? If you used theirs, how were they? And finally, did you get the already attached EVA eyes, or did you attach eyes yourself? If you had Zentai-Zentai attach them, did it turn out okay? I'm worried that if the eyes were messed up I wouldn't be able to fix them because of the glue."
Spiderman,390quc,moralless,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:40:24 2015 UTC,So when it came to ordering mine I did neither if those things but I do know that if u try to use their service on lenses and soles it WILL be hit and miss. I wouldn't risk it  at all and would just bite the bullet and attache it yourself BC its a fair price to pay for it to not turn out perfect. They have tutorials listed on their website if u need help. I ended up wearing actual shoes and a fabric lenses so if I were in your place id get the real deal.
Spiderman,390quc,planet-MarZ,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:32:16 2015 UTC,Perfect. Thanks again for all your help. I'll definitely be going through with ordering it from Zentai-Zentai now.

The second of Maguire's films was absolutely brilliant and the first was really good. Amazing Spider-Man 2 was... Meh. And yes I think he suited the role slightly more but that's just my opinion. I never said Maguire was a bad Spider-Man it's just the films didn't do him enough justice like The Amazing Spider-Man 1 did for Garfield

Spiderman,38wy11,grksmrkle,6,Sun Jun 7 15:20:31 2015 UTC,I liked the humor of Spidey. He's supposed to be a big mouthed buffoon. And the super skinny spider is realistic in that he has unexpected strength for his size.   The editing could be tightened up to get the run time under ten minutes. But overall a spectacular effort.
Spiderman,38wy11,leaf71,2,Mon Jun 8 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"I loved this! It reminded me -so- much of Michael Galusick's channel. He used to make Deadpool fan films that were SO cheap but soooo good. I used to watch them all the time to satisfy my perverted Deadpool needs. Your video is like exactly the same as his ones, only with Spider-Man instead. Make more!  Also, one little chicken-butt-ish complaint. You should ditch that suit and get a better one instead. Add some of those aviator sunglasses white lenses on the mask for Spidey's eyes. The one you currently have seems to have the mask joining in with the chest, and it makes Spidey look like he doesn't have a chin at all :P  WEB-SWING!  EDIT: Oh! Oh! Get a hokey mask and get Taskmaster in the sequel!"
Spiderman,38wy11,RestlessCreation,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"I am going to make more of these. I already have a story arch planned for 5-6 episodes.

And I'd love to do some web swinging in the future but I don't know where'd I start. I'd love to add characters like Taskmaster, I'm currently planning on having Deadpool, Blackcat, and maybe Venom(if possible, getting an accurate black suit would be difficult). The next one I do is going to be the origin story, which isnt super original, but I think it's important to the story I want to tell."
Spiderman,38wy11,RestlessCreation,2,Mon Jun 8 04:21:32 2015 UTC,"Aye! Also, I'm not a professional movie-maker, but I'd think that perhaps for characters like Venom or Carnage, or even Doc Ock, characters that would normally be too difficult or expensive to add in a fan film, you should go for a voice-over. Like some horror movie monster. Like, Spidey walking through a dark hallway, and you start hearing Venom. But you never see him. You just know he's there. Maybe even a flash-back/nightmare scenario thingie.  If not, just get a taller guy in a Symbiote Spidey costume, and boom. Venom :P"

For all we know, some inconsequential side character (like Ollie) will survive through Secret Wars. I don't actually think that is going to happen. Just saying. But Slott and Marvel are being intentionally vague. If we've learned anything over the many years of Marvel history, don't read too into their promotional stuff like that. Example: Remember when they were saying (heck, insisting) Superior was 100% going to be permanent? Yeah, look how that turned out.  But it was confirmed in Secret Wars #3 that the Peter Parker in Renew Your Vows is not 616 Peter (also all the clearly AU stuff in the Renew Your Vows story proper).

They're being kinda weird about who will be Spider-Man exactly after this. No way they're ditching Peter. And Miles has to come through somehow. But SOMETHING is going on. So, Otto returning either in Peter's body or taking over Kaine, and Peter switching suits with Miles, and Miles either being killed or assuming a new identity seems to make sense to me. Or hell, maybe the new red/blue Spidey is Miles and Peter is wearing his costume. Who knows?"

What if that's him in that suit right there? And Miles will transfer with him? Because I meant to say, something about the way he's drawn, his physique, the eyes, and even the pose, remind me alot of Ultimate Peter."
Spiderman,38vm6u,RestlessCreation,2,Sun Jun 7 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"Oh well now won't that be something.  But wait, how would Otto get his own body?"

Spiderman,38vm6u,Dumebuggy,4,Sun Jun 7 07:55:44 2015 UTC,"For me, I think it would be cool for married ""renew your vows"" spidey to survive secret wars, and have Otto reclaim the 616 body, so they Both can exist in continuity together.  But my fear is that 616 spidey is just a red shirt in Secret Wars.  It doesn't seem that he has the power set to play a role in Secret Wars and he doesn't seem to be someone that Hickman likes to use"
Spiderman,38vm6u,kylechrise,10,Sun Jun 7 13:23:25 2015 UTC,I feel like 616 Spider-Man is too iconic/important for marvel to just let Hickman kill him off.

Spiderman,38vm6u,kiekan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:32:51 2015 UTC,mean how? He straight up murders venom then gives up being spiderman...that's not something a nice person does
Spiderman,38vm6u,JoshwaCrimson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"You're completely ignoring context, though. He didn't ""straight up murder"" Venom. He fought Venom head on, after being provoked and having the safety of his family (the thing most important to him) put in extreme danger. When it became clear that there would be no end to Venom's antagonizing, he (as per MJ's urging) made a judgment call for the betterment and safety of his family. His actions were anything but mean. He was being selfless and putting the safety of those he cares about above everything, including his own life and moral code."
Spiderman,38vm6u,kiekan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:53:36 2015 UTC,"It's still murder. He has countless enemies that have not only constantly endangered his life but that of his family, Including friends and he has not gone as far as killing them... Except maybe Morlun but that was more personal. Even if he did it knowing it would put and end to them being in danger it's still not something that I would see Peter doing and or being able to live with."
Spiderman,38vm6u,JoshwaCrimson,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"It's still murder.   No one saying its isn't murder. The point is, killing (or at least we assume he is dead) Venom under these pretenses isn't ""mean"".   Except maybe Morlun but that was more personal.   So killing Venom makes Peter ""mean"", but potentially killing Morlun is perfectly fine? Bit of a double standard there.  Additionally, how isn't the issue with Venom personal? He broke into Peter's house and directly attacked his family. That's about as personal as you can get.  Lastly, this isn't 616 Peter. This is an alternate universe Peter. So the situation with Morlun never even happened."
Spiderman,38vm6u,kiekan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't say killing Morlun was fine or not. He didn't want to Kill or even try kill him even towards the end 616 was against killing, as were most of the Spiders. It was only really Spock, May and Assassin Spider that wanted to. I don't see why you're making such a deal out of it, maybe mean was the incorrect use of word. I don't want to see renew Peter continue over 616 as compared to 616 Renew is a murderer and turned his back on his responsibilities as a hero. what Peter did to Venom was not characteristically like himself and therefore ""mean"" compared to his usual stance on taking lives, no matter what the context of the battle may be."
Spiderman,38vm6u,JoshwaCrimson,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:33:02 2015 UTC,I'd say going after every multiverse version of spiderman is more personal than his wife and child
Spiderman,38vm6u,JoshwaCrimson,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:33:45 2015 UTC,He lives with it because he can live with his family without having to worry about a psychopath who's only goal was to torture Peter Parker through threatening his family.
Spiderman,38vm6u,Valexexe,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:41:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not as true to the character (as of yet). Peter would never be so remorseless after abandoning his friends. he would try to do as much as he could, not just protect his family.  The key part of Peters character is how he isn't just content to let everything fall apart."
Spiderman,38vm6u,EADGBrennan,3,Sun Jun 7 20:57:51 2015 UTC,MJ did kind of browbeat him for not helping out with the baby as much and fighting crime too much to escape his father duties.   The Peter of that reality figured his family was a bigger responsibility than being Spider-Man and saving the world.
Spiderman,38vm6u,ebookit,2,Sun Jun 7 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"That's true, he's a product of circumstance.   It's in our nature to resist change, I just really want everything to still be good when all of this is said and done."

Spiderman,38vm6u,RestlessCreation,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:52:40 2015 UTC,That could be interesting. They purposely showed Kaine alive at the end of spider-verse for some reason.  And don't forget that someone dug up Otto's body way back in the superior era. That was never revealed
Spiderman,38vm6u,kylechrise,2,Sun Jun 7 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"Right? Hell, I'd dig it if they made it so Kaine AND Otto shared the same body at the same time.

One More Day is awful and should die in a fire.  Only read it if you've got brain cells to spare, because you'll lose a lot of them."
Spiderman,38uymy,ryckae,2,Sun Jun 7 05:51:42 2015 UTC,"I know. One More Day is terrible. Read it. Actually made me stop reading Amazing. Well, one of the reasons. Also, unrelated to Back In Black, but I loved Peter throwing Logan out a window when he was making jokes about MJ"
Spiderman,38uymy,kiekan,2,Sun Jun 7 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"One More Day   Lets be fair, though, One More Day was hardly Straczinsky's fault. The guy specifically requested they take his name off of it, since he wrote virtually none of it. The entire story was forced by editorial mandate and almost entirely written by Joe Quesada. So lets keep the blame where it should be: Quesada.  Straczinsky did write the awful story Sins Past, though.  Aside from Sins Past and One More Day (which can both be skipped entirely, without any real issues), though, Straczinsky's run is absolutely stellar. He was the last long-running writer to really ""get"" Peter Parker."
Spiderman,38uymy,ryckae,2,Mon Jun 8 11:17:03 2015 UTC,"That's why I said Back in Black was the end of his run. One More Day doesn't count. lol  I think Sins Past was Quesada's fault as well. Those were supposed to be Peter's kids, not Norman's. Not sure if that makes it better, but I guess we'll never know."
Spiderman,38uymy,kiekan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"Well said! I feel like the whole thing ties back to the endless ""We can never acknowledge the clone saga again!"" mentality. (That and ""Peter can never develop!"")  When you really sit down and think about it, its surprising how much this actually comes into play over the entire history of Spider-Man. That story was a pretty large section of the continuity and its just forbidden to talk about now in-continuity. The last time I can remember anyone in story acknowledging its existence is all the way back in Amazing #608, with the Raptor (Damon Ryder) story. Which was surprisingly good. But even then, they really tiptoed around the clone saga stuff and only touched on it slightly."
Spiderman,38uymy,ryckae,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Slott does utilize Kaine and made him an important part of the Spider mythos. He did play a fairly big role in Spider-Verse, as did an alternate universe Ben Reilly. So there's that.  Kaine did also have his own solo series a few years back."
Spiderman,38uymy,kiekan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"I loved the Scarlet Spider solo series with Kaine. It was my favorite book during its run. It was eons better than anything happening in Superior Spider-Man, too (although that's not really much of an accomplishment, considering pretty much everything was and Yost can actually write well). I even dug his time on the New Warriors. But lets be fair, nothing that happened in his Scarlet Spider book, beyond surface level stuff (getting called Scarlet Spider, etc) has anything to do with the clone saga's actual plot. Kaine was even given an entirely new identity and personality (albeit a great one, but still).  The Ben Reilly from Spider-Verse was so dissimilar to the 616 Ben Reilly that I don't think it even really counts.  Even Spider-Island (which was a lot of fun in its own right), the last time we saw The Jackel, was pretty far removed from anything involving Spidey's unmentionable storyline, heh."
Spiderman,38uymy,ryckae,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:15:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, you do have a point there.  I just think that maybe if Marvel really wanted to erase the clone saga we wouldn't have any of these things."

Things start to ramp up around ASM 4 from the current volume.     You can do just fine reading just the ASM books that are Spiderverse (8-14 I think?).

You'll want:  Superior Spider-Man 18 and 19, then Amazing Spider-Man 4-6 for the introduction of Silk  That gets you caught up for Edge of Spider-Verse, and here's the reading order for it and Spider-Verse:  http://www.howtolovecomics.com/2014/08/06/spiderman-spider-verse-reading-order-checklist/  Only the Amazing Spider-Man issues are necessary to the main plot.  The rest are side stories, i.e. you might see Spider-Man say ""Hey teammates, I need to send two of you on a side mission to Planet X to recover the MacGuffin. Go!"" and then later they come back with the MacGuffin.  If you want to see their adventures on Planet X getting the MacGuffin, that's in one of the side stories."

As a looooong time reader (I'm going to say 20 years - jeez but I'm old) I can't help thinking how far the Spider-Man world has been diluted in the wrong direction.   For instance - I've no problem with Silk - I think it's a great character. But ret-conning the origin story again at re-launch? ugh. Just write her a decent origin story!  To my mind, the spiderverse, spider totems, Morlun et al - everything from the unmasking, One More Day run - should be scrubbed from existence. I understand it's hard to write a character interesting stories for fifty years, but evolving some mystical parallel universe has never worked in any comics. Yes, I include X-Men in that. I hate it.  Just my 2 cents - don't know if people agree or not!"

Spiderman,38r8wh,Worst_Lurker,2,Sat Jun 6 12:37:35 2015 UTC,"Bendis's Ultimate Spider-man run is a great foundation for the character. He was my first introduction to hero comics, and he was the right one.  JMS is a great study on how the character can evolve emotionally, and in my opinion he's the only writer to do that with Spider-man in decades. His run was long, and he wasn't a perfect writer, but he understood where Peter needed to go in order to grow. He wrote the stories that would do that, rather than say, create a loop of regression and non-development that circled back on itself in time for the cross-over events made to move units. but that's me being cynical.  if i had to say which one was better, it would be JMS, but that's not because BMB wasn't good, they were both surprisingly great, one just reached for the new ideas while the other made old ideas new again. Read them both.  I would argue that you should read them both and almost nothing after the JMS run, but that's me. I take issue with Slott and Quesada's decisions moving forward from there, and Slott's writing reads like garbage to me.  The one off titles are great though. The one where Peter meets his sister is great, Marvel Knights is visually striking if hard to follow (very Arkham Asylum that way), and Spider-man Blue is excellent."

Spiderman,38r8wh,azulhombre,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:12:49 2015 UTC,Just before Civil War Spidey had a super trippy arch called The Other. This is where we start learning about the Spider Totems that were revisted in the recent Spider-Verse event. In the other Spider-Man is killed and reborn with new powers. Including Organic webbing and Spider stingers that come out his wrists. He has since rejected The Other and lost those power. However later his cloned brother Kaine (The Scarlet Spider) gained The Other powers. So he does have the organic webbing and Spider stingers.

I'd finish off ultimate Spider-Man, and continue into ultimate comics spiderman, then miles morales: ultimate Spider-Man.

Spiderman,38s5ay,zslayer89,2,Sat Jun 6 19:42:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I hoped it would end to not because it's bad but because it's just not spectacular I hoped now that Disney and Sony have reached a deal they would bring it back and there's been gaps between TV seasons of a lot more than five years

Spiderman,38s5ay,jakemufcfan,2,Tue Jun 9 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"Oh god if only... I still think it's a possibility. If this ends up being the last season of Ultimate, they'll want a Spider-Man cartoon running when the new movie comes out, they could use Spectacular."
Spiderman,38s5ay,bat-reddit,2,Tue Jun 9 19:23:20 2015 UTC,well how Kevin feign describes the tone of the MCU spidey I'm inclined to believe they are similar

Spiderman,38nqna,falconear,2,Fri Jun 5 17:03:20 2015 UTC,I think that was due to the life raft rather as suggested by /u/dddmcd77. The spider connection was mentioned again in spider verse issue 1 (secret wars tie in).
Spiderman,38nqna,theHip,2,Fri Jun 5 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"A thought occurs - if this Mysterio is really the 616 version, should he speak in all caps?"
Spiderman,38nqna,ErikTheRedditor,3,Fri Jun 5 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"616 Mysterio controls this avatar from the 616 world, so the avatar speaks in Ultimate font."
Spiderman,38nqna,falconear,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:44:07 2015 UTC,I never realised that 616 Mysterio spoke in caps. I guess it didn't happen with ultimate Mysterio as he is basically a virtual avatar

Spiderman,38nqna,Rastos27,2,Fri Jun 5 20:31:57 2015 UTC,This is correct. You can even see it in Secret Wars where Miles and The Maker still use lowercase.

Spiderman,38nqna,DBZLogic,2,Fri Jun 5 21:03:12 2015 UTC,"It was just a stylistic choice when they started publishing the Ultimate imprint - everything was done in regular case, whereas in mainstream 616 Marvel comics it was all in uppercase. When they finally had some crossovers, they kept each respective universe's case conventions. It's ultimately a pretty small meaningless thing but it's a pretty cool little 'Hey lookit that' type of deal."

Spiderman,38q2cf,bagman_,2,Fri Jun 5 21:37:25 2015 UTC,I'd rather them focus on the Ditko-Lee run. There are a ton of excellent stories they could adapt such as the Master Planner Saga or the Goblin Crime Story Arc
Spiderman,38q2cf,BeardWonder,2,Fri Jun 5 22:01:26 2015 UTC,I really want to see some kind of adaptation of the Six Arms Saga.

Spiderman,38q2cf,jakemufcfan,2,Sat Jun 6 23:37:09 2015 UTC,"What people don't know honestly is that Spectacular is basically an animated version of Spider-Man the raimi movies. Ock has the brain chip go bad, Venom is taken off of Peter by using a bell, Sandman is created with scientist not paying attention to the Sand machine. There is a lot alike in the series from the movie."
Spiderman,38q2cf,Apple_Joel,2,Sat Jun 6 04:39:17 2015 UTC,I thought the bell was a reference to the 90s animated series? I could be wrong I was very young when it aired  Also in Spectacular sandman was created by accident but not because of negligence but because they wanted to give him armour and Osborn wouldn't stop when things got hairy
Spiderman,38q2cf,No_Strings_On_Me,2,Sat Jun 6 09:07:16 2015 UTC,The bell thing also happened int he comics.

Spiderman,38nmv6,Hydro757,2,Fri Jun 5 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"i think they should bring back Tobey and let Raimi finish his story. Tobey could be married to MJ and be a teacher at his school and take a break from being spidey after Harrys death, which will explain him not being around during The Avengers. Aunt May will be close to dying and come back as Spider-Man after her death"
Spiderman,38iw7o,Mastercheese274,21,Thu Jun 4 14:52:02 2015 UTC,"The ""New"" costume for Peter isn't that different but perhaps this is what Marvel is planning on having it look like in the movie. According to the article:   There will be two Spider-Men post Secret wars, one will be Peter Parker and the other may or may not be Miles Morales. Spider-Gwen will still be in her own Universe even though she is on the promotional material."

Spiderman,38iw7o,KingOfAllDucks,2,Thu Jun 4 15:37:30 2015 UTC,I'm so glad that Spider-Gwen is staying in her own universe.  The book would lose so much of what makes it good if they brought her into 616.

Spiderman,38iw7o,Iokuas,10,Thu Jun 4 15:20:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to comment on whether or not Miles is a great character, but think for a second about what makes him great. It's not just Miles, it's the world and the characters Bendis crafted for him. They're all gone at this point, so unless Marvel is intending to transplant his entire supporting cast a lot of what made Miles run as Ultimate Spider-Man has been written out of existence. Could be good, could be bad, but when it all boils down to it he'll be outshone by Peter."

He made up with his dad. We need a wild card, not some one that goes through the exact same struggles as Peter but in a different medium (Loved one dies, stuggle of telling a loved one that you're Spider-man, etc we've heard it all before.)

Spiderman,38iw7o,StolenHam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"Ultimate peter would be extremely similar to 616 Peter. Miles on the other hand had to fill in the shoes of a spider-man everyone loved and accepted. Also, miles getting to hang out with a seasoned veteran would be sick."

Very slow in the beginning, and the best part was his battle with prowler. Venom was under whelming, the reveal was very ""Who the hell is this guy?"" There is much better Spider's to write about, and there are too many parallels between Pete and Miles. Thats why I think if theyre are going to have another Spider-Man. We need a good anti hero or something along those lines. So lets get Superior back or Kaine or 2099. They all have recieved a decent following and their stories are way different from Pete's. If we are gonna get change then lets get something different."

Spiderman,38iw7o,ranhalt,-13,Thu Jun 4 20:50:07 2015 UTC,may or may not be Miles Morales.   You're a fucking idiot. It is Miles. We've known this for months that he was surviving the merge. We knew during Hunger. Why do non comic readers think they're breaking news for everyone else?
Spiderman,38iw7o,JMNetwork,4,Fri Jun 5 02:49:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, first of all there is no need to be so hostile. I am fully aware that it is Miles,  I've been reading the Ultimate series since it began. If you actually read my post you would see that I said ""from the article"" as in I was conveying what was said in an interview IGN conducted with marvel's editor in chief where the image first appeared. His exact words(which I paraphrased) were: ""Yes, absolutely. All I will say about the character in the black costume is, it could be Miles; it could be someone else"". While it is obvious to anyone who has been even casually following Spider-Man who is in the black costume I made the decision to post his words as he said them rather than speculating what he meant(even if the answer is very clear already). I think it's hilarious you just jump to calling me a non comic reader, as if reading the comics makes you better than someone who doesn't. For the record I'm an avid reader, I have been for the past two decades. I understand you may be frustrated with people trying to create breaking news from nothing, especially if it's coming from news outlets that don't actually understand the context of the comics they are reporting on, but next time maybe try not to be such an asshole."

Spiderman,38iw7o,briancarknee,-3,Fri Jun 5 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"Tumblr feminist bloggers didn't like Thor as a white male, so Marvel/Disney made Thor unworthy to use the hammer so Jane Foster was able to wield the hammer and become the new Thor.  Marvel/Disney has made some changes that some fans are not liking, but they are trying to reach new younger more diverse readers. Hence the Secret Wars and making an all new different universe. At least you get to read about alternative universe versions of different characters in Secret Wars and Battleworld that has a Thor Corps that enforce the law, as many Thors as possible."
Spiderman,38iw7o,kiekan,2,Fri Jun 5 01:44:22 2015 UTC,Tumblr feminist bloggers didn't like Thor as a white male   That is not true at all.  They're just trying something new for a bit. Male Thor will be back someday.

Ms. Marvel became Captain Marvel. It is part of a trend to diversify the Marvel Universe and change the gender and or race of a popular character that is a white male. I expect more of this as time goes on."
Spiderman,38iw7o,ebookit,2,Fri Jun 5 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"Not arguing with any of that, just the part where feminists were supposedly angry because a male character existed. It was Marvel's decision to make a female Thor, blame them."
Spiderman,38iw7o,Reddinstein,2,Fri Jun 5 02:47:07 2015 UTC,"Tumblr feminists put pressure on Marvel to make more female characters.   In a What If Jane Foster found the Hammer of Thor, so it figures she is worthy. Marvel is trying to get more female readers, so Thor became female Thor by switching the owner of the hammer.  I don't see male Thor coming back any time soon, but at least they didn't kill him off like they did Captain Marvel and Wolverine."
Spiderman,38iw7o,ranhalt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:51:58 2015 UTC,Don't assume the real Wolverine won't come back. He is the most popular Marvel character on par with Spiderman. Spidey was out for about 2.5 years in Superior Spiderman and then hints came eventually that he was making a come back. Likely that will happen with our Wolverine too. He may drop the mantle of Wolverine but will still be Logan. Just my 2 cents. :) Hope I am right.
Spiderman,38iw7o,ebookit,-5,Fri Jun 5 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"He gave his name to the new Female Thor.   No. He didn't give it to her. He was not worthy and she was, so she took his name as a title. Plus he's dead. You know that, right?"

Spiderman,38j5dh,freakshow124,8,Thu Jun 4 15:50:58 2015 UTC,This IS the show. Spectacular seems alright but this is the all time best.
Spiderman,38j5dh,legendarybreed,4,Thu Jun 4 16:14:18 2015 UTC,Have you seen or havent seen Spectacular? Be careful on this sub what you say about Spectacular some people might consider it slander. ;) Though growing up with the 90s version it does hold a very special place in my heart as far as animated shows go and probably is my favorite.
Spiderman,38j5dh,Lox22,3,Thu Jun 4 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"I only just watched the first episode since a lot of people talk about it here. Seems good so far, I am definitely going to stop trying to slog through Ultimate and just start going through Spectacular. Ultimate is definitely a noticeable step down. So far my only real complaint about Spectacular is the art style. It just seems ..... simplistic or too cartoony(yes I know its a cartoon)? Not exactly sure how to best describe it. Maybe I'm just being harsh for a show targeting children.  I'd prefer it had a more serious style, more akin to something such as DC's animated movies or the Justice League shows. When I saw Keaton was voicing Pete I couldn't really imagine it but he seems to fit it quite well.  People here seem to love it, so I am sure I'll enjoy the rest of it. 90s Spidey has its faults but it really fit everything into the show that makes me love the mythos. It lands right in the sweet spot for a show aimed at kids but still appreciated by adult fans. Just my opinion though."
Spiderman,38j5dh,legendarybreed,5,Thu Jun 4 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be honest, I think Spectacular Spider-Man is better than the 90s series.."
Spiderman,38j5dh,Techno_Bacon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:24:55 2015 UTC,It is. But I also think that 90's Spider-Man is kind of awful.
Spiderman,38j5dh,ElCrowing,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:31:45 2015 UTC,Kids these days
Spiderman,38j5dh,legendarybreed,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:37:51 2015 UTC,"I mean that depends on how old you are. I'm 28 and I grew up on the show. I've gone back and tried to watch it on multiple occasions, and it just hasn't aged well to me at all.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't entirely their fault. The restrictions on violence that Fox placed on its kids' shows was VERY stifling, so the action was...less than stellar. And Morbius having weird ""plasma suckers"" on his palms instead of being a straight up vampire was incredibly lame. Again, these things were not their fault.  However, the animation is just godawful. It's one of the earliest shows I can think of that used digital cels instead of traditional ones, and everything looked sterile and weird, and the animation itself was very choppy and unpleasant to look at.  This is just a personal thing, but I absolutely hate the art style. I think it's ugly. All of the characters look terrible. Again, that's just my tastes, though.  To its credit, it did try very hard to adapt comic storylines within the restraints that were placed upon them, and I think they did the best job they could. Also, the theme song was sweet."
Spiderman,38j5dh,ElCrowing,3,Mon Jun 8 11:27:31 2015 UTC,I think the art style definitely hurt SSM. I didn't watch it because I always assumed it was for little children.
Spiderman,38j5dh,MasterLawlz,2,Thu Jun 4 19:50:00 2015 UTC,Def take a look and just shrug off the animation. The voice acting is incredible. Keith David as Tombstone knocks it out the park. He's such a bad ass
Spiderman,38j5dh,Lox22,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:05:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the art for Spectacular is pretty stylized."
Spiderman,38j5dh,MaybePenisTomorrow,2,Thu Jun 4 17:33:21 2015 UTC,I think both shows are good in their own ways.
Spiderman,38j5dh,jhk0215,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"Yea but lets be honest, there was no action in TAS because of censorship. Spidey threw like 4 punches the entire series. I like both though, because TAS could have those long story arcs that last seasons and they had so many seasons to develop the relationship between Peter and MJ, and I felt really bad for Peter when the MJ he married turned out to be a clone. Spectacular probably could have had the same kind of development if it weren't cancelled after Season 2..."
Spiderman,38j5dh,kiekan,3,Thu Jun 4 23:39:42 2015 UTC,"I wish that this show would just get officially released on DVD/Bluray (preferably remastered), instead of having to deal with bootleg companies like this."
Spiderman,38j5dh,MaybePenisTomorrow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"I want an uncensored version, Spider-man threw a total of like 3 punches in all of that series."
Spiderman,38j5dh,kiekan,5,Thu Jun 4 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"There is no uncensored version. Part of this show getting created was a deal with Fox that they had to tone down the violence, as Fox thought it would influence kids. So Spidey pretty much never throws a punch in the whole series. The same is true for the 90's X-Men cartoon.  Its kinda fascinating to watch, though, as the animators had to really think outside the box and came up with some really creative ways for villains to still seem threatening, without punching ever."
Spiderman,38j5dh,Kanzentai,5,Thu Jun 4 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"And guns only shot lasers, never bullets."

Which, I know, is a bit of a strange thing to say about Spider-Man since he's meant to be the everyman, but Butterfield just doesn't have the look for Peter Parker."
Spiderman,38pb6n,Iokuas,2,Fri Jun 5 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think he looks irregular. And no, I don't mean that in a bad way. It's just that he has an uncommon mix of traits (bright eyes, pale skin, dark hair, freckles, etc)."
Spiderman,38pb6n,Bug911,-1,Sat Jun 6 04:47:01 2015 UTC,The point of Peter Parker is that he was an ordinary nerd with problem getting girls and was bullied.
Spiderman,38pb6n,XpRienzo,4,Sat Jun 6 01:35:10 2015 UTC,"Which this kid is not. He's a pretty boy with an oddly shaped face.   Peter also wasn't an ordinary nerd who had trouble getting girls and bullying. The only person who bullied him was Flash and in their high school years Peter didn't really take Flash's shit. His earliest love interest, Liz Allan, also gave him plenty of attention early on before she was eventually written out in favor of others. The bullying and women not being interested are a fan misconception."
Spiderman,38pb6n,Iokuas,0,Sat Jun 6 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"Amazing Fantasy #15 read it, it tells you what was Pete's general life before the bite."
Spiderman,38pb6n,XpRienzo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and he's described as an outcast. He doesn't fit in, that doesn't mean he's bullied. He's shown riding a motorcycle amongst other things in further issues, he was an outsider, nor a bullied nerd."
Spiderman,38pb6n,Iokuas,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:06:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't get why people want some teen heart-throb in the role, anyway. Peter isn't supposed to look like Jacob from Twilight. I don't mean no offense or anything, but I can look at Asa and just see a kid that's getting bullied terribly in high school. Andrew Garfield looked like a college senior in The Amazing Spider-Man. And Tobey Maguire looked like he was in his late 20s. Because they were! Going younger and aiming for someone that DOESN'T look like a generic teen pretty boy is good. That's the entire point of Peter Parker."
Spiderman,38pb6n,RestlessCreation,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, Peter Parker is described, and drawn by most artists, as being fairly attractive.  We have been shown girls flirting with him.  There are even other male characters who comment on how jealous they are of him being able to land such attractive girlfriends. Peter Parker is a character who has become known for having a string of super hot girlfriends.   It's also hard to take the ""Peter has to be ugly"" argument seriously when fanboys bitch that Shailene Woodley of all people isn't pretty enough to be Mary Jane.  Shailene Woodley, who is probably 50 times more attractive than the average girl you'd see walking down the hallway in school, isn't pretty enough, and deserves to be ridiculed for it. Not quite sure how this computes with people but there you have it.  Maybe you can have your ugly Peter when he's allowed to have a girlfriend who doesn't look like a supermodel.  Maybe we can worry about that when all his girls look like the rest of us, because to be honest female fans are being left in the dust while the men cry over the representation they've already had for decades."
Spiderman,38pb6n,ryckae,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:07:33 2015 UTC,"So, the argument you all are making is Asa Butterfield is too ugly to be Spiderman? If that's what you think, then state it exactly."
Spiderman,38pb6n,ryckae,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"No, but people are saying they want him as Peter BECAUSE they think he is ugly. Either way you spin it is ridiculous."
Spiderman,38pb6n,ryckae,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:45:38 2015 UTC,"No, they're saying they want him as Peter Parker because he looks like a nerd and a teenager, which is what Marvel is going for, and because they think he's a good actor. Others are saying they don't want him because they don't like how he looks. Now you keep spinning it."
Spiderman,38pb6n,scofieldslays,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"Asa doesn't really look like a nerd to me, though. But I guess that's arbitrary.  A lot of actors can look like nerds, but we have to discredit them because someone out there might think the actors are more attractive than they are?  You're also ignoring the Mary Jane argument. It's ridiculous that going all Revenge of the Nerds is the only acceptable path. The guys have to be uber nerds to the extreme, but all the women need to be hotties.   If people want a certain actor just because he's a ""nerd"" then they better not be crying if the girls look more average is all I'm saying."
Spiderman,38pb6n,newX7,5,Sun Jun 7 19:18:43 2015 UTC,I know they want to go with a younger actor but I just think its all wrong. After watching Garfield's performance the last two movies it will put off a lot of people.
Spiderman,38pb6n,UNITBlackArchive,5,Fri Jun 5 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"Well...a bit, yeah. Less so than before, but still a bit. But the most important thing from this video is that Asa is a nice guy. Calling to give a fan a happy birthday. What a nice dude."

Spiderman,38jru6,AssCrackBanditHunter,10,Thu Jun 4 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"I want a spidey game made by people who care, one that is open world, and NYC and Queens are fully accessible (plus sneaky trips to the Statue of Liberty, by attaching to helicopters like from Spider-Man 2), the maps should be massive and not limited, I don't want easy 1 button pressing swinging or web rushing, maybe an updated and refined mechanic from spider-man 2. I want to interactive with the environment, stick thugs go lamp posts. The webswinging and fight mechanics make or break a Spider-Man game. I hope that we get bullet time back and a whole new fight mechanic, not an arkham rip off. It'll be sweet if the side quests keep going on, like there's no ending them, I hate it when I finish a Spider-Man game, and there's no random events after I do like 100 of them or something. The voice actors got be believable too, I didn't like the guy from tasm, sounded too much like Donatello from TMNT(2003)."

Spiderman,38jru6,RestlessCreation,5,Thu Jun 4 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"Arkham Knight is like, the fourth game in that series. I don't think Spider-Man will be getting a game to rival that series unless Rocksteady themselves take it on. The Amazing games ripped off a few things from the Arkham games anyway.  We do need a really great Spider-Man game though. I've never played one that is breathtaking or anything beyond being alright for killing a few minutes here and there. I want a game I can really get entrenched in. And for once, just once, I'd like a game where I don't want to punch Spider-Man due to him spewing cringeworthy shit all throughout it."
Spiderman,38jru6,web_head91,3,Thu Jun 4 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you might have been too young for Spider-Man 2 and Ultimate Spider-Man. Spider-Man 2 still has my vote for best spidey game ever. The webswinging mechanics were the best (TASM 2 had good mechanics, but I hated how in levels you would just web to air) like the web attaching to buildings, the different ways you could get to from point A to B, the interactivity with with the environment, webbing enemies to lights, swinging off of street lights and stuff. I hated how most of this became one button presses in TASM2, I miss combo swinging. Ultimate Spider-Man felt like the comic books, the web controls were harder; but it was cool how you could climb up your webbing while swinging and do other things to gain height and speed. The spider sense was a different approach, you couldn't go into bullet time to avoid punches and stuff, but it was fun regardless. The switching between spidey and venom was cool too."
Spiderman,38jru6,StolenHam,2,Fri Jun 5 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"I remember buying Ultimate Spider-man the day it came out.  I was so excited to play and it was amazing!

Spiderman,38jru6,ShawnisMaximus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, you beat it in 4 hours? I struggled so much. The game was difficult, mainly due to the swinging and combat system, I was so use to the mechanics of spiderman 2. The general difficulty was high compared to many Spider-Man games to, where you can web rush and press one button go unleash a combo. That difficulty added to the reward of the game."

Spiderman,38jru6,ShawnisMaximus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, I was satisified with the length of the game. You were forced to do side quests to progress in the main story which was good"

Shortly after, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions was released. Batman: Arkham City was released. Shortly after, Spider-Man: Edge Of Time was made.

Spiderman,38jru6,spacecadet2023,2,Fri Jun 5 02:59:06 2015 UTC,"I hope for a new standalone Spidey game before the movie comes out. Honestly my only real problem with the TASM games was that after you're done with them, you're done. There's really nothing to do after that. A more ""living"" environment is something that could make the game a bit more fun. Maybe add Black Cat as a secondary character a la Catwoman in Arkham City, or even play as the Green Goblin or Venom & just create chaos. The possibilities for a fun & crazy Spidey game are endless, but sadly they're sticking to the same ol' formula."
Spiderman,38jru6,DeathN0te,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:58:08 2015 UTC,The lack of alternative characters is the surest sign they don't know what we want. I remember when the first spiderman movie tie in let you play as the green goblin and it was fantastic
Spiderman,38jru6,DeathN0te,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I had in mind. That & Venom in the Ultimate Spider-Man game. Playing as the Green Goblin was so freaking fun, though. The 2002 movie game is one of my favorites."

Spiderman,38euk5,Youareposthuman,20,Wed Jun 3 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"For me personally, one of my favorite aspects of the show was the character development. Especially going back and watching Flash Thompson progress from meathead jock to actual friend of Peter is something really awesome that you don't typically see in animated shows.   Beyond this, the writing was just superb. The writers truly nailed Peter Parker maybe better than he's ever been done, and the way they interwove science, criminology, and even Shakespeare in relation to the story being told was just something so beyond a kids cartoon. It's such a shame we never got to see more."
Spiderman,38euk5,spiderguy1213,7,Wed Jun 3 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"The Shakespeare episodes especially were fantastically well done. It would be really easy for something like that to come off clunky or forced, but it totally worked!"

They built them up for so long and when they finally brought them to light, they perfectly captured how powerful and obsessive they are.  That episode where Spider-man fights Venom in the school is by far one of the best episodes for me."

Spiderman,38euk5,mrglass8,3,Thu Jun 4 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"quite possibly the best action sequence in the whole series.   ""I knew you were finally taking things seriously when you stopped cracking your pathetic jokes"" and then just ass beating, it's so dope."
Spiderman,38euk5,grksmrkle,2,Thu Jun 4 13:45:57 2015 UTC,heck I'm about to go watch it all again :)
Spiderman,38euk5,dudeguy_loves_reddit,4,Thu Jun 4 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"One aspect that stood out the most to me was how the show didn't start out with the origin story, Peter Parker was already Spider-Man, fighting crime. But even better, they decided to bring the origin story in through flashbacks during the symbiote saga when Peter came to his final struggle against the suit, and Oh my GOD, they NAILED it! Incredibly well done, emotional, powerful as hell. At that moment I knew this was the definitive version of Spider-Man. The movies could learn a lot from this show."
Spiderman,38euk5,jhk0215,2,Thu Jun 4 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"The movies could learn a lot from this show.   My sentiments exactly! They said with the new reboot (it hurts to type that) that they'll forego the origin story, so I hope they go the route of TSSM, who handled it beautifully. The whole show is an awesome example of what Sony and Disney can do together!"
Spiderman,38euk5,Inspace96,5,Thu Jun 4 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"What I like most about Spectacular Spider-man is that it was one of the few efforts we have seen from a Marvel property that try to bring finer details of a comic book character to a wider audience.  I don't read comics. Maybe it's partly the stigma, maybe they are just for me. But among my friends, I consider myself pretty well versed in the DC universe. Why? Because DC makes a very strong effort to animate comic book stories and bring them to another medium. We see this with great cartoons and great original animated films. I know about Scott Free and Granny Goodness from Justice League Unlimited, I know about the Judas Contract from Teen Titans, and I know about Harm and Secret from Young Justice. Not only did the shows inform me, they pushed me to read more.  Spectacular Spider-man does for Spider-man what shows like Batman TAS, Teen Titans, Justice League, and Young Justice did for the DC universe.  Unfortunately, now Spider-man's with Disney, a company produces masterful animated feature films, but completely disregards TV and direct-to-video animation as stuff just for small children (I can count the number of good Disney original animated series on one hand)."
Spiderman,38euk5,mrglass8,4,Thu Jun 4 03:42:02 2015 UTC,"I strongly dislike Ultimate Spiderman. It feels like too much of a mockery of Spiderman. Also, I never understood why Spidey needed the team. He's always done well by himself, and while the team idea is a good idea for an episode or two, it doesn't hold up for an entire show. Spiderman is a solo character, and while he does team up with the Avengers and other heroes, he doesn't usually need to. He's possibly the most well known Marvel Superhero. He's technically the most profitable hero that Disney have, and they have a great chance to really make that character shine in a cartoon series and they've screwed it up, washing him down with lesser known characters that should be able to hold their own series, but are instead washed down to be caricatures of their actual selves. It's extremely upsetting for me... I want TSSM back..."
Spiderman,38euk5,Inspace96,2,Thu Jun 4 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"True, it's definitely marketed to kids, but I think there's something there for comic fans. There's a shitload of character appearances in that show, as well as my all time favorite incarnation of Doc Ock. Just the way he's designed, a greasy disgusting little hobbit who uses his mecha arms as a massive crutch instead of an inexplicably muscle bound angry German guy with a bowl cut. Still, TSSM stomps USM."

Spiderman,38euk5,No_Strings_On_Me,3,Fri Jun 5 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"I blame Marvels TV side for Ultimate Spider-Man, Avengers Assemble,  and Agents of Smash.  Disney gives marvel leeway and let's them produce their shows the way they want. Disney has recently had shows that were mature and appealed to adults and children  (Tron, Motorcity, Star Wars Rebels, and Gravity Falls) so they're not completely to blame.   Loeb was the head of their animated departments and hired man of action to run their shows, Loeb is known to prefer less serialized storytelling and having more standalone episodes which is clearly seen in the second half of EMH, most of Season 1 of Avengers Assemble and USM.   They have a new head for their animation department and I heard that the shows have been improving because of it. Hopefully USM will eventually improve enough to be on par with Spectacular,  although I doubt it."
Spiderman,38euk5,voidvector8,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:28:56 2015 UTC,"Okay to be fair I haven't seen the shows you listed other than SW:Rebels, though I'm skeptical of that shows future given that Weismann is gone.  I was more thinking of older shows. The only good animated Disney cartoons I could think of were Gargoyles, Kim Possible, and Phineas and Ferb all of which came from great independent producers rather than an in-house desire to produce quality animated TV.  If they have a new head of animation, that's definitely promising."
Spiderman,38euk5,UnderDogX,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"Rebels will definitely continue without Weisman.The main driving force , pun intended, of the series is Filoni who did Clone Wars for 6 seasons. Disney won't cancel the show since it's doing really well and they're going all out with Star Wars.  You should definitely check out the shows I've listed above they're really good and don't hand hold you throughout the story.  They have sophisticated overarching plots and aren't juvenile like other cartoons currently."
Spiderman,38euk5,RunicLordofMelons,7,Thu Jun 4 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"The voice acting was superb for pretty much every character.   Josh Keaton absolutely nailed Spidey, Steven Blum's Green Goblin was perfect and Robert England as Vulture worked really well, the list goes on. Among all the voice cast though, the performance which stands out most, for me, is Peter MacNicol as Doc Ock. I had never thought of Doc Ock possessing a high-pitched voice, what with being accustomed to the deeper, pseudo-German accent in the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon, but I have to say it really works for the character and ever since watching the show I have used this interpretation of Doc Ock's voice in my mind  when reading his lines in the comics."
Spiderman,38euk5,jakemufcfan,3,Wed Jun 3 21:51:25 2015 UTC,The voicework was so spot on that for a lot of the characters that I read in the comics I actually read them in the voice they had in tssm
Spiderman,38euk5,jhk0215,2,Wed Jun 3 22:13:02 2015 UTC,I do the same. The fact I'm not alone is a testament to the voice acting. I emphasised Doc Ock because he is my favourite Spider-Man character and I thought that he was very well portrayed in TSSM. I loved his 'Evil Genius' mug.
Spiderman,38euk5,jakemufcfan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I love how they made him weak sounding and shrill, it was something that caught me off guard but I loved it."
Spiderman,38euk5,oooooooooomg,8,Thu Jun 4 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"When I knew it was a truly great show was how it handled the symbiote suit. Started with Raimi's look and as he lost control it moved more towards the classic black suit Spidey. Such a subtle thing that blended two ideas. My only comparison is what the new TMNT cartoon does. How they handle the tradition of the character, infuse their own twist but never crossing that line of absurdity. The perfect fan service."

Spiderman,38f1s0,Xesacra,2,Wed Jun 3 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly I jost dove right into it. I know when you walk into a comic store its kind of intimidating but really just walk in and grab something...you'll be surprised how easy it is to get really involved in the universes available. As a spider-man fan I would suggest looking at some of the old tradebacks first before diving into the current arcs. Check out Spiderman Blue and Spider Island for sure. If you want you can read up on some of the arcs pre issue #700.  After that you can just go right into the new arc, 701 to 718. Or skip a few doesn't matter. Spider-man is in a weird spot right now because of what appears to be a pivotal role in the Secret Wars event, so his continuity is kind of in a limbo right now. Once Secret Wars is over he'll be back strong though.  Also what really helped me dive in with no trouble was some comicbook youtube channels that give great overviews and summaries of the storylines past and present.  Check out Comicsexplained, Comicstorian, Variantcomics, and RangoVids on youtube. They are a great reference tool and fun way to get the scoop on comics."

And then Peter just takes it off and abandons it on an alien planet (Earth) out of fear, not for any really good reason.  It never made him angry or fear incarnate or angrier or anything, he just found out it was alive and was all ""Oh man do not want,"" leaving it to die.

Spiderman,38cnez,kiekan,2,Wed Jun 3 12:14:06 2015 UTC,"When you eventually get to the 90's stuff (especially during the Clone Saga), it will become absolutely necessary that you branch out into the other titles. There are a lot of stories that have, for example, part 1 be in Amazing Spider-Man, part 2 in Unlimited, Part 3 in Spectacular, and Part 4 in Sensational, etc. So if you don't dip into the other lines, you'll only get a small section of the story.  One of the many reasons the 90's era is so hated in comics."

Spiderman,38cnez,kiekan,3,Wed Jun 3 13:31:01 2015 UTC,"Just so long as they make it clear where I need to go to read the next part   Unfortunately, in a lot of situations, this isn't the case. I'd grab a reading order if I were you. If you need it, I can post one myself when I get a chance.   I wasn't really aware that the 90's are disliked.   The 90's were the period where the comic industry as a whole nearly went bankrupt. Because of horrible business choices like I mentioned above (forcing readers to pickup all the books from a character). On top of that, they flooded the market with variant covers and whatnot, devaluing the comics already out.  There are definitely exceptions to this, but the 90's are also known for releasing some really bad storylines (usually consisting of forcing legacy versions of characters. i.e. Ben Reilly, Thunderstrike in Thor, Vengeance in Ghost Rider, Azrael in Batman: Knightfall, the FOUR Supermen that took over after the Death of Superman story, ect) and terrible art (its when Rob Leifeldt was in his prime, for example. The tacticool pouch fad was in full effect in the 90's.).  The phrase ""90's Xtreme"" describes the whole era pretty well. Heh."

I think that is why I'm pretty turned off by the current Spidey run. Its such a betrayal to everything ""good"" about Spider-Man. Not because its different, but because it conflicts with the core foundation of Peter Parker's character. Peter shouldn't be this inept manchild he is being written as right now, who gets overshadowed by all the supporting characters. Its all just wrong. lol.

Spiderman,38a5ii,legendarybreed,4,Wed Jun 3 09:07:09 2015 UTC,"What? Just look at the TASM movies. Sony's Spider-man failed and now we are getting a new and different Spider-man the way fans want. If Ultimate Spider-man failed, it opens up the possibility for a new series and makes the ""people behind the scenes"" reevaluate how to make a successful Spider-man show. The first step to getting a better TV incarnation is getting rid of the bad one..."
Spiderman,38a5ii,suss2it,2,Wed Jun 3 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right. But either way this show's going on it's 4th season and is the longest running Spider-Man cartoon, so you're a little late to the game if you're hoping it fails now."

Spiderman,389hge,Xesacra,6,Tue Jun 2 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yo! Wanna get started reading Spidey? Pick up Ultimate Spider-Man issue #001 and start from there! It's a fresh start for a Spider-Man that is from an alternate reality similar to the 616 one. It is brilliant. The entire Ultimate Universe differs from the 616 one, is cleaner and less convoluted in canon issues and continuity problems than 616, and is helmed by just a couple of guys. Also, fun fact, the Ultimate comics saved Marvel from bankruptcy  Ultimate Spider-Man tackles the story of a young and awkward teenage 15 year old boy named Peter Parker. Obviously. You get to see his origin story for the very first few comics, as it is a re-telling, then watch him slowly progress down further into becoming a big-time Super-Hero. So read that. Get the feel of the character down. Then start off with 616 stuff.  Also, side-note, some Ultimate Universe characters, again, are drastically different than 616 characters. But still, you should read Ultimate Spider-Man. Just my two cents."
Spiderman,389hge,RestlessCreation,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:33:09 2015 UTC,You've certainly made a compelling argument and one I intend to listen to. I'll give ultimate spiderman a go!  Congrats on the win ;)
Spiderman,389hge,Apple_Joel,3,Wed Jun 3 06:09:46 2015 UTC,"The best of Spider-Man that I've read for me was the Civil War. The ones to start would be 529-543. Those were some great issues and you get a peak of how Spider-Man acts as black suit. Plus you'd get to read what they're about to make as a movie. To me Spider-Man is a hero of hope. He does what others can't do and represents something that is more than fear. Even so his name gets slandered and he always gets a bad rep he still goes above and beyond for the people of New York. He's just what I want in a hero. Plus he takes on the responsibility younger than anyone else (besides Miles Morales). He is extremely relatable as well. It's just an amazing character to get into. If you want another side of Spider-Man then read Ultimate Spider-Man, it's a great read and easy to get into as well."
Spiderman,389hge,moralless,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:10:08 2015 UTC,Sounds great to be honest. I always liked The look of the Miles spiderman and was one of the reasons I started to consider this superhero branch more.   Thanks for the help!
Spiderman,389hge,Ranorak,2,Wed Jun 3 10:17:15 2015 UTC,"A great question. Why Spidey? In my opinion he is the definitive Marvel hero. He's an icon, much like Batman or Superman for DC. And as any good icon does, he has one of the best rogues gallery out there. His comic started quite different than most. Unlike Batman, he's not ""the best."" This was one of his biggest selling points early on, what separated him from others. He is, in many ways, an average joe. He has family and friends he loves and wants to protect, and has to work to make ends meet (certainly a concept lost to Bruce Wayne). He starts as a teenager, just a kid, untrained in combat. Really, he's kind of the polar opposite of Batman in quite a few aspects. He's vulnerable, he can lose, and he is scared. He uses humor, antagonizing and cracking jokes at his opponents to appear brave, and make himself feel stronger than he really is. And yet, we see him grow. He becomes a (young) adult, and learns to completely kick ass and become a great hero. So, if you're ready to read a comic where the hero will face some serious challenges and make some mistakes (but learn from them), you will love Spider-Man.  Now, when it comes to which comics to read: Are you trying to stick strictly to main continuity Spider-Man? I have to ask, because there are two major incarnations out there (with plenty of side stories). First, there is the original (616 universe) that started in the 60's. There's over 700 issues altogether, so there will be a lot to get through, but there are quite a few different jumping on points (theres a few different ones that people will suggest, you can see which serves you best). There's also the Ultimate universe that started in 2000, called Earth 1610. This features Ultimate Spider-Man, and is a modern retelling of Peter Parker's story. This is also a very well written comic (written entirely by Brian Michael Bendis, art by Mark Bagley) if you're okay with getting somewhat of an abridged, remake version. Ultimate Spider-Man has around 200 issues total I believe, I could be off. Ultimate Spider-Man today features Miles Morales instead, the other Spider-Man you may have heard about, so if you read long enough you'll get to see his character as well."
Spiderman,389hge,TheSpiderWithScales,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:31:43 2015 UTC,I have to say that was a fantastic pitch and the Ultimate spiderman is going to be my first stop.   Thanks so much :)
Spiderman,389hge,bruh_dinosaurs,2,Wed Jun 3 10:19:06 2015 UTC,"Once you get into Spider-man, and you will, it might be fun to pick up the whole Spider-verse collection. In this story a Big Bad is traveling along different universes killing off alternate Spider-men. This leads to a team-up of both new, and old incarnations of spider-man. Like the 60's cartoon Spider-man, the Movie Spider-man and even the Spectacular spider-ham!  Not only did I love this series because I am a big sucker for team-ups. But also because it really shows what spider-man was all about."
Spiderman,387wxh,Lox22,12,Tue Jun 2 14:15:03 2015 UTC,Would anyone like them to reboot it and have it follow the comic storyline? I know I would.  Early ultimate comics were amazing.

Spiderman,385ntn,deedee612,2,Tue Jun 2 13:59:51 2015 UTC,He/she has absolutely no idea. They release information when it suits them to release it. Maybe in a lull between films releases of films to keep the buzz going. It's likely that an agreement had only recently been reached but we couldn't possibly know.

Spiderman,385ntn,deedee612,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:44:29 2015 UTC,I'm guessing if anything it would be post credit or something very small last minute
Spiderman,385ntn,LambKyle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:00:10 2015 UTC,"Post credit could work. Anyone who thought that was possible with Avengers was crazy, but Ant Man is definitely far enough away from the original announcement that they could have filmed something small for it."

Spiderman,383cr0,ryckae,13,Mon Jun 1 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"probably, considering blue=hope and other than willpower it fits the best"
Spiderman,383cr0,MutantCreature,7,Mon Jun 1 17:39:43 2015 UTC,"Well, blue is hope. I think it fits well. The other options are:   fear willpower love compassion greed rage   So I guess maybe compassion works, but I think, considering Spidey's demeanor, blue works best"

Spiderman,383cr0,Astrocricket,3,Mon Jun 1 19:14:35 2015 UTC,In my opinion it would be a toss up between Blue and Indigo.  Spidey is a man of the people
Spiderman,383cr0,whitey-ofwgkta,2,Tue Jun 2 02:24:01 2015 UTC,Red = Anger in the lantern-verse so I hope he doesn't have any red. Blue lanterns are the best IMO. They're more of a support group and just their presence makes green lanterns stronger and it gives blues more abilities to be in the presence of a green. They can bring peace to the minds of someone overcome with rage and can heal someone too.
Spiderman,383cr0,jaywan1991,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:48:14 2015 UTC,"What about indigo for compassion? What kinds of powers do they have? Blue sounds good for Spidey but he's also very compassionate, especially with his no-kill policy."
Spiderman,383cr0,ryckae,2,Tue Jun 2 14:47:14 2015 UTC,"Indigo members are forced into it due to them being mass murders or other 'bad' people. They become sort of 'brainwashed' by the power of indigo and forced to be good as a sort of punishment. Once the power is removed, they revert back to their evil selves. Indigo probably wouldn't be a good choice for him. Blue and Greens seem to be the only inherently good colors that are chosen because they are good and continue to be good.   Spider-man would be a great blue because of who they are. Their leader, Saint Walker (yes saint) is always depicted as a shining beacon of hope, he had a tragic backstory and now he fights for life. He always tells his solders ""All will be well"" and blessed all the dead 'zombies' after they were put back into the ground during blackest night (long story).   If not blue, he would make a good White Lantern. They literally fight for life and hold the life equation in their rings."

Of course wrapped in a bit of patriotism that was a big theme throughout American culture after 9/11, but not too heavy handed, or jingoistic.  It feels like it's not meant to be a story to explain how Spidey dealt with the tragedy, how could they?  It's a letter from Marvel comics as a publisher about how they felt, being an entity of New York, and being people who create stories of things that could be the greatest triumphs and horrors the world could ever know, and not being able to really be heroes in real life tragedy, while pointing out the real heroes, and people with strength to deal with those real life horrors."

Spiderman,37zr8u,samoht822,2,Sun May 31 21:49:30 2015 UTC,Won't he be like 3 or 4? Or am I counting wrong?
Spiderman,37zr8u,KJM321,5,Sun May 31 21:59:08 2015 UTC,No more like 0-1 years old. It happened in 2001 and its 2016-17 in the MCU when spidey shows up and he will be probably 15-16 years old so he would have very young.
Spiderman,37zr8u,SmokeyTheBear420,3,Sun May 31 22:58:23 2015 UTC,Ohhh shit you're right. For some reason I thought the movie was coming out this year. My mistake.

One of the better Secret Wars tie-ins and arguably the best Tie-in team book.  That said, the art can be pretty bad at times and so far it's not exactly relevant in any notable way, though that may change."

Spiderman,37zagd,BozePerkovic,2,Sun May 31 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if you start with the post-Superior run you'll get to read through Spider-Verse.  ASM #18 is the last issue before all the Secret Wars stuff started.  Be prepared for Black Cat character assassination, though.  I'm not liking what they did with her.  But I still haven't read 18.1 (part 3 of Spiral, is it even out yet?) so maybe there was a point to it.  But, financially, the best way to go is to download the Marvel Unlimited app.  It's like $10 a month for unlimited comics.  The new stuff gets put up after 6 months, but there's so much older stuff to read to pass the time. :)"
Spiderman,37zagd,ryckae,1 point,Sun May 31 17:55:06 2015 UTC,So basically if I download the app I'd have every issue of Spider-Man up until half a year ago?

Spiderman,37zagd,monkeypro,1 point,Sun May 31 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, this way you can concentrate on collecting the stuff that matters the most. Maybe a particular story arc that resonated with you when you were younger, or the appearance of your favorite villain, etc.  Otherwise, it would cost a lot of money to try to read it all. haha"
Spiderman,37zagd,ryckae,2,Sun May 31 19:56:14 2015 UTC,I wouldn't start at the new amazing Spider-Man run since there's so much that happens right before it starts with Superior and everything. Id start in the high 600s and finish the original run then read superior. Really gives you a bigger appreciation.

Spiderman,37zxro,web_head91,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:24:13 2015 UTC,Sadly ASM 2 shouldn't have had as bad CG as it did. A lot of the parts were really obvious that they computer-generated Spiderman.

Spiderman,37zxro,Apple_Joel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:29:19 2015 UTC,The extras in that scene are worse than any of the ones in the originals haha. They look like they were pulled out of a PS1 game when Spidey prevents them from getting shocked on the rails. Why does it look so fake?!
Spiderman,37zxro,web_head91,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:39:15 2015 UTC,I feel like they spent most their money towards making electro believable and completely forgot about Spider-Man till the end.

Spiderman,37x1uw,legendarybreed,5,Sun May 31 09:00:31 2015 UTC,It's because people really want things to be happening. I don't know what is going on. I still hope Andrew appears out of nowhere and says he's still Spider-Man.

Unlike other animal species, people are endowed with the ability to change, so if they don't change simpleminded behaviors, they should be criticized for it, and I do.   No one cares what they ""want"" to see happening. Jumping on top of every headlines as if it's true is dumb when you've seen fake leaks from studios all the time. This one could be true, or it could be bologna.

The actors were supposedly all flown out to Atlanta which is consistent with their postings on social media (the ones that have it). And people said that Asa was spotted on the set (which is where the screen tests took place). It makes sense that the others weren't ""spotted"" because their faces aren't as recognizable.

Spiderman,37x1uw,xavierdc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:07:38 2015 UTC,If you've got Netflix you can check him out in Neverland. It's like a two part mini-series (only 3 or so hours long) and it's pretty great. It was a few years ago though. Personally I find it hilarious that he's played the younger version of Andrew Garfield and he also played PETER Pan.

Spiderman,37x1uw,trayNTP,1 point,Sun May 31 19:19:17 2015 UTC,He doesn't have a face that can look older or younger? Or he doesn't look older than usual with his head shaved?

Spiderman,37x1uw,Anna-of-Arendelle,1 point,Sun May 31 04:38:36 2015 UTC,A couple years? Civil War is set to release next year and Spider-Man will be in the movie. The actual movies for Spider-Man aren't set for a couple years but Spider-Man will be featured in other movies till then.
Spiderman,37x1uw,Apple_Joel,1 point,Sun May 31 03:55:17 2015 UTC,I think we will be lucky if Spider-Man is more than mid-credits scene or like a 5 minute cameo in Civil War.
Spiderman,37x1uw,theHip,1 point,Sun May 31 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"With the Russo brothers doing the movie I think they'll do all they can to get the story as close as humanly possible to the comic. They did damn good with the winter soldier so I think they'll do justice for Civil War. I'm thinking he will be at key moments like the court, the fight with Captain America and when Captain America talks to Spider-Man, and other key moments like that. That would easily give him 30+ minutes of screen time."
Spiderman,37x1uw,Apple_Joel,1 point,Sun May 31 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"But Winter Soldier was nothing like the comics? I doubt Civil War will be much like the comics since there are not any heroes in the Marvel U with a secret identity except for Daredevil, or Spider-Man if you want to count him already."
Spiderman,37x1uw,theHip,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:41:58 2015 UTC,I said they made it as close to the comics as humanly possible. It wasn't exactly like it but the key moments were all there. The reveal of Bucky was almost the exact same just different scenery when it happened. They did what they could with what was handed to them. And I wouldn't doubt they will do the same with Civil War. They seem to be the only team that knows what they're doing right now. I bet it'll be more of a Heroes need to take responsibility for the destruction they cause rather than identities but they'll do it the proper way rather than making the whole story a jumbled mess of non sense like AoU was.
Spiderman,37x1uw,Apple_Joel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:23:28 2015 UTC,I had been thinking Thomas Brodie-Sangster (he's 25 but played a convincing teenaged Jojen Reed on Game of Thrones) could've made a decent candidate. He might be tied up with those Maze Runner movies though.

Spiderman,37x1uw,newX7,5,Sun May 31 17:19:19 2015 UTC,honestly....this really doesnt make any sense.Why would they be screen stesting actors now.Has everybody forgotten that CW has ALREADY started filming and spidey is potentially needed in a month (june starts tomorrow btw)?!??!
Spiderman,37x1uw,deedee612,5,Sun May 31 18:22:28 2015 UTC,Because it's lieeeeees. Spidey already got cast. They're just not announcing it yet.
Spiderman,37x1uw,RestlessCreation,4,Sun May 31 18:27:53 2015 UTC,Charlie Rowe seems to be like the perfect pick and seems like a nice guy in general too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZWuGFntuAw  He reminds me of both Daniel Radcliffe and Andrew Garfield.
Spiderman,37x1uw,hartwell_w,4,Sun May 31 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"He played a younger Andrew Garfield in Never Let Me Go! I'd kind of like to see it just for that haha, he's the true heir to Andrew!"
Spiderman,37x1uw,Mippipopolous,4,Sun May 31 20:13:14 2015 UTC,Tom Holland actually looks like a pretty good Peter Parker
Spiderman,37x1uw,jhk0215,3,Sun May 31 12:27:21 2015 UTC,Actually i think asa would look much better.
Spiderman,37x1uw,goodhotchill,3,Mon Jun 1 14:09:45 2015 UTC,Why?
Spiderman,37x1uw,xavierdc,1 point,Sun May 31 04:32:15 2015 UTC,He did a awesome job in enders game!
Spiderman,37x1uw,goodhotchill,1 point,Sun May 31 05:54:38 2015 UTC,"He did a meh job if you ask me, he seemed really wooden in it. Maybe he'll grow on me if he does actually end up getting cast but definitely doesn't make me super optimistic. I don't think Marvel has made one mistake in its casting so far, although Pascal being a part of the project does worry me."
Spiderman,37x1uw,legendarybreed,2,Sun May 31 14:11:45 2015 UTC,They both look like good choices to me I will trust that Marvel will make the right choice
Spiderman,37x1uw,jhk0215,2,Sun May 31 15:35:56 2015 UTC,Sauce?

Spiderman,37x1uw,xavierdc,9,Sun May 31 09:01:28 2015 UTC,"Baby-faced? Yes.  But not short. Spider-Man is 5'10"" as an adult, and Earth-1610 Ultimate Peter Parker is even shorter."
Spiderman,37x1uw,khkarma,1 point,Sun May 31 18:19:36 2015 UTC,Seriously? Asa is 6'0 and 18. Rowe is 5'10 and 19. Holland is 18 and 5'10.  Edit: Hollan is actually 5'8.
Spiderman,37x1uw,Anna-of-Arendelle,0,Sun May 31 22:29:20 2015 UTC,Holland is 5'6.
Spiderman,37x1uw,trayNTP,1 point,Sun May 31 03:43:06 2015 UTC,It appears neither of us are right. He is 5'8 according to IMDB.
Spiderman,37x1uw,Anna-of-Arendelle,0,Sun May 31 03:02:29 2015 UTC,"Who says IMDB is right? Wikipedia lists him as 5'6, but I'm sure you saw that one first."
Spiderman,37x1uw,trayNTP,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"Well I would just assume IMDB would be more up to date, considering it's updated more regularly than his Wikipedia page. Plus since he's young I'd assume it would be the taller of the two heights since the 5'6 measurement was probably from when he was a bit younger."
Spiderman,37x1uw,Anna-of-Arendelle,0,Sun May 31 09:01:59 2015 UTC,"Again, who says IMDB is right?"
Spiderman,37uu28,Sushikitteh,7,Sat May 30 16:11:57 2015 UTC,This strikes me as something Spidey would actually do
Spiderman,37uu28,bagman_,2,Sun May 31 06:07:37 2015 UTC,I also imagine Deadpool in the background with a camera.

Spiderman,37t950,jdofasgard,15,Sat May 30 05:54:37 2015 UTC,Dafoe doesn't even need makeup.  His face is just naturally gobliny
Spiderman,37t950,OsnapsonJC,7,Sat May 30 15:35:54 2015 UTC,Anytime I see this I get trapped looking at it.
Spiderman,37t950,BeardWonder,52,Sat May 30 12:04:41 2015 UTC,"I just want it to be a normal costume.  No Power Ranger Mech Suit, not actually turning into a goblin monster, just a dude in a costume."
Spiderman,37t950,jdofasgard,11,Sat May 30 05:20:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  One of the scariest things about the green goblin is that he's an ultra smart man with super strength who's just off his rocker.   I don't need a literal monster or a dude in a mech suit.  I want that regular terrifying psycho.     Maybe if they want to go that route and make it ""realistic"" just find a guy like Dafoe who looks goblin like and then when he goes crazy he can paint his face or something Joker style"
Spiderman,37t950,Bug911,7,Sat May 30 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"We can have a guy running around with a pointy-eared, rubber cowl, complete with built-in eyebrows. Spider-Man can swing around in his brightly colored, webbed uniform. There can be an anthropomorphic raccoon with a tree for a sidekick. But the Green Goblin? No, he'd look ridiculous if they gave him a mask!"
Spiderman,37t950,jhk0215,4,Sat May 30 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"Apparently for Spider-Man 1, the Green Goblin was supposed to wear a Goblin mask similar to that one but they said it was too scary and changed it into that green tech mask thingy"
Spiderman,37t950,morphinapg,26,Sat May 30 19:26:11 2015 UTC,I just don't think the classic goblin look would look good in a movie.
Spiderman,37t950,OtakuMecha,21,Sat May 30 06:49:36 2015 UTC,"It's not even just that for me. The movies are trying to go for a more grounded approach to stuff. Like when someone has a costume it's reimagined to be some kind of military power suit or something with a practical purpose other than ""they put on this costume to look like a superhero.""  The prototype power suit explanation makes way more sense in the more ""real world"" setting the movies have than the comicbooks where people put on colorful spandex just to look cool."
Spiderman,37t950,runnerofshadows,1 point,Sat May 30 15:09:15 2015 UTC,I think even in the comics he looks silly. Like The Joker. It's what they do that turns their silly look into something iconic and terrifying.
Spiderman,37t950,smalleyinmaine,13,Tue Jun 2 16:35:47 2015 UTC,Anything but ultimate.
Spiderman,37t950,OnMyComputerScreen,2,Sat May 30 14:13:46 2015 UTC,Why do you say that? I'm genuinely curious.
Spiderman,37t950,smalleyinmaine,2,Sat May 30 17:07:07 2015 UTC,Honestly I hadn't read the comics in a long time and then when I saw the character design he was unrecognizable to me.
Spiderman,37t950,moralless,6,Sat May 30 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, he is totally unrecognizable from the original amazing green goblin, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. If you are able to get past the opening shock of him being completely different than the original incarnation, Ultimate Goblin is a very compelling (and completely badass) villain."
Spiderman,37t950,smalleyinmaine,4,Sat May 30 19:42:46 2015 UTC,We'll if they go with ultimate version I'll try my best to keep an open mind.

Spiderman,37t950,Vidiris,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:41:49 2015 UTC,I was actually looking forward to a ultimate green goblin. :(
Spiderman,37t950,jhk0215,6,Sat May 30 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how the Oz formula gave him horns, turned him into a huge green monster and gave him fire abilities. Because according to Osborn's logic in the comics, because the Oz gave Peter Parker the proportional strength of a spider, if I straight up inject myself instead of using a spider, I'll get the proportional strength of myself. Don't really understand how the proportional strength of himself also includes fire powers and turning into a giant green goblin with horns."
Spiderman,37t950,IAmTheZeke,2,Sat May 30 19:32:27 2015 UTC,Isn't he convinced that he is the future of human evolution?
Spiderman,37t950,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat May 30 22:59:38 2015 UTC,"Norman and Harry are basically dragons. The goblin form is just a lizard. Like Hulk's gamma, they generate tons of heat.   I don't follow your proportional strength argument. The spider is a wildcard. The OZ altered the spider and it's impure."
Spiderman,37t950,RestlessCreation,2,Sun May 31 06:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Basically Spidey is a freak accident. A one time thing that can't be re-done. Well, minus Miles Morales, anyway."
Spiderman,37t950,MwamWWilson,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:37:22 2015 UTC,he got different stuff anyway.
Spiderman,37t950,cuntrystorm,5,Mon Jun 1 23:43:06 2015 UTC,Link for purchasing this mask.

Spiderman,37t950,3MinuteHero,1 point,Sat May 30 21:06:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize there were more photos of this, marvel had the picture up on their Facebook."
Spiderman,37t950,boodabomb,9,Sat May 30 16:26:12 2015 UTC,That would look ridiculous in live action. I wish someone would make a high end costume with this look and just produce a professional-looking 2 minute clip to show everyone how silly this would be.

Spiderman,37t950,redjc99,1 point,Sat May 30 19:18:34 2015 UTC,Isn't that what we got with Dafoe?
Spiderman,37t950,runnerofshadows,4,Sun May 31 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"That was my point. Lol. The video was early make-up test for Spider-Man with Dafoe. Instead we got the Green Power Goblin Ranger(Because Sony wanted it, if I recall correctly)."
Spiderman,37t950,redjc99,2,Sun May 31 16:07:45 2015 UTC,I swear - Between Sony and Arad I'm surprised we got any good spidey films at all. So many boneheaded decisions and so much executive meddling.

Spiderman,37t950,ShawnisMaximus,2,Tue Jun 2 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"""A lot can happen between now and Never.""  Hopefully FF bombs at the Box Office, and they sell them back to Marvel. The only real reason I want FF rights with Marvel is for Silver Surfer, Galactus, Doom, Kang, and the rest of the cosmic powehouses!  ...and so the sequel doesn't come out on my birthday 2 years from now... that would be a shitty Present, Fox!"
Spiderman,37t950,3MinuteHero,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that's actually really rad.  I feel like nowadays though they would skip trying to do anything with practical effects and just do a CGI face."
Spiderman,37t950,Mastercheese274,0,Mon Jun 1 22:10:15 2015 UTC,"No. I mean a clip as if taken from the movie, like when we're supposed to suspend disbelief. This is a ""making of"" type segment. I don't need to . They're not trying to convince me it's real in that clip."
Spiderman,37t950,iFucksuperheroes,6,Sat May 30 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you, but I don't think it will happen. I really think the next Goblin we are going to see will be the ultimate version. The studios have had a really hard time translating the classic costume to screen and the ultimate one has yet to be used so it's probably the the most appealing route to them."
Spiderman,37t950,MaybePenisTomorrow,3,Sat May 30 08:07:26 2015 UTC,I think you're probably right.  If they made his size somewhere inbetween Thor and Hulk I'd be content with ultimate.
Spiderman,37t950,Liu_Shui,7,Sat May 30 16:23:43 2015 UTC,I'm just gonna set this link here   https://youtu.be/QEZBhL5lpqg  Combine that with some touch up cgi.....I think we have a winner.
Spiderman,37t950,Bambam005,5,Sat May 30 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"I just don't think the serious tone would come through with that mask, It's hard to take that seriously."
Spiderman,37t950,Liu_Shui,3,Sat May 30 15:18:55 2015 UTC,But you took the Power Rangers mask serious?
Spiderman,37t950,Bambam005,2,Sat May 30 15:48:21 2015 UTC,Well it was still a helmet that someone with tons of money could design. The mask kind of looks silly in live action.
Spiderman,37t950,MaybePenisTomorrow,3,Sat May 30 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"That's another problem I had too. The gear was supposed to be stolen so where did the helmet come from? Norman made it himself? Called up Joe in R&D to make it? I know they were going for a realistic silver age Spider-Man It just would have been more realistic if they made it a cheesy rubber mask or something else in my opinion. I think Dafoe was the best actor for the job, I'm just still disappointed by that suit he had."

Spiderman,37t950,razy01,1 point,Sat May 30 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"I took it more seriously because it was realistic, that automated face doesn't look like something realistic, at least to me."

Spiderman,37t950,jhk0215,2,Sat May 30 18:38:46 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that the next Goblin we get will be similar to the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon. Sort of like The Hulk with some Iron Man armor.
Spiderman,37t950,TheAzureBandit,2,Sat May 30 11:32:32 2015 UTC,From the Ultimate comic verse.....
Spiderman,37t950,moviemaverick,2,Sat May 30 16:35:35 2015 UTC,The Ultimate comic Goblin and Ultimate cartoon show Goblin is different. Ultimate Comics Goblin is this huge green goblin creature with horns that shoots fire and shit and is fucking insane. The Ultimate cartoon show Goblin is a big green goblin creature that speaks in a funny british accent while wearing some mech suit and using a glider
Spiderman,37t950,SkyeRedPheonix,1 point,Sat May 30 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"Actually Ultimate Goblin would be fucking terrifying. Not only is he bat shit insane,but he's one of the smartest minds of the ultimate universe."
