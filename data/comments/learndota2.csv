learndota2,3e2eju,Terracio,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:34 2015 UTC,Will it be ok if I add you on steam? I love the support role and would be awesome to get some game play advice from you.
learndota2,3e2eju,Terracio,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I get many requests on steam nowdays and I think that my flist will be full in no time if I just add anybody so no offense but I'd rather not get friend requests :). Although, if you have questions about supporting you can ALWAYS message me here on reddit or join my dogfullofacid stream channel on dota and I will be happy to answer !"

learndota2,3e3vlo,CheckeredFedora,7,Tue Jul 21 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just start playing. No one is going to give a fuck if you lose or not as long as you can enjoy the game with the heroes you are playing. Because playing against people is probably the best way to practice your hero since you need to adapt way more to that situation, a giant plus is that you already tried a lot of heroes out so you probably already know some heroes and what they can do. There is so much more to learn from actual matches then from bots. Just random in all pick or play all random/randow draft, no one is going to really care what you do, and you shoudn't do that, either. :)  Yes, there will be toxic players either blaming you for losing a fight or just call a quick ""gg"". But in my experience they are the minority of the games you play. But even then, there is a mute button."
learndota2,3e3vlo,RRkillerRR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:41:55 2015 UTC,"Just random in all pick    If you wanna random, make sure you random first or second pick at least so the team can work around you though. Last pick random is pretty likely to get the ire of your team."
learndota2,3e3vlo,hanasanakattakoto,4,Wed Jul 22 02:48:27 2015 UTC,Sound like you should play ability draft.
learndota2,3e3vlo,facelessviking,5,Tue Jul 21 21:03:54 2015 UTC,Less fooling around (goofy/fun builds as you call it) in competitive will lead to less criticism... probably.
learndota2,3e3vlo,chemocentryx,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:07 2015 UTC,I mistyped:  Those builds are happening in the bot games.  Haven't played a real game in a long time.
learndota2,3e3vlo,chemocentryx,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well just ask them what you could have done better. If they're calling you an idiot, then surely there is a reason why. People don't name call for no reason. Once he gives you a reason, you have something to work on. Go back to bot games, practice it, then return to PvP. Repeat. If it turns out it's something like team work and communication then sometimes you might have to practice it in PvP."
learndota2,3e3vlo,dog_obgyn,5,Tue Jul 21 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"If they're calling you an idiot, then surely there is a reason why.    Are you kidding?  People will get mad at any little thing even when they are playing worse or have no idea what they are talking about (as a random example, newer players don't understand split pushing or why you would just sit at a tower waiting to defend it even when it's not in any danger of going down and they will yell at you for doing that even if they don't know better.)  I don't think it's good advice to listen to random pubs screaming at you during games."
learndota2,3e3vlo,chemocentryx,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"Ok. I understand. You think he shouldn't ask for advice in pubs, but then what do you suggest he do instead? Even if they give him the wrong advice, he would still end up practicing something, and that in itself is improvement."
learndota2,3e3vlo,dog_obgyn,2,Tue Jul 21 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"Some of the advice will be right, but it's best not to focus on what some random has to say to you- if you're super serious about getting better you can watch your own replays to see what you did wrong, or you remember during a game something you could work on, or just plain playing the game with some consciousness to your actions can make you better at it by realizing something you could have done better.  I think these introspective options are all better than trusting what someone who is of your exact same skill level (assuming matchmaking works which it more or less does) has to say when they're maddest at you and have no investment in you beyond that game."
learndota2,3e3vlo,chemocentryx,2,Tue Jul 21 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"it's best not to focus on what some random has to say to you     Guess he's better off not listening to either of us then. Cuz of course, no one has a credible answer, not even your peers. Just kidding, you're wrong. Even your peers know something that you don't. That's why peer review is one of the top forms of evaluation in our world. Listen to your teammates and see what they have to say. If they have nothing meaningful to say, then they didn't plan to help you in the first place. Either way, you are not losing anything by asking for advice."
learndota2,3e3vlo,floopyloopy,3,Tue Jul 21 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"Peer review is done by Phds, not by flaming teenagers.  You can definitely lose a lot from asking advice from pubs, especially from people who insulted you like you suggested.  That's like telling high schoolers to ask for advice from their classmate bully!"
learndota2,3e3vlo,floopyloopy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"Ask for advice from high mmr players, perhaps on r/learndota2??"
learndota2,3e3vlo,floopyloopy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:21:46 2015 UTC,People will call you names for no reason.  Do not ask for advice from flamers -- seek advice from friendly players who are higher mmr than you.
learndota2,3e3vlo,dog_obgyn,3,Wed Jul 22 02:20:16 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem where I have a lot of heroes I like to play, so I just play random draft all the time, which forces you to at least choose something that works with your team.  You can also play single draft but since it's not as popular games tend to be less balanced skill-wise (and it's also pretty random.)  Or I just play all pick and just random and who cares what anyone says- you're jus trying to get better at the game as a whole and not doing everything in your power to win that particular game, which there is absolutely nothing wrong with."
learndota2,3e3vlo,dbdkmezz,3,Tue Jul 21 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"Two tips: 1) If someone is giving you grief, and you don't like it, mute them. You don't need to hear it. Valve's matchmaking system will ensure you're on a team that has a 50% chance to win if you all play your normal game, so you're not ruining your allies chances just by playing how you play.  2) Focus on something to get better at each match, before you play. I play with friends, and solo queue. Sometimes I prefer solo play because it gives me space to sit back and think. Get really good last hits, gank at just the right time, warding, wonderful teamfight positioning, map awareness, that spell combo you've been wanting to pull off. Whatever. Just pick a learning focus for the game, maybe read about it first, and then play. This way you can get loads out of every game, whoever your team is, and regardless of whether you win.  Bonus point: there are good strangers in DOTA as well as bad ones. Excellent times can happen in solo queue sometimes :)"
learndota2,3e3vlo,Lord_Vectron,3,Tue Jul 21 21:34:40 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to not take anything from others too personally. People get really competitive and can often take out their frustration on others, often those that don't even deserve it in the first place.   That doesn't mean totally ignore them though, if they're actually telling you to do something or stop doing something, at least try and consider their request and if it's useful advice not only for this game, but for your future games too. (Some guy yelled and swore at me for not using quickcast on Zeus for about 5 minutes before I muted him, the next game I tried it out and it was pretty damn good advice!)    1 thing I personally enjoy doing in solo ranked to take the pressure off a bit is playing fun builds that aren't super common, but don't totally suck, usually anything involving a Dagon 5 rush, running around zapping people to death :D You don't need to worry about 'optimal' builds for the hero, or what people will think of your build, you know it's pretty silly, but you're ok with that.   The main thing is to really not care about the results of any specific game, but more about what you're learning and improving on in the longrun. You'll have losses that will make you a much better player, and victories that really don't teach you much at all."
learndota2,3e3vlo,Sivcere,3,Tue Jul 21 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"Just wondering but what server?  Early on you're going to get some bad eggs,just happens when you are among the newest players (Not sure if bots adds to your hidden MMR) these newbies don't know jack all, don't pay attention.  If this keeps happening use the mute button, as much as I love silly builds, try stick to well known  builds for now.  Unranked gets better, just takes a whilw."
learndota2,3e3vlo,cronimson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:06 2015 UTC,If you enjoy the game by playing goofy builds then just expect to get harass when playing against players or just play bots. When you start to realize that winning is fun then play competitive.
learndota2,3e3vlo,vonHonkington,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"the dota experience is entirely different with a couple people you get along with.  over the years, i've friended a bunch of people who i've had good games with.  we all know we're not great, but we have fun together.  also keep in mind that in ""human"" games, you need to be much more active than in bot games.  it's usually not enough to just show up and click the creeps to win the game."
learndota2,3e3vlo,Psibadger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"Trying goofy/fun builds is alright, but be aware that unranked or ranked you are playing with other people. I think there is some space for trying out stuff in unranked but it must make sense and should look like it might fit the situation. For example, going Dagon as Centaur should rightly get you flamed unless you and your team are well ahead. But, going S&Y as Centaur into a more carry type build over standard Crimson Guard tank/initiator build against a right click heavy team may actually be quite alright.  I solo queue a lot and generally enjoy myself. Main thing is not to take criticism too seriously. Either laugh it off or mute it. Also, be wary of giving your own suggestions to other players. Generally, if you have nothing positive to say, it is best to keep your mouth shut (even if sometimes you end up saying it anyway!)."
learndota2,3e3vlo,Murranji,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:31:34 2015 UTC,"Mostly you don't.  Avoid playing between 12am-6am. I find that if I ever do late night games that's when I get most angry about losing while I can take losses during the day much better.  If you want easy wins you can just spam bloodseeker. He is a very strong hero this patch because of his strong early and mid game and reasonably decent late game. Take him safelane or jungle or mid (though if you are new it's probably best to not go mid too early), get the easy last hits with his 70-100 early game damage and then start snowballing on kills from level 6."

learndota2,3e51j3,Freeze111,3,Wed Jul 22 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"Urn is core, but I never build drums. My MMR went up a good deal when I stopped building MoM. I now go silver edge as soon as treads and urn are online.  After that BKB is normally the next thing I get, but it's situational."
learndota2,3e51j3,Ranthur,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"I meant urn, but I get those two items confused because I'm a noob, I'll update the OP."
learndota2,3e51j3,Murranji,3,Wed Jul 22 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"There are two main ways to build him and it depends on your team composition.  He can be either utility and lockdown, or DPS. The utility build gets items such as blademail, heaven's halberd, silver edge and aghanim's sceptre after you have your core treads/urn/mask of madness/(bkb if needed). The DPS build focuses on just attack speed and attack damage so daedalus or mkb/assault cuirass/moonshard/mjollnir after your core treads/urn/armlet.  If you have enough right clickers and just need more utility and lockdown then go the utility route. If you need to be an extra source of right click damage as you don't have enough other cores then go the dps route. The utility route is better for being the first initiator in team fights since you will take a lot of counter damage since you are the first one in. For the DPS route it's better to let another initiator go first and you follow up once all the abilities have been used so that you can be right clicking for longer and with more health."
learndota2,3e4n8n,Rugbyplayah,3,Tue Jul 21 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, a couple of tips for that game.  Despite being second highest, your tower damage is still wayyyy to low. Also, you're CS is very low, even for someone with 20 kills.  However by the looks of it, you played very well and should be proud of yourself!!!    To deal with a big throw/loss I just go into custom games (on reborn client!!!) and fuck about :D"
learndota2,3e4n8n,Dancatpro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:49:24 2015 UTC,"Playing a game like this frequently, your attitude has to be sort of ""big-picture."" I had a really rough losing streak last month, followed by an equally large winning streak. Then I lost a bunch more, and now I'm winning again.  It affects my mood, but I generally have confidence that I'm getting better, and when I play well I feel good for having played well, not bad for having lost.  In terms of how to think about losses, don't go looking for the guy who went 2-13, go looking for the numbers that don't match up. How are your LHs? GPM? Tower Damage? If you're playing support, it's a little less numbery—how well did you ward, how well did you control lanes, or rotate for ganks?  Think about individual moments and how to improve your games and the win streaks will follow. It's hard to do well and lose, but it's all part of being a better player."
learndota2,3e4n8n,yeartwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:53:17 2015 UTC,Did you learn from the loss? Looks like you did. Don't give a fuck and move on.
learndota2,3e5a3q,frozenmosin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:46:00 2015 UTC,You can run a support Magnus. Honestly? The base damage addition is nice but I like it because it can help your carries farm. When I play Magnus I usually stick to the two lanes on each side of the jungle and keep upgrading our carry with it. Worked so well when Troll and Juggernaut were relevant.
learndota2,3e5a3q,SmoothRide,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:15:49 2015 UTC,Ember plus Magnus is pretty sick combo because sleight of fist.   Other than that it IMO it most benefits carries that are bad at farming neutral creeps like spectre.
learndota2,3e43gb,EsotericPotato,7,Tue Jul 21 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"Many melee carries, including Sven, can be better dealt with if you can kite him. If he has a BKB, this generally means you can try to go on him, but once he pops it you need to back out until it ends unless you know you can kill him during the BKB anyway.  Aside from good positioning, there are various things that help with kiting:   force staff ghost scepter glimmer cape disables heaven's halberd"
learndota2,3e43gb,vple,5,Tue Jul 21 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Kite kite and kite. Get force staves, get ghost scepters, get Eul's. Get whatever you can just so he wont hit you. Once BKB runs out he's basically a giant chicken, just stun him and hit him."
learndota2,3e43gb,shushker,3,Tue Jul 21 20:32:34 2015 UTC,"Does this work: an equally fed ursa with an abysal and bkb. Ursa blinks on the bkb sven, and uses abyssal to pierce the magic immunity. Then ursa pops his own bkb to avoid stuns from the supports and furiously swipes at him?   And in the scenario that the other team lacks support stuns, the bkb on ursa wouldnt even be necessary."
learndota2,3e43gb,WeinerHotDogs,2,Tue Jul 21 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Bane, Razor, Beast Master, and WD can all affect Sven through BKB."
learndota2,3e43gb,chemocentryx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"You're right, a fed Sven is a pain in the ass. Blade mail is always nice, so is halberd. But honestly there's not a whole lot you can do against a bkb sven, you have to counterpick him"
learndota2,3e43gb,Too_Much_Overtime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"You can also play heroes that have skills that go through BKB like Medusa's Stone Gaze or Pudge's Dismember, etc.."
learndota2,3e43gb,cronimson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"Long single target disables, particularly bkb piercing, would do a lot in this situation, something like bane/beastmaster/pudge (beastmaster boar slow also goes through bkb I think, so doubly good for kiting). After his bkb runs out, 1 really good kiting support can make him completely useless, crystal maiden is my favorite for this.  Frostbite, euls, frostbite,=8.5s of disable on him, then nova him and he'll be too slow to catch most people, frostbite again, etc. Or just frosbite+ult and he'll melt because almost all heroes do."
learndota2,3e43gb,decideonanamelater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:38 2015 UTC,Try counterpicking with BKB piercing spells like swap or overgrowth. I was once playing treant for a hero challenge and we had a fed sven standing between us and victory. A couple good ults resulted in an easy kill on him.
learndota2,3e43gb,Conpen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a pro Sven by any means, but I've played him a bit. His stun is really low duration and he has minimal lockdown without an abyssal blade, so you can often damage him from a distance. Most Svens will build blink and that gives him good gap closing ability, but still he is ineffective if he can't get on top of you."
learndota2,3e43gb,Charlie_Wax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"With bkb: A ranged hero with skadi, that slow goes through magic immunity too. Bkb down: Atos, hex, E-blade.

learndota2,3e46fj,Dancatpro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"Well the main thing is I generally lose my lane mid most of the time but only catch up by roaming and team fighting later just due to positioning so i'm still trying to understand the ""finer"" mechanics needed to play mid at a good level.

learndota2,3e4l8i,kmelkon,4,Tue Jul 21 22:26:15 2015 UTC,I'd say not viable at higher mmr but if it works for you guys then go for it. When it stops working figure out why and how you can compensate.  Imo they had a great early/mid ganking/pushing line up against your team but since you had the xp lead from the start and not very many deaths seems like they were playing their lineup wrong. Kunkka has 0 kills and 3 assists? AFK farming? Missed opportunity.

In lower tiers people tend to bunch up when pushing high ground and Enigma can severely punish overextensions and turn a game around with a good black hole.   They also tend to underestimate the power of the Midnight Pulse pure damage.   Finally he farms jungle quite quickly and can get a fast Mek which alone can win teamfights and gain your team an early tower advantage."

learndota2,3e1ktk,Parey_,3,Tue Jul 21 09:39:39 2015 UTC,That's a plan but I wonder how well it will work. TB isn't a great solo laner and I have never heard of dual jungling anything.

None of these heroes has any damage without farm, and none of them are going to get any.  4 melee heroes plus a dusa, and CK stun being the only stun, ensures that laning goes horribly.  No anti-push means after you lose all your lanes, you'll lose all your structures soon after.  Also there's the over-reliance on illusions, so any kind of aoe or hex is going to wreck you.  I wonder if swapping in naga for medusa might make it even worse, since you'd had 5 melee illusion heroes, but once upon a time naga was played as a support occasionally.  Getting rolled over on all 3 lanes with 5 hard carries has to be the worst you can do."

learndota2,3e1ktk,Pentt41207,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"Do you buy Null's? They're seriously powerful on Techies, assuming you're the one farming the lane. I always build 3 Null's or 2 if I'm not doing well, and it adds a lot to your mana pool, especially since you can drop them to get more value out of your soul ring early on."
learndota2,3e1ktk,tbwnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:02 2015 UTC,No I usually go soul ring right into Aghs as of late. Trying to get aghs by the time I hit 11 to really get the push going.
learndota2,3e1ktk,Pentt41207,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, rushing Aghs isn't a very good idea. You should try to get Force+Euls before Aghs, or at least one of those items to support your mana pool and give you some utility, sometimes you really need force against people who buy early gem. Getting early Aghs won't give you enough available mana to spam as many bombs as you think. So, if you go Force+Euls first, you will be able to place a lot more bombs, or if you go Aghs first, you will only be able to play a fraction of bombs that are more powerful. Plus, if you want to ever place bombs in a place where you could potentially be found by someone wanting to gank you, having Euls and Force will enable you to escape really easily."
learndota2,3e1ktk,tbwnz,3,Tue Jul 21 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"But it has Undying to help you deathball too, as well as massivity with Pudge and Mirana. If the enemy team tries to defend, they will have to fight under a tomb, which is fightlosing.  But I agree on the rest of your point. I think this lineup can definitely win though. Same as with any Lone Druid lineup − pushes really fast, but falls flat."
learndota2,3e1ktk,Parey_,3,Tue Jul 21 07:26:41 2015 UTC,You can't make a lineup of five heroes that is incapable of winning a match - every lineup has a chance or even an advantage against certain other lineups. I merely made one I felt was so lopsided toward the early game that it would very hard to snowball hard enough to actually win.
learndota2,3e1ktk,Cerubellum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:34 2015 UTC,Mirana for most of her life has been a carry or a mid. She's played more as a roamer now but if she built carry items she would still have a significant physical dps. She's still a good carry pick in a mid-game focused line up (IF you have a good mirana player).
learndota2,3e1ktk,Sir_Joshula,0,Tue Jul 21 08:10:38 2015 UTC,She's not played as a core very much anymore because she doesn't use farm very well - she needs to be significantly ahead of the majority of semi-carries to be able to fight them effectively. I disagree strongly that she is a good pick for a mid-game carry position.
learndota2,3e1ktk,Cerubellum,2,Tue Jul 21 08:29:09 2015 UTC,"That's just trends. Her carry potential was never nerfed, it was just her nuking power that got hit. And in the pro meta some people just decided they wanted to run her as a roaming support rather than as a carry. Go check out some classic XBOCT Mirana play and see how good it can be. He's sick on that hero!  Fact is she's an agility hero with good stats growth, an escape and an attack speed steroid. She has a good aoe nuke for early fighting and for farming (bit like gyro). She brings more utility than a standard carry in the form of stuns and team invisibility, so that just means she peaks earlier than other carries.   She is one of the very best carries for a group up and push at the 10-15min playstyle which would be the best strategy for your original draft."

Mostly what I am seeing is related to item choices. If you are scared of the tinker in this game, than what good does having a linkens or bkb do. Any competent tinker player knows that bkb is not a viable counter to tinker by any means. You needed items such as sny, skaadi, mkb etcetera to be able to stay on the tinker and survive a hex pickoff. Bkb is better purchased later, when you can charge into a fight with a 10 second bkb and have free reign. I could get into this much more but I will keep it succinct here."
learndota2,3e4cwc,SOWHATIFISWAGGER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:13:50 2015 UTC,I bought the linkens against spiritbreaker mostly to negate the charge. Also thought that maybe it would be a decent counter to laser or reaper scythe. The pick off/fight would usually start off bara charging in. I had difficulty farming due to the threat of being picked off by spiritbreaker and tinker.
learndota2,3e4cwc,FeKrdzo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"linken's is terrible against their team, you only have 180 cs in a 55 minute game, you farmed less creeps than a night stalker as bloodseeker, how you managed to do that is honestly beyond me. If you had more farm you might be able to carry it. Also, a Midas as Bloodseeker is already good every single game, even more so against a tinker, a hero known for dragging games out."

Tusk's obvious abilities are his snowball ministun and that sucker punch.  For the ministun, im assuming that you could potentially euls yourself when hes about to hit you in order to avoid it. As for his sucker punch, not even bkb can stop that. So inevitably, the guys gonna smack you with something during most games.  However, i think his shortcoming would be anything that he does after he combos his skills. Aka his right clicks.  So heres my thought: Play a strength hero who builds blademale. Im imagining bristleback popping blademale right when the ball is about to hit him, sharing all the damage, then turning around to kill tusk when his abilities are on cd.  What'd'ya think? Im curious about item wise what you can do when youre not playing an str hero."
learndota2,3e4caz,WeinerHotDogs,2,Tue Jul 21 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"My opinion would be either A) high mobility heroes (QoP, AM, Storm) to mess with snowball and ice shards or B) tanky heroes who can power through it (Sven, Huskar, DK).  The best counters are probably TA since she CA shield to avoid punch damage and ice shards or TB (crazy I know) who can Sunder after being nuked to turn the tables."
learndota2,3e4caz,Gregthegr3at,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"Huksar is quite bad I think, because Tusk is a natural Silver's Edge carrier."
learndota2,3e4caz,shushker,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:14 2015 UTC,Huskar is not countered by silver edge.  He just uses ulti which has practically 0 cooldown and it dispels the break effect
learndota2,3e4caz,Dancatpro,2,Tue Jul 21 22:50:56 2015 UTC,"Doom. Doom counters everything kappa.   I would say mobility counters Tusk so you can avoid his snowball or shards so anyone can get this in a blink. As far as KILLING him after, some beefy right clicks and some lockdown should do it."

Earth Spirit too, he can pull allies who are being snowballled, silence him if needed and with good positioning you can land a stun on multiple heroes after his snowball connects.  TA is very good against him: Snowball? No damage. Punch? No damage; her damage block instances make Tusk's ganks kind of useless specially early to mid-game."

I then blocked the camp with an observer.  We then saw him return and then waited for him to get the ancients low.  We went over to him and killed him again and then took the ancients for ourselves.  We saw him waiting next to the camp looking confused several times.  He then dewarded our ward, blocking the camp with his own sentry.  He walked to lane about 9 minutes in, only level 2. Our Void killed him without even needing to Chronosphere.  He eventually abandoned later on when he could not do anything at all and dealing almost no damage to anyone all game.  Never play Ancient farming Necrophos."
learndota2,3e1cz4,lonely_squirrel,2,Tue Jul 21 10:53:38 2015 UTC,"This is the reason why it's terrible.  It works only if no one on the enemy team lifts a finger to do anything about it.  That was maybe true for a short bit after the 6.84 change that made it possible, but now, good luck trying it.  Especially since that video came out.  If it works, congrats:  you got neutral creep farm.  If it doesn't work:  you can be level 1 with 0 last hits 5 minutes into the game.  Other jungle methods don't leave you with nothing if the enemy team messes with you.  Jungling is greedy but it's not this greedy."

That's an extremely valid point, but still not the only reason why its terrible, just one of the biggest. Even if it works perfectly the result is still rather shit."
learndota2,3e1cz4,lonely_squirrel,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I should admit it here, but ... uh ... I tried it once or twice.  It was before the leafeator video came out, and it wasn't really known.  I didn't rush midas, though, and I may have started with a null talisman.  Just standing there waiting for the aura kills is something stupid, and the null tally can build into a dagon.  You're not playing carry and you at least have some utility in the midgame.  I'd still say that it worked overall.  I thought jungle necro even before the ancients change was possible.  Maybe it's not great, but sometimes if you have a team of scrubs who think necro is a support.  If they pick all carries, what are you going to do?"
learndota2,3e1cz4,SwimminAss,13,Tue Jul 21 17:38:03 2015 UTC,Oh they have a necro that hasn't show in 3 min time to go kill him by the ancients
learndota2,3e1cz4,WinterAyars,3,Tue Jul 21 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"I've actually done this strat and, while i generally recommend against it unless you have no viable lane options, if your team is sharp you can really punish that. This is especially true for Dire side where it's easy for mid (and even bot) to collapse on people diving in there. Make sure you have a ward dropped (no excuses, buy them yourself if necessary) and watch for people going missing (smoke attempts).  Again, i really don't recommend it unless your team picked some awful, un-lane-able lineup but as a last resort, under the right conditions, played correctly, it can actually work.  (Edit: oh yeah, almost forgot it also depends a lot on event composition. Don't try if they have a Bounty Hunter or something...)"
learndota2,3e1cz4,Terracio,8,Tue Jul 21 11:50:51 2015 UTC,"In an ideal world where the opposite team doesn't know about it/contest you, where them team drafts accordingly and picks a solo offlaner and the Necro isnt a greedy bastard it CAN lead to success.  What do I mean by not being a greedy bastard? Not going Midas.    I'm not sure how popular of an opinion this is, but Midas is such a situational item and massively overrated that it can ruin games. I've been in games where 2 cores get it and I don't even know what is worse: two people building it on the same team or the opposite team not taking advantage of our little fighting potential...   But back to the point, if the Necro builds something more useful (like say a a Mek into greaves)  with his new found wealth THATS a game winner right there.   Midas is a 2050 item IIRC, while Mek is a 2300 item, for 250 gold you're getting an item at approximately 7 or 8 minutes(on a great carrier) that wins fights at a point in the game where it's REALLY strong.   However, so many people seem to know about it that it rarely works out perfectly."
learndota2,3e1cz4,Terracio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, had a Ancients Necro who got Mek at like 15 minutes or something, but he still wouldn't group and help our team that was getting ganked. We were playing 4v5 and the worst part is that our Necrophos could've easily helped."
learndota2,3e1cz4,ADSRelease,3,Tue Jul 21 05:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yup there's the greediness. Once you do ancients and get your first useful item (even if its not Mek)  you have to go help, the point of the whole strategy is to expedite farm and give solo exp to 3 people, not to attempt to get you six slotted by just standing on the same place.   Someone whom I stack with does this and he gets greedy. I usually end up asking him at different stages in the game why is he back at the ancients."

learndota2,3e1cz4,WinterAyars,2,Tue Jul 21 08:45:21 2015 UTC,All ancients farming Necroes I've played with has always gone for a radiance as first item. Not unusual to see them pick it up at 25-30mins.....
learndota2,3e1cz4,Terracio,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"I wonder if that's the best purchase, though. It's awful mana hungry and Necro does have mana problems early.  It is quite good early game though, so maybe just being a walking Mek delivery is good enough."
learndota2,3e1cz4,21meepo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:44 2015 UTC,"You're right, but Im assuming the second pickup after the first successful Mek use will be some arcanes plus the passive."

You can jungle necro nicely, get a friendly teammate to stack the ancients(that's essentially all you're doing hte first few mintues of necro ancients)   Offlane dire can stack pretty easy, couple of trees downed and 600+ range, get your jungle farm(midas at 4min, lvl5), then you clear the ancient stacks in one fell swoop, in like 50seconds.

It's really risky and only effective if no one bothers you. I also only think its worth doing for the first 6~min of the game.

I recommend against both of these items and instead rush a Ring of Aquila and a Drums.  This will give you a MUCh stronger mid game.  After you get a few kills pick up a SNY or whatever flavor of dmg you prefer (basher, skadi, orch)   While Sb probably does wreck 1k MMR you want to basically have the biggest impact possible and slark wants stats to stay alive and continue the assault.   Remember, get in, get a kill get out and heal up with your ult.  with more health (from drums/SnY) you are able to survive more fights, and thus re-engage and continue to make a difference."

No it's not worth it. $0.03 per item * 10 items will cost you 30 cents for 25% of a level. 30 cents * 4 = $1.20 for 1 level. $1.20*24 = $28.80 In store you can purchase 24 levels for $9.99. So essentially you're paying almost 3 times as much. But if you are really good with your predictions you can save money, if you recycle your immortal for 2 levels."

learndota2,3e2e4p,jacksparrowbrl,4,Tue Jul 21 12:50:53 2015 UTC,"I think you're playing fine. Just bad luck with feeders and dc'ed players.   You always go for the the same item build. BKB, orchid, bloodstone.  The best SS players always have different item builds for different situations. You don't have to always get orchid every game, same with BKB. Some game require a bloodstone rush, or maybe linken. It all comes with experience and game knowledge.  Also! Your farm. 120 - 150 last hits and 40 minutes is very low. You can't just focus on getting ganks and kills, you also need items. SS can farm very fast both lane and jungle. You need to aim for around 50 or more last hits every 10 minutes. Pro players get around 100 last hits every 10 minutes.  Think that's about it. Feel free to ask anything."
learndota2,3e2e4p,Ningidrin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks Ningidrin!  In my last games i got really bad luck with feeders, it's hard to play with a hard carry who is 1/10, but everyone have bad games.. and blame them isn't an excuse for losing..  But here's the things:   I consider Bloodstone a item to build every game, am i correct?  I always try to rush orchid first so i can get solo kills easy.. but i really didn't tried other item or playstyle. Do you have any suggestions?  About last hitting, thats a problem i have with every semy-carry and i need to improve.. But sometimes is hard, when we are losing and can't left T3 towers, or jungle is too dangerous to farm.. I also get lost on games that the team doesn't have a good communication.. For example: 15 min game, Void died after using chronosphere on 3 enemies and killing no one, Void says ""GG Storm farming"" (same as gg no wards).. etc"
learndota2,3e2e4p,Ningidrin,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"What you need to understand is that not all heroes require an orchid to kill. For example qop, am and other mobile heroes definitely silence, but others like squishy supports and others with no escape mechanisms. As i said you'll get that with experience.  I think you rush bloodstone if you very good early game and want to finish fast. Sometimes you need more defensive items: bkb, linken, shivas, maybe eul?  If you can't farm lane safely go to jungle yours or enemy's. Use q then last hit, ball lightning in place then last hit, then q and so on.  You need to focus on your own game, especially when you play playmaking heroes. If you need to mute your team, JUST DO IT!"

I think storm spirit should ideally be a last pick or 2nd from last pick if you can persuade your allies to pick their heroes first. And don't pick storm spirit into known counters: http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/storm-spirit/matchups  Saying that I can see areas you need to improve from your gpm to your item choices. For example no stick while laning against zeus is basically asking to lose! Also dagon is not really an ideal item on storm spirit unless you're just snowballing and trolling.  However the best place to learn about Storm Spirit is from Blitz. This video is amazing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xewX9_kM6U) and he has a whole series detailing matchups. What I'd recommend doing is watching that video, then play 5 games then watch it again."

I have watched one video from Blitz, he's really amazing.. i'll keep watching and playing to see what i can improve, Thank you!"
learndota2,3e3p9k,HipsterLings,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:14 2015 UTC,clockwerk'sa decent counter. can't Q or W while being batt. assaulted. fix via force staff tho
learndota2,3e3p9k,VampoRainze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:48 2015 UTC,Yeah clock has given the most trouble actually
learndota2,3e3p9k,Lord_Vectron,3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:05 2015 UTC,"ES is a bad position 5 support, he really wants his soul ring + blink as soon as possible, plus he roams a lot and doesn't do a good job solo babysitting the carry.   You never want 2 melee supports.   So by the process of elimination, he's good when you have a ranged support on the team, otherwise your team will be really lacking and your carry will probably be bullied in his lane."
learndota2,3e3p9k,Lord_Vectron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"So what are some heroes that go really well with him? I enjoy playing with wd(things just seem worth go well), blood(if I get a decent echo he goes full racecar), and zeus(echo+>Zeus ult now is kinda good), are there other heroes I should pair him with? Also I guess I like him with ranged heroes not so much melee."
learndota2,3e3p9k,TOMATO_ON_URANUS,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"I really like ES for his early fissure blocks, so heroes that can really take advantage of a trapped enemy, gyrocopter is pretty awesome, heroes with high DPS that suffer from lack of their own disables like Terroblade and Clinkz can also really take advantage of a nice fissure. Most mids have the burst to turn a good block into a kill, which is why ES roaming mid is so powerful.   Heroes with reliable stuns are pretty nice as they set up easy enchant totem stuns and with that amount of stunlock you can usually get pretty easy kills on any solo hero."
learndota2,3e3p9k,Dancatpro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"racecar   You mean Sonic the Hedgehog-ing. Gotta Go Fast tm  WD is great because you provide so much CC for WD's ult. If you can trap them in the rosh pit with a fissure/death ward it's gg. Really anyone who can take advantage of your ability to stun and shape the map is good, which are a lot of heroes. ES is a pretty strong, flexible support this patch."
learndota2,3e3p9k,sadleaf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:08 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree.  Fissure can be an amazing skill and a pos 5 ES is viable
learndota2,3e3p9k,sadleaf,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"Clock is a great counter. Zeus is also a somewhat counter of all blink initiators because his passive range is immense. Most of the time you will just whiff your ult because you didn't realize that his passive cancelled your blink.   Also, don't pick it if your other suport is a melee because you probably won't be able to harass in lane and then your carry won't be able to farm well."
learndota2,3e3p9k,Charlie_Wax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"So he is a pretty safe pick then, nothing is a super hard counter to him? But how long do I have before the enemy team learns not to bunch so much, they seem to group up too easily when pushing which leads to an easy ult setup."
learndota2,3e3p9k,sacerd0te,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"Well the main issue playing earthshaker is that he can do literally nothing (aside from trapping enemies with fissure) alone to win his lane. He can't zone nor harass his opponent (well, he can zone in a way but he brings only his stun to the fight which you'll have used early on or enchant totem which you'll have at earliest at lvl 3 and usually at 4). The main strength of ES is that he's an excellent roamer that doesn't need levels. That said, you should be rotating REALLY early, looking for kills in other lanes.   What I usually do, is to camp or secure the rune at 2 and then rotate mid. If you can block the ramp of the enemy mid with fissure, its pretty much a guaranteed fb or at least it will force the enemy back to base, especially if he doesn't have a lot of regen or if he's rushing bottle.  The most important things to know when playing ES is to remain hidden in a good spot for an ulti (lots of time you can blink twice into the trees getting a completely unexpected position) and judging if you should ult right now or if you should wait because there will be a better opportunity. What new earthshaker players usually do is to wait for the perfect ulti where all the 5 players and 30 creeps stay together for a instagib where in reallity an ult with just 2 enemy heroes and 0 creeps is perfectly fine if they are far enough of their team or your team is close enought to follow up because you have A LOT of disable time with the ult + fissure + enchant totem. Sometimes what also happens is that they wait for too long and then their team is the one who gets started and then the ES needs to use a shitty ult before he dies."
learndota2,3e2rq4,qwer34eqwer234,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:37 2015 UTC,Some of the challenges haven't been released yet. Just hold tight and keep an eye out for updates.
learndota2,3e3ewr,Calc_,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"Even for me, 2.6k hours (4k MMR) in Dota. I will still play bots regularly. I find that the point of bots is not to beat them, but to practice and aim to improve yourself. Work on timing your stuns and skills, farm more efficiently, create greater map awareness, and minimize idle time. Improving yourself can be applied to real player games, but if you set yourself to beat a bot, you are aiming for just that."
learndota2,3e3ewr,chemocentryx,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"I recommend moving to real players immediately, because bots will form bad habits for you if you don't know what to look for and avoid."
learndota2,3e3ewr,stevethegiantpenis,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"though I agree with this, it depends on what hero you like to play. If you like to play a carry hero, I would advice to play bots until you can get close to 30 kills a game."
learndota2,3e3ewr,cronimson,3,Tue Jul 21 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"i have played almost 1500 hours. I still play a bot match or two everyday. Usually with a hero I am unfamiliar with before playing matchmaking. i find bot matches allow you to push the heroes limits and give you a feeling of how effective they will be at certain points in the game. that being said, playing against real people is always the best practice."
learndota2,3e3ewr,203Blazer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"I had never played a MOBA before so when I started Dota I played bots until I could play against normal/hard bots with 1-2 heroes. I played bots for about a month and then started regular matches.  Worked out in the long run, was better than most when I first started out."
learndota2,3e3ewr,superduck23,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:36 2015 UTC,Once I was able to stomp hard bots I moved onto people games. I still do bots every now and then to learn new heroes.

learndota2,3e3ewr,TayTayIsMyWaifu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, I advise that once you are able to out-cs the enemy mid bot on Unfair, you are ready. Especially if it's against Banebot. You might get ganked early in online games, but that's why you don't level your skills until shit happens. Even if you wind up losing the game, just remember your cs after the 10 min mark."
learndota2,3e2dcl,Avvulous,4,Tue Jul 21 12:42:54 2015 UTC,"Probably wouldn't win TI5 grand final but yeah that's viable in pubs. Super strong ganking, great at teamfighting (as long as your Earth Spirit know's what he's doing and can use his ulti well). Decent lockdown, decent magic and physical damage. Yes its lacking in push but its much easier to push when the enemy team is dead anyway.  Your main concern in the early game is level dependency. You have 4 quite level dependent heroes and none of them can jungle. You'd probably be best to start with 2-1-2 and get venge stacking camps while Ember gets solo safelane xp and have earth and bara getting shared xp and trying to be a nuisance.   Storm + Bara ganks in the mid game are really strong as well if you can keep good vision and map control."
learndota2,3e2dcl,Sir_Joshula,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:02 2015 UTC,"I was worried about the xp issues, but I figured having a roaming spirit breaker takes a lot of that off, he's not actually that level hungry if he's being played as a pos 4, and if he's keeping pressure on the enemy offlane, venge can be reasonably free to stack camps without worrying about ember in the early levels, I think the biggest issue is that 3/5 of the heroes REALLY want 6, earth storm and ember have big powerspikes at 6, whereas venge and breaker have very good ultis, they also have good impact without them, so the 1-1-1.5 with a roaming breaker and semi-roaming venge is perfect."
learndota2,3e2dcl,Sir_Joshula,3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:30 2015 UTC,Roaming Spirit breaker is still very level dependent he's just also quite good at getting kills and hence getting the xp he needs.

I don't know much about him but here's my thoughts:  I like to build mek almost always, razor it's very tank compared to other agi heroes, and mek fits awesosme on him..  There's 2 roles i play actually: Mid/Carry/Pusher: Mek, Treads>Travel, Aghs, Desolator, Refresher (Blow up towers) Hard Carry: Treads, S&Y, BKB/Mek/SB (Situational static links), Skadi, Butterfly, Satanic/AC.. MKB situational.. it depends on how the game is going..  His ult is great to slow and armor reduction on Teamfights, but if you want to destroy teamfights and towers try Aghs + Refresher..  About Skadi and AC i have watched a game that EG.Fear build these two and worked really good.."
learndota2,3e218f,jacksparrowbrl,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:47 2015 UTC,Thanks. I have tried AC and it worked well. I'll consider Skadi too. The refresher and aghs sounds great for building demolition.
learndota2,3e218f,kryonik,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:37:12 2015 UTC,I almost always go phase boots on him now to keep pursuit when you're linked up.

learndota2,3e218f,Pentt41207,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:04:48 2015 UTC,Talk about a hero I haven't played in a while. Not sure how he is this patch. I know his Plasma field got nerfed after TI last year and fell off the map. But as a good mid game fighter he could be good especially when he gets a good static link off.   Nothing quite like getting boots first static link and right clicking people down with ease first blood.
learndota2,3e218f,Maraudershields7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"Razor really can be built (and effectively, not just half-assed) either way and it depends on what you need. I prefer the dps build but mostly because I prefer killing fools.   I have two go to Razor builds depending on our team's carry potential, how well I expect to do, counterpicks, etc. The first is the hard carry build. I start with an aquila and a bottle (bottle first of course). The boots of choice are phase for me. The chasing power allows you to keep static link active from pesky runners. After that I will usually rush a deso. This stacks nicely with eye of the storm and increases my dps further. After that I usually need a bkb although maybe you could use a Linkin's as a greedy substitute. Luxury items include assault cuirass, mkb, butterfly, and satanic.   The second build trades damage for tankiness and utility. Its a good build if you need to tank for squishier heroes, sort of like axe or sb can tank for a drow or zeus. The important thing to remember with this build is that your goal is to survive. The first big item after aquila and bottle is usually a vanguard and/or a mek. Before the vanguard however I will usually buy a quick cloak just because of the cost effectiveness. It's a cheap item that gives great magic resist. I usually leave the mek to the supports if I can but... trench supports. What can you do. If the situation calls for it I will upgrade it to a pipe, usually after the vanguard, but as with all things in Dota, its situational. Your build order depends on the game. After these items I will build refresher then aghs. I just feel like the refresher has more value to it.   Edit: I forgot to answer about the skill build. I feel like it really depends on the match up. Against a Zeus I wouldn't level static link more than once and I would max static link quite quickly. Against an SF i would do the opposite. I would take one in unstable current (mostly for the movespeed) then quickly max static link. I think you should take one in everything by three and not put any points in stats however. That's the only rule for me.   Edit 2: Now that I think about it Lotus orb is probably better than Vanguard. I just haven't played Razor all 6.84. I really need to. I love that hero."
learndota2,3e218f,Maraudershields7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Vanguard, eh? I had not considered that as part of a tank build for Razor. Thank too for the suggestion of Satanic. I had thought of substituting HOD over ROA for early game sustain (along with Bottle and Phase)."
learndota2,3e218f,MattieShoes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, Lotus Orb is probably better than Vanguard. Razor is a ranged hero after all. I haven't played Razor all 6.84 so that didn't really jump to mind like vanguard did."

So this question is a very wise one. * What I always tell myself is, the game is not over until the score board is up. Never give up. That said, sometimes you just have to admit defeat, so there are exceptions. * Something I read somewhere, dunno where though, was something along the lines of ""the only play you have control over is your own"", so while you can't make shitty teammates play better, you can strive to just give your best and find something you personally did well in the game (like CSing, a well placed ult, whatever). Focus on yourself, not on the others. * Being friendly from the beginning sets the mindset I'm in for the game. I start with ""hi team :)"" and just try and keep being nice, saying when people did well, thank them for ganks and such. * I force myself to smile. When you smile, even if you don't mean it, after a while you release endorphins or whatever and automatically feel better. * I get alot of inspiration thinking ""what would Puppey do"". Or Synderen. Kuro. Do they give up? No. Do they yell and flame and get agry? No. They are calm, controlled and positive, and that is what makes them great. I hope this helps."
learndota2,3e1jfj,T0ughC00kie,3,Tue Jul 21 09:13:36 2015 UTC,"Eliminate some of the randomness, queue with friends. Check out NoobsOfTheAncient or dota2pubs. Don't go solo expecting things to go smoothly.  When I queue with a friend, even losses are a win. At least we get to analyze in real time and post-game what's going on, what might happen next, what build is (was) good or bad, and so on.  Lately he's been playing Bloodseeker and I'm playing Lina / CM. Setting his aoe silence with a stun/root is bloody awesome. If we get outlaned we know it early, and act accordingly - request rotations, I go jungle and he plays safe, etc. If we're midgame and an enemy is starting to catch up in farm or starts catching heroes solo, one of us notices and tells the other, so there's less tunnel vision overall.  tl;dr Solo sux."
learndota2,3e1jfj,borland66,5,Tue Jul 21 10:50:21 2015 UTC,"When I am sure a game is tossed, I just practice mechanical stuff. Like if for sure for sure I'm going to lose, I practice last hitting a random lane, I practice whatever my hero's combo(s) is/are, sometimes if I don't think ill get reported for being afk I'll analyze my controls and look for more efficiency wherever, or customize chat wheel, or in the most dire of matches, tab out to reddit."
learndota2,3e1jfj,waterallaround,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"I think what matters quite much, is the understanding that some games are beyond your reach and that you cant let that little number (mmr) in your profile define who you are. In that way you might be able to decrease stress in ranked games. But also remember that throws can happen. I played a game in 5,5k MMR where opponent pudge sold his items and fed intentionally for 10 minutes and then started playing. We almost lost that game even when we stomped them left and right in the beginning."

Might as well use the time for something productive, right? I also try to practice position and stuff like that, but it is hard when the other team is so fed they kill in two attacks.

learndota2,3e1jfj,Labsal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:47:05 2015 UTC,I think you have to try and appreciate and enjoy the fact that you're learning even in losing games. If you approach the game with the right mindset you can always find flaws to fix in your own play even if you feel like the game was totally impossible to carry (and I think games that are actually IMPOSSIBLE to win are extremely rare).
learndota2,3e1jfj,Lallis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:26 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr: if you won't learn how to appreciate losses, you won't ever improve or enjoy the game in the long run. Improvement takes really long time and perseverance trumps talent.  I don't think there isn't a single, or even a set of tips that would help you tackle that issue. You have to understand what is the fundamental reason for which you are playing this game and embrace it. If you're playing to win, then give it your best every single game you play and eventually the consistency will set in. If you're playing to improve, then learn how to appreciate your progress, however slow it can be. Watch your replays, commend yourself for good plays, etc.   If your team is playing badly, but aren't a bunch of shitheads, then just remember that x% of games will inevitably be unwinnable - while still trying to win them (a match doesn't end until the throne falls, let no one tell you otherwise), you just have to accept that behind heroes are real people, who might not necessarily be capable of giving it their best at that moment (whether they should queue for ranked in that state is another issue). If, however, your team is full of just flaming dimwits, then just mute them (I personally do this the moment somebody says a single negative thing or just talks too much instead of CSing) and farm your heart out; after all, even when rolling it's hard for an organized team to beat a hero with twice their networth.  And most important of all, you gotta understand that nobody wins 100% of their games. You will lose matches, but that doesn't make you a bad player or a born loser. On the contrary, you should treat losses as great stimulants to become a better player - after all, if you did win all your matches, what else would be there to do? Even in wins there's always room for improvement. Be humble, be patient, be determined, know where you are and where you want to be.  Remember, everything's in your head, even if you don't realize it yet."

learndota2,3e1jfj,floopyloopy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:34 2015 UTC,I usually keep my cool losing games when I remember that even pros lose games due to teammates. Then I just analyze what has happened in the game and think of better decisions I could have made.
learndota2,3e1jfj,cronimson,0,Tue Jul 21 20:08:29 2015 UTC,"For me, there are 2 things I do when I start to lose horribly :   If I’m upset at my teammates, I don’t say anything. I mute everyone, I mute myself, I focus and I fight until the bitter end. I laugh at mistakes. That teaches me to play from behind and to not choke. Example (I was on a stack, they spent the whole game bashing me and criticizing my decisions, so in the end I just muted everybody) If I’m not upset and I have good team coordination, I try to coordinate my team to get back. If I support, smokes are great for setting up fights that you can win. And every good thing that happens is pointed out. « They didn’t take our T3 and we got a 2 for 2, pretty good ». As a core, I try to stall as much as I can and start thinking along the lines of « I need to play perfectly now, or I lose » which is decently effective for me. In this game none of us had a great game but we ratted with NP and had a pretty good time overall. At some point his treants were finishing off a rax who had about 50 HP, and I was like « Go treants, GO ! » and when the rax died « YEEESSS », it was a bit of a depressing game in the end but quite funny.   I never give up no matter the situation. Dota does not have a surrender option for a reason. That’s probably the biggest part about mindset that you can change."

Your best bet would be to find someone decently strong on your team and just sit behind them (maybe 600/700 units behind and hidden in trees if possible) with the hope that if they get initiated on you can help.  If its invis heroes terrorising you then just stay under the tower or under sentries and don't leave except if you're as a group.

learndota2,3e27it,MattieShoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"If you're support: In the laning phase try to gank other lanes (smoke), however you have to be careful. Try not to gank lanes that are already losing, since that might backfire badly. If you're extremely behind watch other lanes so you can countergank with a TP if a teammate is being dived and in the meantime stack jungle for your carries to catch up. If the game has moved past the laning phase already the same principles apply. Stacking is pretty much always great and counterganking can turn entire games. If you can't do both for whatever reason try to hide behind one of your carries who is farming so you can bail him out if he gets ganked or maybe even get a kill.  If you're playing mid it is usually easy to gank other lanes since you will probably be ahead in levels, even though you died in lane.   If you're playing carry try farming extremely defensively (close to your towers or maybe in the safe part of the jungle.) Ask your supports to paths to your farming spots or ward yourself if they don't want to. Nicely ask for TPs if you're being ganked. Always keep an eye out good fights so you can pick up some XP/Gold, don't just afk farm your jungle for the rest of the game - that will usually lose the game.  Not comprehensive at all, just some ideas how to get something out of those situations."

learndota2,3e24nv,SpeedyMitto,3,Tue Jul 21 11:04:43 2015 UTC,There's a great article on armour here: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Armor  Essentially armour is on a sliding scale and the amount of damage it mitigates depends on your existing armour. If you have 0 armour and add 1 you go from taking 100% damage to 94.3% (5.7% benefit). If instead you go from 10 to 11 armour you only get a 2.3% benefit (from 62.5% damage to 60.2%).
learndota2,3e24nv,Sir_Joshula,3,Tue Jul 21 11:09:01 2015 UTC,"Armor negates physical damage.  Each point in armor negates 6% of physical damage, but it stacks diminishingly (17 armor doesn't negate 100% of physical damage) Physical damage comes from autoattacks mainly, but also from some spells.    Some non-autoattack physical damage sources:   Bristle's quill spray Axe's counter-helix Techies' landmines and suicide Leshrac's Diabolic Edict Alchemist's acid spray Razor's ult WD ult DP ult Dazzle's spells Stuff like Viper nethertoxin, Riki's backstab, BH's Jinada, Ursa's fury swipes Crits   As a very general rule: If they do physical damage, look at ghost scepter and armor If they do magical damage, look at BKB and cloak If they do pure damage, look at BKB and raw health"

learndota2,3e24nv,minicl55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:58 2015 UTC,"Every point of armor increases your Effective Hit Points (EHP) against Physical damage by a constant 6%.  What this means is, if you have 1000 HP, and 0 armor, you have 1000 EHP against Physical damage. If you get 1 point of armor, your EHP increases to 1060, 2 points gives a total of 1120 EHP, and so on.  Where the diminishing returns comes in is the increase in EHP over the previous point in armor. For example:  (1060 - 1000) / 1000 = 60 / 1000 = +6%   (6% total)  (1120 - 1060) / 1060 = 60 / 1060 = +5.7% (11.7% total)  (1180 - 1120) / 1120 = 60 / 1120 = +5.4% (17.1% total)   It is for this reason that you can never have 100% Physical damage resistance, no matter how much armor you have.  In addition, this completely ignores Magic resistance, which is 25% for almost every hero. (The only exceptions I can think of off the top of my head are Meepo and Visage.)  This is why you typically want to build a combination of HP and Armor, because having more HP makes armor more effective by increasing the % EHP gain per point of armor, and Armor doesn't really start to drop off in effectiveness (in my opinion at least) until you get past around 10 armor. Also be sure to keep in mind stat growth from level-ups, and that every point of Strength gives 19 HP, and every 7 points of Agility gives 1 armor."
learndota2,3e2o58,21meepo,4,Tue Jul 21 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"So the 1st point. It procs whenever Linkens would proc. So basically single target spells and items. Not aoes, not ground targeted, not auras.  As for its effect. When you are hit by the any targeted spell, you instantly send the exact same spell back at them. So lets say Lina uses laguna blade on you. Laguna blade hits you and does its damage and then at the same time laguna blade flies back out and hits Lina doing full damage.  See this link for the full list: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lotus_Orb#Reflected_abilities"
learndota2,3e2o58,Sir_Joshula,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:41 2015 UTC,Basically it reflects all single target spells onto the caster. The spell still affects the person with lotus orb on them. Finger of Death? Nukes lion back. Magic missile? Stuns Venge too.   If the spell is single target but has AoE effects those work too. Lion's earth spike will be sent back at him and stun any of his allies that are on the AoE of the spell.   These are the basics of the item. There are some interesting mechanics with aghs and if the spells are lethal. I would suggest you look at the wiki for more detailed information.
learndota2,3e2o58,pridefulrocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:36 2015 UTC,If the spell is single target but has AoE effects those work too. Lion's earth spike will be sent back at him and stun any of his allies that are on the AoE of the spell.    Bear in mind that this is because Lion's spell is player targeted AND ground targeted (similar to Earthshaker's Fissure). Nyx's stun is very similar to Lion's but is ground targeted only so it has no interaction with linken's sphere or lotus orb. I think its just for balance reasons so that you can't get around those items by targeting the ground instead of the hero.

learndota2,3e1rp8,MellamoRaul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"Work on your positioning. Earth Spirit's mobility is the most flexible out of the Spirits because he can manipulate both allies and enemies. You are a walking triple force staff threat when you hit level 3.  Dont blow your rocks too aggressively. Your ultimate gets its value from how many rocks you have in your chamber.   2a. At the same time, you can use rocks to juke out people for last hits. If you want a last hit, place a rock behind the opponent. Usually they will reposition themselves and you get a last hit. If they get smart to it, actually commit with the E and punish them.   If you're against a very squishy/greedy lane, I like to put more levels in the W. Works fantastic if you have a lane partner with a followup slow or stun.   3a. At the same time, if you use your W and they evade successfully, know that you are now horribly out of position. Try to lead your skill shots by 0.5 to 0.75 s so you have a higher chance of landing your skills.   Earth Spirit's burst falls off in the late game . Once you get your level 6, you hit a spike in which you need to force objectives or teamfights. Past the 30 or 40 minute mark, your damage falls off but your utility remains. Itemize appropriately. Force staff and Blink gives you more flexible options for positioning.   4b. Aghanims is amazing. What other item in the game allows you an unpunishable Bat rider ultimate / Pudge hook / OD + SD Disruption? Practice this skill in combination with your others. Blink in > F > E > Q towards allies > W roll back towards allies.  This shit has allowed our team to protect our last rax during high ground defend and counter push for the win. Master this. It's the pub man's recreation of the legendary Navi vs Tongfu match in 2013 where they fountain hooked with the chen and Pudge combo. Plus side is you only need one hero this time around.   All of your spells destroys trees. Do not be bound by the contours of the map when moving. Juke across hills and rivers escaping. Channel a tp immediately after rolling.  Destroy trees with your W and improve ward vision in that area. Sometimes I like to roll through trees to get a wider ward vision in the jungles. You can high cliff someone on the 0:00 rune with your Q if you are careful. Consequently, skill your E if your idiot teammate got cliffed by the enemy Magnus or Rubick."

In order to be able to smash something, one must first get within 200 range of the unit or remnant and then cast it. If you smash a unit within 200 range of yourself, you will kick the unit. If you smash empty ground further than 200 units away, the skill does nothing. If you smash empty ground further than 200 units away and have a stone within 200 AoE of yourself, the stone is kicked in the targeted direction. If you smash a unit further than 200 range away, you walk to it and kick it. If you smash a unit further than 200 range away, and you have a stone within 200 AoE, the nearest stone is kicked to the targeted unit's/ground's position."
learndota2,3e1rp8,Impetus_77,0,Tue Jul 21 15:50:10 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give tips based on the fact that you're just starting to pick up ES. I see lots of people who've never played ES before make a lot of big mistakes.   You don't have to click on remnants to push them. You can just click on an area, and it will push a close-by remnant in that direction. Don't preemptively put down remnants. You see people who've never picked up ES before just litter their lane with remnants and that makes me cringe a little inside. Only drop remnants when you're going to use them (ex. remnant->pull).  Quick cast is your friend. You'll be pressing a lot of buttons very quickly in succession, and quick cast will cut the number of buttons/clicks you need by half. As cool and flashy doing push-pull-roll/pull-roll-ulti/etc. combos are, you don't have to blow all your skills at once on a lone target. You can put yourself into danger and run out of remnant charges quickly. Most of the time your long range stun is enough to initiate with.  You can almost always get the first bounty rune if there's only 1 enemy there. When you get to about 0:01, you can push just them away (preferably onto a cliff) Pushing/Pulling heroes don't stop them from channeling. If you want to stop/save someone, you have to use a remnant. Don't try to use your ulti in the middle of the enemy team. It's not Reverse Polarity. It's better to get it on 1 enemy hero and spread it with remnants instead.  Practice. Practice. Practice. I wouldn't play ES in matchmaking until I've gotten familiar/comfortable with using his skills first. Play a few bot games or practice in a lobby for a bit until you get a feel of how his skills work."
learndota2,3e1rp8,Avvulous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:06 2015 UTC,"on the 'don't litter your lane' tip, I find putting a remnant down occasionally can really save you trouble, people are scared to walk behind remnants, and 5 is more than enough to be wandering with.  overall though, the biggest tip is just get solid with his mechanics, learn what every ability does, then go from there, being able to silence someone mid-roll, walk around them and push them into your team is borderline impossible to do consistently, but you can sure as hell increase your chances of landing that combo by practicing it.  also, quickcast on q/e is option, in my opinion never put it on stones or roll, it does more harm than good."
learndota2,3e142l,AgitatedCosine,9,Tue Jul 21 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"Watched the first 20 minutes of the game: 1) Obviously try not to get first blooded is the easy criticism, but as for improving on this: you see 2 hero icons show up on mini map. You seemed tunneled visioned into the Lina and didnt see the 2 others show up ~3-4 seconds before CM froze you.  2) Issues with last hitting: change your starting items if this is an issue. You pick armor and a shield with one branch, why? You need last hits and if you rush bottle with 2 shared tangos + 3 branches, you can spend mana on last hits and get a faster bottle, AND it would have helped with the clinkz harass.  3) You went to get bounty rune at 2:43 with no bottle and missed out on an entire wave of creeps that arrived, plus killed by clinkz.  Its 3:30 and you have no method of regen and clinkz continues to harass. If you get the faster bottle (better starting items and using flame guard), clinkz harass is no longer an issue and you double/triple your last hits by 6 minutes.  4) It's 4:30 and you roam top with a DD instead of securing more last hits. You're not 6 yet, no bottle, you dont have vision of where you're ganking so they could easily kill you like they did. Clinkz is now 6 and if he's good, he'll start to mess with other lanes. If clinkz is good at last hitting, he should start to punish you (he's not though).  5) Bottle achieved @ 7:00. Good time to shoot for bottle is before 2:30 (sub 2:00 is better).   6) At 7:40, you're waiting for rune instead of last hitting and getting something out of your time like at least being in exp range. Every second you should feel like you're doing something, not wandering aimlessly especially in early game.  7) @ 8:40, use glyph and pull creep wave from tower (agro them) to not have your mid T1 down so early.   10:00 minutes: 21/3 last hits. The biggest and best thing you can improve on right away to snowball early is to get this number up. This is such a huge thing. Bottle @ 2:30 versus 7 minutes in this game could have done so much for you. My personal tip for improving last hits: the early creep waves are 4 creeps, start counting off your last hits and always try to reach 1-2-3-4. You last hit one creep at a time, not an entire wave at a time. Sounds easy maybe, but it helped me a lot.  10:33 - could have used remanant with better mana usage to not die  12:00->14:00. 2 minutes on a wasted gank that didnt accomplish anything. Imagine 2 minutes of jungling or last hitting in lane. The early game matters and translates into huge success later on. You didnt really actually do anything besides play with clinkz until 14:43. Nearly 3 minutes of gold and exp you could have gotten in the VACANT mid lane or jungle. You would have upgraded and been nearing battlefury by now with a better first 15 minutes.  15:15 -> 16:00: Time spent playing with their team, all for an assist they didnt need you for, that much closer to battlefury.  Skipping ahead to 20:00 - 60/3 last hits. Could be easily double if you didnt mess around from 10:00-20:00 with just one of those unproductive team fights.   This is my critique, take it with a rock of salt. Think of every second not accomplishing something as wasted opportunity and putting your team behind. Keep it up though, you ended up with good items, but think of being even farther ahead!"

learndota2,3e142l,CaptainFlounder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:24 2015 UTC,"The top comment here leads me to believe that most of the issue is with your mid play and not so much with Ember specifically. Aside from this, treads are kind of a waste on Ember. Phase are usually much better. I have actually been going BoT rush lately, and I think that is actually the best. However, just stick with phase until you are better at farming early I think. I support the RoA choice over drums.   Also, a manta is often necessary when an enemy has orchid."
learndota2,3e1hrb,KarmaHandouts,5,Tue Jul 21 06:01:25 2015 UTC,"Because against pl bh ur orb deal a thousand damage and you disable their escaping with silence. Both of them are squishy, even till mid game bh and pl's core item doesn't make them more tanky than in lane (diffusal for pl and whatever for bh). Viper is very strong mid laner and very high damage to compete farm with for early blink."
learndota2,3e1hrb,xxAnamnesis,3,Tue Jul 21 06:55:03 2015 UTC,"Puck is great against PL, because Silence + nukes can pick PL off really easily in the early game, and Dream Coil breaks during doppelgänger. It’s a really good early game counter to PL."
learndota2,3e1hrb,Parey_,3,Tue Jul 21 07:30:53 2015 UTC,"Puck has AoE in Orb and Rift(?) that helps identify the real PL. If Puck gets an early Blink PL will just feed Puck for the entire midgame, and PL doesn't have much HP in the midgame and without Dopple has no escape (Rift silences). Late game Puck's Dream Coil will identify the real PL and prevent him from escaping (it stuns through Dopple). Puck also has high mobility so if PL tries to run away at any point in the game Puck can chase effectively with Blink + Orb.  I just played this matchup 2 hours ago and PL really can't kill Puck late game. Puck is Phase Shifted half the time, the other half he's Orbing away or Blinking away. PL can't really get Orchid.  Puck is probably good against BH because all of his spells are AoE, so they can hit BH without Dust if he goes invis (Dust is really uncommon at lower tiers, and that's where most of Dotabuff's data comes from). BH also has low HP which helps. Coil also keeps BH in that circle so you're pretty much guaranteed to hit him with Orb + Rift even if he's invis and you don't have detection. BH also can't kill Puck effectively unless he gets Orchid (and Puck  doesn't have Euls), and at lower MMRs changing itemization to counter heroes is uncommon (I just had a BH go Bfury in the PL vs Puck game I played today, he ended up feeding me because Bfury BH really isn't good, even if a 10 year old guide says it is). Also Rift silences BH and prevents him from going invis in the first place.  Viper is a lane dominator, and Puck is a snowbally hero who relies on a good laning phase and getting kills early on in order to snowball and win. Viper denies him that ability by constantly harassing him and preventing him from ganking due to his low HP."
learndota2,3e1hrb,subraizada3_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:26:15 2015 UTC,"So speaking of laning,  the one hero that I've felt had even better harass than viper was huskar,  and I find that even viper VS huskar,  the huskar will win thanks to his passive. Do you know of a good counter to huskar in lane?"
learndota2,3e1hrb,lozarian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:38:27 2015 UTC,"Viper actually works OK vs huskar - viper will have better damage to lasthit with, better range, can kite and slow, and his passive will damage huskar any time he harasses."
learndota2,3e1hrb,TreysC2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:48 2015 UTC,"Viper does well vs huskar due to his passives being amazing vs him. Nethertoxin deals great damage to sub 40% heroes. Corrosive skin punishes huskar for trying burning spear harass early. Add in that viper's orb / ult / corrosive shred his MS/AS and can make it difficult to escape & armlet toggle, and you have a pretty strong counter"
learndota2,3e1hrb,Craciunator,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:56 2015 UTC,Because viper just rapes midlane and puck needs a good start and a blink to really come online. Sure puck has phase shift but you can only Ps so many poison attacks. You have to be good with the hero and mid laning to win the lane vs viper

learndota2,3e1hrb,NotSoNoble6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"One thing that people haven't mentioned about viper being so good against puck, is is damage over time.  One of pucks greatest strengths in the laning stage is phase shift, it's amazing for dodging high damage attacks.  The problem for puck is DoT, which viper has out the ass.  You attack viper, you take DoT, you get hit by viper, you take DoT.  No phase shift will save you from DoT."
learndota2,3e1hrb,TheArchist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:09:42 2015 UTC,"Puck is a magic nuker that doubles as utility with Silence and Coil. Now PL doesn't deal well with Puck AoE until he gets a Skadi or some stats in general. The illusions just die and there's nothing PL can do about it in the part of the game he's weakest.  Bounty has a nonexistent health pool and the silence really messes up his escape if Puck just carries Dust. Puck is also one of the few heroes not fazed by level 1 roaming Bounty in mid, further giving it an advantage.  Now Viper is a pain for two reasons: he's a lane dominator and nothing Puck does hurts Viper because of Corrosive Skin. Viper also builds tankiness, and Puck is really bad at dealing with tanky heroes even with a Dagon while also trying to fight across his magic resist."

learndota2,3e1r3t,cha0sengineer,2,Tue Jul 21 08:15:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear. Everyone has losing streaks and those games where you don't feel too good about yourself. Remember that your confidence also affects your performance in the game. When you are angry or frustrated it biases your judgement so that you might end up doing even more mistakes.   If you have had a week or two without playing, I would suggest taking a quick bot game or two to stir up your doto instincts and habits. Then go take that game against humans with renewed map awareness and confidence. If it works, you might want to try it even after losing a game.  Best of luck in your future games."

learndota2,3e1r3t,1hatethisgame,0,Tue Jul 21 11:33:06 2015 UTC,I just don't even play if I've lost more than a couple in a row. Its what helps me get through things because I do feel like I go very noticeably on tilt when I start losing. I feel like in spite of some lost skill taking time away can help to prevent it from getting too bad. After a win or two i can feel like I've cleared the air a bit and play more normally. Sometimes its nice to play another game for a while to let yourself forget about any anxiety or anything you may have had as a result of your recent losses.
