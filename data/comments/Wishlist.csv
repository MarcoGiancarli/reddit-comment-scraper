Wishlist,3e35np,Aloof_pooch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:52 2015 UTC,He mentioned you had a scare so I guess everything is ok.  We are in a rough spot. Matt had emergency back surgery yesterday and can't even pick up the kids for 3 months. I'm suppose to bring him home later today if he can handle the transition from the drip meds to the meds he will come home with. I found a babysitter to help but I need to talk to her. Raven pooped out a sticker :( the inlaws are coming in tonight to help. Wish me luck.

That's definitely something for the baby scrapbook....""This is from when your daddy had back surgery and your babysitter decided to take your arts and crafts experience to a whole other level.""  Yeah, I'd definitely have a few words to say about that....Some glitter next time to go with that sticker maybe?    So sorry to hear about Matt!  Emergency back surgery yesterday and they are considering letting him come home today?!?  Wow.  Back surgery is pretty major - really surprised about that!  But on the bright side, he must be doing OK enough that they're considering it, so yay for that, although that really sux about not being able to pick up the kiddos for so long!  Are you guys going to be OK with STD/LTD and/or Workers' Comp if that's even applicable?    And OMG inlaws.  Let's just say I'm so glad one of mine is in an entirely different state and the other across the ocean!  Is this going to be an extended stay or just for the immediate future?  At least they might be able to help with childcare so you don't have to worry about Raven swallowing anything else?"

Blatantly stolen from the Amazon description:    Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining."

I think if you even kind of liked the show, or if you only liked the first few seasons of the show, you'd like the books more. If you loved the show, you'd probably also love the books.

Wishlist,3dxwp5,caraeeezy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:56 2015 UTC,"They sent me a message about this.   Hello:  Great news! You made a wonderful choice shopping with us. At Kidde Time, we truly care about our customers. We are 100% dedicated to your complete satisfaction. If you have any issues, we will work with you until you're happy!  In the meantime, here's how to install your Toy Storage Hammock.  Please save these instructions:   Your package contains 3 metal hooks and 3 plastic anchors. The installation location for this Kidde Time Stuffed Animal and Toy Storage Hammock is in the corner of a room where a child is NOT ABLE TO GET TANGLED in the storage net. It is preferred that you screw hooks into a wall stud. If a wall stud is not available then the plastic anchors must be use. To use the plastic anchors, pre-drilled 5/16-inch hole then squeeze points and push the pointed end into the hole. Screw hook into anchor. Stretch the hammock on a flat surface with pointed end at the top representing a triangle. Install your first hook close to the corner of the wall at a safe height. Attach the top grommet of the hammock to the corner of the wall where you installed your corner hook. Slightly stretch each side of the hammock to determine hook locations for the other two points on each side of the two walls and mark lightly with a pencil. Allow some slack so when the net is hung, it doesn't appear completely flat. Each hook should be equal distance from the floor. Attach the grommets of the two remaining sides of the hammock to the installed hooks. Make sure when hanging your Toy Storage Hammock, you hang it high out of the reach of little hands.   I hope this has adequately explained the installation process for you so you're able to hang your Kidde Time Stuffed Animal and Toy Storage Hammock.  That's it for now. Just know this grandmother of 4 was able to do it by herself so hopefully you will too. I will check back with you in a few days to make sure everything is working for you.   Just thought I'd pass it on."

We went and got his student ID and ate panda express for lunch.  That was delicious!  I'm a little disappointed they're making their fried rice with brown rice now.  It tastes different. Bleh.  Trip to Ikea yesterday was productive.  Found out we're going to have to rent a cargo van to take up there and get what we want because it won't fit in our car.  At all.  Renting a cargo van is actually cheaper than getting it delivered ($130 vs $199).  So we're going to wait until we can buy everything we want and then go up there with a van. :D

A semicolon is used when an Author could've chosen to end their sentence, but chose not too.  The Author is you and the sentence is your life.   My sister and I have been talking about it recently, about each of us getting one in memory of our brother. And recently, a couple of tattoo shops here in Edmonton have offered to run an event, with all of the proceeds going to the local crisis support centre.   I'm seriously thinking of doing it, but a part of me feels conflicted because - I dunno. It feels a bit appropriative, like I'm taking someone else's story or pain and making it about me instead. I know you can totally make an argument that I've been impacted, that it's as much my story as someone else's story, and that this is an important cause to me, etc, but I still go back and forth about the idea.   I suppose I'll see what sister has to say, and that will make my decision from there.

I was on my fourth week of being a camp counsellor and I was exhausted. Emotionally, physically, mentally, and because I was spiritual at the time, spiritually exhausted.  I was dead on my feet.  The theme of the week was missions. Everyday somebody would come and talk about their mission, where they went, what they did, all that jazz. Thursday, how I'll always remember that Thursday, was Korea, and for dinner we had Korean food and no works were provided. But chopsticks were, so many chopsticks.   Halfway through this dinner, where I was starving, and I couldn't eat, and was getting frustrated, something in my head snapped. I put down the useless chopsticks, I took my glasses off, and I cried. I cried like I've never cried before, nor have I after.  I cried for an hour."

Finally got to sleep in the bed last night since husband was admitted to the hospital this time. Now I just need him to be ok enough to get him to our spine surgeon on Monday.

He has a pretty significant bulging disk. Don't know yet about surgery.   It has been a shitty couple days. The crimped hose in the garden last night took all my cursing like a champ.

I would say ""First It Giveth"" because it kind of has a grunge-ish sound to it (it even kind of reminds me of Alice in Chains in a way)."
Wishlist,3dosnx,13rennon,2,Sat Jul 18 01:03:03 2015 UTC,"Chains are also one of my favorites. QotSA's ""...Like Clockwork"" is amazing, particularly (my favorite song) ""I Sat by the Ocean."""

With alternative music, I'm usually more of a grunge fan but I figured I gotta listen to some other alternative bands too and they, along with Radiohead, were the best bands to start with. :)"
