Deathmetal,3e4ch4,SweetBrotato14,-3,Wed Jul 22 11:54:01 2015 UTC,they don't have to make a new album they already made the greatest death metal album that is and will ever be.

Deathmetal,3e4ch4,Injineered,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:50:28 2015 UTC,I don't think any album ever can claim that title because there isn't any objective way of judging music in a way that can be agreed upon by everybody.
Deathmetal,3e4ch4,Metal_Malachy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Cryptopsy's None So Vile is an immediate contender. Odious Mortem's Cryptic Implosion, as well, for me. I'd definitely put Epitaph in the top 10. Number 1 is tough, but I really want to give it to Pierced from Within."
Deathmetal,3e4ch4,iamkoloss,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:23:09 2015 UTC,"Pierced From Within is definitely one of my favourite tech-death albums, but I don't know if I could ever call it the number one best death metal album of all time."

Deathmetal,3e2kdl,iWumbo_uWumbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:42 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: A fucking awesome death metal version of a popular buddhist scripture.  Adding a little context here from what I know. The song was originally arranged by a vocaloid producer called Utsu-P off the album TRAUMATIC. The guys in the video (who I assume to be internet musicians on the Japanese video site, nicovideo) covered the song. Utsu-P is the bass player in the Giraffe mask. Here's a link to the original vocaloid arrangement  The lyrics are all taken from a popular buddhist scripture called the heart sutra. I don't pretend to know what exactly the lyrics mean, but from what I gather it states the doctrine of emptiness (lack of inherent meaning in all things) that is a foundation of Mahayana buddhism.     Here is an english translation of the lyrics"

I have heard this exact same phrasing from multiple different people but I've yet to hear a song about that (I'm sure it exists) and this is what people think metal is all about.   They have no concept that metal has sub-genres - no concept about anything metal-related. Power metal? Tech death? Beatdown deathcore?   The best way to deal with them is to not play. You will never win. If you want to try then just start providing education and asking them questions about why they feel that way and what they believe Satanism to be. Put it on them."

Deathmetal,3dajby,bongxlord666,3,Wed Jul 15 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"It's a reasonable conclusion to make given all the effort to appear Satanic/anti-Christian/anti-religion or whatever - in both the lyrical content and the artwork and the names the bands choose.  I think it's important to acknowledge that it's a valid conclusion for an outsider to make - if you want to have an intelligent conversation about it.  Now, ""why"" they do it and ""why"" you listen can be discussed and that can go in about any direction.  But it's not difficult to establish that it is artwork and there are subtle nuances that fans come to appreciate, much in the same way as fans of beer can taste differences others can't.  Some people may or may not have a personal conviction to one faith or another, but at the same time enjoy the apparent sport with which some bands try to ""out-evil"" one another.  I also like to point out that in today's world the monsters often don't look like monsters - they look like normal people and sometimes they look like clergy, teachers, dentists, and moralizing comedians.  Perhaps the point of the art is to show how people are aghast at the statement of evil, but are quick to rationalize or forgive it when people actually DO evil.  If you are sharing it, be prepared for the reactions and embrace the conversation that follows!"
