DetroitPistons,3e4jie,bmeyers1844,8,Tue Jul 21 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"Great article. You do a good job of exploring his strengths and weaknesses. You really put in the effort to find the stats that back up your points.  I've really enjoyed watching Drummond grow over the last couple years. Hopefully he can take a Boogie-like leap in his fourth year. I'd love to see him in consideration for an All-NBA team.  Since you asked, there are a couple areas in which you could probably improve for the next article.    You often misuse or omit commas. This is an incredibly common mistake for amateur writers; if you look through my post history I'm sure you'd find hundreds of examples of me making the same error. For example:   Drummond built on his rookie season and as a starter the next season, playing 32 mins and scoring 13.5 ppg with 13.3 rpg.   This sentence reads makes it appear that he built on “his rookie season and as a starter next season.” Although this is technically true, I don't think it's what you meant to say. You need the comma to delineate between what he built on and the results of that improvement. Something like “Drummond built on his Rookie season, and as a starter his sophomore year he played 32 minutes and averaged 13.5 ppg with 13.3 rpg” would make for a clearer sentence with better flow.  Although it is possible I'm misreading what you were trying to say.   It takes a veteran player to know when to foul and when not to foul so a big thing Drummond will need to work on to take his game to the next level will be to increase his IQ for the game and try to not have 285 fouls for the year.   This is another example of a poorly constructed sentence. At the very least you need a comma after “foul.” A better would be dividing it into two separate sentences.  You'll also notice i've highlighted the word “thing.” You should generally avoid using that word in formal writing. It sounds lazy and generic. In this instance you could substitute “area” or “facet.”   Shooting is an area of Drummond’s game he has been trying to improve.   Lots of English professors will harp on “being verbs” and passive voice. They often say to avoid them at all costs. Using passive voice can make your writing sound weak. For reference, the “being verbs” refer to “is, was, were, are, be, being. and been.” Now, it is not always true that you shouldn't use them. I just used one it that last sentence and will in the upcoming ones as well. Sometime being verbs are the best choice or else they wouldn't exist. However, as a general rule avoiding them benefits your writing.  For example, “Drummond has worked to try and improve his shooting,” sounds better than the above quote.  Your sentence also poorly conveys its point. What does “improved shooting” mean in this context? Is he trying to improve his shooting percentage? Or is he trying to improve his away from the basket shooting? Based on the subsequent context, I believe you meant the latter. As such, perhaps the best sentence would be “Drummond has worked to try and improve his away from the basket shooting.”   One thing he shares with his rival for the most rebounds in the game is that he is a career 39.7% free throw shooter and hasn’t showed any signs of improvement. For a center who does a lot of magic in the post, especially when he tries the put pack after one of his many offensive rebounds, this is something he will need to fix or become a victim of the hacking that guys like Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard have to deal with far too often.   The first sentence of this quote makes it sound as if Andre and Deandre both shoot 39.7% from the free throw line. You also haven't mentioned Deandre in two paragraphs, so a casual reader may have trouble understanding who you mean when you say “his rival.” You do mention him in the next sentence, but it's best not to leave your reader confused for even a short time. You also use “thing” again, and it might benefit you to split it up into two sentences. Perhaps “Like other elite rebounders, such as DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard, Drummond shoots free throws poorly. He sports a career 39.7% average at the line and shows no signs of improvement” would sound better.   Detroit is one of the worst shooting teams in the league, but his offensive rebounding percent is 17.5% and an insane 18.3% over the past two years respectively. This shows that he just can grab boards on the offensive glass at a ridiculous rate. Now that Greg Monroe is gone he’ll only grab more offensive rebounds and rebounds in total this year and may even be able to outdo Deandre Jordan’s insane rebounding in the past two years.   When using adjectives it's best to avoid repeating the same one in succession. It makes your writing blend together and can cause  the word seem like a crutch. Substituting the second “insane” for “phenomenal” or “outstanding” strengthens the prose.  However, you might want to avoid words like “insane” or “ridiculous” altogether.  They sound amateurish and don't add much to the context. You could say “he can grab offensive boards at an elite rate” or “Jordan's league-leading rebounding” instead. They convey the same point while providing context for the stats and sounding professional.  Now, you're not a professional. If you prefer to write in a more casual style then feel free. It's often better to write in your own voice than trying to force formality. But if you have any ambition towards reaching a larger audience you may consider a more formal approach.  As far as content goes I really liked the article. You put a lot of effort into finding stats to demonstrate your points. I really enjoyed your comparison of Drummond to other elite centers at the same point in their careers. You demonstrated how dominant he has the potential to be in the upcoming years. A couple of quick pointers regarding content:   Taken 9th in a draft where most said he would be a top pick, Drummond came into the league with a chip on his shoulder.   Going into more detail on he got drafted later than expected could allow the reader to better humanize Drummond. The more they know about him the less he's just a name on a page. You could talk about the factors that lead teams to pass on him and the promise he showed as a prospect.   When discussing Centers in the NBA most conversations turn to names like Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard, or the newcomers like Karl Anthony-Towns and Jahlil Okafor.   Not a huge deal, but you start off the article talking about the best centers in the league and don't mention DeMarcus Cousins. That might raise a red flag among more knowledgeable readers. “This guy's gonna talk about elite centers and he doesn't even mention the league's best center? How much could he know?” For the most part it won't deter anyone, but it's valuable to be cognizant of the affect your choices will have.  You also have a tendency to editorialize. That goes back to the formal vs. informal aspect. People tend to trust you more when you present an unbiased picture. Again, if you prefer to write in the less formal style then do as you wish; some professional writers do. Bill Simmons has made a whole career out of it. Just be aware of which style you're choosing.  Don't be discouraged by any of this. These are all pretty common mistakes that you generally have to make before you can learn to avoid them. You just have to keep practicing. Hell, I'm sure I've committed some of the exact offenses in this response that I tried to point out in your writing. It takes guts to put something out for public critique. I really enjoyed your article and hope you write more. I look forward to reading the next one. Hopefully it will address how Stanley Johnson is the next Lebron."

Sometimes i forget he's only 21 because I feel he can still be more physical out there and he would be more dominant if he played with the aggression of Maxiell on the offense. Defensively i wouldnt change a  thing except foul trouble but not all fouls are his fault.

DetroitPistons,3e113i,Trusk_Fundz,4,Tue Jul 21 13:02:45 2015 UTC,"I said pf.  If you put every player into just one position, to me it seemed to be the weakest.

DetroitPistons,3e113i,straussmasterflex,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, PF seems to be our weakest position, and it would be great if we could get one of the rookie PF's from next years draft without tanking or giving up significant value. We could have a starting lineup as a core."
DetroitPistons,3e113i,Comeonmang123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"I just said 'various.' We need any above-average player we can get. Realistically it's probably poor resource allocation to pay another C or PG, and in future moves we should go hard after any potential stars who can play the 2, 3 or 4.  Our weakest position has to be the 3 until Johnson can show us something against real competition. Glen Rice Jr. and Jeremy Lamb are former Summer League MVPs, after all. Our most dire position might be the 4, though; we're relying on some league-average-at-best guys who are 30 (Tolliver) and allegedly 31 (Ilyasova)."
DetroitPistons,3e113i,bison_dele,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"Power forward for sure. Toliver and Ilyasova are redundant players who are basically competent at best. At SG we at least have a good shoot and a good defender with some potential, and we're solid at SF with Johnson and Morris locked up on a super-cheap deal. At PF we have a pair of spot-up shooters who do nothing else better than average."
DetroitPistons,3e113i,come_visit_detroit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yeah I didn't really consider the PF position. My thoughts with saying SG was that KCP is a question mark, and Jodie Meeks is not a starting caliber player in this league. And Darrun Hilliard is also an unknown.   I didn't consider PF originally because I guess I put Mook Morris in there as a 3/4. But yeah, Tolliver and Ilyasova are going to need some help. I really do think Ilyasova could be a very valuable asset for us though."

DetroitPistons,3dznrs,CF4714,5,Tue Jul 21 00:11:57 2015 UTC,I made this comment in an earlier post. Im an Eagles fan and i see similarities between SVG and Chip Kelly. Similar style of coaching in that they are no nonsense type coaches who won't take shit from players but are up front about whats expected of them. They both have great minds for the sport. They have a system that they believe in and can work by plugging in players they feel will fit that system. They want players who want to be here with a team first mentality and want to win as much as they do.
DetroitPistons,3dznrs,kgdanumba1stunna,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:06 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting comparison.  Chip is definitely a little flashier than Stan, but I think they definitely have they share a similar approach to coaching."
DetroitPistons,3dznrs,kgdanumba1stunna,4,Tue Jul 21 02:43:31 2015 UTC,Chip is more ballsy and has a unique style of how he does things. Stan is just old school. Both arent afraid to fail and can see the solutions to the problems.

I agree with your buddy that in today's league center is not the most valuable position but the notion that having someone with Drummond's talent and athleticism could be more valuable at the wing than the center does not mean that Stanley's our franchise player over Drummond for the exact reasons you mentioned that Stanley hasn't even played a game yet.  He played great in summer league but all that does is indicate that he's probably not a complete bust. By no means though does it serve as evidence that he has franchise player caliber talent. I love Stanimal and I'm planning to order his Jersey after I get paid Friday, but your buddy had to have some drinks in him to think Stanley's potential counts for more than what Drummond has already shown. Plus, Drummond is 21. It's insane to pretend like he's past his point of breaking out, especially when you consider the inconsistency he's had to deal with in coaching and competing with Monroe like you said.

I would say Stanley will be top 10 with top 5 being Lebron (still) KD, PG13, Melo, and Leonard and you still have young guys like Rudy Gay and MKG that are coming up."

Bigs who are mobile and can still provide rim protection are very valuable, much less guys who rebound like Moses Malone."
DetroitPistons,3dzexx,nevuking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"I want them both to be franchise players, who is complaining if Stan becomes better than Drummond?  That is pretty fucking good.  Dre is the best rebounder in the league and he had a good rebounder in Moose to share the paint with.  I say he breaks out this year.  Also, the notion of a big man not being important doesn't mean shit.  Drummond is a freak athlete that can cover guards on the pick n roll.  When he comes to his own he will be unstoppable.  Also, it is worth mentioning that centers take around 5 years to fully develop."

DetroitPistons,3dzexx,mithuun15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"I think that as of now, it's certainly Drummond. But I think it will eventually be Stanley. Drummond is a beast to be sure, I'm just not sure he has the court leader mentality. He isn't super vocal, on or off the court. I just like Stan's charisma, and I think he's taking it upon himself already to be a team leader."

DetroitPistons,3dvu48,uscjimmy,21,Sun Jul 19 23:22:05 2015 UTC,"I was at the Drew League yesterday and thought you guys might appreciate Stanley and Andre going to work and dominating. Been following Stanley's career since he was in 9th grade and he's gonna be something special for you guys. You guys got an absolute steal for him with the 8th pick.  Future looks super bright for the Pistons, and as a Lakers fan, I hope we meet again in the Finals so we can get revenge on that 2004 Finals loss lol"
DetroitPistons,3dvu48,Scurvy-Jones,9,Sun Jul 19 23:24:21 2015 UTC,From the highlights Stanley was strokin' it.
DetroitPistons,3dvu48,sRW44,5,Mon Jul 20 00:29:10 2015 UTC,Could you give us some more information on how the two played throughout the game? I see SJ lighting it up from three in this video. Did he take 30 shots to do it or was he on fire?
DetroitPistons,3dvu48,sRW44,10,Mon Jul 20 05:48:35 2015 UTC,"Stanley was very efficient. 6/10 from three and he was just feeling his shot. Dre looked a little rusty out there, but he was just a ridiculous defensive presence in the paint. Stanley had 31 total and was being guarded by Jordan Hamilton, who also plays in the NBA."
DetroitPistons,3dvu48,AZM1995,2,Mon Jul 20 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info!"

DetroitPistons,3do25j,Scentapeed,7,Fri Jul 17 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"Well who was gonna offer him the max? He was a restricted free agent, might as well have just matched any offer and tried to squeeze him a little bit."
DetroitPistons,3do25j,cbosh04,6,Fri Jul 17 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, trying to squeeze your players is a nice look"
DetroitPistons,3do25j,Scentapeed,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:07 2015 UTC,I'd say Miami came out ahead by treating the best player in franchise history like they did. We can't treat Reggie Jackson after 3 months the same way Miami treated Wade after 12 years?
DetroitPistons,3do25j,cbosh04,4,Sat Jul 18 03:28:37 2015 UTC,They were signing a 33 year old to a one year deal... We were looking to lock up a young franchise point guard for years to come and hopefully many years after the contract is expired. Squeezing him would have been a bad idea.
DetroitPistons,3do25j,ReginaldKD,2,Sat Jul 18 06:07:38 2015 UTC,"I was talking in terms of the respect shown towards a player. And so us saying that ""we value as much or more as any team in the league"" I just don't see how that could cause a problem with a player. He's gonna pout for 4 years if we found out he was really only valued at 4/50?"
DetroitPistons,3do25j,cbosh04,7,Sat Jul 18 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"Who the hell does /r/nba want us to spend the money on? No bigger player is going to sign here honestly. When a team like us has the chance to sign a player with Jackson's potential, we have to pull the tigger. Plus the fact that this is a 5 year deal with no player option makes it a great deal. All of the other 4/5 year deals with player options are significantly worse than they appear. I feel like more than half of /r/nba's users have no idea how contracts work. Hell even if we are overpaying at first, who cares. We can afford it right now. Then later in the deal it will be considered cheap (assuming he doesn't turn into a complete shit player).   EDIT: Spelling"
DetroitPistons,3do25j,fluffyjdawg,3,Fri Jul 17 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"Just spending money because people won't come is never really a good call. We could always use cap space to absorb salary from other teams looking clear money off of their books. I mean look what Sacramento gave up just to get rid of the Car Landry and Jason Smith Deals. A first, a couple of pick swaps and a top 8 pick a year ago is a pretty decent haul for just taking on contract. Spending just because you have money to spend is never a good idea.  Edit: grammar"

DetroitPistons,3do25j,kirkwilcox,3,Fri Jul 17 23:37:41 2015 UTC,"Understand something - People on the internet love to mock misery and kick people when they're down. You think we're getting it rough - People have been kicking and dumping on the Lakers, Knicks, and Kings like they're getting paid to. I too am guilty. It's fun to joke on other teams shortcomings. And it's more fun when it's a team/organization with a rich history, and/or high standards. In which the Pistons fit that mold along with the Lakers (have both), and Knicks (just have high standards with a laughable history).   So of course, people aren't going to rag on the Raptors for overpaying DeMarre Carroll, or the Suns for overpaying Brandon Knight, because neither of those teams have had much success. And neither team is notorious for constantly goofing up like the Kings or Sixers. The Pistons seem to have all three going - They have three titles, two memorable teams, and have also earned the reputation for making boneheaded moves (overpaying non-stars like Ben Gordon, Charlie V, and Josh Smith, treating Rodney Stuckey as a franchise player before he remotely proved anything, constantly firing coaches, and overall trying to win every year while failing miserably to make the playoffs). I know it's frustrating, but think of it this way - Either Reggie Jackson is going to be a bust, and those fans at r/NBA will be right for scrutinizing the Pistons. Or Reggie Jackson will explode, and watching him excel will feel much more satisfying. Quite frankly, I love that the deal is getting mocked. I love it when people doubt the Pistons."
DetroitPistons,3do25j,EdwardScissorNipples,2,Sat Jul 18 02:59:38 2015 UTC,What if Reggie Jackson turns out to be completely average? Is that not an option?
DetroitPistons,3do25j,kirkwilcox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"That depends. Is an average point guard worth $16 million a season? If not, then I consider the contract to be a bust. A player making that much money should be playing at an above-average level."
DetroitPistons,3do25j,EdwardScissorNipples,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:55:55 2015 UTC,The way I read your comment made it seem like there was no possibility he could amount to the 11th or 10th best point guard in the league. I feel like this isn't as boom or bust as we are making it out to be.
DetroitPistons,3do25j,kirkwilcox,2,Sun Jul 19 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, and it's important to contextualize the fact that there are a ton of quality point guards in the NBA right now. If studs like Rose, Westbrook, Curry, Irving, Conley, Wall, Parker, Lillard, Dragic, and Paul all sustain their level of play (not to mention other stellar guys like Lowry, Lawson, Knight) of course Jackson might have a hard time becoming better than average when ranking amongst fellow point guards. I'll measure his worth by his production and whether or not the Pistons are competitive, not necessarily how he compares to other point guards."
DetroitPistons,3do25j,EdwardScissorNipples,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. We might be a little spoiled with the level 1's are playing at this day and age. It should be at the least, an interesting season for the boys."

DetroitPistons,3doxb8,purpleclouds,5,Mon Jul 20 03:16:54 2015 UTC,Ive heard a lot of Lakers fans are hot on the Pistons this year. Its a nice change of pace from the last half decade or so. Maybe you guys will get lucky and get one last good year out of kobe. Any word on when he is retiring yet? Its gotta happen soon right?
DetroitPistons,3doxb8,cbosh04,4,Sat Jul 18 05:00:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, we don't hope it is actually happening. The reports are saying that this is his last season (even Mitch Kupkchat, the GM of the lakers, said it), but i hope he stays here for at least 2 more years, because so far he hasn't really announced he's retiring. He's hungry for that 6th ring and we all know it. The guy's not a quitter, that's all i can say, even after 20 long seasons. We are hoping for him being injury-free this upcoming season tbh, because we have a solid cast of young players and veterans who could play alongside him if the chemistry is there. Hopefully everything pans out that way and we'll at least be the 8th seed."
DetroitPistons,3doxb8,MrBrink10,8,Sat Jul 18 05:37:17 2015 UTC,You realize if we were to meet in the playoffs that would be the finals? Neither of us is likely to make the playoffs let alone the finals.

DetroitPistons,3doxb8,megavino,7,Sat Jul 18 04:03:25 2015 UTC,"Well, you guys no longer have Artest, and we no longer have Big Ben, so the chances of another Malice drop drastically.  edit: Also, forgot about that vicious hay maker Jermaine O'Neal threw during that whole brawl."

DetroitPistons,3dnsfq,purpleclouds,2,Sat Jul 18 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"We will see if SVG is the ""genius"" we all think he is. I like what he is doing, he understands the realities that free agents won't come here unless we are winning. For the next few years the path to the conference championship will take you 170 miles to the south east and he knows that too. To me that is why he targeted ""Stanimal"", so we have someone that can play D on LeBron."
DetroitPistons,3dnsfq,VanHalenII,2,Sat Jul 18 14:38:17 2015 UTC,Honestly he is the best coach we have had since Larry Brown. Im an Eagles fan and i see similarities between SVG and Chip Kelly. Similar style of coaching in that they are no nonsense type coaches who won't take shit from players but are up front about whats expected of them. They both have great minds for the sport. They have a system that they believe in and can work by plugging in players they feel will fit that system. They want players who want to be here with a team first mentality and want to win as much as they do.

DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,DeuceWallaces,8,Fri Jul 17 15:56:08 2015 UTC,I said 41-48 the other day so I agree with that estimate. Last year was a mess but we went on many great stretches despite several roster moves and injuries.  I like our depth more and our young guys have another year of development.
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,AdrianWillis22,3,Fri Jul 17 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely think we could be a playoff team and somewhere around 45 wins is possible, but just imagine a lineup of Reggie/KCP/Stanley/Ben Simmons/Drummond"
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,swagmaster_,10,Fri Jul 17 11:44:45 2015 UTC,every year in the lottery I hope we get a #1 or #2 pick and every year its the fucking cavs.
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,defeatedmac,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:26:46 2015 UTC,"I forget, who did the cavs draft at 1 or 2 this year?"
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,KristoffersonFox,3,Sat Jul 18 06:41:37 2015 UTC,"For sure it's realistic! If it weren't for our abysmal start and injuries, the team would have been a lot closer to that number of wins.   Also, I could definitley see the entire central division making the playoffs similar to how the southwest did last.  It could happen regardless, but especially if one good team not in our division suffers season destroying injuries like okc last year."
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,straussmasterflex,2,Fri Jul 17 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe slightly too high, I can see the 38-46 win range though, it depends how everyone merges together and how the quality of the east changes(Cleveland, Milwaukee, Washington, Toronto are all viable opponents)"
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,mistermister321,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:36 2015 UTC,I don't know why we are all expecting so low of our squad. I honestly would not be surprised by a break out 50 win season. Although our division has gotten really tough over the past season
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,PrincessDickFart,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:20 2015 UTC,We're gonna win 36.
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,Scentapeed,-5,Fri Jul 17 18:25:31 2015 UTC,It depends on Jennings. If he comes back and is playing anywhere close to how he was playing at the end of last season we will win 50. If he is not able to play at an average level we should just tank. If we can pick up a good PF in this next draft we will be championship contenders.
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,wonderbreadftw,12,Fri Jul 17 12:41:51 2015 UTC,Worst take ever.
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,Ihategeeks,6,Fri Jul 17 14:10:25 2015 UTC,Why don't you tell me why instead of just being a doofus.
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,wonderbreadftw,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"Because our 2nd or 3rd (depending on recovery) point guard coming off a devastating injury that was already replaced LAST season by someone better is not the reason this team should tank or win 50 games.    Also, saying that we draft a superstar PF at this point is very much unlikely going forward because our current roster composition is picking outside the lottery.  This team is an on the bubble playoff team that will be picking 12th at the best (injury permitting).  In every possible way your statement is wrong and you should feel bad."
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,Ihategeeks,5,Fri Jul 17 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"If the difference between tanking and not is Jennings, we're not a PF away from championship contenders."

DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,wonderbreadftw,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"Okay. I'll take KD, AD, or LBJ over all 3 Lowry, Pau, and Klay."
DetroitPistons,3dkrdg,WMUKirk,2,Fri Jul 17 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"See that is crazy to me. You can't rely too heavily on one player. LeBron showed that in this years playoffs. KD plays really good offense but you can't just outgun people. AD is the only viable choice for me. For example, with the Pistons, if Lowry is our 1, Klay is our 2, Stan or KCP at the 3, Pau and Ersan at the 4, and Andre at the 5. That team is a one seed. Just putting AD on this team doesn't hide other weaknesses."
