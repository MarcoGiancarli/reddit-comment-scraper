I used to just let her sleep where ever she wanted until I had to lock the brakes up a couple times and she got real friendly with the dashboard.  Now we keep a dog bed well actually a cat bed one with the tall walls in place with a seatbelt. She just curls up and it keeps her from being thrown around too much in o shit situations.

Dachshund,3dz2hd,Geekatlrg,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:37 2015 UTC,My dachshund gets Separation Anxiety if I leave her alone. Sorry I don’t have the answer for you I just take her everywhere I go. Problem solved!   Some suggestions to try make the environment as stress free as possible eliminate any outside sounds or distractions. Have the tv/radio on toys to play with.  Fans running white noise.   I have herd good things about the Dachshund Anxiety Shirt. thundershirts  Try getting him used to being in the apartment or room alone by himself.  Make him stay in the living room while you’re in the bedroom with the door closed so it’s normal for him to be alone.  In an extreme situation you can crate train him but I am not a fan of it.  But still better than shock bark collar.   I own my own company we have a pet friendly office if you come in and ask for the boss or the owner we just point at my dachshund.   edit for spelling

EDIT: You could also contact www.DachshundDelights.com, they make ""drag bags"" for paralyzed dogs (you may need to email them to make the request, I don't think they're listed on the main webpage). It helps control messes from incontinence, keeps them from getting abrasions from dragging across rough floors, and could at least create a barrier he can't rip off."

I generally have a boot on it but he pulls them off with the bandaging. Maybe if that was on the boot he wouldn't bother it and leave everything alone

Dachshund,3duamd,orangedarkchocolate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:35 2015 UTC,My mom puts a rock in our rescue's food bowl because she scarfs her food down and sometimes makes herself sick. It's a child's fist-sized rock and having to eat around it slows her down. Also at this point it must taste good because sometimes she takes it out of the bowl and we'll find it hidden around the house. Doxies are silly.

Dachshund,3drkzt,LadyXanthe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:34:42 2015 UTC,"When my girl went down I found keeping her crated was worse than having her lay in her bed. The crate is stressful to her, especially when she needs comfort from not feeling well. So for a good 2-3 weeks I kept her nice big bed at my side with her in it everywhere. If I was on the computer the bed was on the desk six inches from my hand. If I was in the kitchen it was six inches from my feet. If she needed out I picked up the bed put it outside and gently helped her potty then carried right back in, in her bed. Her bed even went in our bed, right by my pillow so even the tiniest whimper could wake me so I could be there for her.   My vet was convinced the crate was best but she cried and whimpered and would be restless, even trying to dig out. At least in our case the crate was wrong for us. She healed quickly and made a full recovery. I don't think it would have gone so smoothly if she was constantly stressed from being in a crate."

Dachshund,3dj5cm,tdsears,3,Thu Jul 16 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"""Come with me if you want to live""...he seemed to say."
Dachshund,3dj5cm,Herrmannator,2,Fri Jul 17 01:11:29 2015 UTC,He definitely reminds me of the Governator :)
Dachshund,3dj5cm,carmichael561,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"Is that a choke collar? Dachshunds are prone to tracheal collapse (causes them to feel like their choking- they cough really hard and it can be concerning. You can hear the clicking noise from their throat).  My dachshund uses body harnesses for this reason, if we use a collar she struggles to breath sometimes.  Not judging or anything. Oscar looks like a very handsome orange friend."
Dachshund,3dj5cm,Abrahemp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:29:51 2015 UTC,That's a smooth dachshund.
Dachshund,3dlszw,duillenua,4,Fri Jul 17 08:42:45 2015 UTC,Yep. Mine are safe if they are on the floor but if I've got them up on the couch or something(especially withy toes pointed up) my sweet old lady is all over them.

Dachshund,3dlszw,FhlostonParadise,3,Fri Jul 17 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"The only foot thing our Elvis will do is when we're eating at the dinner table, he'll rest his head on our feet as his way of begging.   My gf's sister's mini dox, Cooper, if you're sitting on the couch, will sit in front of you and put his chest on your feet.  His way of getting chest/belly rubs.  If you try to give him chest/belly rubs with your hands, he gets mad.  Crazy dog."
Dachshund,3dlszw,jg615,3,Fri Jul 17 14:44:05 2015 UTC,Feet? No.  Socks from said feet? Oh boy...
Dachshund,3dlszw,ElecEngGirl,3,Fri Jul 17 15:32:06 2015 UTC,Same with mine!  Your disposed socks are not safe in our house.
Dachshund,3dlszw,dublinjammers,3,Fri Jul 17 19:14:48 2015 UTC,"My doxie loves socks more then anything. When I come home from work she is right by my feet waiting for the socks to come off. If you give her only one, then the whining ensues."

Dachshund,3dlszw,jo4short84,3,Fri Jul 17 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. they are just general lickers though. The feet when its opportune. I think its cause they like the sweat. I'll come home from the gym and they will go crazy licking everywhere. So feet sweat easier, its tasty to them."
Dachshund,3dlszw,omgfloofy,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"When I am eating, he will get into position by stretching out and resting his chin on top of my bare foot.  Then when i get up to take the dirty dishes to the kitchen, he comes alive and tries to catch any scraps falling from the plate (or my lap.)"
Dachshund,3dlszw,yankeehate,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, whenever I allow them to sit on the recliner with me (which is every night) the foot licks start. I don't usually mind until they decide that they need to get in between my toes... that's where I draw the line. In our house the wiener dogs are affectionately known as the foot licking weirdos.  They like feet. They do not know why."
Dachshund,3dkzy6,TheNipstar,4,Fri Jul 17 03:04:33 2015 UTC,"They definitely need one of those rabbits to let them chase, these guys are going half speed."

Dachshund,3d73ck,nursejessika,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:45 2015 UTC,I made the gradual switch starting after he turned a year old. I then had to make several more because his tummy decided corn was the perfect component to make paint pealing gas.
Dachshund,3d73ck,teardrop87,2,Tue Jul 14 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"12 months exactly.  We switched from Blue Buffalo Freedom Chicken Puppy to Blue Buffalo Freedom Chicken adult, over the course of about  7-10 days.  I think it was so successful (no tummy issues) considering it is the same brand/blend. I started with 25% adult 75% puppy for a few days and watched him, then 50/50, then 75% adult 25% puppy, then full adult.  I also add about a 1/4 tsp of coconut oil (unrefined, cold pressed, virgin, organic- ha) and found that has helped his coat and maintaining a healthy weight (as in filling out a bit more- he has the tendency to look a little scrawny, vet says he's fine though)."

Dachshund,3d1dyf,DongleNocker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:38:21 2015 UTC,I googled 'chedder bay biscuits' and found it is an American version of an English scone. In this picture I mean a biscuit that you would dip into your tea in England. I would say it's like a cookie... TIL a biscuit in America is a scone :). Dachshunds love English biscuits...I'm sure they would love scones too :)

Dachshund,3cu5x0,HoustonSass,2,Fri Jul 10 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"I just found this video today of a dachshund taking a leap from the bed. I was reading the comments, some of which were warning people not to let their doxies jump off furniture, when I saw the owner's response:   i have had dachshunds for 19 years and they are all super badass and can jump down from beds without hurting themselves i super promise. Lulu is fierce no jump could hurt her perma-pup spine   This backhanded dismissal rubbed me off the wrong way. I don't want to tell people how to treat their pets but it's a fact that doxies have fragile backs and it saddens me that so many could end up hurt or paralyzed because their owners aren't careful enough. What precautions do you take for your wien's back, if any? Am I overreacting? Haha"

Dachshund,3cbm6l,zombielulz,3,Mon Jul 6 17:22:44 2015 UTC,"Koko always had trouble with strangers but she never really saw any person other than myself or my parents frequently enough for us to try to do anything about it.  The first (and only) exception to that was my girlfriend, now fiancee, who began coming over to visit frequently.  Koko would go ballistic for a few minutes and then calm down once it was apparent my girlfriend wasn't going to murder all of us.  What helped was that my mom would slip my girlfriend a treat who'd then give it to Koko.  She eventually picked up on the fact that girlfriend = treats and we could tell she was genuinely happy to see her when she visited.  The barking never stopped, but it certainly lessened and we eventually just took it to be part of Koko's pattern when my other half came into her territory.  Now I'm not saying you have your dad do continuous positive reinforcement with Gabby, but I'd try to have any positive reinforcement that happens originate with him.  Have him be the one to start feeding her.  Make feeding into a game.  At the same time let her come to him and your mom.  Dogs with problematic pasts need time and space.  Stick with verbal affection rather than physical for the time being.  Be around, but don't hound the dog too much.  Let her come out of her shell to you more."
Dachshund,3cbm6l,hypnofed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:05:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, we try with the treats, but she is honestly just to scared to come close. I talked with my mom a little more and we adopted her from someone who takes in animals from breeders once they're done with them, so they probably didn't treat her the best when they had her. :( I'll pass that on to try getting my dad to soften his voice sometimes and talk with her while he feeds her some snackies. Thanks a bunch!"

Dachshund,3br3hw,threefortyfive,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, one of my personal favorites. That one stumped me for months before I figured out what I was doing wrong. Or rather, what I was doing wrong in the case of my girl. Each one of these little sausage-hounds certainly come with their own distinct concoction of... well, of adorable psychoses. When she was just a few months old, my little doxie fought a titanic battle against a vicious, savage chickadee. That is to say, she happened upon her feathered nemesis who flew off without delay. However, from her reaction, I'm pretty sure that's not how she saw it all go down. From that day forward, whenever a bird dared land in the yard, I knew about it. And so did the rest of the neighborhood. Of course, there were also those times that it wasn't actually a bird, but rather a leaf. And let's not forget about the third thing it would often be: nothing. A write-up will come shortly in the future, but the abbreviated version (yeah, I know, too late) involved a calm acknowledgement of whatever she saw (or didn't see) followed by immediate disinterest. I'll try to document that process sooner rather than later in the event it's useful to anyone. If not, hey, at least it's an amusing account of how I lucked out ;)"
Dachshund,3br3hw,DongleNocker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"How I trained mine to not bite:  First,  have specific rough house time, with toy to tug of war with or something involving the pup using their mouth. Choose some specific play commands for your rough housing time.   When that time is over, don't use the same commands or tones of voice repeatedly unless you want to initiate rough house time.    As for Biting inside and out of play time.  When you feel teeth on skin, scream out pull your hand away and over react.  Lay on the acting real thick.  If they don't get that message, shun them for a few minutes,  don't touch or give the puppy attention until it is calm and not in ""play biting/nip mode.""  The shunning is worse than a beating."
Dachshund,3br3hw,omenking,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"I can tell you what hasn't worked with puppy Otto (22 week old).   Hitting him on the nose. (Don't do that!) Using a spray deterrent or lemon juice. (Ends up biting what doesn't taste like lemon or we end up with it in our mouth) Yelping (This has never worked, pointless to recommend)  What appears to work. Timeouts. He will calm down in his crate and we let him out and he's licking."

Dachshund,3b0z7w,gnomeuser,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:34:49 2015 UTC,He earned his name  early on actually. He was only 2-3 weeks and crawling out of the whelping box so he could feed off of his mom by himself.
Dachshund,3azbxs,auntiechrist23,5,Wed Jun 24 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"He sounds a lot like my dachshund, Mickey. His velcro-ness is part of why we actually went with a Cairn Terrier. We have had a Cairn before and talked to a breeder about the typical behavior of her cairns. They want to be in the same room as you, but aren't cuddlers. They're also energetic, funny little dogs. We knew this would give Mickey a good brother to play with, but less competition when it came to the lap. You may want to check around for a dachshund with more of that personality (a rescue will help) or just be careful to give equal attention and let jack know that there's plenty of space for two on your lap.   For all you know, Jack may velcro himself to his brother as well. That's what Mickey ended up doing with my Cairn"
Dachshund,3azbxs,stopbuffering,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"Although I adore wiener dogs in pairs, I'm definitely open to a different small breed with a complimentary personality. A cairn terrier is an option I hadn't considered. I'd even opt for a sweet little mutt who was friendly, playful, not too anxious, and a bit less clingy than my boy. I think he'd be happier with a dog bro to detract attention from what he perceives as his dog-job... Protecting my lap!"
Dachshund,3azbxs,stopbuffering,2,Thu Jun 25 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"You'd been good with a number of terriers. They tend to be independent dogs. Definitely do your research because there are some that can be velcro dogs. I absolutely love cairns; I would bet you'd have no problem finding a Cairn rescue. If you go mutt, try a terrier mix. I've seen some terrier/Dachshund mixes in rescues near me with great personalities."
Dachshund,3azbxs,EverythingIsKoolAid,3,Thu Jun 25 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"You know Jack. You know what kind of dog Jack would do well with: another dog that is playful and probably low key. I would search for dogs like that in dachshund rescues or even contact one of them to ask if they could find you a dog that could match with your little guy.   I did the first. It worked out super well. I was also really nervous about adding another dog. Winston was the only dog for his entire life (he was 3 then) and I was worried how it would work with another dog. Winston was anxious and submissive, so I looked for a more dominant, but not aggressive, and calm female. I found just that in Maeve.   Granted, it was a bit touch and go at the beginning. Winston tried to still be the boss and Maeve showed him that it wasn't like that anymore (no violence, just posturing). It took about six months for them to be truly comfortable with each other. But now, five years later, they are best friends. They take care of each other and their newer little brother, Remy (adding a third dog is so much easier, btw). ;-)"
Dachshund,3azbxs,hypnofed,3,Wed Jun 24 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"You're totally right... I think Jack would do best with a playful, friendly, but more laid back kind of pup. He would do well with a calmer bro. I'm most interested in a rescue to begin with, so I think it's a good idea to start there. Thank you! :)"
Dachshund,3azbxs,hypnofed,2,Wed Jun 24 23:41:02 2015 UTC,Any friends who might be able to loan you their dog for 3-4 days?  It might be worthwhile to see how Jack does when another little guy moves in.
Dachshund,3azbxs,bonkersquipy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I might offer to watch my inlaws dog Grandma Poodle next time they go out of town... Jack has known Grandma since he was a puppy, so that could help me gauge how he'll interact with a doggy he knows in space he thinks of as his. She's a really sweet, docile little lady who pretty much let's his little bossy buns run the place. He usually only sees Grandma Poodle at my inlaws place, so trying our place might work!"
Dachshund,3azbxs,jvfricke,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"Just be sure to give them LOTS of chaperoning at first to see how it goes!  If he doesn't like it, a few baby gates to keep them apart for a few days will solve things for the duration.  There might be a difference between a totally new dog and one he's known for a long time, so I'd keep that in mind too."

Dachshund,3ax0ot,AverageAlaskan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:50:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't sure if she had been taken or not. I feel that she slipped out the doggie door and out the side gate when they had it open. They closed the gate when leaving so my first thought was she had no way out so they must have taken her. Thankfully they didn't because I probably would not have her sitting next to me now!!

Dachshund,3awakk,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 24 05:20:40 2015 UTC,"Merguez:       Merguez /mɛərˈɡɛz/ is a red, spicy mutton- or beef-based fresh sausage in Amazigh (Berber) North African cuisine. It is also popular in the Middle East and Europe, having become particularly popular in France by the closing decades of the twentieth century.  Merguez is a sausage made with uncooked lamb, beef, or a mixture stuffed into a lamb-intestine casing. It is heavily spiced with cumin and chili pepper or harissa (which gives it its characteristic piquancy and red color) as well as other spices such as sumac, fennel, and garlic.  Merguez is usually eaten grilled. Dried merguez is used to add flavor to tagines. It is also eaten in sandwiches and with french fries.

Dachshund,3ariz4,MISSNerdBerger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"I did not handle our boys getting fleas very well.  We used one of those drops that goes on the back of the neck, I forget what it's called but it was one that only did fleas and ticks, no worms.  Then a day and a half later I bathed them with ""Exelpet"" flea control shampoo. This was long enough for the topical ointment on their neck to soak in. While they were being bathed and locked outside I got their bedding and the couch covers and washed them with HOT water. I vacuumed the entire house like never before, systematically and in every nook and cranny.  Finally I got a fleaban powder by the same brand and put it on their bed and in the crevices of the couch. It's safe to use as a flea treatment on your pet, you just apply it, comb it through, then towel off any excess.  I chose this stuff because it contains ""Pyrethrins"" which I heard works well. It did work well. Apart from a few very lazy looking fleas struggling across the couch or the dogs belly for a day or two after, we have not had any fleas. Yay!  It went on for about a month. When we first noticed the fleas we did the neck thing like the pet supply store told us to, but it didn't work. When we went back and asked about it they told us that it ""just needed time to work"". Well it had been a month and I thought that was ridiculous so I went on the attack. Boom. No more fleas."

Dachshund,3ariz4,sempronialou,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"He might scratch for awhile yet due to flea induced dermatitis.  The saliva causes inflamation in some dogs, hair loss too."
Dachshund,3ariz4,sempronialou,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:16:07 2015 UTC,"I had to deal with this a few years ago.  My dachshund got them, but also spread it to our cats.  I used the frontline plus on each pet, and used the furniture spray that kills the fleas, the eggs and larva as well.  I sprayed around the yard as well with another spray.  I had make sure the pets weren't in the room I was spraying in.  I only had to do the spray one time.  Then I vacuumed each day on the floor and furniture, but had to throw out the bag each time.  Each pet got flea combed each day until I saw no more.  When flea combing, I had a cup of hot water and dawn to kill the live fleas.  I dipped the comb in the water/dawn after a few strokes, wiped it with a paper towel in between.  The cat loved the flea combing.  My dachshund was patient.  I washed all the bedding and such in hot water.  Even the curtains because the cat hung around the windows.  The vet tech said it'd take 2-3 months to completely kill the flea life cycle even with the frontline and such.  She was right.  About 2 months later we were done with them.  That's why I stayed on top of flea combing to check them, and vacuumed often.  Our cat got it the worst and took longer to get rid of.  My dachshund didn't have signs of them after 2 weeks, but I still checked her often.    After that, I put my dachshund on sentinel instead of a regular heartworm pill.  Then I had to switch to trifexis after sentinel haunted production.  We never had flea issues ever again.  I still get nervous when I see the cat scratching."

Dachshund,3aovi9,Realmenhavecurves,3,Mon Jun 22 12:36:52 2015 UTC,"I very rarely see healthy dachshunds under 12-13lbs, I know they exist but I hardly ever see them. My girl is about 15 (should be 13) and she's considered a standard. I've been to lots of dachshund-centric events and she's average sized so as far as I'm concerned outside of the show ring there are very few explicitly miniatures or standards."

I've seen a lot smaller; my bf's sister has a super mini who weighs literally 2lbs. Hell, a girl I went to school with had two standards and they were obese and freakin' huge.   My dog is a little bit overweight (2-3lbs), but we attribute it to her age. She's 10 or 11 now and she's still very active, but definitely less than when she was a puppy.

Dachshund,3ae3jk,nnp31,5,Fri Jun 19 11:07:19 2015 UTC,"Walks are really your best bet for dachshunds. Their little legs have a hard time running even short distances and it isn't great for their backs. If you want to help them with their endurance, walking is the way to go. If you want to help them lose weight, feeding them less is your best bet. It's like people: slow and steady weight loss is what you are aiming for. They make specific food for weight loss and you may even want to discuss the best way to do this with your vet."
Dachshund,3ae3jk,EverythingIsKoolAid,2,Fri Jun 19 12:54:49 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Dachshund,3ae3jk,EverythingIsKoolAid,2,Fri Jun 19 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"No problem! I don't know if there are any hiking or nature trails around where you are, but my dachshunds absolutely love walking on nature trails. We've had a lot of fun exploring new trails and enjoying nature."
Dachshund,3ae3jk,digiblur,2,Fri Jun 19 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Nope, we are a city family :) I'll take them on walks very regularly and also look for the weight loss food.  I just freaked out when I compared pictures from November and June, poor little creatures :'("
Dachshund,3ae3jk,jg615,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:17:55 2015 UTC,I also recommend the walking as well. Fast paced walk for you is a pretty good pace for those short doxie legs. Cut back their feeding a bit in slow steps. Most doxies will eat and eat as long as there is food down.

Dachshund,3acdp4,solinaceae,3,Thu Jun 18 23:26:56 2015 UTC,"I've been through this and I never really figured it out.  My Violet managed to get out of the diapers no matter what.  I gave up and used to those washable bed pads that you see in nursing homes.  I put those on the floor and in her bed under her, and I was able to deal with leaking and incontinence issues better.  All I had to do was wash the pads and put a new one down.  I also was hyper vigilant about getting her outside at regular intervals when I was home.  We made it work."
Dachshund,3acdp4,sempronialou,2,Fri Jun 19 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. Did any wrapping work for when she was moving around, or sitting on laps? At this point, we've been using disposable training pads all over the floor in her area, and under anything she's sitting on. But it gets tough when she wants to walk around or sit on laps."
Dachshund,3acdp4,chidoxie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"http://www.petsupermarket.com/products/petsupermarket/pid-102710582.aspx?pn=disposable%20diapers  This is the one I use from simple solution,  I will say though because mine is a mini, and she's really skinny,  it doesn't fit quite right. The next size up would be too big for her, she has a small waist,  and big hips which makes it difficult to use.  I would also recommend getting the liners for them if she's having leaks. They don't hold much liquid and has to be washed constantly. She doesn't try to take it off , but it makes her walk odd."
Dachshund,3acdp4,Tom-ocil,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"My dachshund was recently diagnosed with a UTI, and I also had trouble finding diapers that fit. I forget if it was somebody here or on Facebook, but the best suggestion I heard was to buy a pair of little boys briefs and use that as a diaper.  What you do is put a panty liner/other absorbent material inside the briefs, and use the front flap for the tail hole and then tie off any excess elastic with a hair scrunchie. My Roxy got medication before we could try this, so it was never necessary, but it seems like it'd be more secure than just a doggy diaper."

If it is just food allergies avoid wheat, corn, chicken and turkey. Those are all the most common allergens for dogs. I make my own dog food every two weeks and just freeze portions. If your willing to make her food. Use beef or salmon as a protein source. Rice and barley for carbs and fiber and add in some veggies. I rotate between a bunch of veggies. As for treats I only give her fresh fruit and veggies. She loves green beans and apples. Also ask your vet is you can try human allergy medicine. My vet has me give ailia half a zertech in the morning and half a benadryl at night. I hope you find something that works. I know how much it sucks to watch your pup suffer."
Dachshund,39s4ej,DoxieWigglebutt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:24:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.  I think we are going to start making her food. We have found a few recipes that we are going to try.

Dachshund,39s4ej,yankeehate,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:13:36 2015 UTC,Have you considered a raw diet? Maybe a mixture of beef and lamb? It might be something to ask your vet.
Dachshund,39rlwz,BartenderPleases,2,Sun Jun 14 02:02:45 2015 UTC,Could you leave her food out for 10 minutes and if she doesn't eat just take it away? Give her food next scheduled feeding time and repeat until she's hungry enough to realize that's what she's going to get.

Dachshund,39rlwz,sempronialou,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:09:24 2015 UTC,"When my dog was finicky about eating in her younger days, my dad put a treat in her bowl.  She ate it and then ate the rest of her food.  She ate human food as well, but she liked to eat her food and let me know when it was time to feed her.  Yes, that meant we had to put a treat in her bowl because she expected it, but that was okay.  Eventually I was able to phase out the treat.  You could also try changing the brand of food.  Do you feed her on a schedule or is she free fed?  If she is free fed, maybe you could schedule her meals."
Dachshund,39rlwz,adean83,2,Sun Jun 14 03:09:09 2015 UTC,I always feed her on a schedule. Once in the morning and another time when we get back from work. then we usually take her on a long walk.  I'll try the treat trick. thanks!
