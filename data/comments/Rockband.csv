Rockband,3e67fe,Drihscol,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:50:55 2015 UTC,"Customs skirt a lot of legal issues.  They aren't licences for distribution or sale, and at the very least you're downloading an MP3 that's illegally shared.  That said, if you own the song already, you've at least supported the artist already.  Will anyone really care? Probably not, other than what you have to do to the consoles to get it to work."
Rockband,3e4v81,Ziyad786,4,Tue Jul 21 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"I recently replaced my Ion brain with a used Alesis Trigger IO + Midi Pro Adapter.  My Ion pads are much better than before, I wish I had done it sooner!  It certainly costs more and takes some time to set up, but it's worth it."

Rockband,3e4vor,DoctorKs,9,Tue Jul 21 23:47:50 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that old cymbals will work with new drums, but new (and improved) cymbals will not work with old drums."
Rockband,3e4vor,NemoEsq,3,Wed Jul 22 00:00:11 2015 UTC,This is correct!
Rockband,3e4vor,metroidmen,2,Wed Jul 22 00:57:52 2015 UTC,Are they releasing a set of cymbals for the new kit?
Rockband,3e4vor,GremboZavia,3,Wed Jul 22 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, they've said so multiple times...although you may have noticed nothing is up for sale on that area yet. Hopefully they don't back out like they did with the other colors for the instruments."
Rockband,3e4vor,NemoEsq,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"Bah, so another thing i've got to keep my eye on.   I'm already torn between buying the full RB4 band bundle or going for the RB3 Pro Kit, my old RB2 guitar + RB4 software, second option would be cheaper but without more information about the dongle etc. I'm clueless :/  Hopefully we'll know more soon."
Rockband,3e4vor,GremboZavia,2,Wed Jul 22 02:54:57 2015 UTC,Old cymbals have been officially confirmed to work on new drums. There was a MadCatz video that showed off the hardware that went into length about this situation.
Rockband,3e4o9p,zrambler,4,Tue Jul 21 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"I would suggest using auto calibration if you can (if you have a guitar with the sensors).  Otherwise, you're going to have to wing it. It not only varies with TV and what mode is used (some have different processing modes that affect latency), but every connected device in the chain, so if you have a stereo/receiver between the console and TV, it will affect things too.  You might try looking around on avsforum.com in the appropriate subforum for your TV and see if someone has posted some information, too. There's usually a thread dedicated to each model/line of new TV that comes out to discuss features, calibration (video, not timing though), etc."
Rockband,3e4o9p,biosehnsucht,3,Tue Jul 21 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm gonna make any friends by saying this, but manual calibration is only as good as you are. You've gotta be tight. Granted, it's not gonna be perfect. But it's an easy thing to slip up with. That's all there is to it, really. I've seen my friends struggle with this more than a few times."
Rockband,3e4o9p,The_Pert_Whisperer,3,Wed Jul 22 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"I can give you my method for calibrating drums.  Make sure you turn on game mode on the TV if you have it.  If you're playing drums, I find it best to turn off Dolby Digital, it causes more lag during fills (if you have them turned on).  I usually start out with Calibrate Manually by hitting the pads to the audio/video cues on the screen just to get a ballpark figure.  I've NEVER been happy with the numbers it gives me.  At that point I do a lot of trial and error going between practice mode and the Enter Calibration Numbers screen.  The first number determines where the note is in relation to the bar at the moment it gets hit.  Lower is closer, higher is further away.  The second number is basically your timing window in relation to the song itself, how early or late you play.  Lower is earlier, higher is later."
Rockband,3e4o9p,IBitePrettyHard,2,Tue Jul 21 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"Never had much luck with it, myself. I always did the auto one.  And that relies on my reflexes basically, so it doesn't work so well. :P So yeah, not sure. Good luck though."
Rockband,3e4o9p,Rizaria,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"Buddy I think has the same tv. Game mode is a must. And if I recall, you have to reset game mode every time you change the input. Don't react to the sound on screen, time it so it is in sync.  Eye of the tiger expert guitar is my check song to see if it's on point."
Rockband,3e4o9p,Nick08f1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:30:07 2015 UTC,Inputlagdatabase.com?  Not sure how to test the audio. I would just recommend switching on game mode and using the calibration tool within the game.
Rockband,3e4o9p,fatalmedia,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:40:41 2015 UTC,"Best way I've ever found to manually calibrate (since the autocalibration on the guitars have never gotten it quite right for me) is this video. He explains how calibration in Rockband actually works, and describes a good way to get tight calibration.  I typically always pick an easy song that I can play without looking and has a consistent beat, often Pork and Beans by Weezer. Then I'll calibrate the video by muting the TV/speakers and calibrating purely by sight. Next, I'll unmute and play with my back turned or with my eyes closed and periodically open them to see how early/late I'm hitting in order to calibrate the audio. It helps to have another person there to tell you if you're hitting early/late as well.  Once I feel like I have good numbers for a simple song, I'll play some Impossible tier song to make sure everything feels right. Also, as others have said, game mode is a must if your TV has it.  EDIT: Oops, I forgot to mention that I always start with a value of 20/20. Technically that's 0/0 in Rockband 3, I believe. I forget why though... >.>"
Rockband,3e2qy4,ducro,4,Tue Jul 21 14:42:40 2015 UTC,I recommend you start off with a Rockband 2 stock or Beatles stock drum kit to start unless you really want to spend the extra money and get an ion drum kit. I purchased one back in 2012 and it still works flawlessly so its def worth the investment. At the moment there is no word on the legacy adapter for the Xbox One or PS4 (so I'm pretty bummed) but Rockband 4 looks like it'll be amazing. If you have any questions about the ion drum rocker go ahead and ask away :)
Rockband,3e2qy4,ItsMeKidd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:51 2015 UTC,Whats your opinion on the new drum set released with Rocknand 4? What makes the Rockband 2 drum set superior? Thank you!
Rockband,3e2qy4,jimbonics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"Whats your opinion on the new drum set released with Rocknand 4?   I don't think anyone really knows yet, since they're likely still being manufactured. However, word is that there isn't much deviation from the RB 2/3 kits.    What makes the Rockband 2 drum set superior?   Nothing. I think his idea is to start you off with the cheapest base-model to get you started, kinda like your first car is supposed to be a junker."
Rockband,3e2qy4,MLC2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"The RB2 drum set is superior to the RB1 set because the pads and extremely quieter and they support the pro cymbal add on, if thats something you want to pursue."
Rockband,3e2qy4,ItsMeKidd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:48 2015 UTC,I have no idea on the RB4 kit besides it looking the exact same and maybe just a bit updated version of TB kit. In one of the recently released videos that took place at e3 you can see the drum pad peeling up and bubbling. Like the usual stock kits. I play expert pro drums and that's one of the reasons I invested in a e-kit.
Rockband,3e2qy4,FinsterFolly,2,Wed Jul 22 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, go stock until you are good enough to realize that it is holding you back. Then you are probably going to wanta better kick pedal. Hopefully there will be a secondary market like the Drum Rocker. Then ions with pintech cymbals. At least that was my path with Rockband 1,2,3. Still waiting to see about the ions and RB4."
Rockband,3e2qy4,ItsMeKidd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:45:52 2015 UTC,That's the setup I currently own. Ions with 3 pin tech cymbals
Rockband,3e2qy4,AR-47,2,Wed Jul 22 07:36:30 2015 UTC,"What's the best Drum Set to start and practice with?     Rock Band 2 kit.  The one with the black pads.  These have cymbal expansion connections.    If I intend to go Expert should I buy a Pro Drum Set right away or am I able to expand the regular one?    Not a huge difference.  The main thing to learn is limb independence, and cymbals won't make that any easier or harder.    And what's up with these E-Drums and Midikits I read about? Are they worth the money for a casual-to-serious gamer like me?     If you want to get into actual drumming, you could buy a cheap e-kit and the midi adaptor.  Not useful unless you want to play actual drums."
Rockband,3e2qy4,zptc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"alright, thank you for your detailed answer! :)"
Rockband,3e2qy4,valeforXD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"Currently we don't know if the midi adapter will be supported or not. Last I heard was ""not at launch"" since wireless only will be supported at launch. Hold off on the e-kit for now."
Rockband,3e2qy4,Paimun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely get the RB2 drum kit to start with. It's a little quieter, less prone to breaking and has the necessary ports for the cymbal expansion. I wouldn't know about the other two questions - I've never played pro drums or a midi kit."
Rockband,3e2v9k,gcooldude,5,Tue Jul 21 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, no one does."
Rockband,3e2v9k,thefury500,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:49 2015 UTC,Well. There's probably a couple people at Harmonix who have a general outline of how it will go.
Rockband,3e2v9k,ohsnapitsjf,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:35 2015 UTC,It sounds like they'll have it so you can simply tell it to download all your stuff in game.  But I'm guessing we'll have to wait till close to release.
Rockband,3e2v9k,Bront20,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not too concerned overall with how the export will go, that has always been the least painful thing. So has the price of the export licenses.  What I am concerned about is how many existing songs will port over and IF RB3 will export."
Rockband,3e2v9k,ihaveneverbeenhappy,2,Wed Jul 22 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, just waiting for news about RB3 export here too."
Rockband,3e2v9k,GremboZavia,2,Wed Jul 22 03:01:53 2015 UTC,Downloading about 1000 songs in a variety of packs and singles could be painful if there's no tool or the RB Store doesn't help.
Rockband,3e2v9k,Bront20,2,Wed Jul 22 08:32:05 2015 UTC,"I suspect it will simply read your purchase history for Rock Band, and then you will be permitted to download from the RB4 store (many of) the tracks that are tied to your XBL/PSN account.  I don't think there's been a confirmation that ALL the DLC tracks will be available for redownload, but I imaging most of them will be."
Rockband,3e2v9k,Avengerr,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"If I were to design this, I would start by being able to define content that can exist in both PS3/360 and PS4/One stores, but have different packages when downloaded depending on platform you download it on.   This is useful in other areas, for example Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibilty on Xbox One - digital titles can be downloaded based on previous purchases on 360, but you don't get just the original 360 package, you get it wrapped in an emulator to run it on the One.  This is also extendible to cross-buy for Windows 10 / Xbox / Windows Phone implementation, which is why I suspect the final solution is similar to this.  Similarly, you could have DLC that exists in both old and current generation stores but grouped as a single purchasable item, and you get the platform specific version when you download it so when downloading on Xbox 360 you get the RB2/3 content and on Xbox One you get RB4 content, etc."
Rockband,3e2v9k,biosehnsucht,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:34:14 2015 UTC,That's on the console makers end.
Rockband,3e2v9k,Bront20,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:33:15 2015 UTC,I would expect it to be an authoring tool exposed to the developer but yes it would be built by the console maker.  There is something similar at least for doing universal windows apps but I'm not sure how closely the workflows and structure line up with what I described.
Rockband,3e2v9k,biosehnsucht,2,Wed Jul 22 08:40:44 2015 UTC,"RB1 export was a full download, so that should be easy.  RB2 was just a key you entered and then you could download the tracks. RB3, I'm hoping will be available soon or eventually at a cost if possible. And Blitz should be free."

I've always loved Rock Band... bought all the games, bought lots of DLC and have been super hyped for RB4 since announcement. Never really played Guitar Hero, but I pre-ordered GH:Live for 150AUD.  Ordering just the guitar bundle for RB4 from the US would be 175AUD plus postage... a bit more than GHL, but maybe justifiable. Except none of my DLC would work, so that's not happening.  From the UK, where my DLC would work with it? 230AUD plus postage. I can't justify $100+ over Guitar Hero for something very similar, but I really want Rock Band. Not sure what my options are now."

Rockband,3dv8su,mazegeek999,2,Mon Jul 20 06:46:47 2015 UTC,"So were the previous ones any good? I have an Ion kit in the garage... the pads are kinda shitty but usable, and it only has 2 (shitty) cymbals, and the pedal broke. So I'd need at least 1 cymbal and a new pedal, but probably 3 cymbals, pedal and pad upgrades.  So, with that in mind, are the normal RB drums worth buying, or do they not hold up to pretty high-level expert gameplay?"
Rockband,3dv8su,G3ck0,2,Mon Jul 20 08:20:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen so many opinions on this I don't know what to make of it. I got the TBRB drums + 3 cymbals kit. Reinforced it (read: put screws in) the legs. Never seen any bubbling or failure. I then upgraded to an e-Kit so I sold the TBRB kit. Then I moved and had to get rid of the e-kit and I'm back on another TBRB kit + cymbals, again with the screws to reinforce it. No bubbling, no problems. Can you play the game and enjoy the game with game kits? Absolutely. Considering you can find these used on Craigslist for cheap and in thrift stores even cheaper, it's worth it - specially if you don't have the several hundred dollars or the space for an e-kit."

Rockband,3dx0gx,IBitePrettyHard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:02:26 2015 UTC,Are there any hiphop/rap charts for drums that are both challenging and fun?  If so lemme know!
Rockband,3dwf7q,BigBananaDealer,8,Mon Jul 20 02:29:38 2015 UTC,"iirc, intentional decision owing to the fact that they weren't sure what the right/safe charting amount for plastic drums would be. Several other charts also have notes dropped from quick doubles.  WDoA in particular, though, I believe it's because the roll is a triggered sample."
Rockband,3dwf7q,espher,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, WDoA's roll was in a different stem, so it wasn't charted.  They admitted it when they released the updated RB3 version.  I've heard both ends where they intenionally undercharted or they did not and it was just lack of drum charting experience.  Given it only effects a few songs, I'm guessing it was an intentional design choice that changed at some point.  But WDoA had a specific reason it wasn't charted."
Rockband,3dwf7q,Bront20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:55 2015 UTC,"Personally, I noticed it right before the chorus in Panic Attack. Feels much more fair than giving us a random amount of notes."
Rockband,3dwlxx,HvyMetalComrade,7,Mon Jul 20 03:31:42 2015 UTC,"In the GH community, everyone bashes on RB because they can't hit notes. Why? Because they don't know how to play them on time, and don't take the time to get good. The RB3 engine is weird, but it's my favorite out of any rhythm game. I've played both RB and GH for 7 or 8 years, and I've never had issues with switching between engines. Make sure you calibrate it to your liking (my game tells me it's like -20/30 or something when I play best with 20/25).   Since it's your first time switching, I recommend getting it calibrated to when you strum. From there, HOPOs should react the same way as your strums. The better you get at RB3, the more you'll improve all around. The only windows you can abuse in RB3 are the strumming windows, which everything over a 32nd or something is ""ignored"". Example: Green Grass and High Tides Solo 2e, if you strum the orange string of notes faster than they appear on screen, you'll still combo regardless.   If you have any questions man, feel free to ask.  EDIT: Assuming you played GH3 a lot, HOPOs in RB3 don't have the infinite back end that GH3 had (you could hold your note down waaaay before the HOPO came up and it'd still hit it)."
Rockband,3dwlxx,Plumato,2,Mon Jul 20 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"Haha well it's not even close to me first time switching, I've just always had the problem and wondered if there might be an easy solution. I've been playing GH2, 3 and GH:Warriors of Rock a lot lately but recently got a drumkit so started playing RB again, and found it to be a bigger deal than I remember. I'll try calibrating it and seeing if it changes anything, and I order a rock band guitar as well so we'll see if that changes anything either."
Rockband,3dwlxx,Plumato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:35:41 2015 UTC,"I've always used GH Guitars on rb lol. I guess it also depends on your tv. You get used to everything after 7-8 years, so that could also be it."

GH1 was absurdly precise to the point where nobody even uses hopos in it, you just have to strum everything (that's why that Buckethead song was so ridiculous to FC).

Sorry wasn't exactly clear, but I just meant the hopos.    GH2 and RB3 are pretty close in terms of hopo windows, I think. GH3 is where they got the huge back end so you could press the next button pretty much immediately on them and it hardly mattered how much time was between the notes.    In terms of just overall windows, yeah any rb game is definitely tighter than any GH game."
Rockband,3dwlxx,Calibration_God,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:14 2015 UTC,"It's not just that the window is smaller.  The window is essentially identical in Rb1/2 as in GH2.  Reading the circles compared to reading the rectangles is just worse for some people.  I was a monster at GH2, and while I'm still good at rockband, my ability with the rectangles is very unreliable.  I couldn't be competitive on guitar in RB."
Rockband,3dwlxx,Rizaria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you but that's just the size of the windows. It takes a tiny bit of getting used to one vs. the other, but the reality is no matter how good you get at RB, you're always going to be better at GH.     Like, I'm miles and miles and miles and miles better now than I was back when i played GH3 a lot... but I still couldn't play some of the stuff I could back then if you put it on a RB engine, even if you made them appear the same."
Rockband,3dwlxx,Bront20,3,Tue Jul 21 06:45:28 2015 UTC,"As everyone said, RB's timing window is incredibly smaller, and not even comparable to the exploitation of GH titles released after 2. RB 1 & 2 would be similar to GH 1&2, but RB3 would be a little more lenient but, not in comparison to Gh3. For me, personally, if I play GH for a few hours, and try to play RB immediately after. I crash and burn. It takes a bit to resume the same mindset for the engine. Just keep that in mind but, once you make it past getting use to the engine, it's incredible :-)"
Rockband,3dwlxx,valeforXD,2,Mon Jul 20 04:09:16 2015 UTC,"Long time Guitar Hero player here, recent switch to RB due to song library and the deadness of GH.  I had this problem too. The note detection definitely feels different, I feel like there's less leeway than in GH. So you need to get used to the rhythm, speed and the notes more. Even so, I definitely do get lag, sometimes a huge spike where the song buggers up. But I feel that's a PS3 problem, in my case.    basically, if your controller still works fine with GH but not with RB, it's more likely you just need to get used to how RB is played. It's not quite the same, and I'd agree with you and say it's worse. But there's nothing you can do about that.  You're mentioning hammer ons in particular though...far as I can tell, they function the same way. So I'd say your timing is just off. Keep at it."

Rockband,3dsbgx,djx1100,18,Sat Jul 18 23:55:14 2015 UTC,I thought the strum bar already made hardly any noise as it was. Gh guitars are generally the clicky strum ones. Are you sure you dont mean the frets? Those can be pretty loud on RB guitars

Rockband,3dsbgx,kerminsr,12,Sun Jul 19 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"Biased?  It's common knowledge.   A lot of people even prefer the GH guitars because of the clicky strum bar. I've seen a lot of people bash the RockBand guitar because Harmonix decided to make it with a silent strum bar instead one that makes an audible click like the Guitar Hero controllers always had.   It's actually been quite a divisive topic. Some of the players are happy with the silent RB strum bar,  but more people seem to hate it and stick with their GH controllers.  So yeah.  You think people are talking shit about GH by saying their strum bars are louder, but a lot of people prefer the louder strum. So you think they're talking whit about GH by listing one of the things people like about the guitar?"
Rockband,3dsbgx,Runefall,-20,Sun Jul 19 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't consider this argument until you brought to me a fallacy.

Rockband,3dsbgx,LumpyArryhead,9,Sun Jul 19 09:02:01 2015 UTC,"Stop. You're wrong. GH strum bars have clickers, RB strum bars do not.    It's not bashing, having the clickers is preferred by most people."

Rockband,3dsbgx,LumpyArryhead,5,Sun Jul 19 09:31:57 2015 UTC,"Pick up a guitar hero guitar. Strum it.    Pick up a rock band guitar. Strum it.    If you still can't see the difference, go look into hearing aids.    This isn't some random shit someone made up. It's the simple reality that absolutely everyone that's played with both knows. It's not just sound, either, you can feel the resistance/click.     I mean, you can literally just take the damn things apart and see for yourself. The clicker is a little plastic thingy with a metal ""spring"" which is just a little L shaped tab under it. You can take out the metal if you don't like the click, and it now works just like a rock band guitar."
Rockband,3dsbgx,Runefall,-16,Sun Jul 19 09:40:44 2015 UTC,"Nope. My guitar hero guitars sound exactly the same as my rock band guitars.  If your guitars are different - sure, cool - but mine sound exactly the same."

Rockband,3dsbgx,aWiseMoose,2,Sun Jul 19 10:27:42 2015 UTC,"You're fucking retarded.  Let's just look at the hardware involved in the strumming mechanisms for both a Guitar Hero guitar and a Rock Band guitar.  A Guitar Hero guitar registers strums when a physical button is pushed down inside the guitar.  When the button actuates, there is a small piece of metal inside the button that clicks.  Rock Band guitars don't have that metal that clicks.  When Rock Band guitars make contact, there are actually little rubber pads to dampen the already quiet noise.  I am absolutely floored that this is even an argument.  If you hand literally anybody a GH guitar and an RB guitar, 10 out of 10 times, they will choose the RB guitar as the quietest."
Rockband,3dsbgx,Runefall,-12,Sun Jul 19 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"I understand that. That's not my point. I'm just waiting for someone to provide proof, as I asked.  God, ignorance."

Rockband,3drrv0,Gigakoops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:43:57 2015 UTC,"So, I'm a big Lit fan. To be honest, I never pay attention to these threads but now of course I'm excited. What does this mean, is Over My Head now available to download for RB? I'm not at home right now so can't boot up the game until wednesday when I'll be back from holiday. I hope I won't miss out on this!"
Rockband,3drrv0,Brokeit,2,Sat Jul 18 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"As the title suggests, this is about custom songs, not official DLC. You can go to customcreators.com and download these customs for free, put them on your Xbox Flash Drive, load Title Update 4 (since TU5 disables customs) and play away."

Rockband,3dp6me,socomman,2,Sat Jul 18 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised by the Amazon sales ranking of GH Live.  Activision has been marketing the hell out of it.  Every time I go into Gamestop for even 5 minutes, I'll see an ad for GH Live play on the TV in the store.  I would guess that Guitar Hero has really lost its core audience, the kind of people that would preorder the game.  I'm interested to see what happens when the games are finally released.  Guitar Hero still has more brand recognition with the general population.   When the average person sees a guitar controller, they think: ""Guitar Hero!"" And the bundle is only $100 (I know RB4 will have a guitar bundle, but I think the band kit will get more shelf space).   So when xmas comes around, mom's gonna go into Gamestop and see the $100 GH Live bundle next to the RB4 $250 bundle and they'll probably get Guitar Hero.    It's too bad that HMX doesn't seem to have the marketing budget they used to have when they were owned by MTV Games."
Rockband,3dp6me,kerminsr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:13:08 2015 UTC,i agree i wonder if activision is panicking.
Rockband,3dp6me,kerminsr,0,Sat Jul 18 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they are.  RB4 is selling almost purely on word-of-mouth with almost no advertising.  GHLive preorders aren't doing as well, even though they've had a huge marketing campaign.  I'm actually really interested in trying the new GH controller.  My favorite thing about Guitar Hero was learning how to play, seeing my progression from one day to the next.  I think it's a good idea for them to introduce the new guitar, I'll be able to recapture that feeling I got when I first learned to play GH.  IMHO they should have given it 8 buttons instead of 6 though.  And whoever thought it would be a good idea to use video footage instead of a graphics engine.....yeah they should be fired.  If I end up liking the game it will be in spite of the graphics, not because ""it makes you feel like you're really there!""  I'll buy GH Live, but I'll probably wait until the price of the bundle drops below $60.  Depending on how poorly it sells, that could be really soon."
Rockband,3dp6me,necrosteve028,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm in the other boat, I won't buy it. I don't like the colour scheme (black & white is very dull and confusing in such a small space), I don't like the 2 rows of buttons. I couldn't care less about a live audience, I think they wasted their time with that. I just want good charts & good music except they haven't catered to the existing GH community so it isn't worth my time. Most people just want to stick with their 5 frets so they pick Rock Band."
Rockband,3dp6me,harveyglobetrot,0,Mon Jul 20 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree about the video background (whether the live crowd or the music video backgrounds). Seems like it would be awesome if this was 20 years ago, but now it just seems like a weird styling decision."
Rockband,3dp6me,AR-47,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:36 2015 UTC,Rock Band's community is the reason they managed to release so much DLC.  It's also what Harmonix wants to support them since RB4 is a platform while GH is simply a cash grab.  Guitar Hero Live probably won't have much of a community to support them.
Rockband,3dp6me,toymachinesh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:26:27 2015 UTC,"lol ""core audience"" of Guitar Hero. It never existed after GH3, it's just a bunch of people that complained from 2008-2010, good riddance."
Rockband,3dn1t0,therealf1r3wa11,15,Fri Jul 17 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"For people at work, here is the forum post:  Hey gang,   For 7 years I’ve been fortunate enough to spend most of my time working with the community on the Harmonix forums, the Rock Band Twitter and Facebook accounts, and at live events. I have been lucky to be on the front lines with some of the most enthusiastic fans, for some of the best party games ever made, so that makes it all the harder to say that today is my last day at Harmonix.   I joined Harmonix in early 2008, just a few weeks after Rock Band shipped. I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. Since then I’ve served as a Community Manager for every Rock Band release, and have had at least some small role in supporting the Dance Central franchise, Disney Fantasia: Music Evolved, VidRhythm, Record Run, A City Sleeps, the Amplitude Kickstarter, and a few projects that never were, and a few that are still yet to be.   Since 2008 I’ve demoed Harmonix games in over a dozen states and seven countries. I posted 192 Rock Band DLC announcements. I’ve even been able to help a few community members propose to their significant others both in game and on stage.  I’ve played The Beatles: Rock Band with Tom Hanks, talked about Dance Central choreography with Suge Knight, and explained Rock Band 4’s Freestyle Guitar Solos to WWE’s World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins. I’ve been on QVC, the red carpet at the VMAs, and I’ve set up The Beatles: Rock Band at a McCartney concert at Fenway Park. I’ve played bass on songs by The Police while Sting watched, I’ve seen The Who in sound check, and I’ve played “Here Comes The Sun” at Abbey Road.   As exciting and surreal as those moments have been, 90% of my job has been talking to the community, passing along your feedback, and advocating for the things you’ve asked for. The Rock Band social accounts were the first thing I checked almost every morning and the last thing I checked almost every night. That’s not something that was in my job description, or something that someone told me I had to do… it was something that I enjoyed doing because Rock Band has such an amazing, dedicated, and unbelievably passionate community. I’ve loved the time I’ve spent as your Community Manager, and I’m going to miss it.   That said, I can’t wait to experience the next wave of Harmonix projects as a fan. The level of talent in the studio is absolutely off the charts, and they are the smartest, most creative people I have ever met. The reaction to Rock Band 4 at events has been so overwhelmingly positive, and it’s an honest to god thrill seeing so much enthusiasm for Rock Band after a 5 year hiatus between games. I’m really looking forward to seeing launch from the other side of the fence, playing the final game for the first time in a room with friends. If you’ve got a launch party planned and you need someone to sing “Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong” so loud that the neighbors call the cops? Call me.   I hope you treat the other Harmonix folks (and the volunteer mods, who are living saints) on the forums and social channels as well as you have treated me, but I wouldn’t expect anything less from this community. Thanks again for 7 amazing years.   Rock on,  Aaron"

Rockband,3dn1t0,MaybeTowelie,7,Sat Jul 18 03:22:17 2015 UTC,I totally agree.  Personalities like Henry and Drake is what made me originally fall in love with Harmonix.  Knowing that they are not there anymore makes RB4 feel a bit different.  I will miss looking forward to Henry's Friday song announcements.

And all the old rockband ones have more features than rb4."
Rockband,3dn1t0,Koteric,5,Sat Jul 18 07:46:07 2015 UTC,This is what I keep saying.  RB4 is a huge step back.  Bringing it to the new consoles is great and all...but it's really just a Prettier RB3 missing a ton of features and forcing people to go back to using their crappy vanilla drum set.
Rockband,3dn1t0,KandoTor,5,Sat Jul 18 11:08:50 2015 UTC,It's really the lack of online multiplayer that's killed it for me.
Rockband,3dn1t0,Bront20,2,Sat Jul 18 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"It's a platform though, so they can expand it for years.  Meanwhile they need the core experience to be worth the price to get new players.   Online? It's coming after launch.   Ekit support?  XBone may have issues,  but I suspect PS4 already has it working.   Meanwhile we'll get a new game on the next gen console to play the game we already love.  For me, keys is the only real hit, and that's a stretch since it's more a party issue.   If they support the RB3 keyboard for guitar/bass, I'm set."

So I've been steadily building up U.S DLC and will be importing RB4.  Hopefully there'll be a digital version though.  Shame about the instruments though.

They have NOT gotten any wired devices working (other than microphones). They still may be able to via patch, they say they'll try but can't promise it on any level. But on launch, wireless only."

Rockband,3dlo8n,Rizaria,3,Fri Jul 17 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"They probably will.  I've never gotten any of those sorts of things, in GH or RB. Even when online play was a thing. Mostly because I got into the craze way too late. :P  Thankfully I'm not an achievement whore, but it's still annoying all the same. Still, I see it being included in RB4 from the get-go, seeing as Harmonix seems convinced everyone plays RB and have RB parties all the time."
Rockband,3dlo8n,Rizaria,0,Fri Jul 17 08:57:40 2015 UTC,I don't mind them adding them after online play is announced. But adding them at launch just seems like a waste when they could fill it with more varied achievements.

But yeah, with every bit of good, there's plenty of bad. Just because GH has been re-imagined and now sucks, it's no excuse to take the easy way out. :p  Not counting Harmonix out just yet though. If there's a fair priced digital copy of the game and a promise of online, I'd be happy enough.   At this point, I have to attempt to make friends to play it with otherwise and that ain't gonna happen!   I feel like I've rather veered off-topic now though. Whoops."

I have gotten the rock band 3 platinum and it was a very fun experience switching up the instruments and making friends that can help me out. You take away that, you take away a lot of the charm the game provides."
Rockband,3dlo8n,Bront20,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"That takes a lot of skill too.  I cant get the protar ones (don't have a mustang, won't buy one) and the drum trainer ones are a grind.  Not to mention pro keys and the Bohemian Rhapsody one.  Stuck at 82% and fine with it."
Rockband,3dlo8n,Jmcglosson,2,Sun Jul 19 06:54:36 2015 UTC,"Don't want to admit it.. But I cheated for the bohemian rhapsody one. That was the last trophy and none of me or my friends could do it. I don't know what they were thinking when they put that trophy in, but that shit is impossible.  Pro keys took a while to get used to, but after some practice you get pretty good, Its very fun as soon as you get the hang of it. Keyboard only cost me $20 on eBay too.  Pro guitar I just set aside some money every paycheck and eventually got enough. If you slowly save up it isn't that bad, I had to spend 50-60 I think. Its not my favorite instrument, but it was interesting to play alongside rocksmith. Do I regret spending that much for a few trophies? Absolutely. But Im determined so whatever."
Rockband,3dlo8n,FattyMcPatty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've thought about cheating the Bohemian one, but it's a lot of effort for a trophy.  And yes, prices have gone down (and back up).  I could own a Mustang for $50 at one point.  It would have been to play it, not just for trophies though.  Props for doing it though.  I think I had help singing Llama and Beast and the Harlot for the star expert trophy (It was easier than eeking out the last few thousand points I was short of a 5 star), and have decided to let the others rest (apparently I did get the 25 Pro Keys one, just not the trainers)."
Rockband,3dfgrl,elcanadiano,4,Wed Jul 15 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  We're pleased to finally announce the official launch of RockBandForums.com! This has been a few months in the making, and we now invite you to join us! We aim to be a community for both the general fans and the dedicated alike.  With the forums launched, we are now looking to move forward. We have lots of stuff planned, including information wikis, score submission, and maybe a league/tournament system as well. There's more to come, and we're excited to move forward!  For me it particularly comes full circle. I was originally a co-founder of the Unofficial Rock Band Forums five or so years ago. At our peak at around 2010, we were the largest third-party Rock Band community after ScoreHero and DLC Quickplay, and we also were the sponsors of the original iteration of Team L3G3ND. Now that I have graduated from university five years later, I thought it was high-time for such a community to exist once again, especially with the release of Rock Band 4.  Until then, for those about to rock, we salute you!  Norman, Daniel, Johnny, and Alexander"

Rockband,3dfgrl,Bront20,3,Thu Jul 16 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"DLCQuickplay still has some people in the forums, and as long as it keeps working for DLC matching, I assume it'll stick around.  Scorehero's been kinda dead for a while in general discussion, but I'll admit I wasn't a big score guy.  The Official forums aren't too bad.  I've seen worse official forums honestly.  Plus, there's reddit.  Plenty of places to go.  I'll still check it out."
Rockband,3dfgrl,_johnning,2,Thu Jul 16 06:31:00 2015 UTC,I totally forgot about Dlcquickplay lol.  Nostalgia takes me back
Rockband,3dfgrl,Bront20,2,Thu Jul 16 09:49:59 2015 UTC,"Still active, despite several attempts by the admins (or the server owners, not sure which) to kill it.  Which is good, because as long as you can buy DLC, it's a tremendous tool."
Rockband,3dfgrl,Rizaria,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  Always a pleasure. I'm a huge fan of your work and more recently, the work of C3 as a whole. It made my day when I saw this, this, or this for the first time (you can see one band I like). In fact, some of my staff members as non-Xbox 360 people have Xbox 360 Rock Band for the purpose of playing customs.  More recently, having moved to the Seattle area from Toronto (where my parents now live, although I am originally from Ottawa), I recently discovered a local Rock Band group who plays on Sunday nights. The guy who runs it has this massively dedicated set (something like two Mad Catz Premium Fenders, a MIDI kit, professional mics, a sound system, the works) and has bought all the DLC and has tons of customs, mostly of the C3 variant. Having played with them, it really does impress me how much communities like this and C3 are still dedicated to playing this game (I've had an off-again, on-again relationship with the game since leaving for University). I remember earlier today we were watching a movie and he was mentioning how he was trying to get a hold of those in the project for some videos. I don't remember the details of that though. We unfortunately don't play with Harmonies Project stuff because they've already approached the song limit and that stuff but I would have liked to see some more Boston.  Anyways, I digress.  Maybe we could catch up sometime. I don't really see it as competition in that sense - a lot of my members are huge fans of the project as a whole and being able to play stuff beyond Harmonix's releases."

Rockband,3dei1j,imdahman,13,Wed Jul 15 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I am a huge Rock Band fan, had the original first day and this is a deal breaker for me, there is no reason to upgrade to Xbox One/Rock band 4 the only reason I am currently seeing is the on disc set list, other than that it benefits me to stay on 360.  The graphics and new features just aren't significant enough to warrant the price, I have a bad feeling this game could kill the rhythm genre once and for all, I really hope I am wrong but this game is lined up to fail, they have a very expensive instrument set supplied by a company that is very likely to go bankrupt.  I can't see this game being a mainstream hit and further alienating those that are fanatical about the game (Ion owners, Keyboard owners etc) will for sure not help there cause, this along with the removable of multi player on launch and with Guitar Hero looking wholly uninteresting, its kind of concerning."
Rockband,3dei1j,Tezemery,10,Wed Jul 15 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, I do like the guitar but mainly play drums (as I was a drummer in a band in my younger/wilder days).  If there is no 'Pro' style drumkit, I can't see myself playing the game.  I have the Ion set and if that doesn't work, then no Rockband 4 for me."
Rockband,3dei1j,Spankmeister88,5,Wed Jul 15 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"Pro drums has already been confirmed to be returning.  They will probably operate exactly the same as old drums did, so even if the ""brain"" isn't the same, aftermarket parts will work.  Right now I use a ""stock"" set with mesh heads and a double bass pedal from my real drum set.    There could be midi-out for Ions to work, pads like old GoodWoodMods could be made, electric drum bass pedal convertors could be used, possibilities are endless.  There's people out there with electrical knowledge and a desire to make money.  That's how we got the aftermarket scene back in 2007 and that's how we can do it again."
Rockband,3dei1j,AR-47,9,Thu Jul 16 02:23:51 2015 UTC,I'm holding out on preordering RockBand 4 until they confirm their stance on e-drums. I'm not going to bother with RockBand 4 if I have to use the cheap kit that comes in the bundle.
Rockband,3dei1j,White_Dragon_ZB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the community will figure out some kind of work around. I remember before I used the official MIDI adapter, I was using a second pedal with community-designed hardware that allowed me to get hi-hat effect. I'm not too worried, and I think Harmonix knows that they need to support MIDI again at the very least, even if the ION Rocker ""controller"" module isn't supported."
Rockband,3dei1j,Afrobean,6,Mon Jul 20 08:20:43 2015 UTC,Go here and tell them you want an adapter for the XBox One.  This looks like the best chance we have at getting e-kits to work with RB4.
Rockband,3dei1j,IBitePrettyHard,5,Thu Jul 16 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"Also a deal breaker for me.  I spent a lot of money on the drums and heavily modified them to be even better.  I can't go back to the old drums, especially when Rockband 4 just seems like RB3 with a new interface, less features, and less compatibility."
Rockband,3dei1j,Koteric,3,Thu Jul 16 00:34:43 2015 UTC,"There's always a chance, but I wouldn't count on it. All wired instruments other than mics are being dropped currently."
Rockband,3dei1j,StefanGagne,3,Wed Jul 15 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"For now, despite the clear ""None will work"" responce, most suspect the PS4 will work just fine with IONs and MPAs.  There's a demand for support on the XBone though, so I suspect they'll figure out something, or at the very least promise they'll make it a top priority once the game is released.  Someone explained to me that the way the XBone is designed, it won't look for wired controlers, and there's nothing MS can do about that, but they've been flooded with requests from multiple ends recently, so they're trying to figure out a workaround.  I don't know if that's true, but it would both explain the issue and show that MS is willing to work with them."
Rockband,3dei1j,Bront20,2,Wed Jul 15 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think that's the case here. You can use Xbox One controllers with a USB cable and even if it wouldn't find wired controllers, Microsoft certainly has the ability to change that in software.  I just think Microsoft doesn't want to enable the remote possibility of using your old regular Xbox 360 controllers with your new console, for whatever reason."
Rockband,3dei1j,lasthour1,2,Thu Jul 16 00:45:36 2015 UTC,"It wasn't exactly the most reliable source, so we'll see."
Rockband,3dei1j,Bront20,2,Thu Jul 16 06:20:43 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all, I have two USB keyboards that I know for a fact work with the Xbox One. And you can use Xbox One controllers on Windows with a USB cable. Why would they implement that if they were going to release a wireless dongle for controllers?  Wired controllers are totally a thing. I can even head up to Walmart and get a third party, wired Xbox One controller. They just don't want to allow people to use their old controllers (which are still functional and work perfectly fine if you use the Windows 10 Xbox app for streaming), most likely so you have to buy new ones to play same screen multiplayer. Even though that's being phased out."
Rockband,3dei1j,lasthour1,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"I have been misinformed, then. Maybe it really is just as simple as needing to provide the security chip and what not."
Rockband,3dei1j,wwwes32,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"All in all, I'd imagine it would be pretty simple. But, I'm not a member of the Xbox dev team, so maybe it's totally not simple.  But it is totally within their power to do it. I mean, the amazing men and women on that team wrote an Xbox 360 emulator, so I'm sure that enabling support for Xbox 360 controllers would be child's play comparatively."
Rockband,3dei1j,lasthour1,0,Fri Jul 17 20:12:43 2015 UTC,They didn't write an emulator. They're recompiling games coded for 360 on the new platform. Think of them as simple ports. I think this was the same way they achieved backwards compatibility with original Xbox games on 360.
Rockband,3dei1j,Afrobean,0,Fri Jul 17 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"They did write an emulator. The engineers said so themselves. That's also the case for the Xbox games on 360: It's an emulator. It's also why Xbox Original games ran like crap on 360 most of the time.  EDIT: proof. ""[Emulation] is hard,"" admitted Spencer, explaining that the company was dealing with having to harmonise PowerPC architecture with x86.  ""The approach that we've taken is to actually emulate the full Xbox 360 hardware layer. So the [operating system] for the 360 is actually running when you run the game,"" Spencer explained."""

Rockband,3dei1j,NamesNotCrindy,2,Tue Jul 21 07:26:36 2015 UTC,PS4 does.  XBone doesn't.

I decided to reserve the guitar bundle since I enjoy that instrument a lot just not as much as drums. But I will never buy a mad catz drumset, it just can't give me the feeling of playing drums anymore."
Rockband,3dei1j,logicalnoise,3,Tue Jul 21 07:57:35 2015 UTC,Does that mean the MIDI controller won't work either!?!?!  I have a Roland kit that I've been using with the MIDI controller for a while now.  This is disappointing to hear...  I really hope that they end up supporting the MIDI controller.
Rockband,3dei1j,Lechonbaka,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"That's what I was reading/seeing on the forum, too. A lot of peeps were upset.   Allegedly it has to do with the box itself - it lacks the necessary hardware to actually recognize wired controllers - again, allegedly done so that you would HAVE to use XB1 controllers, and there would be 0% chance of someone cooking up some mod/fix to use a 360 controller."
Rockband,3dei1j,mike_gainor,5,Thu Jul 16 18:09:59 2015 UTC,I also wouldn't even get the game if I had to play on regular drums.

Rockband,3dei1j,BaddDadd2010,2,Wed Jul 15 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"They haven't said, but there's some expectation that supporting the IONs or the MPA may be easier/more likely on the PS4.  Just people speculating, so don't count on anything."
Rockband,3dei1j,Chronotakular,0,Wed Jul 15 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"It would make 0 sense to support one console and not the other. Fingers crossed I guess, but it seems super unlikely to me at this point."

I'm willing to bet it's jumped up the priority list since definitive announcements were made.  They have committed to supporting RB4 as THE game of this console generation, not falling back on a RB5. They want it to be the best experience possible. If it's at all feasible to get them working, I'm sure they've tried, and they will continue to try.   EDIT: I'll also say with relative confidence that there are HMX employees that are just as negatively affected by not getting these things working. Plenty of them are musicians, I'm sure many of them upgraded their kits to be more pro-mode. It's not just an obliviousness to consumer demand."
Rockband,3dei1j,Blehgopie,5,Wed Jul 15 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"It's fairly deserved backlash.  Owners of Ion kits are probably some of the biggest supporters of the series.  We dropped hundreds of dollars on a premium controller to play a video game.  Ion users most likely dumped more money into DLC since the very fact they own an Ion kit showed they were serious about the franchise.  Most drummers that still played RB after the genre ""died"" probably had expensive aftermarket drums.  On top of that, the stock kits are garbage if you're anything beyond totally casual.  I for the life of me can't figure out how it could possibly be harder to get wired things to work than wireless.  Hasn't it always been the opposite historically?"
Rockband,3dei1j,Tacoaloto,3,Wed Jul 15 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"Hell, my friend just bought an ion brain two weeks ago to convert his old ion from xbox 360 to ps3 and brought it over. Less than three days ago my dad bought me a brand new Roland drum set that works perfectly with the ion brain and this whole rock band 4 scenario worries me greatly since I've fallen in love with these drums."

Rockband,3dei1j,NuclearFej,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:39:50 2015 UTC,"I think they are gonna end up falling back on a Rock Band 5. There's just too much missing from the game at this point, it wouldn't make financial sense to do it all as DLC."
Rockband,3dei1j,wwwes32,2,Thu Jul 16 11:35:41 2015 UTC,"Actually it does, the cost of patching is way less than it was on the old systems. If you're making a game that needs totally different gameplay, annualized releases make sense. But the core gameplay for rock band has barely changed across seven years, it just has gotten incremental tweaks."
Rockband,3dei1j,NuclearFej,2,Wed Jul 15 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not even figuring in the cost of patching - simply put, moving copies of Rock Band is their best financial incentive, which is why I think they'll do a Rock Band 5. They could patch everything in,  but why do that when they can sell us a whole new game based on those features?  They say they're patching stuff in, but I don't think they mean things as major as online multiplayer or keys support. It's possible, just unlikely."
Rockband,3dei1j,wwwes32,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:50 2015 UTC,They've said flat out there will be no Rock Band 5 and that is both before and after those items came up as potential features. They may or may not be free. Keyboards almost definitely wouldn't be free. But plenty of games sell expansions and live off of adding features via add-ons.
Rockband,3dei1j,NuclearFej,2,Fri Jul 17 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"Games used to live off expansions, but not really anymore. The only modern expansion pack I can think of is Civ 5: Brave New World (as well as Gods & Kings). I don't think that would work for Rock Band, the closest they've had were the DLC packs, and if I remember correctly those didn't sell well. That kind of model doesn't seem to jive with the console market, so to speak.   The only way that what they've stated is feasible is if RB4 sells like gangbusters. That would be fantastic - but it's up in the air.   At the end of the day, this all comes down to whether the game sells or not."
Rockband,3dei1j,LostVector,2,Fri Jul 17 05:14:44 2015 UTC,I'm probably going to hack together another mod like the highly liquid mod for RB1 back in the day.  The annoying thing is having to buy an entire bundle just to get a working drum kit.

Then in 2012 I got DJ Hero because I was really into that type of music. I played the guitar part in DH1 and then wanted to play more Guitar Hero. I never got any more games until January 2014 when I found a brand new Band Hero set for PS3 for $100 on clearance. I got that and then started to collect all the RB and GH games since they're dirt cheap. I now own every GH game and am only missing the Country 1&2 track packs for RB. I exported everything (RB 1,2,GD,Lego) and thank god I did while I could. Bought a ton of DLC over the past year and a half and now here we are."

That being said, I reckon all previous RB character models look awful anyway, like plasticine people with freakish proportions. Heck, even the slider bars were poorly implemented. I would always choose clothing that covered my rocker up as much as possible.   It'd be nice if Rock Band could have as food looking good characters/customisation as Guitar Hero did. But if it's at least as good as RB3's, it'll do I suppose. With some tinkering I finally made a decent looking band.   But I don't think it's a focus for Harmonix. Don't get your hopes up.

Rockband,3dcanm,ohsnapitsjf,-4,Wed Jul 15 13:22:02 2015 UTC,But there hasn't been ANY  confirmation that any of what I'm asking for is in the game because the STUPID people doing the interviews WONT ASK THE DEVELOPERS ABOUT CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION!

Rockband,3dcanm,Edge2k13,3,Wed Jul 15 15:41:03 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about this stuff too. I'm hoping they go the full 9 yards and have a huge list of customization option available. Bigger than any of the previous games. At this point though I'm a bit worried about it. In one interview they stated that early on character customization itself was ""off the table"" but then decided fans would be upset if it wasn't included. Makes me worried that this stuff might be half assed. Hope I'm wrong."
Rockband,3dcanm,Bront20,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"The ""good"" news is that the new platform system will let them sell extra clothes and stuff like that as DLC.  So while they may have a good selection to start with, they can add in extra stuff you can purchase.  If they do it right (like, a full shop's worth of clothes for a reasonable price), it could be kind of cool.    ""Want to go full goth, by Goths'r'us expansion for 6-8 new tops, pants, shoes, along with a new hair style.  $4.99""  They could sell endorsed shops too."
Rockband,3dcanm,thewinnerisgeeg,2,Wed Jul 15 05:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most of these are possible save for the microphone stand thing. The stage is intended to have 4 members and to take out the vocalist kinda kills the feeling. Aside from that the only way to implement it would be through something in the options menu, or to make it mandatory on case by case basis, like for songs where the singer also plays guitar, which seems silly. Also to answer the title question, I think nobody is asking because nobody doubts that the character creation will be fine. RB games have always had good character creators.  (Ps. Mosh pits would be fucking cool)"
Rockband,3dcanm,StefanGagne,3,Wed Jul 15 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"I have my doubts the character creation will be fine, given they admitted in interviews that they weren't even going to include ANY character creation originally. Given the dark and murky lighting I gotta wonder how in-depth the creator will be, and if that red haze is to mask it.

Rockband,3dcanm,Bront20,3,Wed Jul 15 04:06:17 2015 UTC,I think the mic stand he means having the guitarist/bassist have mic stands so it looks like they're singing into them for harmony parts.

I kind of feel that they have been trying to mask the performance and characters with that really smokey and dark venue... I really hope they publish a character/band customization video down the road... also this game is really emphasizing on ""putting your own personality"" into the game, so I hope this also extends into the band and character customization feature."

There would be costumes I like, that I couldn't get because I didn't play multiplayer often, or didn't own that instrument, let a lone if I wanted to play that instrument or not.

They only seem to be concerned with hardware bundle sales numbers and not with anything else. I am speculating that there is a push to get this game released before Christmas to keep Mad Catz financially afloat and they are doing everything they can to just drop a new game out there despite not having a polished and finished product less than 3 months ahead of its planned release date and are cutting as many corners as they can in order to meet that goal.   It breaks my heart to see HMX doing this, especially because I want to be able to support them, and we've all been waiting so long for another game to just have the ball dropped like it seems to be. I want to be wrong, but looking at things realistically that is how they are adding up. There is still a whole bunch we don't know about the game yet, so many things have been cut from the initial release, HMX answers questions with ambiguous and open ended answers, and I feel like the sky is falling here.

I have no problem buying an XB1 to play RB4 because that is where my DLC lies, on the 360. But if I have to buy anything extra, the adapter is going to be it, because my two guitar controllers work just fine. After $350 + $60 for the game, I don't have another $100-200 extra just to buy another guitar that isn't needed or a drum controller that will never get used with an extra guitar I don't need.   Having said that, there should be an option to pre-order at least just a physical copy of the game bare minimum to help support HMX and Mad Catz and the option isn't there. I get if they are still working the adapters out, and they don't want to make them available for pre-order, but that still doesn't take away from the fact that at the very leasy a copy of the game should be available.  If the adapters aren't widely available either, that is really going to suck."

They are gonna have a shitstorm of dumbasses who bought just the game day one thinking they can plug in their legacy controllers and be golden, bitching to them, asking refunds, giving the game negative scores, etc.  Harmonix probably doesn't want that, and assumed that no one wants to buy a game they can use for a while.

Rockband,3d9lwh,biosehnsucht,2,Tue Jul 14 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"I assume it will be available digitally on the marketplace, with the ability to preload, like every other non-Skylanders-esque game.   I hope so, I just would like to get the bonus songs without having to buy an Extra guitar."
Rockband,3d9lwh,chexmixho,2,Tue Jul 14 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"Launch is hardware bundles only, and only with physical disc. If Madcatz doesn't go out of business producing them, we may be able to buy more instruments separately.   Likely a digital only release will come eventually when they release the wireless adapter, if they do ... since there's no date on it and nearly no information."
Rockband,3d9lwh,Farnic,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"We know that RB4 will be able to be pre-ordered and pre-loaded on XBox One at some point since that is the case for all XBox One retail games.  It is even has the page on XBox.com here: https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Games/Rock-Band-4/e7610f96-a7d8-41c1-8d3d-f1230d163af9 I'm just hoping there is some way I can get the XBox360->XBox One dongle for wireless instruments, the game and the bonus tracks from Amazon somehow on launch day.  That is looking less and less likely."
Rockband,3d4mge,catsrocktubas,44,Mon Jul 13 14:11:07 2015 UTC,"For people who can't follow the link:    Aerosmith – ""Toys in the Attic"" The Cure – ""Friday I'm In Love"" Dream Theater – ""Metropolis - Part 1 'The Miracle And The Sleeper'"" Foo Fighters – ""The Feast and the Famine"" Judas Priest – ""Halls Of Valhalla"" Live – ""All Over You"" The Outfield – ""Your Love"" Ozzy Osbourne – ""Miracle Man"" Paramore – ""Still Into You"" St. Vincent – ""Birth In Reverse"" Van Morrison – ""Brown Eyed Girl""   The preview video also shows a different track highway and note gems from the builds we've seen before."
Rockband,3d4mge,ohsnapitsjf,18,Mon Jul 13 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"The aesthetics look WAY better. The highway/notes that we saw in the past looked so bland and uninspired, but these look like a finished product."
Rockband,3d4mge,Jedmart,6,Mon Jul 13 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"Note highways are nice, but still not a fan of the ""monochrome red"" lighting on stage which leaves all the characters completely in the dark. Hard to see any details or colors."
Rockband,3d4mge,StefanGagne,11,Mon Jul 13 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"It's still the same venue as we've been seeing all along. I'm sure others will be better-lit, if this one is even in the final version at all."
Rockband,3d4mge,ohsnapitsjf,8,Mon Jul 13 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but what're the chances that they'd showcase the darkest, least lit venue in all their promo material and the other 99% are nicely lit? Very low, I'd suspect -- meaning this may be a representative sample of what we can come to generally expect.  Hopefully, like the note highways, it's a work in progress and will be changing. I LIKE looking at my characters, not just seeing the vague outlines of them."
Rockband,3d4mge,StefanGagne,6,Mon Jul 13 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"I get the worry, but they also haven't shown a single second of the career mode yet. They've emphasized the importance of the crowd to your performance, maybe they're holding off on showing any real venues we'll see until they're ready to talk about how that's really going to work and look."
Rockband,3d4mge,ohsnapitsjf,3,Mon Jul 13 16:50:31 2015 UTC,I mean they showed off the very basic highway before they showed off this one which looks 100x better. I figure we'll keep seeing the game improve aesthetically as they release more song release videos. Lol.
Rockband,3d4mge,AdAfterlife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:24 2015 UTC,I imagine they've been showing off that venue because it matches the box art/marketing material aesthetic.
Rockband,3d4mge,VinTheRighteous,6,Mon Jul 13 17:44:24 2015 UTC,Hot damn! I hope they make the HO/PO's a little more visible. Reminds me of RB1/Lego where you can hardly tell the difference. Sucks during some of the more difficult solos.

Rockband,3d4mge,Tom_Anks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:35 2015 UTC,I hope there's more from her. I'd love to try Prince Johnny on guitar. Did you see her play it on Letterman?  So awesome.  Teenage Talk seems fun for vocals. I really like the phrasing on that song.
Rockband,3d4mge,smacksaw,2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:16 2015 UTC,Aerosmith is pretty neat.  You'd figure they would have wanted more money.  Now we just have to wait and see if Metallica gets on board.

Rockband,3d4mge,MilesHighClub_,9,Mon Jul 13 19:50:00 2015 UTC,Same here! Soooo excited for it. I think its going to surprise a lot of people who've never heard the awesomeness of St. Vincent before.
Rockband,3d4mge,doyoh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"I've never heard it before -- I pulled that track up in Spotify, heard a series of random screeches and plonks, and I came into this thread expecting folks to call it the next Cool For Cats. But I'm seeing near-universal praise.  It's entirely possible I'm wrong and my first impression was just bad, so I'm willing to give it a few more tries. Can you recommend some other songs?"
Rockband,3d4mge,StefanGagne,3,Mon Jul 13 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"what do you mean ""next cool for cats""?"
Rockband,3d4mge,BigBananaDealer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:47:49 2015 UTC,"As in ""the song nobody wants to play because it sounds annoying."" I didn't realize it was that popular. I'm pretty out of touch with modern music."

Rockband,3d4mge,BigBananaDealer,2,Tue Jul 14 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"Cool For Cats far from modern, late 70s new wave."

Rockband,3d4mge,sageamagoo,2,Wed Jul 15 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but her entire new eponymous album was really good (my second favorite song after this one is Rattlesnake, and lots of people like Digital Witness and I Prefer Your Love).  She also did a full album with David Byrne of the Talking Heads. It is  really good - check it out!"
Rockband,3d4mge,thekidwiththelisp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I do loves me some Talking Heads. I'll check it out. Maybe it's just this specific song that makes my ears weep blood."
Rockband,3d4mge,StefanGagne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:53:07 2015 UTC,I hated this song when I first heard it as well. It really grows on you. Check out Cruel off her album Strange Mercy.
Rockband,3d4mge,burns148,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"As far as current St. Vincent goes, I'd say Digital Witness is pretty accessible. Her style has changed quite a bit since her first couple of albums, something like Paris is Burning is quite different from the electronic, glitchy sounds from her current album.  Edit: Even if I didn't like St. Vincent though, at this point I'd just be excited for anything that's not just extremely common, overplayed, classic rock, heavy metal, or pop songs."
Rockband,3d4mge,-xe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yes! Birth in Reverse is one of her poppiest songs, but St Vincent has stuff along many genres.

Rockband,3d4mge,NemoEsq,5,Tue Jul 14 00:53:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's no reason to undercut Harmonix when they're trying to get RB4 off the ground and need all the support they can get. Customs are great but officials are wonderful.

The only set list I had a problem with was Rock Band 3 and that's because some tracks were not fun on most instruments and were obviously included to push either vocal harmonies or the keyboard.
Rockband,3d4mge,C_Rufio,4,Tue Jul 14 02:19:21 2015 UTC,The Outfield - Your Love  I can die happy now. I've been asking for that jam since RB1. What a party track. Great choice!

Rockband,3d4mge,writtennred,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:56 2015 UTC,They better have licensed more than one Annie Clark song for DLC...

Rockband,3d4mge,memphisheat,3,Mon Jul 13 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be frank with you guys. I'm NOT impressed about the confirmed songs, at the moment I only like at least four of them. Which is totally the opposite with the older games, I get the feeling I'm too spoiled by the older on-disc soundtrack.   Which is weird, I always got hyped about the soundtrack. I even learnt about many artist who I never got into if it wasn't for the games.   But this is the first time in Rock Band History, I don't like the line-up. Heck, I love the entire subseries, even the soundtrack of Blitz made me smile!   I understand because of budget and that many songs are already available as DLC, it's getting harder to get the ""Woah songs"", I completely get that!   I really wanted to use RB4 as my game to get over to next gen, but after hearing the soundtrack, I hope games modes will make up for the lost hype. While that have its issues either...

I haven't been totally wowed by a choice yet (except maybe Suspicious Minds, which is the song I'm most looking forward to in RB4) but this is shaping up to be a really solid set. Anyway, there's still 40-odd songs to go, and HMX hasn't failed me yet.   EDIT: Oh, and I'm looking forward to St Vincent as well."

I could end up being pleasantly surprised by some of the songs, but there's nothing that's genuinely exciting me right now and that's concerning."
Rockband,3d4mge,Azza_,-7,Thu Jul 16 06:35:01 2015 UTC,There is a real glaring lack of recognizable hits on this setlist as of right now. That can and hopefully will change as we get further into the setlist but I am a bit underwhelmed right now.

Rockband,3d4mge,joe_internet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"Both.   My musical tastes run the gambit from Gojira to Wutang. I'm just not seeing the ""catch the audience"" songs in this list thusfar. When they did the RB3 reveal, I had very strong initial interest in the tracklist.  It seems like there is a deeper emphasis using deep cuts to get popular bands on the list along with bands that cater to a younger audience.  A younger audience isn't the audience that has invested in this since RB1 and deep cuts don't really do anything for me as disc songs. Deep cuts should be for DLC."
Rockband,3d4mge,Sikazhel,2,Tue Jul 14 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"You can have your opinions on whether ""deep cuts"" are worthy, but how young are you accusing them of skewing? There's like, four songs even close to pop-pandering, and that is making a stretch on St. Vincent."
Rockband,3d4mge,ohsnapitsjf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"I said:  ""There is a real glaring lack of recognizable hits on this setlist as of right now.""  Is there a Freebird or a Creep on this setlist as of yet? I did say ""as of right now"".  And secondly, I never said there is a pandering to pop. I said there is a pandering to a younger audience. If you associate youth with pop then that's not really my problem.  The investment in this game isnt going to come from gamers who haven't invested before. It's from people who were 22 or 23 when this game came out and have invested years of time and money in it."
Rockband,3d4mge,Sikazhel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:54:42 2015 UTC,"Okay. So how young are you accusing them of skewing? There's like, four songs even close to... Fuck me, how can I word this without your comeback being 100% semantic and not an actual response to what I was clearly asking you... youth-pandering? That's a terrible phrase, but I don't know how else to say it, because it's pretty far off base anyway.  I didn't even argue about the deep cuts comment. You're not as completely wrong about that one. Don't know why you went defensive about it."
Rockband,3d5g4t,Bonerspider,13,Mon Jul 13 17:52:17 2015 UTC,Guitar Hero is where I learned all of my music from when I was younger.  Here's to more memories when Rock Band 4 hits the shelves!
Rockband,3d5g4t,Runefall,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"I love Harmonix so much for that. Their games really facilitated a strong interest in music that I didn't have at all before playing GH1. They're the reason I picked up a real guitar (and I'm playing bass in a friend's band now). I don't play the games all that much anymore, but I'm still excited for RB4"
Rockband,3d5g4t,Hello_Cup,8,Tue Jul 14 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Rock band taught me how to play drums (at least the basics!) Then, it was used by my high school rock band (real instruments) to find new songs to cover. I'd put my real kit in front of the tv and put no fail mode on to play along with tracks and learn them. We would pause the game and the microphone would still be active so our singer used that for vocals during band practices before we bought monitors. The game helped us a lot in those ways!  Also, I would love to hear that rock band helped me lose my virginity story!"
Rockband,3d5g4t,Honcho074,3,Mon Jul 13 20:06:53 2015 UTC,Did watching the charts while behind a real kit help you learn? I've always been curious.
Rockband,3d5g4t,Anchor_Rancor,3,Mon Jul 13 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"For me, it helped. Here is why I think it helps. It helps your timing, it teaches you different styles of playing, and you learn various fills. By just playing the songs, you get a nice basis for many different genres of music, and different drumming styles. The amount of variety you get is great.  The more I played on the real kit, the more I could do certain beats from memory and it would help me be creative by taking those beats and putting my own twist on them.  I've been playing drums for about 7 years now and rock band gave me a great foundation that I've built on."
Rockband,3d5g4t,Honcho074,2,Mon Jul 13 21:11:00 2015 UTC,Are there any negative habits that come from playing rock band first?
Rockband,3d5g4t,Anchor_Rancor,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"I took drum lessons for about a month after a few years of playing rock band.  My teacher said I had natural rhythmic techniques. However, he did say that the way I held the sticks was wrong. That was really the only thing I found that was a negative habit. He corrected my drum stick grip. That could be a major thing, but I don't think it would apply to everyone who plays."
Rockband,3d5g4t,Honcho074,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:43:02 2015 UTC,"I never took drum lessons, but I hopped behind the drums once and my a music teacher said the same thing about my rhythm. I guess I'll have to see about getting a drum set eventually."
Rockband,3d5g4t,Anchor_Rancor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:43 2015 UTC,It can be a big investment depending on how nice of a kit you want.  You may even want to look for a used kit for your first one. Or if you live somewhere where too much noise is an issue then you'll want to look for electronic kits.
Rockband,3d5g4t,Honcho074,2,Mon Jul 13 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"If I did get something, I'd most likely start off buying pieces in increments, instead of a whole kit all at once."
Rockband,3d5g4t,Anchor_Rancor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:55:08 2015 UTC,The game doesn't have you use the hi-hat pedal (which is used to keep time). So you'll have to learn how to use both feet for real drums.
Rockband,3d5g4t,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Tue Jul 14 02:42:29 2015 UTC,That is most likely my main problem. I tried using two pedals recently; it wasn't great.
Rockband,3d5g4t,Anchor_Rancor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:57:38 2015 UTC,Some folks have set up their EKit to let the use the pedal to hit either yellow or blue. Alternating the cymbal
Rockband,3d5g4t,Bront20,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but sometimes Harmonix doesn't put open hi hats on a different cymbal. They have to find the balance between realism and fun (that's why all ghost notes aren't charted)."
Rockband,3d5g4t,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, but at least it's practice when they do."
Rockband,3d5g4t,Bront20,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:52:22 2015 UTC,You can have a hi-hat pedal enabled on pro.
Rockband,3d5g4t,mokacoffay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:36:08 2015 UTC,That is only in the fills and freestyle mode. Rock Band charts open hi hats to a different cymbal. In real drums open and closed are on the same cymbal and controlled with your left foot.
Rockband,3d5g4t,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"When hi-hat pedal is enabled, it converts yellow notes to blue; which is how most (new charts) open hi-hat notes are charted in pro.  You have to know the difference when to use it on a song-by song basis of course, but it's better than nothing.  Pro-charts definitely aren't perfect.  Scream by A7X is still completely broken on pro mode."
Rockband,3d5g4t,mokacoffay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:36:17 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? Open hi-hats have always been charted to blue, even in non pro mode (since Rock Band 1).   Hi-hat enabled only affects drum fills and drum freestyle. With that option on, the yellow cymbal will sound like a open hi-hat. If you have a second pedal plugged in, hitting the yellow cymbal while pressing it down will result in a closed hi-hat sound."
Rockband,3d5g4t,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, apparently RB3 doesn't come like this by default.  I'm using someone else's kit who informed me their module is actually modifying the open hi-hat to register as blue, and yellow when depressed.  Seems pretty interesting that they didn't just put that in the base game seeing as the game can detect the hi-hat being open though."
Rockband,3d5g4t,mokacoffay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that watching charts is amazing,  I would seriously consider it on par with drum tablature."

Rockband,3d5g4t,Airiq49,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"For me its a lot of things.  It's what made me get into the expensive hobby of high end home theaters.  It's motivated me to advance in my career goals so I can afford better equipment so I can rock out harder in rock band.     I primarily play on drums.   I've gone through 4 drum sets (2 ions).  For me it's a fun form of exercise.  I never exercise so when I play for 2-3 hours on expert I can feel the pounds falling off.  It keeps my heartbeat up.  I usually pick out 4-5 songs at a time and use the song selection as a breaks.  Towards the end I'll push myself into 10-15 song set-list.    Overall, between ~1,500 songs, rock band equipment, high end speakers/TV's I've spent at least $15,000 on rock band.  Granted the home theater can be used for other things, but I wouldn't have most of it if it wasn't for rock band.    It's let me discover new music I would have never found without it.  It makes me appreciate professional musicians even more.  I could talk about rock band and what it means to me for hours, it literally changed my life."

Rockband,3d79vq,rockydil,6,Tue Jul 14 02:52:31 2015 UTC,But it's Rock BAND.  Having all the instruments is kind of assumed as a requirement for the full experience.

Rockband,3d79vq,Pandos636,2,Wed Jul 15 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, in that there should have been an alternate way to unlock everything.

Rockband,3d79vq,kerminsr,6,Tue Jul 14 06:36:36 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll find a lot of sympathy here.  Most of people here have shelled out $500+ to continue playing the game.  I know I blew through 2 base drum kits and an extra bass pedal before I upgraded to the Ion Rocker ($200) and finally got myself a Roland Mini E-kit ($900).  Not counting anything else I've spent $1000+ on just getting drums that will accurately trigger the notes when I hit the pads.  It sounds like you bought a used RB3 disc and had a guitar laying around and are complaining that you can't have the same content as people that have spent years and $1000+ on the same game.
Rockband,3d79vq,kerminsr,-20,Tue Jul 14 02:26:20 2015 UTC,It sounds like you bought a used RB3 disc and had a guitar laying around and are complaining that you can't have the same content as people that have spent years and $1000+ on the same game.   Well forgive me for not spending over a grand on a fucking videogame like a moron and being pissed that I can't access stuff that shouldn't be locked behind paywalls. Sorry. /s  edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted. Someone care to explain?
Rockband,3d79vq,Runefall,2,Tue Jul 14 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"I believe you were downvoted because you insinuated that people who spen a considerable amount of money on something they love, video games or otherwise, are morons. It is a very rude statement."
Rockband,3d79vq,owarwolf,0,Tue Jul 14 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"I fully understand spending a lot of money on something you love. I for example own 4 guitars 2 amps and a half a dozen effects pedals (oh the days of having money...I miss you so.). But I do think spending over a grand on a single game is extreme to say the least. I don't really disagree with what I said in context, but out of context what I said sounds pretty shitty. My point was only that just because people spend (what I believe to be) an insane amount of money on a game, doesn't mean they should be rewarded for doing so. Or if they are, don't make the rewards something you already paid for that is locked behind what is essentially an on-disk paywall.  Sorry to those who I offended. I didn't mean to come off as rudely as I did. Continue to downvote my previous comment all you want. I (kind of) deserve it."
Rockband,3d79vq,dwfan24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"It was just worded harshly. It is a unique aspect of a game to operate in that way, possibly to drum up more interest in other instruments for those on the fence."
Rockband,3d79vq,dwfan24,0,Tue Jul 14 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Sadly, I got that. I was in a seriously bad mood because I was having a really shitty day yesterday and when I got home I was just ready to finally relax and enjoy creating some funky characters and rock out to some good music, and when I realized that I wouldn't be able to do so (or at least, to the full extent) because of the shitty unlock system, I just kinda flipped. Hence why I still agree with what was said, but regret saying it in the manner I did. I really didn't mean to hurt anybodies feelings :/"
Rockband,3d79vq,dwfan24,4,Tue Jul 14 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Your ""paywall"" is not owning the peripherals to play the game in the first place.  You have a guitar and can play guitar/bass content, that seems fair to me.  If you want group achievements you can unlock them through online play, but really the game was meant to be played with other people in the room with you (IMO).  You can still find a mic pretty cheap, it just needs a USB plug-in to work for the game.  I have no idea about the piano, I got one with the initial game launch and it still works just fine so I've never needed to replace it.  The drums are a whole other story though, unless you want to spend some serious cash then you aren't going to happy with what you find."
Rockband,3d79vq,Plumato,-2,Tue Jul 14 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"It's nice to know that I can get group achievements through online. I'm sure I can find a few people on here to give me a hand. Thanks for the tip.  And as far as not owning to play it in the first place, that seems kind of dickish design wise. That' like splitting a game up into several disks and saying ""you have to buy them all if you want the full game!"". I can understand locking a few things behind specific achievement walls, but they should be minimal and should directly relate to the instrument in question (ex. unlocking a special instrument for completing a difficult challenge with it). But RB3 locks basic outfit pieces behind these walls and is basically saying ""you have to buy them all (the instruments) if you want the full game!"". It seems pretty shitty that they locked a fuck-ton of stuff behind these walls just so that they could force you to purchase everything to fully access everything on the disk (or digital download) you already paid for once. It's similar to how Street Fighter X Tekken locked characters who were already on the disk and forced you to pay for them as DLC even though you had already paid for the game and should rightfully be able to use everything on the disk. I have serious issues with companies saying ""even though you paid us for the game, you have to pay us more to remove the barriers we put in it."" And this only makes me angrier because Harmonix is essentially saying ""I know you already paid for the game, but now you need to pay us another few hundred bucks to use all of it.""  Also, sorry if I came off like an asshole. I'm just irritated and you came off sounding snobby to me. I don't mean it to sound that bad."
Rockband,3d79vq,zuxtron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"The original Guitar Hero games didn't detect whether or not a guitar peripheral was plugged in, so if you didn't have a guitar you could play with a standard controller.  It would be nice if Rock Band didn't auto-detect which kind of instrument is plugged in so that you could play with a standard 360 or PS3 controller.  It's actually pretty fun to try to play guitar with a 360 controller.  Would that be a solution you could get behind?  I kind of agree that it sucks that whole portions of the game are locked for people who can't afford the drums.  Yeah, you're getting downvoted: you're on the RockBand subreddit, it's all superfans here.  So sorry you're not being received well, a lot of the people here have spent a ton on the game and would skip meals for as long as it takes to save up enough to replace their drums if they broke.   But again, you're not completely wrong.  It would be so fun to play keyboard with a guitar controller, or play guitar with the drums, or play any of it with the standard console controller."

Rockband,3d79vq,Anchor_Rancor,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, welcome to the internet!  haha  Personally, I don't see much of a problem with locking superficial character customization items behind specific instruments.  Now if they locked songs or venues behind specific instruments, I'd be pissed.   While yes, I think there would be better ways of doing it.   I'm curious how you think it would be better handled.  Just tie unlockables to specific songs?  Or to total number of stars earned?  And do you think that no unlocks should be tied to instruments or is it OK to have some tied to the instruments, but just fewer?"
Rockband,3d79vq,dwfan24,0,Wed Jul 15 00:26:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't see much of a problem with locking superficial character customization items behind specific instruments.   I love creating characters, so I assume it's a bigger deal for me than a lot of people.   I'm curious how you think it would be better handled. Just tie unlockables to specific songs? Or to total number of stars earned?   Things like total number of stars/golden stars earned, number songs completed at varying difficulties, completing certain songs with at least X-points, etc. There are plenty of non-instrument based ways they could have done it. All of these would work no matter what instruments you have.   And do you think that no unlocks should be tied to instruments or is it OK to have some tied to the instruments, but just fewer?   I would say a few is okay. But it would need to be directly related to the instrument in question. Something like a special instrument or two would be okay and maybe even a shirt that says something like ""X master"" with X being whatever instrument you completed the goal with.  I'm okay with a few items for those who happen to own several different instruments (though completion is still kind of an issue. But I'm not getting into that right now); but they've locked an extremely large portion of the clothing pieces behind instrument-exclusive goals. Like I said before, it's like they're saying ""even though you paid us for the game, you have to pay us more to remove the barriers we put in it."" And I find that to be an extremely shitty move."

Honestly, to myself and my friends who played the game, it is the greatest loss, greater than online multiplayer - but that is because we never did online MP, only local MP. I totally understand why people are upset about that, and I am in support of the game getting online MP because its definitely a valuable option for many players, and I wouldn't want to get my more niche Keys at the expensive of MP, even though I don't play MP.  I'd be satisfied if they planned to add support for Keys / Pro Keys on existing last-gen DLC that has it that gets ported forward, and just let us use our existing gear w/ the adapter, though obviously I'd like even more new songs with Keys.  Just one more reason that even though I've preordered the full band kit I'll be keeping my 360 set up for RB3 (also, customs.. including customs / updates to existing songs with Keys!)."

In AIM mode, vocals aren't scored and are locked to Easy difficulty, they also don't contribute to Overdrive or Unison bonuses.

Hell, no expected RB4. Thats another reason I might choose to just rebuy the instruments and dlc. To prevent you from having to buy xboxes next console as well if your still in the games.

They / Madcatz are stretched thin as it is, and they / retailers can't have too many SKUs taking up store shelves. That's why there's only instruments w/ game disc bundle versions.   There may be a digital only version later (and perhaps more plausible on PS4 since PS3 instruments that are BT based can work w/o any kind of adapter), but don't expect it any time soon.  If you wait for the digital only version, it may never come. If they don't get large numbers of preorders, the game may die an early death and Madcatz may go out of business."

Rockband,3d1hfj,kerminsr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"OK, let me start by saying that I really am trying to help.  That drum set is garbage.  Actually, just the drum brain in that package is garbage, the rest is fine.  It's been sold under a ton of different names, look up DD502.  I had one and I got rid of it in less than two weeks.   I've read numerous threads where people complain that the module has trouble sending more than one note at a time.  So people run into problems when there are parts in the song that hit the kick and two cymbals all at once.   You're right though, it looks a lot like the ion set, that's because it's identical.  It literally is the ion set with a crappy brain instead of the 360/ps3 controller part.  I don't know how much everything costs where you come from, (I'm assuming not the U.S. because of the link you provided) but if you can get an ion set for much less than this, then I'd go with the ion set.  When you get the ion, you still have the ability to add a decent drum brain down the line.  Again, it all depends on how much everything costs for you.  If this set is close to what it will cost you to get an ion set, then by all means get this and the MIDI-pro adapter.  But be warned: this drum brain is the worst one on the market.   You can always upgrade to a better brain later though, the pads and cymbals are decent enough and they work really well with RockBand.  And the pads and cymbals will work with almost any other drum brain.  You can pick up the Roland TD6 or TD6V for pretty cheap nowadays.    I'm not trying to burst your bubble, I just don't want anyone to make the same mistake I made."

Slightly off topic, I find it funny that the full-band PS2 GH games have the widest controller support of all GH and RB games put together, past and future. They even support 360 kit.

All they'd have to do is support that and give a list of compatible adapters. Still, would be contingent on the console manufacturers allowing it, which probably won't happen.

Rockband,3cvfge,PartyBusGaming,3,Sat Jul 11 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"When I play, I don't use my arms unless switching to another pad. Instead, I use my wrists. Moving your arm up and down makes you tire out a lot quickly than moving your wrists. Another tip is keeping your foot down on the pedal after you hit a note. When you bring it back up, you're pretty much doing a half a note. I only bring it up when I'm about to hit another note. That's pretty much it. Doing doubles on a pillow will definitely increase your stamina."
Rockband,3cvfge,wearing2raincoats,3,Sat Jul 11 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"That's like drumming 101.   Some basic tips for drumming is to learn how to properly hold the sticks, look up the ""Moeller method"", and focus on letting the rebound of the sticks do most of the work.   Also, for Rockband only, the RB pedal is actuated by a magnet that ""senses"" the pedal hit when it's only halfway down. If you can find this spot, you only have to move the pedal an inch up and down and it'll trigger the base hit."

I have 360 Les Pauls, and the removable neck seems to cause some misses. I took a large rubber band and put it on the bottom neck strap and the one on the neck. It holds the neck very tightly into the guitar and seems to have eliminated most (if not all) of the guitar's missing button presses.  you could also take apart the guitar and see if any wires are loose, but I'm pretty sure all the electronic are on one board, so there's not much you'd be able to do."

Rockband,3cx884,adderrson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:11:26 2015 UTC,The 360/PS3/Wii Les Paul and PS2 Kramer guitars use pins in contact with an exposed circuit board on the removable neck.  Over time the neck weakens and can begin to wiggle in it's socket and due to the nature of how of how the GH3 guitars work can cause buttons to not register.  The easiest fix for this is to take a piece and cut/fold it into a rectangle to pad out the back of the guitar neck connector and then jam the neck back on until it clicks. You'll notice the neck is now more structurally sound and hopefully should improve the performance of your ageing les paul.

It's definitely possible to find one for under $300, then you just have to get the MPA for $10-$20 and you're set.  And with an e-kit you get to use a real kick pedal.    Besides, the ions are basically an Alesis e-kit minus the brain and plus a game controller.  Keep an eye out for either the ions or a reasonably priced MIDI-capable e-kit.

Rockband,3cuwuz,eckstazy,2,Fri Jul 10 23:48:58 2015 UTC,What do you need to do? Just inject customs you've downloaded?
Rockband,3cuwuz,farottone,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:46:30 2015 UTC,i haven’t even got that far yet. I’m trying to install title update 4. on my virtual machine party buffalo is just telling me “no drives found...” and it looks like there is just a text file on the new usb drive I’m trying to use =\
Rockband,3cuwuz,NemoEsq,2,Sat Jul 11 00:50:40 2015 UTC,Sounds like you got the new update to your Xbox and your flash drive is formatted using the new system. Old tools like Party Buffalo won't work. You'll need RBtoUSB from C3 CON Tools...but be warned it is designed only for Windows and I do not guarantee it will work on a VM.
Rockband,3cuwuz,IBitePrettyHard,2,Sat Jul 11 04:09:17 2015 UTC,"yeah i actually figured it out. i got the new update, but with that i didn’t even need a file explorer. with a little guess work i was able to open the correct folders on the drive, replace the title update with 4 instead of 5, then simply drag and drop the custom song files into the right folder and it worked. it was super easy after i figured out where the files went."
Rockband,3cuwuz,IBitePrettyHard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:41:32 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you saying you got customs to work without using a PC, just a Mac?  I'd be very interested to know exactly how you did that, lol.  I've been wanting customs forever but never had access to a Windows machine."
Rockband,3cuwuz,farottone,2,Sat Jul 11 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"its super easy actually. just erase the usb drive you wanna use on your mac as ms dos using disk utility, then copy the files from your main drive like it says in the guide, then just find the files and paste them in on your mac. if you need more detailed instructions let me know and I’ll do a write up when i get home"

Rockband,3cuwuz,farottone,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"""Doing customs"" as in authoring songs? You can use the exact same software for autoring (Reaper) on your Mac, Magma C3 (which you need to compile your songs) only works on Windows but it will probably work in a Virtualbox under Mac OS. You can also choose to go the dual installation way and bootup on Windows. On our forums you can find all the guides to authoring songs. ;) If by ""doing customs"" you mean copying them to your Xbox, Velocity works fine, otherwise you can simply copy the files over if your USB drive has been formatted after the latest Xbox update."
Rockband,3cuwuz,sageamagoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I just want to play customs on my XBox...sorry I wasn't more clear, haha.

Is there any way you can quickly explain the procedure in terms an idiot would understand?"

Rockband,3cuwuz,IBitePrettyHard,2,Thu Jul 16 20:06:08 2015 UTC,you don’t even need velocity to do this though. just format the flash drive to ms dos from your mac then drop title update 4 where you find title update 5 and drop the songs where it says song cache and plug it in to your xbox and thats it

Totally agree on the independant breakneck speed as well. I can only play with breakneck speed on and my friends hate it."
Rockband,3cucyc,Kloporte,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like they're making excuses for laziness or have some kind of obnoxious ""That's not a REAL band!"" mentality.

Almost as if they revealed it too early and need more time."

Rockband,3cucyc,StefanGagne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe obnoxious wasn't the best word. Pretentious maybe? Kind of like the PC Master Race, who think anyone who plays on consoles are dumb. Anyone who doesn't play in a ""proper"" band in the game is dumb, and therefore we don't want that option. It's their game, they can do what they want, but it wouldn't make the decision any less pretentious. I'm not making any accusations, just guesses."
Rockband,3cucyc,PerfectAgent64,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's not pretention, it's a game design decision. If the makers of Call of Duty don't want to include a duck hunting minigame, even if it has a lot of fans demanding one, that's not them being pretentious, that's them making a decision about what they feel works best for their game.  You're free to disagree with the decision, but it's not made in some snide, nose-in-the-air snooty way. It's just how they feel the game works best."
Rockband,3cucyc,Anchor_Rancor,2,Sat Jul 11 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"The decision to include the feature or not is a game design decision, the reasoning behind that decision could be a number of things. Maybe it didn't work right, maybe they don't have money for it, or maybe they just don't want to make it, but it could also be some snooty way like ""That's not a real band"", hence the reference to the master race. Either way, it is their decision, and I'm not accusing them of being pretentious, at least not yet. Basically, I'm not saying the absence of this option is pretentious, but the meaning behind it's absence may be. I think this is unlikely because it was included in the past, but it's still a possibility."

Rockband,3csdbz,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"Complete list of downloadable songs for the Rock Band series:       The Rock Band series of music video games supports downloadable songs for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions through the consoles' respective online services. Such downloadable content comes from two sources; Harmonix typically provides three to six new tracks per week available to all consoles as listed below, and artists and authoring groups can submit their own tracks for peer review through the Rock Band Network.  Players can download songs on a track-by-track basis, with many of the tracks also offered as part of a ""song pack"" or complete album, usually at a discounted rate. Tracks released for Rock Band 2 on the Wii platform are only available as singles while Rock Band 3 offers multi-song packs as well as singles. Since on-disc songs are not available for download, some albums are incomplete. For example, the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik is available for download, which contains the song ""Give it Away"" on Rock Band 2 and Blitz, so the downloadable album does not include ""Give it Away"".  Most downloadable songs are playable within every game mode, including the Band World Tour career mode. All downloadable songs released prior to October 26, 2010 are cross-compatible among Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Rock Band 3, and Rock Band Blitz while those after only work with Rock Band 3 and Rock Band Blitz.  Also, certain pre-Rock Band 3 songs deemed ""suitable for all ages"" by Harmonix are also available for use in Lego Rock Band.   The Wii version of Rock Band does not support downloadable content; however, Rock Band 2 and Rock Band 3 do, with DLC first made available in January 2009.  Harmonix has said it will continue to release songs from the back catalog of downloadable content each week for Wii until all songs are available,  and starting in March 2009, is making new DLC available for Wii at the same time as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.  All songs are available for download on Wii unless otherwise noted.  After more than 5 years of uninterrupted DLC releases, Harmonix ended its regular releases of DLC on April 2, 2013 as it transitioned to other games, with the final song being Don McLean's ""American Pie"".  Although no new DLC was scheduled for release after that date, Harmonix did not rule out the possibility of releasing DLC in the future should the right opportunity arise. On January 12, 2015, Harmonix announced the first of one-off releases of new DLC.  The sudden release, along with a survey posted by Harmonix a few days later, hinted at the possibility of a new Rock Band game for eighth generation consoles.  Harmonix later confirmed Rock Band 4 on March 5, 2015, set for release on October 6, 2015 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.  After the initial announcement, Harmonix intended to support the Rock Band Network for Xbox 360 so long as the backend tools were still supported; however, due to technical issues and the company allocating its resources to other projects, Harmonix terminated support for the RBN in September 2014.  Additionally, RBN ports to the PlayStation 3 have ended on April 2, 2013 along with regular DLC.

Rockband,3cphw4,Bront20,2,Thu Jul 9 19:22:53 2015 UTC,Angela Surf City - The Walkmen  Such a fun song to play and probably would never have made it into the game if it wasn't for the Rock Band Network.  Hope that eventually comes back in RB4!
Rockband,3cphw4,logicalnoise,2,Thu Jul 9 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"Woho!  Free Stuff!  (PS3er here).  Boston's ""Peace of Mind"" is one of my favorite songs of all time, as well as one of my favorite RB songs.  I've managed to beat it into the kids head though repeat plays to where she's started liking other Boston songs as well (that aren't ""More Than A Feeling"", which I think requires you to be not human to hate).  I'll always love RB, but it means a lot to me that the kid not only loves playing it, but has moved from some of the playful songs on to other real songs and is constantly expanding the songs she likes and enjoying to find they're on Rock Band."
Rockband,3cphw4,SilentR0b,2,Thu Jul 9 19:29:43 2015 UTC,I really enjoy Mute Math on Drums so that's my fav. Unofficially the Tool customs have the actual best drums in the game.

I remember I was solely a guitar player (from the gh2 era) years ago and one day I randomly decided to check out some if the new dlc. I watched the guitar video and during the song I thought ""damn, the drums sound nuts on this""  and Oh man... I must have watched that video on loop for about 4 hours straight. I eventually did get to play it (and 5 star it!) a year later when I got a drum set. Man, what a fun song!"

See, my friends and I weren't some simple goons. We basically were rock gods. So we decided it was time for Endless Setlist 2. Never even did the first one since we were so badass. But what made this particular song so good? Well the song itself is amazing but I remember getting on hands and knees while belting out Dave Grohl's beautiful lyrics to push on the foot pedal for my brother while our bassist and guitarist shredded away. Of course we passed, but only because of our teamwork and ingenuity."

Second goes to Everlong, which became a recurring setlist finisher and eventually defined my now-wife and I's relationship to the point where we played a string arrangement of it at our wedding  Finally, Metric - Combat Baby is one of numerous amazing songs I never would have known without HMX's well curated playlists"

Rockband,3cphw4,MrDelish,2,Fri Jul 10 04:42:44 2015 UTC,"Oh man. So many ways to take this question.  I'll say Cherub Rock. As I learned drums, it was the first song I was able to play to an extremely advanced level. It was the first time I had finished a song and thought to myself ""ok, I can be really good at this"".  Favorite DLC is probably Typical by Mute Math. It's just such a great drum chart. Drummer everywhere who haven't played it yet, you are missing out! Kool Thing is also up there, man what a completely killer drum chart!  Favorite song, removed from RB gameplay and just as a piece of music? Panic Switch, Black, Everlong, Drive, Santeria, Californication, Diary of Jane, South Side of the Sky, Tribute, Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get Fooled Again, Shockwave. Idk."

Even though I'm a metalhead and people would probably expect me to write a metal song here, Machinehead is honestly my favorite Rock Band song and one of my favorite songs in general."

Just a great track all around, so much so that even its weaker instruments (vocals and keys) are still worth playing."

But there's still a lot of questions I want answers to. ""When"" and ""how much"" are good, but also ""What instruments will it support"" including GH instruments, is wired support truly gone, what about using keys as a guitar... things like that. And given they're busy trying to figure out how to make it work only three months before release, a HARDWARE PART which is not complete three months before release... that's concerning."

This is from the Rumors and Facts thread on the official forums:  “The plan for preorder colors had been to give certain colors to certain retailers. Unfortunately, the problem that popped up was one of stock. Giving certain places certain colors constrained sales, both limiting how many large retailers could get, and what would happen in other areas of the world like Europe who don’t have those retailers. Factories would also have to be slower when it came time to swap back over to black, so in the interest of having instruments out there, we had to delay alternate colors. They aren’t cancelled, MadCatz is very excited about different-looking instruments, but we had to decide between giving people the ‘wrong’ color and people not getting anything.”"

Rockband,3cna1l,Crimsonclaw111,5,Thu Jul 9 05:52:59 2015 UTC,"""Cutting"" is very different than ""redeveloping.""   I also don't know where the rumor started that practice and breakneck were out. I don't think those things have been mentioned in any way, but I'd be very, very surprised if they're not in at release. The mode they were in to demo the freestyle guitar in their livestream looked VERY much like a practice mode."
Rockband,3cna1l,ohsnapitsjf,2,Thu Jul 9 13:34:59 2015 UTC,"It came from the RBA interview with HMXhenry: Link   Will there be variable Breakneck/audio adjustment/incredibly detailed leaderboards?  ""Same answer, we haven’t put that stuff in yet.""  Will Practice Mode be in the game?  ""Maybe. Most of the use came from the hardcore players working towards FCs. Again, game’s still in development, we’ll see as we go.""   So yeah, the functionality could/may/will be added before launch, but the issue wasn't just concocted out of nowhere."
Rockband,3cna1l,forensick13,4,Thu Jul 9 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Wait wait wait, hold the fucking phone, no breakneck speed??  If that's true I can't buy RB4 :( I've played on hyperspeed 2 since 2008, there is no way I'm going to be able to play without breakneck speed!"
Rockband,3cna1l,spideyjiri,4,Thu Jul 9 11:19:53 2015 UTC,No one has said breakneck speed is removed. They just haven't commented on it.
Rockband,3cna1l,VinTheRighteous,5,Thu Jul 9 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"They're redeveloping things from the ground up, and have decided to say ""We're working on it"" for anything that's not in the game already.  Online has already been shoved off till after launch, so that gives them time for the local play.  Plus, it's expensive, and I'd rather it get delayed so they can do it right (which is what they look to be doing).  Practice?  BNS?  They're saying ""Maybe"" on these because at the moment they aren't in.  Chances are, both will be in the game, as there is both demand and precedence.  That said, they're building the entire engine from scratch.  At the moment, BREs aren't even in the game (they will be, but that's why they're charted on the demo videos).  Keep in mind, individual track speed was something included due to demand of the players.  So I expect that, as well as BNS and practice mode to be included, even if practice mode is just a revamped version of the RB3 one (which got complaints about not being able to slow down the song too much).  What we've seen now is the shell of a game with the new features to show so they could say ""Look, it's the old gameplay you remember, with a few new twists to make it yours"".  A lot of the old standard features of sit down and locally play RB are coming.  My guess is most of the improvements RB3 made (No fail mode still counting on the leaderboards, individual track speed) are coming as well.  Honestly, thinking about it, Individual track speed is more important that I've been giving it credit for.  It basically saved my parties (The Drummer hated the speeds constantly changing, as he played on easy or medium, and those of us that played at a higher level wanted BNS on then, but since we kept swapping people, the difficulty still changed and played with the speed he was using, and my preference is expert speed without BNS).  So I hope it's coming."
Rockband,3cna1l,Bront20,2,Thu Jul 9 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"They don't have a lot of money, is what it basically comes down to."
Rockband,3cna1l,NuclearFej,2,Wed Jul 15 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that they are rushing it. It comes out in just a few months and from what I've seen from their current installments which have been previewed at E3 the game is nowhere near finished. They say they will avidly listen to the community and keep updating the game after its release. Although, I would honestly prefer if they just waited a little longer and released a game with more features. Its kind of late for that now though considering that they already have a release date deadline they have commited to.  It kind of sucks that we dont know whats going on and I just hope Harmonix just adds what we want to the game. They have said before ""this game is considering everything the community wants."" Although Im pretty sure nobody said ""Hey I want vocal improv and freestyle guitars solos but no online play screw that."" The only thing that they have listened to the community on is dlc cross compatibility and controller cross compatibility, and as of now the controller cross compatibility isnt even confirmed to be full. Honestly the more and more I hear updates for Rock Band 4 the more and more disappointed I become..."
Rockband,3cna1l,ModestMusician,2,Thu Jul 9 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"Well Harmonix employees need to get paid soon to feed themselves and their partner and major supplier MadCatz needs the money soon or they will be out of business. As a result, Harmonix will be under pressure to find a new hardware supplier. That's the reality of the situation.  But, I am disappointed in Rock Band 4's launch features. I only play Rock Band locally so it doesn't affect me, but the lack of midi drum support is disappointing. Maybe a CronusMax code will be able to hack or trick the game or a company will release an adapter or module for Rock Band 4 at a consumer-friendly price. As for keyboard support, I rarely bothered using my keyboard until I got into RB customs. My catalog will be downgraded if I switch to Rock Band 4 and the only plus I see are 50-60 songs that aren't in customs and 1080p visual update."
Rockband,3cna1l,Very_Toxic_Person,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:33:04 2015 UTC,"Their priorities are a result of multiple surveys they sent out in to the community. Obviously online play did not rank highly among a majority of users, so it's a feature that was pushed. With a studio their size, with a limited budget, they have to make priorities. This game can't be all things to all people, so it has to be the best it can to the majority of people."
Rockband,3cna1l,VinTheRighteous,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"About the rumor about no BNS and practice mode in rb4:  This tweet doesn't confirm anything, but it states the possibility that BNS might not be in the launch game. ""subject to change"" so I think it's still likely it would be in  And about practice mode, I can't find a source on this but I remember that someone from HMX saying that very few people actually used practice mode and that they have to focus on priorities, the way it was phrased made it seem kinda unlikely it would be in the launch product.  So yeah, we will probably get BNS. Practice Mode is up in the air at this point."

Rockband,3clmgk,SmokedCheesePig,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"Find an Ion kit. You won't be sorry. If you don't want to shell out the money for a new one pick up a used one but make sure the controller itself is working. Beyond that you can replace the drum pads and cymbals relatively cheaply. I upgraded to Pintech cymbals and it was well worth it. They work with the Ion mounting hardware so all you have to do is swap out the pad itself.  I also upgraded to a Rock Pedal. I know those aren't around anymore but I'm sure someone can give advice on what's currently available. There wasn't much to that mod itself but having a real pedal, with a practice pad, made a huge difference for me.  Edited for clarity"
Rockband,3clmgk,Kloporte,2,Thu Jul 9 00:24:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure. I read posts about people telling everyone how awesome Ion drums are everywhere, but buying a brand new e-drumset along with RB3 and a MIDI-Pro adapter would be even cheaper.  I know the way the pads are positioned on a Ion kit is better for Rock Band (and probably takes less place), but spending up to 600$ for it seems like a waste of money to me.  For instance, I bought a brand-new Millenium MPS-200 kit for 320$, it works perfectly on RB and I can use it as a regular drumkit."
Rockband,3clmgk,Storm360,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"Ions were great back in the day, but they really aren't the best option now, back then, ions weren't that expensive and it cost a pretty penny to get a really nice e-kit, now that's changed. If you're gonna pay $600 for ions, you can get a nice cheap starting e-kit, maybe even a mid range kit if you're willing to shop used and look around for a good deal. This comes with the benefit of just overall higher quality equipment (the bass drum pedal for sure!), a easier time upgrading and finding replacement parts, and a option to play outside the game if you ever want to take your drumming further (this also has some other benefits, I personally like muting the drums in game and overlaying the audio from my e-kit over it)"
Rockband,3clmgk,kerminsr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:02:10 2015 UTC,Yeah the ion's worst feature is that you can't use a real kick pedal with it.  It would be perfect if it supported a real kick pedal.  Back in the day it wasn't a problem.  There were a few products you could buy to let you use a real pedal with the ions.  I remember I played with my ion set for about 2 days before buying the kickbox (the name of the adapter to play with a real pedal).  Now all of the online stores don't carry them anymore and you can't even find them on ebay.
Rockband,3clmgk,ohsnapitsjf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:49:58 2015 UTC,"The only caveat I'd throw in is if you ever feel like upgrading to XBOne and RB4, as it stands now, the high-quality drumkits will NOT be compatible with the new system. Just the wireless ones. They say they may figure out how to patch it in the future, but I just wanted to give you fair warning on that if it was a factor."

They have only had two options in the menu: Shows and Quickplay. The builds at their office probably have everything else.   I bet they created the demo build to have just a core set of things to show off because including everything could contain bugs they haven't fixed and the risk of someone revealing stuff they don't what to show off yet.

Rockband,3cg2of,gisdood,2,Tue Jul 7 18:29:57 2015 UTC,Go to a carpet store and see what kind of leftover roll-ends of under-carpet padding they have kicking around.  Get the thickest stuff you can.
Rockband,3cg2of,Bront20,2,Tue Jul 7 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking between this idea and a yoga mat suggested below, it should work. Appreciate the help!"
Rockband,3cg2of,Bront20,3,Tue Jul 7 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"Some kind of pad below the kick pedal may help.  I do agree that making friends with the neighbors may help, particularly if you find out when the noise might bother them the least.  Something like a Yoga mat might actually do the trick well.  I swear by the XCell pads I got for my drumkit, as they've lasted 4 years and the only issue is they've needed to be re-adheared to the kit once (which was easy).  The Cymbals are pretty quiet already."
Rockband,3cg2of,Bront20,2,Tue Jul 7 18:25:21 2015 UTC,I use a destroyer pedal as my kick pedal. Would a yoga mat be enough to muffle the noise? Has it worked for you?
Rockband,3cg2of,gisdood,3,Tue Jul 7 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"I made a custom pedal, but I own a home so it's not an issue.  I just figured a yoga pad will add a combination of cushion and noise muffling, and might be booth cheep enough and large enough to fit your drum kit on.  I've heard of people who have built platforms on wood and foam and those help supposedly, but that's rather expensive and bulky.  The worst thing you do is try it, and find the $10-$20 solution doesn't work.  You may even be able to return the mat."
Rockband,3cg2of,Jedmart,2,Tue Jul 7 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"I will definitely be trying this. One last question; do you know if using a kick-pad(hopefully the right word) instead would make it quieter, or would this be the better route?"
Rockband,3cg2of,LostVector,2,Tue Jul 7 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"A kick pad may help, as the force is partially directed forward.  The issue isn't as much noise locally, but force directed downwards to make noice for the people below you.  I'd try the mat first."
Rockband,3cg2of,Bront20,2,Tue Jul 7 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll go with the mat first. Appreciate your input!"
Rockband,3cg2of,ohsnapitsjf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:21:16 2015 UTC,I found the kickpad setup much quieter than a conventional rock band pedal - it made it much easier to focus on speed and accuracy and not just stomping the crap out of the pedal :)  My pedal setup.
Rockband,3cg2of,ohsnapitsjf,2,Tue Jul 7 18:57:00 2015 UTC,Sweet setup! Most have cost a fortune.
Rockband,3cg2of,Nyxyxylyth,2,Tue Jul 7 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"I personally use a memory foam pillow for the bass pedal. Yeah, it elevates it a little bit but as long as you're not stomping like a madman it absorbs pretty much all the sound and vibration."
Rockband,3cg2of,IBitePrettyHard,2,Tue Jul 7 18:56:25 2015 UTC,Also a good idea. Do you know where I could get some in a small-ish size?

Rockband,3cf0t4,PantsAflame,8,Tue Jul 7 12:04:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, same way they discontinued DLC with RB2 when it became incompatible with the new releases."
Rockband,3cf0t4,evuldave,9,Tue Jul 7 12:08:17 2015 UTC,"RB4 uses a new engine, the songs will not be backwards compatable with RB1-3."
Rockband,3cf0t4,Sayburr,3,Tue Jul 7 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"No, because the new songs will contain things like vocal improv lines that won't work on old games (just how like Rock Band 3 DLC doesn't work in old RB games)."
Rockband,3cf0t4,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Tue Jul 7 13:36:49 2015 UTC,No it won't. If they were going to do it they would have announced that already.
Rockband,3cf0t4,Gr8NonSequitur,2,Tue Jul 7 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"It's been confirmed by HMX that the free song released with the RB4 announcement was the last RB3 song to ever be released.   The good news is that they still get paid for RB3 songs you buy now, and any new songs you buy on the old system will transfer to the new system eventually.  But they need to move on  Still, no one's stopping you from playing RB3.  And it sounds like buying a PS4 isn't entirely out of the question, so when you do, RB4 will be there for you (and your RB3 instruments, which should mostly work)."
Rockband,3cf0t4,Bront20,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"There is no technical reason why RB4 DLC shouldn't work on RB3, it would just be a matter of exporting content removing all added features. However, they probably want everyone to jump over to RB4, and that is the most likely reason why RB3 won't have new DLC."
Rockband,3ce3cn,aledclar,3,Tue Jul 7 04:55:00 2015 UTC,All we know is that it exists and that Harmonix plans to have it available at launch. Also only XB1 users need it since PS3 dongles will work on the PS4.

Rockband,3ce3cn,Altruit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"Official word from Harmonix is that wired instruments will not be supported at all.  This may change, but that's the current take. Wireless only, and for XB1, you'll need an adapter (which is unavailable right now, has no release date, no price, and no details.)"

Rockband,3cd74a,MeshuggahIsLife,2,Tue Jul 7 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly! I dont want to export, i just want the songs that were in the previous games."
Rockband,3cd74a,larunex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"The rock band 1 export code can be bought from the PSN store, and once you buy it, its bound to your account. They will transfer. Rock band 2 is alittle iffy, you need to call EA but even then nowadays most people can't get one. and rock band 3 is a no-go, (something something licensing issues).    Unless you mean just regular old DLC, harmonix has said it will all work. Just be sure to buy what you want soon because most licences will eventually expire."
Rockband,3cd74a,wearing2raincoats,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this info is somewhere else, but do you know if I can just buy and use the X360 RB1 export code if I didn't have RB1 for 360? I had it for PS2 and I suspect I need the disc for the correct console, but just wanna be sure. I'm sure I can buy a used copy if I need to."
Rockband,3cd74a,Jmcglosson,3,Tue Jul 7 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"You would need the disc to export the songs. Simply buying the license doesn't work, you have to buy the license and then hit a button in the game's menu to export the songs. But a used copy will work there, no worries. And you can get a used copy from Gamestop for $0.99.  With Rock Band 2, I did have to go to EA to get a working export code, but their customer support chat didn't even ask for a proof of purchase, which I was willing to give. They just gave me the code that I asked for."

Lego won't export anymore, but you can get 2 of the queen songs in the RB3 upgrade pack, and the Bon Jovi song from the Bon Jovi 12 pack, and a live version of Jimi Hendrix's ""Fire"", so you can get 4 of the 45 songs.  Green Day Rock Band doesn't export anymore, but all the songs are available as DLC now, so you can pick and choose what you want unless you want them all  (There are several fun songs there, and I wouldn't have found them if I didn't buy GDRB, but if I had to buy them now, I'd cherry pick.

Rockband,3cbiyr,snootchie_bootch,2,Mon Jul 6 18:17:14 2015 UTC,I tried that and it didn't work. What did end up working was going to the Quick Play section and playing the songs once each. They then showed up in all the other game modes.
Rockband,3cbiyr,Anchor_Rancor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:42:22 2015 UTC,I think I've had this happen too. We're they just grayed out until you highlighted them?

It lets you play the song for about 30 seconds, I think. If you actually plan on buying the song, though, getting the demo makes you unable to play the song in Training without first playing it in Quickplay every time you start the game."

Rockband,3c5zy4,Spankmeister88,4,Mon Jul 6 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"I already have a PS4 -- oddly enough for Amplitude -- but I also bought an XBone for RB4, since all my DLC is in the xbox family. I'm  hoping to get a legacy adapter (when and if they actually release it) rather than buy all new instruments.  Chances are low of another drop before October. You might get one in the Black Friday Holiday Hellscape but by then the game will already have been out for some time, and if you don't wanna wait, I say go for it. If you need to save money, buy a refurbished XBox instead of a new unit."
Rockband,3c5zy4,StefanGagne,3,Sun Jul 5 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"Is it 100% confirmed that DLC won't port across consoles?

I'm actually surprised the bundle is 350 as it is considering it isn't that old (makes sense though considering the troubles they've had). I have an old RB guitar I found at goodwill but I feel like it's a gamble with old guitars. I'd hate to buy a goodwill guitar, and game-only, only for the guitar to die a month later you know? Is there any news on how the new hardware looks? Or quality?"
Rockband,3c5zy4,StefanGagne,3,Sun Jul 5 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"New hardware's tip-top and well made, by all accountings.  Despite wanting to use the legacy adapter, I'm ordering the guitar+game bundle. Why? Well, Mad Catz is having financial problems, and I'm concerned that if my old instruments die (as you're worried about too) I'll be utterly screwed because the company that made them folded.  If you can afford it, the best route is $350 console, $150 guitar bundle. That's the safest path. But if you're cash-strapped, $250-300 refurbished console, $60 game, and $10-20? legacy adapter ($320-$380 total). Riskier, but hey."
Rockband,3c5zy4,Redgouf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll probably go with the former. I heard about that Mad Catz thing today and that's mighty unfortunate... I'm sure Harmonix is probably not too happy about it either. Wouldn't be surprised if they're shopping around for a back-up company. Well, I hope it works out. With all the licensing they'll have to do to get all this DLC back, it's going to cost Harmonix a fortune (if they pull it off). I'm kinda thinking this is Harmonix going ""all-in"" so to speak."

Rockband,3c5zy4,Nyxyxylyth,2,Sun Jul 5 12:58:36 2015 UTC,I will be buying an Xbone for RB4. I really wanted to go PS4 this generation but can't since all my DLC is on Xbox. I did pre order the game and full kit on both platforms just in case they managed to get cross platform DLC transfers going on (but based on this thread I should cancel that idea). I have some very old RB1 instruments that need to be replaced because the drums are super loud and the strum bars are not working that well.
Rockband,3c5zy4,EdTanguy,2,Sun Jul 5 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"I have a PS3 with a ton of Rock Band DLC and was waiting for a while to see whether or not it was worth getting a PS4.  Since RB4 was announced, I'm likely going to pick one up before the end of the year.  There are a few other games that I will most likely want as well (Infamous: Second Son, Uncharted 4, and I'm sure there's a few others I could point out) so I feel more comfortable in picking up a PS4 now.  Over the last few years I've migrated over to PC for my gaming, and I already have a Wii U that I haven't played as much I would like.  Adding a PS4 into the mix is definitely not a priority of mine right now.

Rockband,3c46vc,runujhkj,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"The only part I hate about rb3 is the lack of versus modes, a really stupid thing to leave out."
Rockband,3c46vc,spideyjiri,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:27:13 2015 UTC,You're not wrong.
Rockband,3c46vc,runujhkj,9,Sun Jul 12 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"3, hands down. I usually play through campaigns once in games, so in Rock Band I end up exclusively playing quickplay after a week.  The overshell is the greatest thing ever. Being able to drop in and out, switch instruments easily, change settings, and limit the amount of full screen menus made things run faster.  I recently went back to play RB2, and it is so slow, bland, and tedious. The highway in 3 is so much better, the characters look a lot more detailed, the dynamic music in the menus is genius (I got sick of hearing set list songs in the old games), and I loved all the challenges (even though locking some clothes behind the impossible ones was a bit cruel).  Pro Drums is basically 95% of why I play the game now so that was an amazing addition (the fact that it worked retroactively blew my mind). Rolling the highways back after pausing is also something I can't live without in music games now.  My opinion is very high of this game, but I also managed to not have some of the issues other people had. I played on 360, so no crashing to XMB or sound screeching. I also rarely played online so I never got annoyed by the terrible way you chose songs. I would have played online more if they kept the vs modes though. I hated how you couldn't see your locally saved scored unless you were online. (unless you made a one song playlist and viewed it there).  I believe many people think RB2 was the best because they are basing it on the setlist or have clouded memories of how the game actually played."
Rockband,3c46vc,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,4,Sat Jul 4 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"Great answer. It's easy to forget how essential the menu optimizations are after you get used to them. So many little changes that made parties run smoother, combined with pro mode... there's no question, RB3 was the best one."
Rockband,3c46vc,sageamagoo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"Rock Band 3 is easily the best, but Rock Band 2 had two great features that weren't in 3.  First, head-to-head.  I miss being able to challenge other people.  Second, the online quickplay.  Rock Band 2 was simple.  One person picked one song, you'd play it, then another person would pick the next song.  In Rock Band 3 it's just crazyness and you always get that one asshat who picks more than one song."
Rockband,3c46vc,AR-47,22,Tue Jul 7 05:05:15 2015 UTC,I had the most fun with 2. Its on disc setlist is the best in my opinion and it was the newest rockband game during the time that rythym games were still extremely popular. So there were more people playing it and I met a lot of friends from playing Rock Band 2. Maybe the game wasnt better but at the time I enjoyed it more than I ever did rock band 3.

Rockband,3c46vc,spideyjiri,5,Thu Jul 9 11:29:55 2015 UTC,Rock band 3   Best setlist can house every rock band song from every game mechanics feel great graphics look really polished and the lanes are improved the goal system works really well and has the best campaign of all RB's keyboard pro instruments online isn't absolute shat
Rockband,3c46vc,dwfan24,2,Sat Jul 4 21:58:10 2015 UTC,"What Campaign? Random set lists with slight goals is a campaign? There's no gain to playing through multiple times, no different venues or any real reason to with anyone other then yourself. All the other RockBands focused on Band Building."
Rockband,3c46vc,paynexkiller,3,Sat Jul 4 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"You gain fans by playing gigs, to unlock higher class venues.  So yes, you build your band like every other rock band game.  What values are there in other rock bands that rock band 3 doesn't have? Played through all 3 and rock band offered the most. Did you even play the campaign and not just the goals?"
Rockband,3c46vc,dwfan24,2,Sat Jul 4 23:07:23 2015 UTC,"I ask again, what campaign? What do Fans give? Anything? All I saw from 'fans' was ranks. Oh, you mean the screen where it says '3 Alice in Chains Songs.' '3 Rock Band 1 songs.'   Was that a campaign? Like, seriously? I mean actually give it some thought and compare it to the journey that bands would go through on RB1 or 2. Playing songs to make money to buy their characters new clothes, hair and god knows what else (Guitars shaped like Hands.) instead in the 'awesome' RB3, you just get given everything for free. What a complete and utter waste of time.   Which Is why I ask, do you really consider that a Campaign?"
Rockband,3c46vc,paynexkiller,0,Sat Jul 4 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not home right now, so I can't directly lead you to it.  But there was a campaign. It took me a while to find it as well. What you are talking about is just the goals.  IIRC to get to the campaign you have to go to: Career>Rock Band>and then something like gigs. I'll reply again as soon as I find out for sure."
Rockband,3c46vc,dwfan24,0,Sun Jul 5 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, I remember. It was road challenge  Play now>start a road challenge.  You play through multiple gigs unlocking new venues going on. Yes, you start out with all the songs from the begging. But I consider that a plus considering 90% of people don't want to blow through the career right away (including me).  And what are you talking about on having all the costumes from the start? You have to unlock them by doing goals/progressing in road challenge. Which I thought was way better considering you can't just blow through the campaign on easy to rake in a ton of cash to buy everything. In RB3 you actually have to try and be skillful."
Rockband,3c46vc,dwfan24,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"No. Road Challenge isn't a decent campaign mode in the slighest. Compared to the Journeys you went on in Rock Band1 and 2, that actually led you to the Endless Setlist and the 'Rock and Roll' Hall of fame. What do the Road challenges lead you to? A couple hats? You can't call that a campaign. Or a story. Because it's not.  It's a menu.   It's like calling the shooting range in GTA5 a story compared to the entire game of GTA4 or 3."

Someone is also probably on keys."
Rockband,3c46vc,AR-47,2,Tue Jul 7 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"Tie between 2 and 3, leaning whichever way you prefer.  RB2 has a better tour mode and a more fair way of earning character customizations (tied to money instead of achievements).   RB3 has more instruments (pro modes, keys, harmonies) and much better DLC integration, and can be hacked to run customs.  My hope was that RB4 will be a best-of-both-worlds scenario, with RB2's tour mode and customization alongside RB3's rich feature set and DLC, but we've lost enough features along the way that I'm not sure anymore."
Rockband,3c46vc,StefanGagne,2,Sat Jul 4 17:10:41 2015 UTC,2 was my favorite because of on disc setlist and presentation. Beatles will always have a place in my heart though because the creativity there was cool as hell.

Plus I loved online head to head score duels and such."
Rockband,3c46vc,canhasdrums,2,Sat Jul 4 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Rock Band 2 was arguably my favorite game of last generation.  ""But why wouldn't you pick Rock Band 3?"" because quite frankly Harmonix shit on the PS3 version of RB3. It wasn't gamebreakingly bad, but it was noticeably inferior. Plus IMO the game didn't have the same ""oomph"" that RB2 did. It felt like they tried to do too much instead of making a concentrated video game like RB2.

Rockband,3c46vc,Sygenysis,2,Sat Jul 4 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"I think that 2 is the best in terms of presentation, and the one I can remember having the most fun with. It's also the most challenging, in my opinion, as far as on-disc songs go.  I think that it's definitely between 2 and 3, but the problems in RB3, like no competitive options, bizarre song tiering, and a lack of a world tour mode (which was my favorite part of 2) were where 2 shined best, in my opinion.  As of late, though, in a party setting, I think that 3 is much better, since the harmonies and keys are both fun to play, and fit any ensemble of players, even if they suck. On top of that, customs are really good at increasing the longevity and playability of RB3, and being relatively easy to add to the game is something else RB2 lacked.  All this being said, yeah, at a party or get together, I'm breaking out RB3, but I think that 2 is in its own relative spot, the better game."

There was a point when they used to offer BOGO deals for guitars and fighting sticks. I can see them depending a lot on the success of Rock Band 4 and Street Fighter V."
Rockband,3bxxd5,Very_Toxic_Person,12,Fri Jul 3 03:38:38 2015 UTC,"It's a big bet, and now it's very clear to see why preorders are being pushed so hard.

Rockband,3bxxd5,Fastla,13,Fri Jul 3 04:27:48 2015 UTC,It seems like they're putting much more of their money time and effort into this than i thought
Rockband,3bxxd5,OutsideOwl,13,Fri Jul 3 02:00:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this isn't a burning ship.  I don't want to see rock band release, madcatz go out of business, then the flow of instruments stop and they sell out everywhere."

Rockband,3bxxd5,biosehnsucht,3,Fri Jul 3 07:21:03 2015 UTC,"That's my worry. If Madcatz goes down, two things happen:  One, if you were relying on the legacy adapter and your old instruments, you are on death watch for them croaking and no replacements being available.  Two, if the funding for the game dries up because the publisher went out of business, the promised post-launch support will dry up as well. Online play would basically be impossible, since it requires a LOT of money, and the money would be gone.  I really don't want RB4 to sink before it's even launched..."

Rockband,3bxxd5,Klynn7,2,Sat Jul 4 06:05:23 2015 UTC,"One follows the other, though. Instruments become unavailable, players can't play the game, so they don't buy the game, so it doesn't sell, so HMX doesn't get money, so they can't add features. They're inextricably tied to each other."
Rockband,3bxxd5,StefanGagne,2,Sat Jul 4 13:05:59 2015 UTC,"Nope, Mad Catz co-publishes the game, addressing marketing and worldwide sales too."

Rockband,3bxxd5,Klynn7,3,Tue Jul 7 06:22:20 2015 UTC,well this certainly explains the hardware-only pre-orders
Rockband,3bxxd5,sarcasticorange,-15,Fri Jul 3 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"And this is why I'm just sticking to the instruments I have If I get the game at this point. The more I hear about RB4, the less excited I am, and this is coming from someone who's preordered every Rock Band since release. It's just seeming shadier and shadier. Harmonix also dropped the ball REALLY badly with Dance Central Spotlight by releasing a broken game without fixing its issues and prematurely pulling the plug on DLC less than a year into its release, which is pretty bad considering it's dependent on DLC. Rock Band 4 is going to need to prove itself before I consider dropping a cent on it. EDIT: Found an article and it seems more of a MadCatz issue than a Harmonix issue. I hate MadCatz with a burning passion. Seriously, fuck those guys. I bought a wireless bass from their store and it worked for four hours. I contacted customer support and they said they'd get back to me shortly. It's been four years. Also I had one of their memory cards for the Gamecube. I stored my Pokemon Box data on there, and one day it corrupted. I lost all of the pokemon I'd been collecting for years. Seriously, fuck MadCatz and the cheap shit they produce. If they go out of business, the gaming hardware industry will be a better place."
Rockband,3bxxd5,SharkSocks,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:42:09 2015 UTC,I thought they were working on a Dance Central 4. Also wasn't spotlight like $10? I thought the point of that game was to get something out on the new console before they worked on a proper sequel.
Rockband,3bxxd5,wwwes32,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"Spotlight is $10 with 10 tracks. It's intended to be a springboard for DLC since a DC title isn't very fun with just 10 songs. Considering that it's a title nearly dependent on DLC, it's ridiculous to pull the plug on DLC support less than a year in its lifespan. The last DLC update last month actually breaks your DC library if you purchase a new song from the xbox store and not the in-game store. Thing is, it doesn't show up in the in-game store, so the only way to buy it is through the xbox store. Any songs I've purchased after ""Replay"" can't be played and don't show up in fitness playlists. I put in a ticket and contacted HMX outside of that and it doesn't appear that fixing the broken game is a priority."

Rockband,3bzdck,OutsideOwl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:59:11 2015 UTC,"All other points aside, focusing on the Mad Catz issue...  It's concerning because if Mad Catz goes under, two major events happen.  One, current instruments become rarer than they've ever been before, 'cause no more will ever be made. Meaning if you wanted to go the legacy-adapter route, you're screwed if your already five-year-old instruments stop working. I know I've changed my preorder to a guitar bundle despite having two perfectly working guitars out of fear I may never get a replacement guitar again.  Two, if their publisher croaks, Harmonix may not be able to deliver on their promise to keep supporting the game after launch. Online play? No way, no how, that's expensive and if Mad Catz dies, if the money stream dries up, HMX is boned.  I got a baaaad feeling RB4 is a sinking ship even before it's been launched to sea. I'll do what I can to support it but at this point my expectations are nice and low."

It isn't mushy. You can feel when the switches actuate, without a loud click like Guitar Hero guitars. I know it doesn't support Mad Katz, but I've never been happy with Mad Katz products, and I've been running into them since I bought a second PlayStation controller from them in the 90s. (The D-pad broke within a week.)"
Rockband,3bzdck,frigginelvis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like Harmonix actually doesn't die even if Mad Catz does, why would it? If Harmonix was only ever selling copies of Rock Band with hardware, that'd be one thing, but if they're just selling feature packs to existing customers, that's something else, they can do that directly through the MS/PS stores."
Rockband,3bzdck,wwwes32,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"To hardcore existing fans, sure. But that would mean zero growth in the player base; nowhere to go but down. If new players don't join in because no instruments are available the game will fail. Heck, if old players can't rejoin because they sold their instruments or broke them and can't get replacements the game will fail. Growth is a must."

Rockband,3bv2y3,TheDudeD09,3,Thu Jul 2 11:46:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, just so you know, if you bought any DLC for 360, it will NOT transfer to PS4. The DLC transferring is only valid within the same console family.  Second, RB3 is currently not exportable. We haven't heard that it definitively won't be at some point, but for now, those songs won't be available for RB4.  As far as the older exports, I believe you will either need to find a new copy of RB2 (exceptionally hard), or a used copy and then contact EA for an export code under the guise that you had one and lost it. Apparently they're somewhat liberal about it, so that might be the easier route."
Rockband,3bv2y3,ohsnapitsjf,2,Thu Jul 2 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that you can no longer export songs, from any game"

Rockband,3bv2y3,Storm360,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:32:20 2015 UTC,really? I just imported RB1/2 into RB3 last week (360).
Rockband,3bv2y3,fatalmedia,3,Thu Jul 2 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"Track Packs: Absolutely.  If you can find them for cheap, they all still work.  AC/DC is still at most Walmarts in clearance.  Lego: It's expired, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Blitz: You can buy it online and you'll have the songs.  Green Day: It's expired, and will no longer export.  You can get these all as DLC, so it's not too bad.  RB1: Export works the same as the 360.  Buy the key, then do the export.  You may not need to actually do the export at this point though, as that simply copies the files to your HD from the disk.  RB2: The free 20 code has expired, and the export has expired, but if you contact EA support for RB3, they will sometimes give you the code.  If you end up buying songs, I would suggest avoiding RBN songs to start, as we're still not sure if or when any of those will come over."
Rockband,3bv2y3,Bront20,2,Thu Jul 2 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Also, don't forget to get all the free songs from the store."

Rockband,3bv2y3,Unldentified,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:09:01 2015 UTC,You need rock band 3 to export the rock band 2 songs. At least that's how it works for Xbox because the export code is 16 characters and 16 characters can only be redeemed from in game.
Rockband,3bv2y3,Bront20,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"RB1?  Yes, you don't need a new copy.  RB2?  In theory you need a new copy for the code, but if you contact EA Support, they may get you a direct download code (so you don't need RB2 at all).  Otherwise, the export is expired.  But you in theory need RB3 to redeem the export code.  So what you need is a copy of RB3."

Rockband,3bql9f,Bront20,2,Wed Jul 1 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"RB3 introduced Roll Lanes, Strum Lanes, and Trill Lanes.  Crazy Train on Expert Guitar has Strum Lanes and Trill Lanes.  The concept is that fast strumming sections or trills can be hard to hit because it's easy to go too fast or too slow.  The lanes let you go faster than needed without missing notes, so you can basically go nuts.  The biggest issue seems to be you need to strum the first note regardless, so changing from a RB to a RY trill will sometimes have you miss a note when you shouldn't, which can be frustrating.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfzY9r1yYVc  Meanwhile, while I don't know a disc song with roll lanes, I believe Wanted Dead or Alive has a few for some cymbal rolls.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttI7Gc-m3cc&feature=youtu.be&t=88"

Rockband,3bobhc,MrChiodos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"I suppose I can see why some might see it as distasteful. That's why I was originally hoping for more of a trade.  To be fair, I didn't get it for free. I got it because I paid for a new copy of Rock Band 2, then happened to get more than one code in dealing with EA."
Rockband,3bobhc,MmmmmKittens,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"If it's impossible to get more from EA, I'd be willing to buy one as well. I was able to find a new RB2 but I'm not sure how exactly people export nowadays."

Just follow this video, and INSTEAD of using PartyBuffalo use RBtoUSB in this program. Whenever you have your customs USB plugged in, just never update Rock Band 3"
Rockband,3bmltv,mbsurfer,3,Tue Jun 30 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"How do you load over 400 songs into rb3? When i try to load 1,475 songs it always freezes. When i load 400 songs it works."
Rockband,3bmltv,10eazye,5,Tue Jun 30 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"You can have up to 2,952 songs. If it's freezing then one or more of the songs you're adding are corrupted."
Rockband,3bmltv,NemoEsq,2,Tue Jun 30 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"I deleted all the corrupt songs, but I still get that. Would using c3 con tools help? If a song has no cover art when you look at the file on your 360, does that mean it's corrupt? I've deleted every corrupt song that says corrupt, but the issue still arises."
Rockband,3bmltv,10eazye,2,Tue Jun 30 19:43:31 2015 UTC,I'm presently at ~2100 songs across 1100 files. Takes a minute to count them each load but it still works.

People like you love to jump at the chance to say I act like a douche with my curt responses...but it's because people like you usually end up running into problems that could have been avoided had you heeded my advice. So I won't help you now. The answers to your questions are already answered in the C3 forums. Do your own damn research."

Rockband,3bmltv,mbsurfer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:16:43 2015 UTC,So do you have to play offline? If I'm offline I can't use my DLC songs
Rockband,3bmltv,frigginelvis,6,Tue Jun 30 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"Correct. You can't go online if you are playing customs. That's why you should have a second USB with Title Update 5 on it, so that you can plug that in instead to go online."
Rockband,3bmltv,Phil_Bond,2,Tue Jun 30 14:42:40 2015 UTC,If I'm offline I can't use my DLC songs   This sounds like you need to do a license transfer. Have you gotten a replacement Xbox at some point?
Rockband,3bmltv,NemoEsq,2,Tue Jun 30 19:35:16 2015 UTC,Person who'll never hack the game here: I can't believe Microsoft would do that. Being able to load three or more people's complete music collections into the game at a time by having two collections saved to external USB drives was a killer feature that we used at parties and conventions all the time.
Rockband,3bmltv,Phil_Bond,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:39:02 2015 UTC,Not sure what you're saying Microsoft wouldn't do?
Rockband,3bmltv,NemoEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding OP correctly, they're saying that you can't format a USB drive for use as external Xbox360 memory anymore, which sounds crazy to me.  Is that not what they were saying?"
Rockband,3bmltv,Phil_Bond,3,Tue Jun 30 18:25:53 2015 UTC,Not what they're saying. Xbox changed how it formats drives so now it's just a simple FAT32 format rather than the proprietary FATX format they were using before. So the old tools that handled FATX don't work with this new system.
Rockband,3bmltv,NemoEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, so this only affects customs community and other hackers? That's a relief. My condolences though. Thank you."
Rockband,3bmltv,Phil_Bond,5,Tue Jun 30 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you keep referring to ""hackers"" - there are no ""hackers"" involved in any of the customs community. Modifying game content for personal use is legal in many countries and is in no way ""hacking."" In any case, this change affects all users of Xbox 360s - if you play ANY game and intend to back up your save file, or copy content from the PC to the Xbox, or from the Xbox to the PC, this issue affects you. My tool is specific to Rock Band customs usage, but I'm sure other tools exist or will be made soon to account for the new system."
Rockband,3bmltv,NemoEsq,-3,Tue Jun 30 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"If you use software like Rock Band 3, or hardware like an Xbox 360, in a way that's contradicts the intentions of the creators, especially if it affords you new creative opportunities or saves you money, then you're hacking. It's not necessarily illegal or immoral (although hacking usually goes that way), and it doesn't matter that you don't have the technological know-how to create all the necessary tools yourself (no hacker does). It's still hacking, and you're a hacker if you hack something. There's no reason to be modest or dishonest about it."
Rockband,3bmltv,Phil_Bond,2,Wed Jul 1 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"I think you ought to do some research on the definition of the word hacking and the practice of hacking. This is modding. Not hacking. It's like calling the Xbox One and the PS4 ""next gen"" consoles. They're current gen, Xbox 360 and PS3 are last gen. It's all a matter of semantics. You sure seem put off by the idea of ""hacking"" your game, unnecessarily so."
Rockband,3bmltv,NemoEsq,-3,Wed Jul 1 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"How about instead of telling me that I don't know what hacking is, you tell me what it is with a definition that can't include the concept of modding."
Rockband,3bmltv,TheAnsiBomb,2,Wed Jul 1 02:29:46 2015 UTC,"I don't need to defend modding, that's up to you if you want to learn more about it. The point is you're grouping hackers with modders in the same category and doing so in a way that very clearly implied a disdain for hackers. If you're going to dislike a group, please don't conflate it with different groups."

Rockband,3bmltv,Phil_Bond,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"It affects the customs community in that we can, essentially, just use the Windows file system to manage files. It makes it easier."

Rockband,3bj8hg,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Mon Jun 29 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Didn't even think about that, they'd easily fit in one ps3 bluray."
Rockband,3bj8hg,BigBananaDealer,2,Tue Jun 30 06:27:32 2015 UTC,Definitely. It was hilarious how the 360 had three discs for LA Noire and I think four for Lost Odyssey. Swapping them wasn't that much of a hassle though.

It'll be a really cool dynamic to throw into voxtar showboating.   The band graphics seem to look a bit better than the IGN build, I never saw a high-quality enough video from E3 to gauge. Still only seeing one band, one venue.   I haven't seen those emblems before, seems like cool in-game indicators of those titles we've always gotten at the end of songs.  Also, directly relating to the livestream; I resent the life trajectory that prevented me from working at HMX. God damn it."

Rockband,3bkis7,MLC2,2,Tue Jun 30 01:13:29 2015 UTC,I think they did that on purpose to hide any weirdness with the animations since they are still rough.
Rockband,3bkis7,BathTubNZ,3,Tue Jun 30 13:21:18 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, they look like they could be kind of hard in some songs- the intro solo for The Warrior that they show has a lot of switching between the two sets of frets and short phrases that seemed quite unforgiving for getting your hand set.  Have they said what happens with those using GH guitars that don't have the lower set of frets?  I assume they just miss on anything requiring the high frets and so should stick to charted solos."

Rockband,3bjum0,z0oinks,3,Tue Jun 30 13:33:32 2015 UTC,"No forced release deadlines due to publisher pressure (Part of RB3's problem, it could have used another month of polishing, it didn't get it due to Viacom's pressure because they wanted to sell HMX)."
Rockband,3bjum0,Bront20,2,Tue Jun 30 16:57:28 2015 UTC,My guess is that the numbers for online play in past games were fairly low and they decided it wasn't worth the budget.  I don't think most people who played the previous games actually played online at all.
Rockband,3bjum0,Quazifuji,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"Online Play was hot in RB and RB2. In my opinion, RB3 butchered it in a couple ways and made it a drag to play online.  No VS mode, and the song selection screen was a god damn nightmare of kids spamming Beast and The Harlot in the setlist. There was such a demand for DLC compatibility match making, I don't understand why they would remove online play. Online was a viable source for a multiplayer-centered game."
Rockband,3bjum0,Ledgo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"There was such a demand for DLC compatibility match making, I don't understand why they would remove online play.   I'm assuming you're basing this off of places like this subreddit and scorehero, which are a tiny portion of the people who buy Rock Band.  Harmonix has the numbers, and my guess is the vast majority of people did little to no online play.  Personally, for me it was almost purely a novelty that I barely touched, and I'm much more hardcore about the game than the average buyer."
Rockband,3bjum0,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"That demand was something that was a popular request since Rock Band started building a good size library of DLC in RB1. It was a big topic on the official forums as well, which had way more people, but there's no real reason to discuss online populations.  Whatever Harmonix's reason is their reason. At one point I was fairly heavy into RB, it just sucked I had a healthy amount of songs and it was difficult to find people with compatible songs. That's really my problem that HMX has no real NEED to cater because I didn't have to buy the DLC. It's a feature that would make buying DLC feel like a better investment and make the multiplayer a more enjoyable experience, something which Rock Band has strived to do.  As for multiplayer, it makes or breaks sales for some people. I namely play with my brother, so online play became a must-have when we didn't live in the same house anymore. At this point RB4 is a pass for me, it's a lot of money to invest for a product that is missing key features that I enjoy."

Rockband,3bl3oh,spideyjiri,3,Tue Jun 30 06:35:51 2015 UTC,"BREs are only charted on expert for animation purposes, and not on every instrument (as also seen on blitz).  I think they had to make the drum charts off the animation in Blitz.  The demos had BREs showing up, but they simply didn't have them going away.  BREs likely aren't going away, as they have the potential to turn a 0-2 dot song into a 5-6 dot song on an instrument.  Yeah, they're not that great to play, but I think I'd rather play them than something that's charted off of them."

Rockband,3bew33,Heff228,5,Sun Jun 28 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"This is all total speculation on my part!  Since the Xbox One and 360's online functions are so closely tied together, I can assume they'll transfer over all compatible DLC from the 360 store to the One's store. From there, it'll likely read your purchase history and allow you to redownload the songs (either through the store or through the RB store in-game).  I also wouldn't be surprised if we had to register with the RB website in order to get the transfers. Only time will tell, but all I can say is that I'm happy it will be an option at all."
Rockband,3bew33,evuldave,2,Mon Jun 29 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"No information is available at this time. A save expectation is that it is tied to your purchase history (so, to your account)."

I imagine they'll probably look to see if you have the export key for RB1 and then make those available as a download. You can redownload your exported songs currently by just going to your download list, I would think that would carry over to the new systems, they would just have to be flagged as XBONE or PS4 compatible."
Rockband,3bef5w,georgekera11,2,Sun Jun 28 13:29:08 2015 UTC,According to comments elsewhere on this sub Gamesmen and the Mighty Ape have pre-orders up. This will probably mean more to you than to me.

Rockband,3bef5w,WarConsigliere,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:50:17 2015 UTC,"The Gamesmen is taking pre-orders, but doesn't have prices which indicates that the suppliers haven't told them anything about the game yet.  Mighty Ape is taking preorders only for the guitar set at AUD260=USD200, which is extracting the urine a bit.  Amazon will ship to godzone for USD139 all up.  Think about going that way."
Rockband,3bef5w,harveyglobetrot,2,Tue Jun 30 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"Figured that's how much it would run for here.  I'm still perplexed how single people can order it in for cheaper from overseas than can a company whose sole job is to do stuff like that. I realise they aren't ordering in massive quantities, but you would think some economies of scale would come in to play.  The only thing I'm mindful of is the game in the bundle would be incompatible on an Australian Xbox One, wouldn't it? Or have they changed compatibilities between AUS and U.S. (or PAL and NTSC) games since last gen?  If that is the case, it becomes pretty comparable to buy it here, since you will be looking at a minimum $70 to get the disc by itself."
Rockband,3bef5w,WarConsigliere,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"It's region-free, but the bonus DLC thing is a little weird.  You have to set your region to the US, then redeem the code, then switch back.  I'd bet that the price is speculative and hasn't been confirmed by the distributor yet, though, so JB/EB might be cheaper.  But I'd bet that Amazon will still be cheaper."
Rockband,3bef5w,harveyglobetrot,2,Tue Jun 30 10:15:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting that Xbox discs are now region free. And it's no big issue about the DLC - I have an American Xbox account (from the days when you couldn't buy RB DLC on the Xbox store). I'm not sure if the reason these songs are coming free is because they aren't carrying forward from their original release (as the RB2 free or as RBN DLC) or just as a ""bonus"".  I guess it now comes down to importing and getting a delayed/uncertain arrival in Australia, but a significantly cheaper price, or more expensive and guaranteed purchase on the 6th (presuming The Gamesmen's price is around the Mighty Ape mark - they have a physical location in Sydney).  I was planning on booking a day off the day that RB is released. The 6th is perfect because it's the day after the October long weekend, so it's pretty easy to tack an extra day of leave on that.   Admittedly for me, an instrument bundle is a bit of a luxury purchase when it comes to RB since I still have old instruments in working order. So I might just end up picking up the game and the controller adapter (which I'm sure will be much more expensive here than in the U.S.) on release and wait for a price drop on a bundle."
Rockband,3bef5w,WarConsigliere,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:53:56 2015 UTC,"The bonus songs are by Harmonix and Harmonix-adjacent bands, and they have a history of providing those as pre-order bonuses.  I've got a number of them on my US profile, but I'm not sure whether I picked them up as a bonus with another version of the game or got them on the RBN.  Some of them are great tracks, though."
Rockband,3bef5w,harveyglobetrot,2,Tue Jun 30 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are all (?) pre-existing tracks (as RB1 on disc, RB2 20 free or as RBN tracks). But what I'm intrigued about is if they are releasing them this way because they are only going to be available this way in RB4 or if they'll carry over like other DLC and exports.   My guess (based on past HMX history with exclusives) is that they will be released later for non-Amazon purchasers. But it is something else in favour of pre-ordering with Amazon."
Rockband,3bef5w,WarConsigliere,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:06:17 2015 UTC,"The 30 free songs are for people who pre-order (at least in the US), no matter who they go through - I'd expect that that'll be in our market, but might be an EB exclusive.  There's an extra few songs for ordering through Amazon, but I didn't recognise any of them."
Rockband,3bef5w,harveyglobetrot,2,Wed Jul 1 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, right you are.  I've got no interest in the 4 bonus tracks (besides, I'm sure they will be out soon after release), so I guess that's not a factor."

Pedals are the DW 9002 (same ones Neil Peart uses) and retail for $600, but I found them on eBay new with slightly damaged cardboard packaging for ~$370. The extra crash cymbal and corresponding mounting kit (far right) to replicate the way Rock Band charts are set up (with the crash being to the right of the ride) was ~$300. So altogether, it was about $2300.   It's a lot of money, but I couldn't break it if I tried. Also, I now know for sure that I am to blame for any missed notes since it is extremely accurate. The peace of mind I get from its accuracy and durability makes it all worthwhile if you ask me."

Now I don't have space to leave the kit set up though :(.  Also, I see your pedals, that just doesn't look comfortable.

You can even use like a headset with a microphone on it if it is USB, although I like the feel of using a hand microphone better in RockBand."
Rockband,3b8lk8,ModestMusician,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"Aw come on... You know you like using a headset to feel like a real pop superstar lol. In all seriousness, Turtle Beach headsets and the like work surprisingly well for Rock Band... Or at least they did in the previous iterations of the series. I would actually expect them to work better now with the refinements to the various systems they've made. Overall I would guess just about any USB microphone solution would work aside from the kind that plug into controllers like the PS4 ear bud or the Xbox Live communicators on 360/One. In those cases I would think you would HAVE to go with the microphone that Mad Catz is making although I really have no way of knowing until the game's release. Even if they allowed the use of those mics, the sound quality they pick up is rather bad so I wouldn't rely on one of those anyway. They work okay if all you need is to communicate but to try to sing into one probably wouldn't register nearly as accurately as you would need for Rock Band scoring."
Rockband,3b8lk8,Superb_Dante,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"Any USB mic will work.  Of note, the SingStar mic works surprisingly well, is 2 mics for generally a good deal, may or may not come with a game you can trade in for credit elsewhere, and work in Rock Band.  This only applies to the PS4, but it does work."
Rockband,3b99wp,real-dreamer,8,Sat Jun 27 00:46:27 2015 UTC,They've pretty much moved on from the game and are looking towards the games on newer consoles.  Maybe if they added a Beatles mode as an option in RB4. But that seems like a long shot even.
Rockband,3b99wp,evuldave,6,Sat Jun 27 00:52:33 2015 UTC,That edition has been out for a long time. I wish they'd have finished it.
Rockband,3b99wp,evuldave,3,Sat Jun 27 03:52:00 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that Beatles RB has been out for a while. And, like you, I was holding out hope that they'd incorporate more music as DLC.  I abandoned that hope a couple years ago. The only way I could see them feasibly offering more Beatles would be through RB4, and even then it'd probably be a separate mode to choose from the menu (since the Beatles made requests like no crowd noises and no missed note noises to preserve integrity of the songs).  I keep my hopes up that something like that would happen. But as it is, I wouldn't expect them to pay the premium in order to license more music for TBRB on last generation consoles. They claimed they wanted to do more stuff for Beatles but clearly their sales/DLC sales didn't give them confidence in releasing more, so maybe a new venue besides a dedicated game could be the solution."
Rockband,3b99wp,MLC2,4,Sat Jun 27 05:18:16 2015 UTC,"The only reason why TBRB was made in the first place is because Dhani Harrison (George's son) is a huge GH and RB fan.

I do hope we get some way to export TBRB to RB4, even if I simply have to buy it again.  TBRB with Pro-drums and no other changes would be amazing."
Rockband,3b99wp,Bront20,2,Sat Jun 27 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"I hope you've been playing the TBRB customs export in RB3. They're as close to the originals as I could make them, with added pro drums, and some with keys/pro keys and pro g/b."
Rockband,3b99wp,NemoEsq,2,Sat Jun 27 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"That would involve me having a 360 sadly.  I'm a PS3er.  Honestly, since I don't drum a lot, TBRB works well enough as it's own experience.  The game itself honestly is a work of art."
Rockband,3b95ii,MoonbirdMonster,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"The Guitar Hero guitar dongles were all tied to specific the guitar models.

Rockband,3b95ii,MLC2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"You can only have one controller per dongle, and it has to be the specific guitar the dongle was made for. And yes, they will work with RB4.  RB and GH on PS3 were always a hassle because of the stupid dongles. I felt kinda dumb because its so much harder to get instruments for it these days. I feel less dumb now because I exported every game and bought a crap ton of DLC for PS3 and my main console now is PS4. So it worked out in that regard."
Rockband,3b95ii,MLC2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:25:52 2015 UTC,"Dongles I believe are tied to the specific instrument they were created for, and you need a dongle for each instrument.  So that $5 Goodwill guitar won't work most likely.  I've been pretty anal about my dongles, so I never lost one (in fact, I have an extra one because I had a GHWT guitar die on me and get replaced under warranty, I don't think it works though).  Also, if you have more than a few plugged in (2-3), you should split them up or use a powered USB strip.  I ran into some crashing issues that went away when I moved most of the adapters to a powered USB strip (Though I believe I had 3 mics, 3 guitars, keys, and a drum kit plugged in between the 2 USB ports on my PS3, so that's a bit of a load).  The RB guitar and drum dongles are both big square grey blocks.  The keyboard dongle is a nicer black thing.  The guitar and keys have 2 ports to chain things, the drum kit does not.  The instrument logo appears on the top of each dongle.    All the dongle controllers will work with RB4 if you have the right dongles, so be sure not to lose them."

Rockband,3b4qr2,LetterSwapper,9,Fri Jun 26 00:44:03 2015 UTC,"I use it all the time with the midi out. I have a larger keyboard controller but the RB one is good when I just need a quick melody or when I'm writing. The strip acts as a mod wheel and the buttons change octaves. Then you can assign any other buttons for other stuff. Probably could  do Transport controls with it. So play, pause, record actions."

Most if RB2 was easy, yes, but the last few tiers are some of the most varied and fun tiers since GH2, on both guitar and drums.  Most of RB3's final tier would have probably been a tier or two lower in RB2, and the hardest one (Llama) isn't really any fun to play...just hard."
Rockband,3b0ljg,dwfan24,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:53:39 2015 UTC,"I would be very upset if there weren't a song like that. Every game so far has had a few songs that teach techniques that hadn't been in the game before the inclusion of the song. Run to the Hills had fast disco beats and triple-chugs, Visions introduced the kind of metal that has crazy blast beats and chunky guitar sweeps, and Llama hugely relies on exact timing and stamina for every instrument. All of these songs are considered ""not fun"" or ""annoying,"" but playing them makes you better and provides a challenge for really skilled players.  In terms of an actual selection, I would love another BtBaM song because their drum charts are the best in the game. Since HMX is focusing on songs that are fun on every instrument instead of sucking on one or two, it would have to be a BtBaM song with a lot of clean vocals. Maybe something off their upcoming album?"

Songs like that as DLC is fine to me if people like that kind of thing.

Maybe they were limited by songs with keys or decided to focus on songs with mixes of weak and strong instrument parts. I'm new to this, so maybe it's just me, but it feels like RB1 and 2 had a much better selection of songs that play well as a group. I hope for fun group songs for RB4.

Rockband,3ayyas,TommyWalker1237,2,Thu Jun 25 01:09:29 2015 UTC,"My guess is they're aiming for over 60 (Didn't the Toys'r'us preorder have 65+ listed initially?), and being cautious, because yes, 60+ technically means 70+, but if they said 70+ and fell short by 1, folks would scream.

Rockband,3ayyas,NemoEsq,2,Fri Jun 26 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"I called it!  Here's my quote from 5/20/2015:   I would be surprised if they even managed to have 80 songs. RB1, RB2, and RB3 were released at the height of the music game craze. They knew they were going to be selling millions upon millions of copies of the games. But now the craze is over, it might only be the die-hard fans who buy the game. I'm betting their licensing budget is smaller than it was back then.  Plus, the price of games hasn't increased since 2007. We were paying $60 for a disc back then, in real dollars $60 today is worth a lot less than it was in 2007.  Harmonix has also made it sound as if they're looking for the disc to be more of a DLC hub than a standalone game.  With all of that, I'm guessing the disc will probably have about 60 songs on it. I doubt the number of songs on disc was never due to technical limitations, anyway. Rock Band songs don't really take up that much memory."

Rockband,3az3e9,Kevers86,6,Wed Jun 24 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"I was a little annoyed to see a retailer-specific preorder bonus for RB4.  So often I've seen games have different preorder bonuses at different stores.  A lot of the time, these bonuses are never available for purchase.  So in order to get everything available for a game, you'd have to preorder at 3  different stores and buy 3 copies of the game.  I doubt Harmonix will go that route.  They've never made any songs console-specific, and they've been really pro-consumer for a game developer.  Of course this is speculation, but I wouldn't worry about it too much if I were you."
Rockband,3az3e9,kerminsr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"If it's like a ""timed exclusive"" or whatever, I'd be fine with that. If the songs are available on the RB store for purchase either immediately on release or shortly thereafter, that's ok by me.  If it's Pre-order only, then screw that."
Rockband,3az3e9,Avengerr,7,Wed Jun 24 20:56:46 2015 UTC,So what's your deal with amazon? I have had over ~1000 order with amazon and they have given me little to no trouble.

Rockband,3az3e9,Bront20,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"A) There have been 5 songs that have been semi-exclusive.  3 Schick promo-songs that were RBN songs that were labled RB3 versions to get pro charts.  These songs never made it to the PS3 outside of this promo, so that's the only way to get them on the PS3, and the only way to get the pro upgrade.  And the 2 pack only Ozzy songs, which anyone can get if you buy the pack.   RB3's exclusive songs from Gamestop (Deftones, Talking Heads, and New Order) were DLC week 2 or 3.  I suspect this is what will happen with RB4.  B) Seems unlikely.  However, game club members can save 20% off either bundle at Best Buy, so if you're not locked in to Amazon for some other reason, get a Gamers Club membership and save money.  At the very least, you'll (nearly at least) make back your investment in the club with either instrument preorder."

Rockband,3azpcu,Drihscol,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"RB drums with cymbals don't work on Guitar Hero. It's the way the games are programmed, so I'd say get a GH kit if can find one to get all 5 lanes if you want."
Rockband,3axag7,snowdog_ace,10,Wed Jun 24 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"In the last 5 years where DLC slowed down and came to a complete stop and had no new major releases, a lot of new stuff has come about in the music world. I know there are a lot of classics people want to see but I would absolutely love to see some big releases from the last 5 years to make up for lost time, whether on disc or through DLC early on in RB4's life.  Stuff I would like to see at some point in the future:    Tame Impala  Deerhunter (Desire Lines would put me in heaven)  Band of Skulls (something official from Harmonix) Cheatahs Dead Sara  Dot Hacker Electric Guest Father John Misty  Future of the Left Gary Clark Jr. Jukebox the Ghost (something official from Harmonix) Local Natives The Lonely Wild Lord Huron The New Pornographers (something/anything from Brill Bruisers!) Rubblebucket Sleeper Agent Sons of Hippies The War on Drugs"
Rockband,3axag7,That_Guy_Link,6,Wed Jun 24 07:16:31 2015 UTC,Almost any Tame Impala song would be amazing to play on pretty much any instrument. Drums especially!
Rockband,3axag7,evuldave,3,Wed Jun 24 10:07:34 2015 UTC,Those all look good and nice and actually challenging musically. They have had The New Pornographers before and that stuff is perfect; Deerhunter would be fantastic
Rockband,3axag7,That_Guy_Link,2,Wed Jun 24 09:10:12 2015 UTC,"It was always a shame they never got more of The New Pornographers in RB, especially not more stuff from either Mass Romantic or Twin Cinemas. Now with their Brill Bruisers album I hope we get some stuff from that because that entire album is fantastic."
Rockband,3axag7,OneOnTheRun,2,Wed Jun 24 09:34:02 2015 UTC,"Your taste in music is great! Good picks, especially Jukebox The Ghost."
Rockband,3axag7,sibtiger,2,Wed Jun 24 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"I love Brill Bruisers but if there's any New Pornographers song that needs to be in Rock Band, it's The Bleeding Heart Show. Those drums and vocals would be so good!"
Rockband,3axag7,spideyjiri,2,Wed Jun 24 16:46:08 2015 UTC,There's a Band Of Skulls song in Guitar Hero Warriors Of Rock
Rockband,3axag7,That_Guy_Link,2,Wed Jun 24 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"Do you happen to know which one it is? Out of curiosity that is, because their song ""I Know What I Am"" was released on Rock Band through RBN (and was how I discovered them)."
Rockband,3axag7,spideyjiri,2,Wed Jun 24 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"That song exactly, it has awesome animations, the singer is the male vocalist and the bassist( I think) is the female singer, it's pretty cool."
Rockband,3axag7,Kloporte,2,Wed Jun 24 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"Future of the Left? Man, I thought I was the only one requesting this band! I charted a song from them and I might do more in the future. Great picks!"
Rockband,3axag7,HBOXNW,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:09:27 2015 UTC,I have not heard of any of those. Are they some sort of hipster music?
Rockband,3axag7,That_Guy_Link,8,Wed Jun 24 08:26:32 2015 UTC,"Those are a bunch of bands of varying degrees of popularity across different genres that have been establshing themselves over the last half decade or longer. Within the list though Band of Skulls and Jukebox the Ghost have had tracks through RBN, while The New Pornographers have had tracks on disc (RB1's Electric Version), DLC, and RBN. Here are tracks from each band:   Tame Impala - ""Solitude is Bliss"" (Psychedelic) Deerhunter - ""Desire Lines"" (Indie/Shoegaze) Band of Skulls - ""Himalayan"" (Alternative Rock) Cheatahs - ""Mission Creep"" (Shoegaze) Dead Sara - ""Weatherman"" (Alternative/Rock) Dot Hacker - ""Order/Disorder"" (Alternative) Electric Guest - ""The Head I Hold"" (Indie) Father John Misty - ""Chateau Lobby #4 (In C For Two Virgins)"" (Folk)  Future of the Left - ""notes on achieving orbit"" (Noise Rock/Post Hardcore) Gary Clark Jr. - ""When My Train Pulls In"" (Blues) Jukebox the Ghost - ""Adulthood"" (Pop Rock) Local Natives - ""Sun Hands"" (Indie) The Lonely Wild - ""Buried in the Murder"" (Folk/Alternative) Lord Huron - ""Lonesome Dreams"" (Indie/Folk) The New Pornographers - ""Dancehall Domine"" (Indie Pop) Rubblebucket - ""Came Out of a Lady"" (Alternative) Sleeper Agent - ""Be My Monster"" (Alternative/Indie) Sons of Hippies - ""Man or Moon"" (Psychedelic) The War on Drugs - ""Red Eyes"" (Indie/Americana)"

Rockband,3axag7,kbups53,3,Wed Jun 24 16:37:36 2015 UTC,I would love Adulthood or Ghosts in Empty Houses from Jukebox the Ghost.  All of their current DLC is incredibly fun but some songs from Safe Travels would be aces.
Rockband,3axag7,OneOnTheRun,3,Wed Jun 24 15:07:13 2015 UTC,Yes! That album is top notch!
Rockband,3axag7,OneOnTheRun,2,Wed Jun 24 15:38:26 2015 UTC,JBTG would be great. I would love something off of their new album!

Rockband,3axag7,evuldave,4,Wed Jun 24 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"Dethklok seemed to be GH exclusive throughout the previous generation, but that may change with the newer/pop-centric focus of GH Live. I wouldn't be surprised if Dethklok showed up at this point. Maybe even some other Adult Swim bands could come along with that (Pusswhip Banggang anyone?)"
Rockband,3axag7,evuldave,2,Wed Jun 24 06:46:03 2015 UTC,"I have songs on my rock band by Dethklok but I may have gotten them from rock band customs, but that is how I know they would be perfect! I have murmaider, thunderhorse, and lazer cannon death sentence and they are all really really fun to play even though you need to be a drum machine to FC any of it on drums..  I did not realize Dethklok was GH exclusive, hopefully that ends"
Rockband,3axag7,spideyjiri,2,Wed Jun 24 06:55:42 2015 UTC,"Exclusive probably wasn't the right word, but I only meant to say they appeared solely on the GH games for whatever reason.  I also have those customs! They are fun, but I think the difficulty of the songs may keep them from being on-disc songs for RB4. I could definitely go for some DLC though! ""Bloodlines"" would be a good choice, but since it was on GH6 I'd hope for a new song entirely.  ""The Gears"" could be a lot of fun with harmonies turned on, and provide a decent challenge across all difficulties."
Rockband,3axag7,LastnameWurst,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:03:33 2015 UTC,"How about Go Into The Water? Everyone can agree that song is good and it should also be the most popular from the show, last episode of season 1, pretty iconic and actually quite mellow and passable"

In Cauda Venenum was already used in Saint's Row the Third, so TDH is obviously down to license their music for games.  And, actually, if all of In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 could just be available as DLC, that would be great."

Rockband,3axag7,SteamySecrets,5,Wed Jun 24 17:06:15 2015 UTC,They need a stronger indie rock showing IMO. Biggest one for me is Two Door Cinema Club - Who the fuck wouldn't want any song by them on.
Rockband,3axag7,SteamySecrets,5,Wed Jun 24 17:08:19 2015 UTC,Radiohead - Paranoid Android
Rockband,3axag7,Clamgravy,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:30 2015 UTC,Radiohead has gotten very little love. No big fan is going to be too happy with either Creep or My Iron Lung. I always thought In Rainbows would make a great full-album addition.

Keep it in place with your toes and don't completely lift your foot up.  Maybe when you hit the pedal you're hitting it at a leftward angle, so it's slipping towards your left leg? Try experimenting with different ways of using the pedal, because it's always been really solid for me."
Rockband,3avig3,Advanst,2,Tue Jun 23 21:43:47 2015 UTC,If you're on carpet you can get a piece of Velcro with the sticky back and just slap a few pieces on the bottom of the pedal-that's what I do.
Rockband,3avig3,ImaFrakkinNinja,2,Tue Jun 23 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"For real bass pedals you can tie a rope from the heel of the bass pedal to the leg of your drum throne, but you might not find a place to attach a rope to the RB pedals.  Maybe tie it to the RB kit's crossbar?  Velcro might also help too."
Rockband,3avig3,IBitePrettyHard,2,Wed Jun 24 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested in this as well, since I have a GHWT drumkit and two pedals that slide all over the place, even on my carpet. The rubber bottom just isn't rough enough."
Rockband,3avig3,mrbellek,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:47:13 2015 UTC,"I don't do it much because I keep breaking my spare pedals, but I usually put the left pedal not even on the crossbar. Just on the floor under the red pedal. It doesn't actually stop it from moving (if you don't have carpet, it moves even more, especially forwards), but it might be easier to stop it from moving once it's liberated from the kit."

Rockband,3anuv7,espher,5,Mon Jun 22 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"To say ""anything wired"" is a misrepresentation of the facts.   All of the old mics will work, and all of the old mics were wired.   The distinction is no wired instruments will work.  The old wired instruments everyone's concerned about are:   all RB1 guitars and drums the ion drum set pro drums with the MIDI-pro adapter older Guitar Hero guitars like the X-Plorer.    The old mics are just standard USB microphones. While they're releasing a new mic, it will fundamentally work the same as the old ones. You'll even be able to plug the new RB4 mics into your Xbox 360 or PS3 to play any of the old RockBand games."

Rockband,3alug6,RobinLv,3,Sun Jun 21 14:17:16 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but! I believe Harmonix said that they're gonna slowly make all the DLC available after launch. A bunch of songs will be immediately available, with the rest coming later. I wish I could find the source to confirm that, but I remember hearing that somewhere.  Of course, I'd love a tool like this, though. I have 1100 myself and I always wondered how much of a pain it was gonna be to redownload it all."
Rockband,3alug6,valeforXD,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:35:15 2015 UTC,Hopefully they will release an announcment regarding what legacy DLC will be released first.  If it is coming out in waves they should let us know way in advance what will be there day one and then what will come later.  I have about 200 or so songs that I would add to my list but am holding off purchasing until I know for sure what will be available.
Rockband,3alug6,MACST3R,3,Sun Jun 21 19:15:29 2015 UTC,Supposedly the game may help you with it.  I've heard that hinted at at least once.
Rockband,3alug6,Bront20,3,Sun Jun 21 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all the interviews I've seen have all but explicitly said the game will find and download your purchased songs for you, hopefully in a process that can be repeated as they keep making these dumps of old songs."

Rockband,3alug6,Spikor,2,Sun Jun 21 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"Depending on how many songs you bought on your 360, it might just make financial sense to grab an Xbox One just for RB4.   We have around 900 DLC songs, and at an average of $2/song, if I didn't have an Xbox One now, I would surely get one to not have to shell out for all that DLC again!"
Rockband,3alug6,sengoku,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:16:14 2015 UTC,Sad but true!  I found I was collecting songs like Steam sale games for a while--bought more than I regularly played--but I doubt I'm up there high enough that it'd be worth it to get an Xbone.  Probably right on the border though.  I don't think 250   songs would be that unreasonable an estimate.

Rockband,3aljf4,wwwes32,2,Mon Jun 22 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"According to Harmonix, the number of people playing online was crazy low, they said not even enough to form a significant minority of players. Combine that with the really high cost and time to develop for an online system and it mostly makes sense we don't get it yet. It's sad, but they aren't big enough to foot that kind of expense and expose themselves to that risk.   Remember that the last Rock Band game was actually not that profitable, if it wasn't an outright loss. That's why they got dumped by EA. They're trying to be smarter about what they spend money on so they can keep development going and not go bankrupt."
Rockband,3aljf4,burns148,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:36:26 2015 UTC,Yeah it makes sense. Just kinda upsetting. I'm trying to decide what to do sense I've gone from 360 to PS4 and then I get this thrown at me haha

I mean, it's not important, I'm just curious as to why they did that."

So keep checking back.  I'm in a similarly stuffed position.  I want a new guitar - great, there's a SKU for that - but I also want a new microphone, but I'm not going to buy a drumkit because if it doesn't work with my ION set then the publishers can go fuck themselves.  So I'll buy the game and play some guitar by myself, but I'm not going to do anything silly like buy DLC until I know that I can call the group around and have a barbecue and rock band party which will need my drums and a new microphone.  And if that doesn't happen by the Christmas break, the game's probably going to go into a corner and not get pulled out again.  Now I imported RB 1 and 2 and a drum kit to play this, and I've spent hundreds on DLC, but if they launch broken I think I'm out."

I need a new guitar because the old ones' contact with the neck was never secure and my Logitech works fine, but I need a second.  Easy.  Done.  I need a new microphone because the old Lips ones work OK but not great, particularly on the lower end, and I'm a bass-baritone.  But I don't want to replace my IONs with cheap plasticky pieces of pooh, and they're holding out hope that I won't need to.  So I won't.  But I won't invite people around until I have a drum set.

Rockband,3afsgs,thewinnerisgeeg,2,Fri Jun 19 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"That depends on how the console recognizes it. Since the device is meant to convert joysticks, then it might technically work, but it might end up reading drum controls as a gamepad when used in rb4.

Rockband,3ah80t,calliope_clamors,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:57:04 2015 UTC,i agree. I feel like they need at least another 5-6 months of development.

As long as the primary living room multiplayer works on release, I for one will be very happy to see them add features throughout this generation as they are ready. I suspect there are new features we will see this generation that we can't even imagine now, and I think allowing them the ability to do this is great."

Rockband,3agmg6,Bront20,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:12:03 2015 UTC,"RB4 drums are a safer bet to work, though I suspect on the PS4 things will work without issue with the MPA.  That said, if its disc only or full kit, thats a $190 price difference if you dont need a new mic or guitar.  Probably comes down to this.  Will you be using them for anything other than RB.  If not, just get the RB kit."
Rockband,3agmg6,Bront20,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'll probably only use them for Rock band, and that's why I wouldn't get something super expensive   I just don't want to end up in another hole where my drums are failing and dropping notes left and right and I can't buy a new one"

EKits may not work (though I suspect they will, at least on the PS4), and honestly, cheap ones still run around $400 or so for a full playable kit in RB.

My drums are broken and I have trouble finding them, there are so many new songs that I want to play that I thought could never be included, and I know my 360 is going to stop working one day.  Edit: Also, if we don't buy this Rock Band game, we DEFINITELY will never see any more Rock Band again. This is a pretty expensive Kickstarter-type experience it sounds like, but I have spent so much time and money on Rock Band that I would hate for it to fail."

Rockband,3ad5ug,Rizaria,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:03:19 2015 UTC,"The rumored budget for RB4 is ten million dollars. No way in hell they'd raise that much on Kickstarter. Without Madcatz and other publishers backing the bill, the game wouldn't be happening at all.  Kickstarters like Bloodstained and Shenmue really downplay just how expensive AAA game development is; both have massive amounts of off-the-books funding from other publishers. The fan portion, despite being multimillion dollar, wouldn't be enough alone."
Rockband,3ad5ug,Very_Toxic_Person,3,Fri Jun 19 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post. From my interpretation, they have insufficient funds and time to bring what everyone wants. I sort of see the launch of Rock Band 4 as an early access and hopefully they may generate enough profit to bring in the features people are asking for.  May I ask, is it possible Harmonix can setup a Kickstarter page for people to donate to have the most wanted features incorporated?"
Rockband,3ad5ug,Rizaria,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"It's sort of early access -- the core game is there, it's not really ""unfinished"" at all. They could walk away and call it a job well done. But they have announced they intend to let sales of the game and DLC fund more additions to the game itself, to make it a living platform.  A kickstarter is possible, but I'm suspecting they'd rather rely on traditional funding. That means what we can do to support them is buy the game and instruments, and support DLC efforts. If they can get metrics showing that the game is selling, it will help justify ongoing development.  ...which leads to a paradox of ""I won't buy until X is included"" and ""We can't put X in unless people buy the game."""
Rockband,3ad5ug,themonkeyaintnodope,3,Fri Jun 19 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"That was actually a really good article. Good read.   I'm still sore about the lack of online play. Hopefully I can make some friends who'd like to play sometimes.   And it's a shame about the basic coloured instruments and lack of standalone ones at launch. But I can wait. My logitech guitar still works. And I have mics. Just glad to hear there will be a digital version of the game. That'll save me import money. So now it just depends on the set list. If it's worth it, I'll get this game on release after all.   Thanks for putting this up."

Rockband,3ad5ug,Yourbasement,3,Fri Jun 19 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"It's not trivial to make a last gen controller work with a current gen console, particularly the crazy midi brain system that powers the Ions. But they know people want this, and there are some hardcore dedicated drummers who want it, so I'm guessing it'll be a post-launch feature."
Rockband,3ad5ug,espher,-1,Fri Jun 19 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't complicated at all for wired instruments as far as HW problems. SW would require a new driver but at the worst it's finding someone to work on it as efficiently as possible. The next problem is MS or Sony allowing this to happen since any driver designed and any adapter supported would allow legacy controllers to work on the new systems.  The ION brain in particular isn't all that nuts, MIDI is a well defined standard and nothing in the ION was proprietary other than the chipsets/drivers licensed by MS/Sony."
Rockband,3ad5ug,Kerrby,3,Fri Jun 19 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"Even wired instruments have a constant authentication cycle with the console.

That'd require new releases of keys and pro guitars, neither of which sold very well in the first place and would thus be massive loss leaders in RB4. They're an indie studio without EA's backing this time and something had to give.  That said there are RB3 features I'm hoping will be there by launch day or patched in later, like online play, and 1-lighter filtering."
Rockband,3ad5ug,espher,-7,Fri Jun 19 12:55:27 2015 UTC,They're not going to patch anything in. They've never patched a major feature in before. I remember all this shit back when BWT didn't have online in RB1.
Rockband,3ad5ug,TheGreatDave,2,Fri Jun 19 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"They've gone on record saying the plan is that instead of a RB5, they're going to expand RB4 with new content, new features, and new patches. It's a different world than it was in RB1; the idea of a ""living platform"" for a game is much more possible as it's expected for all consoles to be networked 24/7 now.

Rockband,3af3cm,IBitePrettyHard,3,Thu Jul 16 23:00:23 2015 UTC,Make some support struts for the red and green pads. Buy some drum silencers for rock band drums to protect the pads. The only pedal I have seen that is available now is the roadie pedal. I wish the rock pedal was still available. You can also grab some drum sticks training tips or silencers.
Rockband,3af3cm,Very_Toxic_Person,2,Fri Jun 19 17:46:24 2015 UTC,Oh yeah!  I totally forgot about the support struts thing.  I did that back in the RB1 days by simply taping a drumstick from the leg to the underside of the pad.  Although I wouldn't recommend using silencers because they deaden the sensitivity.  The pads are already lacking in sensitivity as it is.

Rockband,3af3cm,IBitePrettyHard,2,Fri Jun 19 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"Don't even need extra legs, just some pvc between the existing legs at a 90° angle going to the underside of the side pads"
Rockband,3af3cm,ZANY_ALL_CAPS_NAME,3,Fri Jun 19 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"Both of the problems you mentioned are fixable. They happened to me too. For the wire issue, you could have stripped the ends of the wires and spliced them back together. For the pad falling off you could have glued the plastic back together and then screwed a metal plate onto the area where it broke for support."
Rockband,3af3cm,dwfan24,2,Sat Jun 20 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"Oh snap! I hadn't thought of a metal plate! I tried using an epoxy to hold the plastic, but when that failed I gave up. (The drum set is still in my closet somewhere)  As for the wire issue, my dad is something of an electrician, and he said the wire was broken too close to the connector to be spliced. He didn't have enough to work with."
Rockband,3af3cm,BReeves,2,Sun Jun 21 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know your exact technique but it sounds like you hit pretty hard if the red pad fell off.  That's your first tip, lol.  Also make sure you're hitting the pads at around a 10-12º angle...any steeper and the bead of the stick can dent the heads.  Get some 4"" Remo Falam Slam patches to keep the pads from cracking and bubbling.  They're just stickers made of kevlar and they work great."
Rockband,3af3cm,Edit0r88,2,Fri Jun 19 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I need to retrain myself. I get so into playing the drums, that it becomes a cardio workout almost."

RB4 looks like a great game, but it's frustrating to learn that people like me who want online play, ION support, score duels, and practice mode version are in such a tiny, insignificant minority that it's not even worth catering to us anymore. Never mind wanting a PC version! Edit: Also RBN and button-activation for overdrive.  This isn't a dig against Harmonix or Rock Band 4 - They have every right to develop the game they want, not the one I want. It's just hard to come to grips with the fact that after all these years Rock Band is finally coming back and I'll probably never play it."

One of the first Rock Band 4 articles (on IGN i think) stated that Rock Band 4 is a platform rather than one game. I'm assuming that once RB4 gets out the door, Harmonix will then have time and possibly the resources to look at all the stuff we want in the minority and then implement it in game.   Not having it day 1 is a bummer, but I'm holding my head out to see if Harmonix can implement what we want in game later."
Rockband,3adt0o,Yourbasement,9,Fri Jun 19 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"What bothers me is that it's 4 months to release and we're still getting nothing but ""maybe"" and ""it's not done yet"" and ""it's too early to say"". Four months, guys. The game's launch features should be locked down by now.  Even if Online and Practice Mode and all of these other things are actually coming after launch, not having them on day one is going to upset a lot of people who are now less likely to buy the game at all. When it finally does get online play, will it be too little too late?  If they said ""Online play is definitely coming, and it's Xth on our priority list"" we would know and people could buy confidently. But as of right now they haven't committed to any of it. We might get it, we might not.   Personally, online is the only way for me to play with friends. There's no way I'm dishing out that kind of money for a new console, game, and set of instruments (because my IONs may never get support!) only to find out that I'm stuck playing alone forever."
Rockband,3adt0o,vsTerminus,3,Fri Jun 19 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"This is where I am. I don't live near anyone I play Rock Band with anymore, and no confirmation of post-launch online is keeping me from preordering and very likely purchasing at this point."

I understand HMX is developing a game for more than the hardcores, and that as an independent developer, their resources are limited. I get that.  But throw us a freaking bone here! If these features aren't going to be day one, I understand! We all do! But pretty soon I will need to know if I should put my $60/$125/$250 into RB4 or something else.

That's the most angry I've ever been at a video game."
Rockband,3adt0o,koenn,2,Mon Jun 22 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"I bought a 360 so I could keep up with the stream of DLC and RBN songs around February 2013. I was so excited to see what was gonna be on offer in the future.  Of course, April 2nd came. Y'know, when they released American Pie, their very last DLC song. The day the music died. And while RBN continued for a little while longer, it just sort of abruptly ended, right in the middle of releasing Richard Campbell's Frankenstein.  So, that was the most frustrating experience; watching DLC slowly come to a stop."
Rockband,3adt0o,valeforXD,2,Fri Jun 19 10:30:25 2015 UTC,"Some friends came over to play RB3, when my Xbox Live profile somehow got corrupted during login.  As I couldn't log into XBL, none of my DLC would work, but it'd still show up as present in the song list - it just wouldn't let any of it be played.  So you'd choose a setlist only to be told that every song in it couldn't be found.  Of course, this was after the MS tech support line closed, so I wasn't able to spend over an hour sorting it out until the following Monday."

Rockband,3acv2x,Unldentified,3,Fri Jun 19 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"Did they mean RB3? I'm super confused. RB2 is already on my drive, licensed, like DLC... why wouldn't it be able to be redownloaded onto the new systems?"
Rockband,3acv2x,ApplicableSongLyric,3,Fri Jun 19 04:06:23 2015 UTC,Not everyone (including me) was able to import the rock band 2 disk songs since we waited too long. So I asked if they'll ever release those songs as normal DLC and this was the response. It's entirely possible they thought I meant RB3. I asked because rather than go out and buy RB3 (25$) and the 10$ fee to transfer the songs I could just download the ones I want as DLC if they release them
Rockband,3acv2x,ApplicableSongLyric,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:56:27 2015 UTC,Eff that anyway. Saturday I'll give you a spare Rock Band 3 code off a manual so that if it is the former you don't have to worry about plunking down for a used copy.

Rockband,3acv2x,TweetPoster,3,Fri Jun 19 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"The RB2 export is officially expired (though some are able to get keys from EA support), it may be the case that Harmonix is attempting to resecure the licenses that would allow them to offer legacy exports to new people, to build up their RB4 libraries. That's all speculation on my part though, of course."
Rockband,3ae5ut,TheZooBoy,2,Fri Jun 19 11:39:15 2015 UTC,"Rock Band 3 doesn't export and won't export at launch of RB4. The codes on the game manual doesn't have any use at this time (and even if they do export later, I feel like they'd probly go on something besides code as later 360 printings had no code).  With Lego Rock Band, some people have had some luck getting codes, but it's hit or miss at best. Basically with both both Lego and Green Day they no longer have the legal rights to sell the export content, so officially, no you can't do these exports. You might get lucky, but I wouldn't count on it.   For Green Day, though, you can buy all the songs as DLC, individually or by album. More expensive than the export, but it's at least still available."
Rockband,3ae5ut,sudobyte,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"At least according to the Rock Band Music Store app, I can't buy the Green Day songs individually. A glitch, or are they truly unavailable?"

They'll be ported over to the new system with no additional work.  If you haven't exported, do so now if you can.  The licenses are expiring or have already expired, so they may not work.  RB3 we can't export yet, and not sure if/when/how that will happen."
Rockband,3ae5ut,Bront20,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"My bad mate, guess I wasn't clear enough in my post. I don't have these songs yet, I was just saying that if I did, I would just play them in Blitz since I don't have any instruments ATM.  Problem is, around the time Lego Rock Band came out, my instruments broke, and because of that, I never bought any subsequent releases. Now that Rock Band 4 comes with new instruments, I am buying that, with the hope that I can play all the songs I missed out on in one title (Rock Band 4) by buying the games I missed."
Rockband,3ae5ut,Bront20,2,Sun Jun 21 09:40:00 2015 UTC,"360 or PS3?  If you haven't exported Lego already, you're likely SOL, but you can try using the code in the book if you have a 360.  If you have a 360, buy RB3 digitally, and see if you can use the code in the game to export.  If you have a PS3, hit up EA's RB3 support, and they may give you the code for the RB2 export.  Green day's export has expired, but it's all DLC, so you didn't miss anything, just the deal, but you can cherry pick.  Blitz exports automatically, and is fun.  Get it.  Hope that helps."

Rockband,3a90xg,mokacoffay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:51:01 2015 UTC,That's just too long. They really need to rethink this decision.
Rockband,3a90xg,kissofarose,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:11:40 2015 UTC,"Solo improv appeals to hard core folks who sing. Authored drum fills may have some appeal.  That said, the core experience is a very casual one by nature, and things like a good campaign mode can help create hardcore fans.  Once the have a user base for the new platform, they can start to ad hard core add ons.   Protar?  Could easily be patched in later (figuratively easy, likely still costs money).  A midi pro adapter? Can be rolled out later (ps4 may not even need a new one).  Online?  Definitely coming later, possibly with duels.  A modular core game offers so many options, and the core experience needs to be done right first for it to catch on enough to be viable."
Rockband,3a90xg,Bront20,2,Fri Jun 19 18:45:29 2015 UTC,Pro-tar definitely not happening.  The scope of work that would take is unimaginable compared to something simple like adding score duels.
Rockband,3a90xg,mokacoffay,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:52:41 2015 UTC,"To enable Pro-tar?  Simply need to let it read known hardware (true, an obstacle on the 360), enable the game to read Pro-tar charts, and allow Pro-tar as a choice, then simply allow the Pro-tar charts they already have be put on the new system.  Everything else, the scoring, the play mode, etc, is already written, they just need to put in a pro-tar module for the charts effectively.  Score duel requires an entirely new mode to be programmed.  Sure, the charts are there, but allowing for local play means treating the song differently, while online play is part of the whole online play package.  Honestly, one way around score duel would be a Score War similar to Blitz.  Let you challenge someone else to a score war for a particular song, and you both have 2-3 days to post your best score.  It's not quite live, but it could be fun."
Rockband,3a90xg,Bront20,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"RB4 doesn't have ANY of the pro-tar assets inside the game though, none of the gems (which would have to be done from scratch to match the aesthetic anyway), icons, bends, chords or chord numbering, only existing charts would be supported (so zero at launch), no art assets for pro guitar on neither the lane nor side failure bar.  No existing score listing for pro-tar in the current gui (e.g. for medium,hard,expert) or leaderboard listing.  Not to mention the entire dedicated tutorial system for pro guitar would need to be ported over as well.    Score duels:  global:   Pick a song and enable 2 of the same instrument (mirror initial spawn of an instrument lane) Gui element for scores above each player lane Indication of winning player during the match animation of defeated/winning player End results screen showing the winner   online:   Server that handles lobbies and matchmaking based on difficulty/rank gui for lobby  refer to global (ranked only):  store values based on win/loss for future reference."

Rockband,3a8rhe,Jmcglosson,3,Thu Jun 18 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there will be a standalone game available (especially considering every Xbox One game is available digitally...), it just isn't yet. Which isn't worth worrying about because discs and especially digital copies won't run out.  The only reason to preorder NOW is if you want hardware.  That being said, the people who want a second guitar are (currently) getting shafted with the available hardware bundles, but I'm sure MadCatz will make them available standalone in the next four months."
Rockband,3a8rhe,elcapitaine,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:40:13 2015 UTC,Basically it seems like RB4's hardware releases are getting the same treatment they did back when RB1 released. Bundles released first with the stand alone instruments sold soon in the future.

Without remixes, King Kunta and i could work pretty well.  From other rappers, I could see Black Skinhead by Kanye West working out well.  Honestly, rap just isn't a good genre for Rock Band because it's not about the instruments.  Harmonix could maybe put out a couple DLC's worth of songs for the entire genre since most songs don't work very well."

Blitz is a thing where it's kind of like... yeah that's a bunch of songs for a good price, but a lot of it is seriously garbage in RB. Especially with keys being gone in rb4 it loses its biggest selling point, which is that it has a bunch of solid keys stuff.    If there's a few songs in it you've been thinking about getting, though, then yeah go for it while it's cheap."
Rockband,3a7cd3,ApplicableSongLyric,3,Wed Jun 17 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"Many folks liked the set list well enough.  Some pretty classic songs in there including 2 returning RB2 songs.  Just 1 lighter the ones you don't like.  At $6 or $4.50, its a steal for 25 songs, and the game is fun too."
Rockband,3a7cd3,LumpyArryhead,0,Thu Jun 18 07:23:05 2015 UTC,Some? Just one. Moves Like Jagger is absolute garbage.    And inside of Rock Band 3 you can remove individual songs from the library without having to delete the whole downloaded package.    Though why anyone would actually do that is beyond me.
Rockband,3a7cd3,ApplicableSongLyric,2,Thu Jun 18 08:22:53 2015 UTC,"So Far Away is a terrible terrible song, and boring as hell. Several of the songs have barely 3 digit note charts for guitar and bass. Others I won't go into cuz some are popular but just trash imo lol.    As to why I'd want to delete them individually, it's so people can't pick them online lol. And rb3 won't let you delete singles that you get as part of a pack, if you try to delete one it says ""you will be deleting pack: xxx, proceed?"""
Rockband,3a6wnh,ilovewiffleball,8,Wed Jun 17 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, it looks every bit as fun as I'd hoped when done by someone who knows how to use a Rock Band guitar. I'm officially hyped about this. Looking forward to rewriting solos."
Rockband,3a6wnh,wwwes32,8,Wed Jun 17 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Best part: It seems like the solos are very customizable from what I heard. Different button combinations, strum patterns and chords lead to different sounds, and they sound pretty good in most songs. There were only a couple of songs where the increased presence and the ""dirtiness"" of the tone really interrupted the flow of the song, but most were vastly improved with the feature."
Rockband,3a6wnh,SkippyDeluxe,4,Wed Jun 17 18:49:03 2015 UTC,Do you know if there are different guitar tones for different songs/genres (like there are different drum samples for fills)?
Rockband,3a6wnh,BathTubNZ,3,Wed Jun 17 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"It sounded like the same tone to me. It's a great tone that works with a lot of songs, but I wish it was more customizable based on the song or at least genre. The tone sounds like a muff distortion + blues overdrive + clean boost through a single coil guitar for the guitarists out there."

Rockband,3a7vwg,LeEbicMemeMan,10,Wed Jun 17 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"From a previous thread:  I'm trying to focus on bands that lack keyboards, at least as a primary instrument.  Where is My Mind? - Pixies. We have all of Doolittle, it may seem a bit boring but it would be a good lower-tier song.  Maybe another Stone Roses song, like She Bangs the Drums or I am the Resurrection. We only got one from them, so they have more coming.  Chelsea Dagger - The Fratellis. This one has been long overdue after the Fratellis pack. I am shocked we didn't get more based off of how fun that pack was, especially this song.  Mr. Jones or Big Yellow Taxi by Counting Crows. We got Accidentally in Love so we should probably see more of these guys.  Something by Weezer - my guesses are Surf Wax America or The World Has Turned and Left Me Here  Maybe we could see another Radiohead song? I won't get my hopes up for that, though we only have two so far, and Just or Paranoid Android would be great for the game.  Last Nite by the Strokes; we got Reptilia and Under the Cover of Darkness, there is hope for another Strokes song.   Similarly, something by Modest Mouse (probably Dashboard).  Something by Blink-182 as well; Carousel?  We only got two Kelly Clarkson songs, and there are a few decent pop-rock jams she has that would lend themselves well to Rock Band (much better than Stronger and Miss Independent at least).  I'm also hoping for Mastodon; it seems like a realistic possibility.  My Chemical Romance - This Is How I Disappear  Arctic Monkeys - literally anything off their new album.  Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun or Add It Up  Also I'm hoping for more Simon and Garfunkel - last time they came around we didn't even harmonies for them, which is a real crime.  The Clash - Safe European Home (or something else from Give 'Em Enough Rope)  As far as new, unseen artists go, I think some realistic options include The Vaccines, St. Vincent, and Mac DeMarco.  My thoughts since then:  We've seen a lot of newer music and artists, even Benjamin Booker. Thus, I think we may see some of the following artists  Blur, Damon Albarn, or Gorillaz: Damon Albarn and Blur's new albums would have great songs for this game, and we know he's fine with his songs on the game.  Tame Impala, most likely Elephant due to popularity (sick fills on drums too).  Cage the Elephant: I'm shocked they haven't been on a game yet to be honest.  The Black Keys, Gold on the Ceiling because Guitar Hero got it.  Similar vein, Ed Sheeran.  Japandroids.  If we were to get hip hop, it would be Kendrick Lamar - i. Almost unquestionably."

It isn't necessarily popular and it is older, but it just seems to fit the vibe for RB. Its a great party song and would be easy as a tier 1 difficulty.  As far as party-game lyrics, you will have a hard time beating gems like:   Baby, Would you eat that there snack cracker In your special outfit for me, please?  Yo ye pharoahs, let us walk - Through this barren desert, in search of truth - And some pointy boots, and maybe a few snack crackers.

Rockband,3a60xl,jordanlolss,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Regardless of who it's made by, it's still relevant because it's going to be Rockband's main competitor.. New people to the music game genre who just want to play guitar will make the comparison.. $150 for two guitar hero guitars + game or $130 for one rock band guitar + game.  Don't get me wrong, I love Rockband and i've already preordered the band in a box set.. I'm just pointing it out"
Rockband,3a60xl,FattyMcPatty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I think returning fans are more a driving force this gen.   I like ghlive's new mechanics, but there are also quite a few people who dislike it so much that they'd rather wait till they can get rock band, and hmx has enough fan loyalty that those left out of the first wave of hardware releases will buy as soon as production is able to start again."

Rockband,3a60xl,NemoEsq,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"I would have paid more to include a second guitar or at least one guitar + one adapter for legacy guitars. We need to be able to play all players on day one! Come on Harmonix, make it happen."

Rockband,3a60xl,NemoEsq,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"That's absurd. For Xbox 360 I find guitars locally in Goodwill for $5 and lots of guitars, drums, bundles on Craigslist for reasonable prices. Just today found a TBRB kit, new but out of box, for $50. I already have too many instruments so I passed but great deal."

There's no official statement from Harmonix about whether or not it's needed, and if it is when it'll be out, or for how much. Things are very unclear right now.  Hopefully we'll start getting answers over the next few days."

Rockband,3a4yno,Sampwnz,8,Wed Jun 17 07:05:49 2015 UTC,"How does it look like scoring works? Do you want to match a certain rate of notes, or can you just wail and get max points? Much delay?"
Rockband,3a4yno,PCR245,3,Wed Jun 17 09:47:27 2015 UTC,"You have to follow what the freestyle section is telling you. So during the tapping, you should tap and not hold out a chord. During the lines, you should strum matching those lines.   You have freedom during those sections, but if you follow what the screen is telling you, you will score the highest. I have a video of someone playing a pantera song and he didn't follow the screen directions. At the end of his solo it said ""messy solo."" HOWEVER, his solo still sounded pretty cool in my opinion. So you really do have that freedom."
Rockband,3a4yno,SkippyDeluxe,6,Wed Jun 17 15:55:05 2015 UTC,Here's that Pantera song. Skip to 2:12 in the video for the solo. http://youtu.be/dFaX2GNx0YY

Rockband,3a4yno,VivaLaMcCrae,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I could tell, there was a circle below the track that was filling up, similar to how the vocals getting scored. People who were wailing on all the buttons didn't seem to score very well, but those who followed the instructions on the placard filled it up and received the ""Awesome Solo"" message."

Rockband,3a4yno,Joshante,5,Wed Jun 17 16:15:40 2015 UTC,They said you will be able to turn it off and play matching the original solo if you choose.
Rockband,3a4yno,Joshante,2,Wed Jun 17 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"Thank god, when they showed it on Keighleys show with My God is the Sun it didnt work at all."
Rockband,3a4yno,the_infiniti,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"From the few gameplay samples released so far, it seems like everyone's first instinct is to wail randomly on the buttons as fast as possible, which really doesn't fit into some songs very well. I'm hoping that the system is learnable enough for experienced players to be able to craft something unique, yet realistic."
Rockband,3a4yno,Rickles360,2,Wed Jun 17 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"It is. I consider myself an experienced guitar player in Rock Band. I memorized the chart so that I knew what to do before I went up there to play. When the solo came up I started nailing exactly what it wanted me to do. One of the camera men even came up and started taking pictures of me soloing (or video, I'm not sure). My solo came out really well and one of the developers came up to me right after my solo and said ""that was a really good solo."" If I didn't understand what each of the sections was telling me, it wouldn't have turned out that well. I'll scour the Internet for a video of when I went up there and see if anything comes up."
Rockband,3a4yno,Smrt225,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"Was the sound coming out of a TV's speakers, or a separate sound system? If the latter, was there any delay?   We're the two songs you played part of the disc's set list or DLC?   Was it... FUN?!"
Rockband,3a4yno,spideyjiri,3,Wed Jun 17 10:14:37 2015 UTC,"There were three stations where you could play: two stations for guitar where you play and listen through some headphones and the main stage. On the main stage they had the sound coming out of the venues sound system, so it sounded awesome. The main stage had some delay. I got 90% on Even Flow. I know I could have done better.   It was loads of fun. They even gave everyone two free drink tickets at the bar. It just took forever to play. The line was long. I was there for 3 hours and only got to play twice. Worth it though. This game is going to be so much fun."
Rockband,3a4yno,Awsaim,2,Wed Jun 17 16:15:42 2015 UTC,There was a fourth screen that was invite only that had better lighting for filming that they brought people who rocked out hard on the main stage. They took a lot of pictures while I was up there so I'm hoping I might show up on some promo material in the future.
Rockband,3a4yno,Awsaim,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:28:43 2015 UTC,Is there an option for individual breakneck speed in band play?
Rockband,3a4yno,Awsaim,6,Wed Jun 17 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"When I was on stage I tried navigating through the menus and one of the developers told me ""stop pushing buttons.""  Funny story, the game has a new feature that displays at the end of a song. Each band member votes on what happens next, so for example ""play a song from 1988"" or ""play a song with a female vocalist"" etc. Me and my friend got up on stage at the end of a setlist and it gave us two options: ""play an encore"" or ""don't play an encore."" I wanted to look around so I told my friend to choose don't play an encore. We choose that and it sends us back to the song library and a developer says over the in-house sound system ""who chooses not to play an encore!?"" and my friend yells back ""GUNS N' ROSES!"""

Rockband,3a5epu,Rizaria,3,Wed Jun 17 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"So far as I can tell, no matter the store or country, the only two options currently are the band pack and guitar pack. No instruments separate, no game separate.   Hopefully that will change in the future though. But it makes me wonder if they can manage it in time for release. Might be one of those things that will have to wait until they make enough off the sales.   In the meantime, maybe purchase an old controller? Just in case.  I know I'll still be using my Logitech guitar. :p"
Rockband,3a5epu,StefanGagne,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"There's no word yet on when the legacy instrument adapter will be available, though. Until that happens it's unclear which controllers will work.  (This for Xbox; for PS4 you just use the PS3 dongle adapter.)"

If you've already done your exports (songs are playable in RB3) you're good to go.  Be aware the Xbox might need a legacy instrument dongle -- it's a bit unclear right now -- and we have no idea when it'll be available or how much it'll cost.

Rockband,3a1yvk,Airiq49,0,Wed Jun 17 03:13:38 2015 UTC,HMX is going indie.  They don't have a publisher like EA bankrolling the game and the market for these games is much smaller now.  Non essential features have to get cut somewhere.
Rockband,3a1yvk,Rickles360,2,Wed Jun 17 22:43:32 2015 UTC,"""Non essential""  Wat."
Rockband,3a1yvk,Airiq49,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:43:54 2015 UTC,Sorry I guess we play the game differently.  I never played online after trying it out in RB2.  The DLC was always an issue with randoms.  For most of my playing I competed for scores in single player.  If I went over to a friend's house we enjoyed band play but we'd never enjoy it the same way online.  The only thing I appreciated it for was the time I made a friend through Scorehero and competed in a Guitar + Bass tournament and we could compete together as strangers online.  I'll miss out on that as an opportunity but really I never touched the online after RB2.
Rockband,3a1yvk,Rickles360,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:15:57 2015 UTC,"I see.  Absolutely... I only played this game online. I live in Texas, my brother in Florida. We synchronized our DLC purchases and did Quick Play together with our hundreds and hundreds of songs. I did a bit of solo jamming, but for the most part that was how I spent my time in Rock Band.  With this option removed, and no clear support for E-Kits, I'm sad to say that this ""next gen"" version is looking unlikely to be purchased. A shame."
Rockband,3a1yvk,Airiq49,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:39 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that.  I'm quite confident that if the game becomes popular enough again HMX will patch online support back in.  The question is when.  I'm pretty sure they are firing on all cylinders to get everything else done so I would bet it will take a little bit if they ever get to add it.

I am sure these will be answered over time.    I know you guys are trying to get all the DLC to transfer over but I have yet to see an official word to which of the DLC will be playable day one and excluded.  I recently sold all my gear except my stage kit and created a spreadsheet of songs from the official dlc I would buy if they are supported.  So far that number is 242.  I am sure there are others like me wondering the same thing.  The other thing that decides on whether to keep my preorder or not is how they are going to do future DLC.  I dont care if its weekly, every other week, or a month at a time.  So far out of the 34 announced songs, I can see 1 of them to be added to my rock band parties (I play with people in there 40s and 50s.) I hope they go for older songs, not just main stream.  I also  understand that you guys dont have a big company backing you like EA or MTV Games anymore.  If that effects who you can get as an artist, please allow customs in the game.  Thats what I think has kept the community alive as well as people like me coming back Rock Band 3.  RB3 has been my most played game of all time.  I hope RB4 will take that spot."

I'm sure there were some changes in rules/guidelines but it never got to Neversoft levels of wtf for me.  I'm sure some people will point to specific examples of a change in how a given pattern was charted, but the only things I really ever noticed were the odd highly visible mistake (like the Sum 41 lyric mapping thing or the odd song having a lyric 'duplicated' visually)."
Rockband,3a5nwu,espher,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Mistakes and irritating chartings were scattered throughout the whole DLC catalog, and sure there were some ""trends"" like the hypercharted solos in Iron Maiden pack 1. Those bad examples jump out because they're bad, and because it's hard to quantify what makes a perfectly-charted song. But if you weigh all the songs HMX ever charted against each other, the vast majority were spectacular."
Rockband,3a5nwu,wearing2raincoats,4,Wed Jun 17 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"they didn't get objectively worse, it's just a matter of opinion. RB2 era charts were generally more fun to play, whereas RB3 era charts were generally more accurate to sound, not considering how fun they were to play."
Rockband,3a5nwu,thewinnerisgeeg,2,Wed Jun 17 14:10:09 2015 UTC,"I never noticed a trend no. HMX's charting is the same as it's ever been IMO, in a state of unpredictable flux. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, depending entirely on who did the charting.   It definitely got more accurate post rb1 but that's the only major change I saw sans new features like lanes.  So long as they fix the detection window on the lanes (and dial them back a bit) in rb4 I'll little to no charting complaints aside from some obvious standouts."

Rockband,3a5nwu,sageamagoo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"The only parts of the charts that I personally believe actively got worse were the parts auxiliary to what you're playing. Past the excellent first half of 2011, the venue effects, camera cuts and singer assignments became highly dissonant to the action in the song because a lot of them either felt like or were autogenerated.   To see harmonies be backed up by more singers than just the lead character was a rare sight in 2012, which was a damn shame, but I would wager it was the only part of the charts that grew consistently dimmer. It is a shame to see this hasn't changed with RB4 or the last RB3 DLC yet, though."
Rockband,3a5nwu,Lowlander_2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Nah. I think they reached their peak at RB2 and just sorta flatlined from there.

Rockband,3a5nwu,valeforXD,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:48:13 2015 UTC,I've seen good and bad over the years.  Most recently I noted that the beast and the harlots rock band chart is immaculate.

I remember back in the RB2 days, I bought a drum kit with the protection plan, and every few months I'd take it back to Best Buy because the red pad would bubble up, and they'd replace the drum kit, and I'd buy a new protection plan which was way cheaper than getting a new drum kit outright. Every few months, repeat, repeat.  Toward the end of RB2's life, the drums were still $89.99 but Best Buy was selling the RB2 band bundle for $99.99, so they let me upgrade for $10 and get the replacement drums, but also walk out with a guitar, mic, and copy of the game. Didn't need the mic or game, but $10 for a guitar was a good price."

Rockband,3a1dvw,RollofDuctTape,18,Tue Jun 16 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"When I played RB2 online using the head-to-head modes, I thought I was in a majority. There were always fresh players to battle against and it kept the game exciting for me.  Turns out, I was in a massive minority. There were very few percentages of the whole that were playing online against each other.   That's probably the same case for the online multiplayer this time around. I love playing online but there were complications and struggles with it. I'm hoping Hamronix will work on it and release it ""complete"" rather than just having a stand-in working solution from the start."
Rockband,3a1dvw,ridethepiggy,8,Tue Jun 16 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"I loved Score Duel modes in RB1/2/Beatles and was really disappointed that it was removed from RB3. Also, I felt that the online band multiplayer mode in RB3 was poorly implemented. It took only 2 sessions where my friend and I got matched with a stranger (not on a headset, naturally) who made a ""playlist"" of the entire RB3 base game setlist for us to give up on playing with randoms forever."
Rockband,3a1dvw,deadlystingnyc,4,Tue Jun 16 14:29:26 2015 UTC,This is my point. I think if they're using data from poorly implemented multiplayer modes that's an awful sample to gauge interest from.
Rockband,3a1dvw,deadlystingnyc,2,Tue Jun 16 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I think in order to get an accurate read on how many people would use a well-implemented Rock Band online multiplayer mode, they should look at the numbers from RB1/2 and Beatles instead of RB3."
Rockband,3a1dvw,Klynn7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"Out of the 15 or so people I know that are pretty excited to get the new Rock Band, only one of them ever used online play in the older ones."
Rockband,3a1dvw,espher,12,Thu Jun 18 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"I like to think we’re in the majority here – a once united group of friends separated by space and often time, unable to play the game we love because of that. How many folks can realistically host a party of 3 or 4 folks nightly to make proper use of the hundreds of dollars you’re expecting us to pay? I think you grossly overestimate just how useful Rockband is to folks “locally” and grossly underestimate the benefits of multiplayer here.   If this was the 'majority' demographic and it was worth it for them to do it I'm certain they'd do it out of the gate.  The fact that they aren't speaks volumes to how they perceive the market and, frankly, they have more data to work with than we do. I'm sure they have info on the total percentage of people that bought the game that played online, and the percentage of 'diehards' that bought lots of content that played online, and the percentage of people that were XBL connected and played online through the twilight of RB3's lifespan. They also have poll data which I'm sure helped prioritize their focus -- and if online play was up there priority-wise we'd see it in the release product.  I mean, if all we want to do is point throw anecdotes around, I've spent a small fortune in money and time on this game, and my online play basically amounts to two weeks of casual play during RB1 with my free Gold month. That amounts to seven years of RB play with almost no online play. I'm sure I'm not the only one, just like I'm sure you're not the only one who plays online more than off."
Rockband,3a1dvw,espher,-6,Tue Jun 16 14:16:01 2015 UTC,What data are they using? How many years has it been since RB has had a dedicated multiplayer mode and how much has multiplayer evolved since then?  How many games are released without multiplayer in this generation?
Rockband,3a1dvw,espher,2,Tue Jun 16 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"What data are they using? How many years has it been since RB has had a dedicated multiplayer mode and how much has multiplayer evolved since then?   I would expect data that they've gathered over seven years of play which would allow them to view trends in total and remaining active population -- like showing the play habits of the enthusiasts that have been around for seven years and are likely to continue to buy the game -- as well as poll/market data gathered over the past year when rumours of RB3 started to surface (which would be useful for gauging tastes/preferences/interests of returning players, among other things).   How many games are released without multiplayer in this generation?   I'd wager very few (lots have local but no online). I'd be curious to find out how many rhythm games were released, and how many with online multiplayer, in this generation. Multiplayer for the sake of ticking a box is dumb and developers are still prone to doing it.  Edit: I should point out that, though this isn't a case where I'd say we're better without it than with, not every game needs to have some stupid, shoehorned, always-online social/multiplayer integration bullshit."
Rockband,3a1dvw,espher,0,Tue Jun 16 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"My question still stands. And I suppose, you're affirming it. Is the data they're using founded on a primitive multiplayer game mode from 2 titles ago? If so, isn't that an unfair data-point?"
Rockband,3a1dvw,ohsnapitsjf,6,Tue Jun 16 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm completely misunderstanding what you're saying, why would they not be using play data from functionally identical play modes across all previously released Rock Band titles to identify whether or not people are playing Rock Band titles online?"
Rockband,3a1dvw,Airiq49,-7,Tue Jun 16 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"Because this data is from a poorly implemented game mode that players universally agree were barely functioning. Obviously a poorly done game mode isn't going to be played.   Compare the RB3 Career Mode to RB2 Career Mode, for example. One done well was played far more than one done poorly."
Rockband,3a1dvw,Rizaria,4,Tue Jun 16 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"... which is why they would be wise to be looking at data sets across all of their titles and using it in their determinations regarding demand, preferred/desired feature sets, and cost/benefit? Looking at RB3 in a vacuum isn't great, just like looking at RB1 in a vacuum for other facets wouldn't be great.  I'm not sure what you're arguing for or against here, honestly, unless it's ""WELL RB3 MULTIPLAYER SUCKED SO THEY SHOULD IGNORE IT COMPLETELY"". If the case is being made for playing with friends I think that data is still worth looking at from RB3."
Rockband,3a1dvw,nordee,7,Tue Jun 16 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"I agree and understand your general point, but this:   I like to think we’re in the majority here – a once united group of friends separated by space and often time, unable to play the game we love because of that.   ...Comes off as very naïve. That's a very specific subset to consider a ""majority"". There's people who only bought to solo guitar as a GH1/2 sequel, there's people who only bought it to sing at parties, there's kids who have never bought it. There's a huge variety of demographics for this game that your use case is not going to be the prevailing one. Among forum posters, possibly, but not total numbers.  Anyway. It's not really going to affect me, but it's a surprising feature to omit. I don't think it's going to cripple them on its own like you do, but the more concessions that get revealed (or not revealed for as long as they're taking to solidify wired back-compatibility), the harder it's going to be for some of the previously locked-in buyers (like yourself) to justify re-investing."

Rockband,3a1dvw,StefanGagne,16,Tue Jun 16 14:12:05 2015 UTC,"Hi awesome thread, thanks for starting it.   All I'm going to say is that we're making our decision based on data, the best data we have, and the best data we can get. Is it good enough and does it represent our demographic? That's a question every developer asks every time they release a game. We hope so. Certainly we have some very smart, experienced people thinking about it.  And I just can't help but respond to this specific comment with some data. The percentage of players who played MP. Not a majority. Not a significant minority. You know that joke about how the universe is so big that on average the population is 0?  Yeah. That."
Rockband,3a1dvw,FyreWulff,4,Tue Jun 16 20:31:11 2015 UTC,"Spare me; the reason MP in RB3 was so underutilized is because it's basically unplayable compared to RB2.  No turn based selections, so some guy can spam the entire setlist (Biggest gripe from everyone in the community)  No guitar/bass switching between songs  Disconnections of any kind mid song leads to failure  No mute option for people leaving their mics on 24/7  The leader just kinda has to guess when the other members are ready to start the setlist  Lag from overdrive activation is CRAZY.  Keys players feel like crap because they make the setlist for the rest of the band in the single digits  Lanes get cut basically in half if a vocalist is present.  You aren't solving problems by cutting out the entire mode and calling it fixed is all I'm saying."
Rockband,3a1dvw,russianbear28,3,Wed Jun 17 04:51:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's because online play didn't have some very useful UI information in order to promote online play more.   Hop on most FPS games these days and they'll have the literal number of people playing each game type. Tons of data for the user. ""There are 9,283 people playing team arena? Cool, time to hop on a random server.""  In RB, it was always extremely minimal. Press the queue button, and suddenly a guitarist pops in. (For the sake of this, let's assume you aren't using a headset which a lot of people don't actually use) How do I communicate to them that I want to play guitar/bass, or the ability to switch off? How do I tell my band how many songs I want to play, or to keep playing? How do I know who has the DLC to each song? Simple UI fixes would've drastically helped online play. I constantly queued, and was constantly disappointed by people not having DLC, getting booted when they thought I was the culprit (but wasn't, so I changed my name to 650 DLC), or people just up and quitting after a couple songs, or during a song.  You guys have literally fixed the majority of these problems with the in-game song queueing, so I was pumped that this would be the final answer to this game's online play problems, only to hear that there isn't online play!"
Rockband,3a1dvw,mattd121794,5,Tue Jun 16 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. You guys are awesome and easy to support. I hope I can join in on the love eventually. But I question the data only because a big part of the reason folks simply did not play RB3 multiplayer was because of its lack of functionality. It simply did not work. I'm sure your data demonstrates that RB2 players played a ton more multiplayer. RB3 multiplayer was plagued with latency issues, issues just starting up a game, and lacked the wonderful futures (Score Duel) that RB2 multiplayer had.   When you tack on the growth of multiplayer gaming, the target audience, and the potential for the franchise...well I just don't think the data is all that reliable anymore.   Your slogan is - ""Start a band. Rock the world."" It's tough to get behind that notion when, in reality, there's is no rocking of the world here without multiplayer. There's a lot of potential for multiplayer this generation and I do not think the data from Rockband 3 (or even 2) accurately demonstrates the demand.  Might I suggest another survey? I'm sure a survey asking folks whether or not online play impacts their decision to buy the game at all may open some eyes.   I personally could not play multiplayer in 3 because the experience was terrible. But in 2? That wasn't bad at all. And I was banking on improved online play and it would have been my primary game mode.  I feel like this game wasn't just made for the small group of diehards. It sure makes us happy but in order for it to be great you have to expand beyond that little group. So instead of targeting that small base who would play anything titled Rockband...I'd go for implementing a solid multiplayer feature and trying to get folks who maybe weren't able to enjoy the greatness of Rockband before (lack of friends or friends with interest in this genre) with a ""Start a Band. And Rock the World - FOR REAL"" campaign.   Edit: Might I add that you'd sell a lot more games/hardware too? I feel like we all have (or are) the friend who has RB and all the instruments and folks come on over and play. But if you can play online with your friends, there's definitely appeal there. And multiplayer opens up that avenue for you folks to sell individual instruments and sell a ton more game discs."
Rockband,3a1dvw,Rizaria,6,Tue Jun 16 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"You also have to realize that by the time RB3 came around, the amount of DLC was close or into the thousands. It's easy to say ""just connect me with people with a lot of DLC"", but if you had 200 songs and I had 200 different songs, we might as well be rookies to each other. And I'm assuming 200 is an excessively high number for the majority of players.  I'm not justifying this decision, just saying that RB3's online matchmaking not being what RB2's was may have had a lot to do with that."
Rockband,3a1dvw,wwwes32,2,Tue Jun 16 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"I can second that I played the heck out of RB2 online, but little to no RB3 online due to the free-for-all playlist functionality. Round-robin style in RB2 let everybody have a fair shake; one person could flood the playlist with junk in RB3 you'd be stuck playing for an hour or more.  That said... I'm okay with them pushing back multiplayer to an after-launch feature. As long as I eventually get to play with my friends and go on tour, I'm good."
Rockband,3a1dvw,Rizaria,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:38:05 2015 UTC,I'm not sure the situation was much better in RB2. They've often said the reason Score Duel was removed from RB3 was because <2% of the RB1 and 2 online userbase ever used it.

Not a significant minority. You know that joke about how the universe is so big that on average the population is 0? Yeah. That.   http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/

Rockband,3a1dvw,Jmcglosson,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"The only reason I never used online play was I got into the series so late, no one played Rock Band any more. Guitar Hero however, I played online heaps and it was great. Because lord knows I have no friends into this sorta game and I'm not exactly great at going out and making more just for this purpose. :P  You have your data, and that's great, but I wouldn't take it as gospel. Unless you wanna come over to my house and jam with me, I'm gonna need some way of playing the game with others! Some day. sniffle"
Rockband,3a1dvw,Ketomatic,0,Tue Jun 16 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I think you've convinced me finally, I'm giving up on any sort of insistence for online play. If it was that much of an outlier, you couldn't possibly be expected to put out your neck and support it. I just hope that you put your heads together and try to think of this as a need to make that mode workable rather than just give up on it.  All I can really say to this is that previous implementation of matching made it hard. Unless you found buddies with dlc libraries, it was really rough and disappointing. If the number of people playing online was small, that has to be a reason why. One suggestion I saw was to have genre based lobbies, that might be enough if you could just use the raw number of downloaded/imported songs as a matching aid.  Make that better and you will have a robust and healthy online base. That and making the single player campaign into an endless career mode."

Rockband,3a1dvw,Ketomatic,3,Tue Jun 16 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting it to be added later as a patch.  Harmonix has said they intend to only release RB4 this generation.  They've said they plan on taking advantage of console's ability to add new features to the game via updates.    It sounds like GuitarHero Live forced Harmonix to release RB4 earlier than they originally intended.  If they didn't have to worry about making the release in time for the holiday in order to stay competitive with Activision, they'd be more likely to release what we consider a ""complete"" game.  It makes sense for them to worry only about the core gameplay and add the online multiplayer later.    Sadly, the majority of people buying games aren't as savvy as us.  To them, the first time they hear about the new RockBand game is when they see it in the store.  The vast majority of consumers aren't reading game previews and keeping up with what features may or may not be included in the game.    I'm still waiting for support for ions and the MPA for drums, but I'm preordering because I'll still want to play as soon as it comes out, even though I won't be getting my optimal experience.   HMX is pretty much the only developer I still trust, and I believe my purchase will make it more likely for them to eventually add the features I want.  But look at it this way:  HMX will hopefully make a ton of money by releasing in time for Xmas.  They'll then be able to use that money to add the features we want...hopefully."

If it leaks on some big gaming publication and casual folks are turned off by a game in 2015 that doesn't have online play...it may hurt the franchise.  The fact is, gaming companies cannot survive catering to a small subset of people. This game will not succeed on the backs of us diehards. It needs a wider scope of people. And not launching with multiplayer will hurt this game. May not hurt it in the eyes of diehards, but it will in the eyes of casual folks who are a necessity in keeping this title afloat."

Without those this game goes from being a pre-order / day 1 purchase / shouting from the rooftops, to not even considering it.  ESPECIALLY playing online with my brother from across the US. Without this, I will not purchase, and will urge everyone I know to do the same.""  This basically sums up my current feelings.

Rockband,3a1dvw,athzar,8,Wed Jun 17 04:30:56 2015 UTC,"They'll put it back when when they have the money+time and the demand for it is enough to push the feature to the top of the list. I would assume their stats for online play were not high enough to make it a top-tier need, so it got benched for now. Personally I'd expect online play by a year out, give or take. Maybe for the next E3! Depends how well the launch goes, I suppose.     I've only ever played RB totally alone though so I'm super not the target audience for online play..."

Because 1) you assume you know more about the product than the company creating it 2) you assume you know more about what will make a company money than the company that stands to make or lose money on the transaction and 3) you think you can make a difference with a rant in a shitty little corner of the internet (no offense to Reddit, it's hyperbole).  I happen to be part of a growing forum of players who mostly play offline. I've definitely spent more time and money in this game than you have. Why? Reasons that you'll never know. But my online play ceased entirely in 2011. So this lack of online play doesn't affect me at all.  I also help host a weekly bar event that has been running since 2008. Weekly. Without fail. With 0 online play. But with a lot of expenses towards the game.   So that's two examples of doing things differently from you. Everyone always thinks they're the majority, because obviously, who would play this game differently than you? The answer is, a lot of people.  Was I surprised that online didn't make it? Honestly, yes. But do I think I have any standing to tell Harmonix what is and what isn't a good business decision for them? My doctorate is not in business and I'm not a market analyst, and I get a feeling, neither are you. So I'll trust Harmonix is doing what is best for Harmonix.  And I pre-ordered the box kit, and will buy another guitar, multiple microphones and the cymbal kit, plus continue to buy every piece of DLC. Online or not."
Rockband,3a1dvw,mokacoffay,6,Tue Jun 16 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"You're welcome to  your own opinion on the game. It being in step with the developers' opinion doesn't make it a ""more valid"" (nor less valid) opinion than any other. Sometimes the people in charge make the wrong decision.     He may or may not be correct about being the majority, but the point is quite valid: the widest market for any video game, but especially one that requires the level of suspension of disbelief as plastic music, is young people. This game's roots are roughly 8-10 years ago when it comes to being ""big time.""    Middle school through college and into early bachelor/bachelorette life was a HUGE part of the giant boom in this genre 8-10 years ago. Many of those very same people are out on their own, spread out from the people they used to hang out with and play these games... but in tons of cases still playing games, be it CoD or Halo or WoW or Diablo or Rock Band 3, or whatever else, online with those old friends.    Was the late 20's-early 30's person that's too busy to get people together to play all the time the majority of the market back then? No.    I would say the majority of the people that were buying it then are in that demographic group now, though.    What that means to me is that a large chunk of the group of people likely to be most excited for this, i.e. ones with great memories from it before, is suddenly turned off by the loss of a feature that has been an absolute no-brainer to be there throughout most of the genre's successful life."
Rockband,3a1dvw,NemoEsq,6,Tue Jun 16 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"You are the overwhelming minority, though. That's not sustainable at all for Harmonix if they want this to blow up. The reason multiplayer was such a pain was because of the legions of people who had 0 DLC, making queueing not worth it if you wanted some variety. I am definitely worried that Harmonix just looked at statistics that said only 5% of players play online or something like that and decided they didn't have to budget a netcode programmer.   You have a venue you can host these things at, where strangers will go (AFK Bar in Renton?). That has other benefits such as bringing in paying customers that a regular person doesn't have. They're just stuck with the game and themselves. I get that their focus is on the real life band experience, but that's not feasible with most adults.   I DO have the standing to say this is a mistake by Harmonix because I'm using common sense. By not including multiplayer, they've already lost me until it's going to get put in or else the investment isn't worth it. This is coming from someone who attended the trailer filming, has played since GH1, hundreds of DLC, etc. I don't even own an Xbone and was going to order one just for this game and now I'm doubting it, on top of the game which I was more than ready for. If anything, I'm one of the more hardcore Rockband fanatics and even I don't want to drop my credit card just yet. Why won't I just play the game on X360? It's not like this is a graphically driven game.  Hopefully they patch this in."
Rockband,3a1dvw,mokacoffay,0,Tue Jun 16 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that people with lots of DLC that play at home with local friends is such a minority...as I said, I know a lot of people that do based on the forums we're a part of. In any case, I still say that unless you're a market analyst or you have some sort of insight into their budget, research data and internal decisions, you and I and anyone else has no reason to doubt they're making a decision that to THEM is the best (safest, whatever you want to call it) decision to make now.  By the way, the events I attend are at Ye Olde Falcon Pub in Davie, Florida."
Rockband,3a1dvw,NemoEsq,4,Tue Jun 16 21:16:06 2015 UTC,"The problem is HMX is they're penny pinching the wrong thing. They're not looking at the obvious picture.  -With a focus on getting a real band together, why would 3 of the members bother buying the game and all of the DLC? They could just meet up at Ralph's house instead. 3 less customers per band right there. Since they can't play together online when real life issues happen (adulthood), this makes the problem even more glaring.  You are the perfect example of this. If everyone had a cool local bar to go to that had every single song + customs, why would I even bother investing in the product instead of just going to your perfect environment? Online play is literally the solution to this.   -I don't own an Xbox One because it had a garbage launch. This was going to be the game to get me there. Now, why should I buy BOTH? That's $700 saved to just continue playing RB3. Sure, I miss out on a few new gimmicks and a single player campaign, but that's not exactly the point of a party game, either. I'm still going to eventually play the same tracks.  -Online multiplayer is a staple of gaming and it's 2015. The series has also set a precedent of having it. I know they used to have big backers, but let's be honest, you can contract out like 3 brogrammers to get this feature in. 1 if he's a boss. Plus, they already have the foundation of 3 title's worth of code to work from."
Rockband,3a1dvw,mokacoffay,-2,Tue Jun 16 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"You and those who want to paint Harmonix as a group of retarded people instead of a successful company who's been in business for twenty years don't like listening to others' opinions, that much is clear. You're saying they're penny pinching and not looking at the obvious picture. I'm saying maybe you don't have the information they do (you don't), so you should stop second guessing their business decision. You can be as unhappy as you want. But you don't know better than Harmonix how to run Harmonix."
Rockband,3a1dvw,NemoEsq,5,Tue Jun 16 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"That seems to be your only excuse. ""They are a company so they know how to run themselves."" Sometimes, companies get out of touch. You do know Atari used to be the king of videogames at one point right?  My other points are apparently valid enough for you to ignore them. It's obviously penny pinching. A dev even said it was cut due to budgeting reasons! I'm refuting that argument by showing that the cost of a few programmers is less than the amount of people who are going to buy the game if the feature is included. Just look at the forums right now. People are upset about this and rightly so. I'd much rather have 'freestyle random button mashing guitar solos' cut out than online play, I'll tell you that much.  edit: If I didn't care so much about this franchise I wouldn't be wasting my time writing about it*"

That's like saying you only play guitar so it doesn't even matter if the game doesn't have bass.  No excuse. zero.  Harmonix doesn't even take you into consideration for these things because you don't even show up in any of their data from being offline.  Holy hell am I mad.

Rockband,3a1dvw,mostdeadlygeist,3,Wed Jun 17 04:42:44 2015 UTC,"So, people gave harmonix their $60 for the base game already, big deal, BUT, if people aren't online or seeing friends playing the game, they are far less likely to continue playing and buying dlc.    This goes so far that Blizzard's Battle.net client won't even let you appear offline since their data concluded that a significant amount of people who don't see friends playing online are much less likely to continue playing the game."
Rockband,3a1dvw,valeforXD,-2,Wed Jun 17 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"OK bud. You have all the answers. I know that who matters is who supports Harmonix, and those finding reasons not to buy RB4 are sure not helping. A lot of things have been pushed back pending a successful and profitable launch...by not buying now you're only contributing to the demise of those potential additions to the game. I'm OK with my preorder. Good luck with your situation."
Rockband,3a1dvw,Jmcglosson,3,Wed Jun 17 05:05:46 2015 UTC,It's not like I'm digging real deep at the moment to find things that make this game unsavory to me.  I was willing to settle with a few of my favorite features being excluded again but this was the final straw; nothing personal toward Harmonix.  There is zero incentive for me to pay for a game that has less features than the last iteration.  Just because I enjoy their games does not make me obligated to fund things that don't appeal to me.

Rockband,3a1dvw,TommyWalker1237,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you here as well. But, judging from what they've told us, their decision was influenced by statistics and polls. So if their decision was made using statistics and polls that might not accurately reflect what their customers want in a game, I think that's worthy of discussion.  What's been pointed out over at the Harmonix Boards is that there were two surveys (which I answered) that asked fans what they wanted in the game. The first directly asked fans about what features they wanted in the game. Online play was there. The follow-up vaguely asked you what kind of RB player you currently are (Band Member, Score Chaser, etc...). If they made their decision based on how we currently use RB and how we currently ignore the online game mode that doesn't accurately reflect how folks will use an improved mode in the future.  That's all I'm saying.   I expected, like 99% of the titles released, a multiplayer game mode. Even single player RPGs have them. I didn't think it was unreasonable to expect it. To not have it be a priority threw me off. Heck, it threw you off.   I agree that Harmonix has far more information than I do but the information they've touted might not accurately reflect what they think it does. The multiplayer in previous RB's was bad. Folks played it DESPITE how bad it was. Folks tried it and it wasn't WORTH it anymore. An improved game mode would certainly draw more players.  I hope they release another survey or listen to the poll on their own forums.  But you're absolutely right on. I just question the data set and will sit tight and wait for more news before I pre-order again. If all I'm getting is a next-gen RB with no online play, I can keep RB3 and just play that. What's the difference? A few cool features that my friends won't really know/care about?"
Rockband,3a1dvw,TommyWalker1237,2,Tue Jun 16 16:30:52 2015 UTC,I also think it's kind of ironic since I will not get SW:BF3 because they are focusing on multiplayer and have omitted the campaigns.
Rockband,3a1dvw,dwfan24,2,Tue Jun 16 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"Y'know, at the very least, I'd like it if Harmonix would launch a Find-a-Bandmate thing for their site and highly publicised it. Put in your area, some contact details, what you play and it finds like minded people nearby. It'd be a neat way to make friends, let alone band mates.   Hardly as simple as finding someone's PSN on here though, or playing it with my good buddies in other states in countries. But I wish there was SOME option for those of us who don't or can't throw these ""Rock Band Parties"" I keep seeing shilled in the comments here.   Depending on the set list, I'll get it eventually to play by myself. But without others to play with, it won't be pre-ordered or bought on release. Which is a shame. I reckon Harmonix are pretty great, and doing what they can as a team that's now basically indie. Still. Time will tell I suppose. Plenty of months between now and then."
Rockband,3a1dvw,russianbear28,5,Tue Jun 16 17:10:10 2015 UTC,I have played and owned all the RB games since 1. I have spent lots of time in solo and band play with people actually in the room. The amount of time spent in online multiplayer is probably a few hours total over all 3 versions. Just don't care.
Rockband,3a1dvw,yodaman1129,3,Wed Jun 17 12:15:54 2015 UTC,"As a three-time Platinum Artist, and owner of 800+ songs, I can count the number of times I played online using one hand.  Rock Band (and Guitar Hero before it) has been one of the go-to party games for my group of friends & I for many years. Local play is by far the more popular method of play amongst us, mainly due to the camaraderie and sense of togetherness.  When the four of us (five or six if we have harmonies) gel together and kick a difficult song's ass, it's a great feeling; one that is not easily replicated over Live or PSN."
Rockband,3a1dvw,BathTubNZ,3,Tue Jun 16 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"It's a huge mistake for me and I think many like me and here's why:  I own an Xbox 360. I don't own an Xbox One. I would have upgraded to Xbox One just for this game. What am I missing out on if I just stick to the RB3? A few new songs, different graphics (which doesn't quite matter in this genre), single player campaign, and a couple new gimmicks.  Instead, I could save the $400+ for the Xbone, $300+ for RB4 plus the instrument dongles, and have online play and the same music/friends to play with. Harmonix thinks it's too expensive to contract out some programmers but doesn't realize how much money that investment should actually bring back to them. Based on what I'm hearing a lot of similarities with other users and I, that's going to turn into hundreds of thousands of dollars gone because they are making an error in judgment to not include a feature that's been a staple of the franchise since day one.   If they want this game to be all about playing with your real bandmates, then I guess they aren't thinking about the obvious problem with that--That's 3+ people that now don't have to buy the game, DLC, or instruments because now they can go to the hosts house instead since they can't play online.

Even in this thread there seems to be as many people who are extremely passionate about online play as there are people who found online play a pain and only used it a couple times.

Rockband,3a1dvw,BrainWav,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:56:54 2015 UTC,I would be eager to hear what you guys have to say given the little information we have.   Calm down and wait for more information.
Rockband,3a1dvw,HardLeg,-1,Wed Jun 17 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Obviously I will. I cancelled my pre-order, though, so the incentive isn't exactly on me to ""wait for more information."" If they want people to actually pre-order they need to actually provide the information. No?"
Rockband,3a1dvw,sageamagoo,6,Tue Jun 16 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"Obviously I will.   Considering you pre-ordered - then canceled said pre-order - You come off as more impulsive than calm. Harmonix has been very transparent in the past and we are less than 24 hours out of them announcing the release date and opening pre-orders. E3 is still happening and perhaps they are busy with that. You said it yourself, we have little information. Calm down and wait for more."
Rockband,3a1dvw,Haktuar,0,Tue Jun 16 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"The situation is fluid for both the buyer and the seller. To expect me to commit to buying a product despite the fact that a very key feature (to me) is not going to be available at launch is a dealbreaker. So I cancelled. It's not ""impulsive,"" it's a consumer not buying what you're selling.  So the seller needs to explain why it's not available and when it will be available. That simple. If the explanation is satisfactory, I'll pre-order again. If not, I won't buy.   We owe Harmonix nothing."

Rockband,3a1dvw,thewinnerisgeeg,-2,Tue Jun 16 14:06:31 2015 UTC,Which is what I am doing. What's the problem? I'm doing exactly what you're telling me to do yet I'm being criticized for it.
Rockband,3a1dvw,HardLeg,0,Tue Jun 16 14:17:27 2015 UTC,You asked for input from others. I cannot control how you react to my statements anymore than you can control mine. Don't make a big deal about it.
Rockband,3a1dvw,thewinnerisgeeg,3,Tue Jun 16 14:18:22 2015 UTC,"I don't get you. How did you pre-order without knowing what was and wasn't included? The pre-order pages listed the information, and it all went live yesterday. So you're saying seconds after it went live, you pre-ordered, without reading what was (and what wasn't) on the page, before Harmonix made their announcement that you knew was coming in minutes after pre-orders went live, then you rage quit and canceled said pre-order, and somehow that is not impulsive?"
Rockband,3a1dvw,HardLeg,-3,Tue Jun 16 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"I pre-ordered immediately, assuming online play was in. I was given no reason to believe it wouldn't be in given the other games had it (albeit poor versions).   As soon as I read the link stating no online play I canceled my pre-order.   Every game that comes out these days has multiplayer, it's not like I was assuming the game was going to be an MMORPG or something. It wasn't an unreasonable assumption to make. Games, even Rockband, have multiplayer (I guess not this one).   It's not impulsive because once I found out the feature I wanted was not in the game I cancelled. It's an informed decision."

Rockband,3a3gi0,wwwes32,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:54:29 2015 UTC,Fun so far? How do the guitar solos look? Has anyone successfully sung in harmonics yet?
Rockband,3a3gi0,wwwes32,6,Wed Jun 17 02:16:35 2015 UTC,"I took a video of both a full song and a guitar solo for you guys and I'll upload it late tonight/tomorrow and share it with you guys.  The hardcore players are going to be very, very unhappy with the guitar solos. They've completely ""nerfed"" the talent out of soloing. Instead of trying to track and hit every note, it's now more generic button mashing.  Orange or blue lines pop up that reference the beat. You button mash on the low frets and strum to the beat or 2x/4x the beat when the notes are orange, and do the same on the high notes when it's blue. A thick line indicates when you should hold a note and not strum, and a wavy line means hold the guitar up to mimic feedback. Everyone will have this mastered in a matter of hours. It's very casual friendly and actually really satisfying and fun, but it's going to isolate the hardcore players who kept Rockband alive, I'm afraid.  EDIT: just talked to some guys at Harmonix. The solos aren't gone and I'm an idiot. I'm just not seeing it because everything is set to party mode here. No fear, shredders, the competitive rockband you know and love will still exist. With leaderboards, too!"
Rockband,3a3gi0,Ketomatic,3,Wed Jun 17 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"Well, they are optional! And don't count towards top spots on the leaderboard, our own nordee confirmed that. So I look forward to just messing around with them."

Rockband,3a3gi0,Trues17,4,Tue Jun 16 23:21:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, got an answer! Just got to chat with the mad catz guys for 10 minutes. They said the red and white kits will definitely NOT be available at launch as of right now, and he's not sure if they'll ever see the light of day. Plan on the standard black being the only thing at launch.   Also, they will not be manufacturing as much hardware this time to cut down on unnecessary waste that cuts into the bottom line, so full kits may be very sparse this winter. They amount they make will be determined by the number of preorders. I'm not a big preorder person, but my old gear is ruined and I don't want to wait to make last gen controllers compatible, so I preordered to ensure I won't be left out at release."
Rockband,3a3gi0,FattyMcPatty,2,Wed Jun 17 02:28:30 2015 UTC,Aww.. The red drums looked so nice! Thank you so much for asking though!

Rockband,3a3gi0,StefanGagne,2,Wed Jun 17 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, this one I can answer without getting ahold of one of the guys. Just got finished playing it on a screen the size of a small movie theater. The graphics are CRISP. In particular, the notes and fretboard look very clear and bright. I really like their color palette for this version as well, the menus are noticeably clearer and sharper, even on a ridiculously huge screen.  I can't speak as much about the background stuff, because we are playing with all instruments on and a good bit of it is blocked. From what I've seen, stylistically, it looks a little less ""larger than life"" to me and more intimate. Might just be the venue though.   Overall, no worries on the graphics. This makes rockband 3 look granular and truly last gen. It'd be hard to go back after looking at how smooth and clean this is."
Rockband,3a3gi0,mmoody1287,2,Wed Jun 17 01:52:08 2015 UTC,What about those bloom effects? I was fairly unhappy after the initial reveal on ign.com with how they redid the track colors and brightness. I wasn't a fan at all. Does it look like they've polished that up a bit?
Rockband,3a3gi0,StefanGagne,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  Luckily Harmonix said the bloom was a bug, so I really hope it's toned down. I wish the notes were thicker too because they are razor thin!"
Rockband,3a3gi0,mmoody1287,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:00:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there's some bloom, but I didn't really notice it at all once I was playing it and in the zone. It just adds some nice presentation for when you're watching.   The colors and brightness were actually something that were a strong point. I felt that I was able to focus better on the notes and play better due to the brightness of the notes in contrast to the background. Everything looks very polished and ready to be shipped as is, and although it's a matter of personal taste, I'd say give it a try in your own living room before you make opinions about it. I thought it was overdone in gameplay videos, but found it very appealing for playing."
Rockband,3a3gi0,StefanGagne,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd love to try it in my own living room but don't wanna drop $60 on a game that's annoying to look at, as big a Rock Band fan as I am. So how does that bloom now compare to those ign.com alpha videos? Also that whole count down and ""Let Us Begin!"" crap was really weird. I honestly thought it looked like Rock Band Hero after that initial reveal and was incredibly turned off."

I got RB3 BiaB and Halo 5 for the price of BiaB on Amazon  EDIT: Looks like amazon.ca has a similar thing going on, too. 20% off 2 games or 30% off 3"

Rockband,3a28bi,harveyglobetrot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what I fear more as an Australian: whether the instrument bundles will actually be released here at all or, if they are, what they will cost. My guess, based on the poor history of releases in Australia, is that it could run $500 (if they come out at all).  I'm lucky to be in a reasonably good position at the moment (I will have old instruments that I can play), but it's going to be near impossible for any Australian who wants to get into RB4 fresh this generation.  EDIT: a quick Google around seems to show that The Gamesmen and Mighty Ape have RB4 instrument bundles (both band in a box and the guitar only) as a listing, but a TBC release date and no price. No listings at all on EB or JB Hifi."
Rockband,3a28bi,valeforXD,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm not the only one who's worried. At the very least I can import it from the UK, but I would like to just be able to pick up the game at my local EB for a change."
Rockband,3a28bi,harveyglobetrot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:49:31 2015 UTC,"Check out my edit, there are a couple of places that look like they will definitely get the instruments.  If I have to get instruments, I'll probably go with the Gamesmen, because I know they have a store near me.  As for the game only, I hope EB and JB get it although then they will also have to stock the dongle so old 360 instruments are compatible. We'll have to wait and see - importing really sucks and I'd rather not have to do it again (like I had to for RB1 and 2)."
Rockband,3a28bi,valeforXD,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool, thanks for introducing me to Gamesmen! I'm always looking for more sites like that.  At the very least, as a regular customer of Mighty Ape, this is a bit reassuring."
Rockband,3a28bi,harveyglobetrot,2,Wed Jun 17 03:36:01 2015 UTC,"I've never used them, but having the solidity of a physical location nearby (if you are in Sydney) is a big bonus.   I've always feared getting a dud drum set or guitar from overseas and having to return it. Luckily it's never happened, but I can imagine it being an annoying process.  I might send them an email this afternoon and I'll post back here to see what they said."
Rockband,3a1j4i,thekidwiththelisp,7,Tue Jun 16 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the gap they have to fill since their hiatus. They very probably approached RB3 as their last disc release, and put out some very heavy hitters for it and the following DLC. If they saw next-gen on the horizon, I bet some of the late DLC would have been kept in reserves.   I also can't imagine the owners of anything they tried and failed to get for whatever reason back then has budged on their stance all that much, especially now that they don't have MTV money/clout to throw around."
Rockband,3a1j4i,ohsnapitsjf,4,Tue Jun 16 14:57:50 2015 UTC,"I don't mind as long as they also include some classics, as they seem to be doing. I have discovered many new acts through Rock Band games, most of which are newer bands. I don't listen to the radio, I'm 31, and I've been playing since RB1.  I love classic rock, but I trust HMX to pick some newer bands that are fun on all instruments. I hope they don't quite go as far as GH did with emphasizing newer music."

Rockband,3a1j4i,mattd121794,5,Tue Jun 16 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"Think a moment about the previous games and their actual release dates. RB3 came out in 2010, and is one of the more ""Classic-oriented"" releases... it had 25 songs on-disc from the 200X decade. Another 13 were from the 90's.    Further, consider the extent to which they've already filled out their library through previous games and especially DLC.    Finally, consider the costs of getting, say, more Skynyrd licensed vs getting modern bands that are still trying to expand their fan-base to jump in.    Songs like Freebird sell copies of Rock Band.    Rock Band sells copies of albums for bands like H.I.M. and the Raveonettes."
Rockband,3a1j4i,LumpyArryhead,3,Tue Jun 16 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"Guitar Hero's also emphasizing modern music. I'm guessing both are pushing that hard in an effort to connect to a new, younger audience.  I'm all for it if it helps RB, but it is gonna cause problems at my RB parties since our vocalists don't listen to current radio and have no idea how any of those songs go."
Rockband,3a1j4i,StefanGagne,2,Tue Jun 16 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some bands would want their most recent songs in the game to help expand their fanbase.  But, I think it's a good mix so far. I mean, Elvis! Come on!"

Rockband,3a1j4i,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really is too bad. It was also hugely depressing for me as a giant Zep fan when I came across the info on just how bad they were about it.     There's also the fact that Page and JPJ were light years ahead of their time as producers/mixers, and some pretty widely supported rumors that the masters are not the elegant perfection we hear on their albums and even live performances like the SRTS ""movie,"" but that they're huge constructs of re-recordings and overdubbings and remixing together to sound so unbelievably good.    But yeah, I agree, I've always wondered how things would go down if one of the really enthusiastic guys at harmonix could get his ear, and especially with time to show him how fantastic TBRB was...    If Page and Plant actually got involved in it hands on... it could truly be a masterpiece of not just gaming but a standout across all mediums of art.    Also, just to clarify what I mean by the ""it"" there... I don't think harmonix would want to go for just a song or 2, or even an album. To do Zep, it needs to be its own game."

Rockband,3a1jgp,oddwhun,2,Tue Jun 16 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"There was an IGN video about instruments a while ago. It doesnt look like there will be any new features. But they will be built better, quiter, and more responsive."
Rockband,3a1jgp,612WolfAvenue,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"Bites my ass to spend $130 on RB4, but I think it's finally time to upgrade my original RB1 guitar.  Just having wireless will be very nice, plus they claim the strum bar is more robust now too."
Rockband,3a1jgp,grifta67,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:46:10 2015 UTC,Wireless? But they have been wireless since RB1. I think the last game out with a wired guitar was GH2.
Rockband,3a1jgp,grifta67,0,Tue Jun 16 18:09:48 2015 UTC,shrug  I dunno.  My Rock Band guitar (with the upper and lower fret buttons) is definitely wired.
Rockband,3a1jgp,grifta67,2,Tue Jun 16 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"Ok I just looked it up, apparently the first version of the xbox guitars were wired and playstation has always been wireless. Thats why I never saw one."

Head over to www.google.com, search ""MadCatz Interview RB4"" and spend a couple of hours listening to him tell you."

Rockband,39z5z8,sarcasticorange,3,Tue Jun 16 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"why the rush?    Mainly GHL.  That said, why should they wait to put it out when they can add it later and release it now for those that don't care about online play?"
Rockband,39z5z8,Quazifuji,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"It's a valid point.  Personally, I am thrilled for Rock Band 4, and the lack of online multiplayer doesn't affect that the slightest bit.  While I realize that it was a defining feature of the game for some, it was never more than a novelty for me."

Rockband,39z5z8,Quazifuji,2,Wed Jun 17 04:16:05 2015 UTC,"I never got the appeal of online Rock Band personally.  It never really seemed to capture the atmosphere of local multiplayer for me, and without the atmosphere I'd rather just play whatever songs I want on whatever instrument I want by myself.  I'm not gonna criticize people who feel they won't get enough enjoyment for it to be worth buying without online multiplayer, but I think people here are seriously underestimating how many people used that feature heavily."
Rockband,39z5z8,mattd121794,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:21:21 2015 UTC,I used to play with my friend out in Ohio (I'm from NH) and that was great till he broke his drums... (Which he threw out before I told him they could be rigged...) so that kinda stopped it all
Rockband,39z5z8,vsTerminus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"Online multi with strangers can be a lot of fun, but it depends entirely on the people you run into. If you find players with similar DLC and functioning microphones you can meet some great people. Sometimes you get into one of those rooms that are clearly a house party where they just need an <instrument> player to fill out the group. Those are a lot of fun too.  It's the people who don't have/use a mic and don't have any respect for the sort of unwritten rules when building a playlist and picking an instrument.  The guy who makes a 68 song setlist and the guy who backs out until he gets guitar are douchebags. The guy who knows the singer wants to actually sing something but locks in a bunch of metal anyways is a bigger douchebag."
Rockband,39z5z8,BathTubNZ,2,Wed Jun 17 17:59:23 2015 UTC,Does Guitar Hero have a date? Maybe they feel the need to beat it to market.
Rockband,39z5z8,espher,3,Tue Jun 16 05:10:37 2015 UTC,Looks like Guitar Hero Live comes out in September.  I can't see it being as big of a competitor to RB now that it's being revamped and they're dropping vocals and drums.

If I'm going to lay out the money to preorder this game with a new console, I want to know that this mode is at least in the works or being given thought."
Rockband,39z5z8,Rizaria,5,Mon Jun 15 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"Right, it's not even a commitment to eventual online play."
Rockband,39z5z8,Stonicus,6,Tue Jun 16 01:25:03 2015 UTC,"Unfortunate. The main reason I wanted a new Rock Band was to play with people online. I don't have any offline friends who care for this.  Damn it, Harmonix. Maybe I should stick to RB3."
Rockband,39z5z8,vsTerminus,5,Tue Jun 16 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"This is hard for me. I normally played with my friends online, due to our schedules. Now, we will not be able to.  I also used to love joining random bands and sing whatever stuff they threw at me.  Ok, I guess"
Rockband,39z5z8,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:15:37 2015 UTC,I used to love joining random bands as well on pretty much any instrument. For a long time I had the majority of the DLC so it really didn't matter what they felt like playing.  I miss that.
Rockband,39z5z8,RollofDuctTape,6,Wed Jun 17 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"Well, that saves me buying a PS4 just for Rockband, at least.    That said I really hope they don't decide based on sales numbers or purely on demand from people that actually buy the game without online play.    This is going to hurt sales, and I don't feel like I could possibly consider buying it without knowing for certain there will be online play... so if it's based only on people actually buying the game without online play, I won't have any input.     I feel pretty confident harmonix is reading this thread as they seem to actually take this subreddit seriously... so yeah... please don't let this happen, guys. Online play is way too important to forgo. If anything it should be the focus in today's gaming environment. With me personally it's not only costing you guys a full band kit sale, it's costing Sony a ps4 purchase as well.    And I've spent more than both those things combined cost on DLC."
Rockband,39z5z8,vsTerminus,12,Tue Jun 16 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"Deal breaker for me. I'll buy it when multiplayer is patched in. By then, there won't be a hardware shortage. And just like that...pre-order cancelled."
Rockband,39z5z8,bigprettybridges,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:41:33 2015 UTC,I know some people who bought Xbones for RB4 and now won't be able to play online with each other >.>

Rockband,39z5z8,Jmcglosson,6,Tue Jun 16 11:37:07 2015 UTC,"They can't keep saying ""well if the numbers are there we'll put it in"". If they do then people just won't bother with the game. We need reasons to buy it."
Rockband,39z5z8,BathTubNZ,3,Tue Jun 16 11:44:44 2015 UTC,"No online multiplayer and still, as far as I know, no word on midi adapter compatibility.  I pre-ordered a Band-in-a-Box just to make sure that I had one if I still wanted it in October, but now I'm having to question whether I still want it..."
Rockband,39z5z8,DDRguy133,3,Tue Jun 16 02:42:52 2015 UTC,So what stats will they be tracking to gauge support for online multiplayer?
Rockband,39z5z8,C_Rufio,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:26:12 2015 UTC,Probably solo players and how often local co-op is used. Sop no voxtar or voxdrums for a while
Rockband,39z5z8,i_saw_nothing,3,Tue Jun 16 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"Everyone I play Rock Band with comes over to my house to play it, so the online feature was rarely used on my 360. However, I can see how this sucks for a lot of people. Hopefully they're able to add it in eventually through an update."
Rockband,39z5z8,Koteric,3,Tue Jun 16 04:01:27 2015 UTC,"Well then.    No online multiplayer, no support for my Midi Pro Adapter so I can use my Roland kit, and no export of RB3?  RB4 also won't be launching with me."
Rockband,39z5z8,MillerWins,3,Tue Jun 16 17:25:50 2015 UTC,Welp.  They can have my money when they include a feature that should just be standard at this point.
Rockband,39z5z8,Blehgopie,3,Tue Jun 16 21:59:00 2015 UTC,"This is like a punch in the gut for me. Literally all the people I play RB with are hundreds of miles from me. Online multiplayer was the only way we got to play together. If they said something like ""we're no doubt going to add that post launch"" I would be fine with that. But they didnt. I mean, it's 2015, how is being able to play with people online not a main feature?"
Rockband,39z5z8,-Novowels,2,Thu Jun 18 02:25:29 2015 UTC,This basically means I'm stuck with solo play until HMX patches online in.

Rockband,39z5z8,Heiroglyph,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:43:01 2015 UTC,"Fine by me, but I'm surprised they don't just delay the game and stick it in that way. I'm sure they have their reasons of course - I'm no game dev."
Rockband,39z5z8,SkippyDeluxe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"I imagine a need for cash and the results of the polls they did have a lot to do with this decision.  A lot of people use this as a local party game or solo, so selling without the online feature gets much of the money rolling in sooner rather than later."

Rockband,3a2vpl,Koteric,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"HMX has the data on this though, and they feel folks like you are in the minority.  Will I miss the ability to?  Possibly, but I rarely ever did in any of the RB games.  Throw in that online isn't free for PS4 folks either like it was for PS3, and you have a feature that's already pay gated by the system that also costs money to implement and their research says isn't a major selling point.  I fully expect it to be patched in if there's enough demand, but likely the game has to do well first."
Rockband,3a2vpl,Bront20,2,Wed Jun 17 03:34:11 2015 UTC,"Harmonix is getting all kinds of hell here and on their forums from that ""minority"".   I'm not sure about the others in this category, but I spent a lottttttt of money on DLC."
Rockband,3a2vpl,mokacoffay,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"The forums are only 5-10% of the username according to HMX.  Honestly, online players being vocal online isn't too surprising.  Heck, I still recall folks complaining about Blitz needing to be online constantly."
Rockband,3a2vpl,Bront20,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:45:55 2015 UTC,"That's all well and fine.  My money will remain in my wallet till it is.  I can play RB3 which has pro guitar, pro drums, keyboards, and online play till they do."
Rockband,3a2vpl,Koteric,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"True, and fair enough.  Or perhaps you'll change your mind after release.    RB4 isn't missing pro drums."
Rockband,3a2vpl,Bront20,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"True, but I am not going to buy a whole new pack of instruments if they don't make old stuff work.  I already have 3 gh guitars, ion drums/rb2 drums.  So i guess more accurately, no online and no backwards instrument compatibility is a no go."
Rockband,3a2vpl,Koteric,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"PS4 will be able to use any dongle based controler supposedly, so I suspect the MPA/Ions will work on the PS4 as well (the console won't be able to tell, it will just see the controler ID).  XBone?  much more difficult.  HMX has now also officially said Online play is top post-launch priority."
Rockband,3a2vpl,Bront20,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"All my DLC is on Xbone, and it's a lot.  So when they have online play and compatible instruments they will get my money :p"
Rockband,3a2vpl,Koteric,2,Thu Jun 18 23:27:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's pretty ridiculous that there doesn't seem to be online play and I'm holding off on preordering until I hear more details. If they could include it in every past title, why not this one? Online multiplayer is pretty much required for gaming these days."
Rockband,3a2vpl,mostdeadlygeist,2,Tue Jun 16 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"""If they could include it in every past title, why not this one?"" - because they were backed by MTV and had shit loads of money to hire a larger team, that's why. Now it's either postpone it until next year and lose out to GHL and lose out on Christmas sales, or release it now without and maybe patch it in later."
Rockband,3a2vpl,NemoEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"This stuff is complicated and Harmonix is a small team. They have to set priorities. They can't set out to accommodate every possible use case or they'd go bankrupt trying. Creating online play likely would have meant the exclusion of some other feature, and I guarantee you there'd be just as many people complaining about that, if it were the case.  I understand that it's a bummer when they're not doing the thing you want, but try to maintain some perspective here."
Rockband,3a2vpl,VinTheRighteous,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"Literally every other RB game has online mode which they are removing, and they're also removing Pro Guitar / Keyboard.    If I try to maintain some perspective here, all I see is a degraded game. It shouldn't be the hardest thing in the world to implement Online, and I'm sure the Freestyle takes far more effort and time to develope than online play. In my opinion, Online has been a grand core mechanic for RB, and by removing that you are hurting a large demographic group of the consumers.    Adding online play shouldn't exclude other features, unless if there's not enough memory / space which I seriously doubt is possible on this game. The team shouldn't be small enough that they can't develope online, and it shouldn't make them bankrupt with Online Play which they have already experience with.    To add in a little though, RB3 did remove Duel-Mode, and it literally had no storymode other than just a handful preset setlists called Road while in contrast RB2 had a full progressive ""story"" mode."
Rockband,3a2vpl,VinTheRighteous,3,Tue Jun 16 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"I really think you're underestimating the kind of funding and resources having a publisher like Activision/EA/MTV Games provides for a development team.  Harmonix is currently self-publishing the game with Madcatz (who are concerned mostly with hardware and distribution, as I understand). As such, it's certainly within the realm of possibility that online multiplayer was just not in the pre-release budget.   To address your other point, while online multiplayer could be regarded as a legacy feature, that doesn't necessarily mean it was a widely used feature. For every user like yourself, whose purchase depends on it, there's one like me, who only ever played online to get the achievements. I would have to imagine Harmonix has data to support their decision to exclude online multiplayer, otherwise they would have made it a priority."
Rockband,3a2vpl,NemoEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:50:22 2015 UTC,"You fail to see that every prior game had it because they were backed by MTV and had shit loads of money to hire a larger team, that's why.

Rockband,3a2vpl,NemoEsq,2,Tue Jun 16 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be reasonable to simply not develope the freestyle thing? If the budget is really that tight, introducing a new system with ""improvising"" seems a little off with the lack of online. We didn't ask for it. It's just my opinion though."
Rockband,3a2vpl,therytor,2,Tue Jun 16 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, some people will say that it would have been better to keep online and not add any of the ""new"" things. Some people also would say it would have been better to keep keys and fuck online play. And so on. Everyone has preferred features. And Harmonix has to appeal to a new audience. Maybe you don't realize (I wonder, does anyone else?) that all these ""new"" features are really ways to make the game easier for people who have never played it, easier to approach for new gamers. Maybe online would have been crucial, maybe it's not. I'm sure that Harmonix is in the best position to know this, not us."

Rockband,39xv6v,nerdcrest,3,Mon Jun 15 18:29:35 2015 UTC,30 additional songs for pre-ordering   Okay... I know they need a lot of cash up front to give us the best game they can but...   4 EXCLUSIVE AMAZON SONGS   Didn't we just get done telling Harmonix that this kind of stuff is really deplorable?
Rockband,39xv6v,mokacoffay,5,Mon Jun 15 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"The amazon songs will obviously be released as DLC a few weeks later, just like the Rock Band 3 pre order. It's not that big of a deal."
Rockband,39xv6v,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:45:27 2015 UTC,The point is that the songs are already made; and should be on the disc no matter where you buy it from.  It's cutting content out that's already been prepared.
Rockband,39xv6v,mokacoffay,3,Wed Jun 17 00:02:38 2015 UTC,New songs:  Violent Shiver  Benjamin Booker  Suspicious Minds    Elvis Presley  Uptown Funk Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars  My God Is The Sun   Queens of the Stone Age  The Warrior Scandal
Rockband,39xv6v,EvoHero,3,Mon Jun 15 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"I think a bigger announcement is that apparently the rest of Scandal is no longer being trod under Patty Smyth's boot heel.  Man, I really like that Benjamin Booker song in the trailer."

Rockband,39xv6v,StefanGagne,2,Mon Jun 15 18:33:54 2015 UTC,I really hope the other retailers get the same bonus songs or none at all... I hate these games that force you to make a fucking spreadsheet to figure out the optimal purchase...

Rockband,39xv6v,snootchie_bootch,2,Mon Jun 15 18:35:54 2015 UTC,Looks like only guitar and band bundles?  That's gonna make importing a pain in the arse.
Rockband,39xv6v,Rizaria,2,Mon Jun 15 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"Whoops. Accidentally pre-ordered the guitar bundle on Amazon. Didn't think it worked. Last I checked, didn't think they sold such things to overseas people. But it was like 10 bucks postage. Weird.  Still, whoops. Didn't mean that! Glad they haven't charged me right away."
Rockband,39xv6v,Rizaria,2,Mon Jun 15 23:45:08 2015 UTC,"Weird. Must be a glitch. I can get the PS4 bundle, even the band one, but not the Xbone bundle. Ha. Who stuffed up at Amazon?"

Rockband,39xv6v,dwfan24,2,Mon Jun 15 18:20:36 2015 UTC,Holy crap 30 bonus songs from amazon!?  i think we all know where we are going to pre-order from lol
Rockband,39xv6v,djx1100,5,Mon Jun 15 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"The 30 songs are for pre-ordering anywhere, Amazon just has 4 exclusive tracks"
Rockband,39xv6v,jordanlolss,2,Mon Jun 15 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"300$ for the bundle in Canada.... That's 50$ less than an Xbox One, it's really too expensive. I don't get the logic though. Game= 70$ Guitar and Drum= 115$ each? That seems excessive.."
Rockband,39xv6v,BaguetteStix,3,Tue Jun 16 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"Well, game is 75 on its own (check EB) - games are going up again as our dollar continues to go down (Battlefront is 80). 160 for the game with guitar, so 85 for the guitar. Which leaves 140 for the drums and mic, so probly ~115 for drums, 25 for mic. Yeah, it's a lot, but as the game is more expensive than the last everywhere, mixed with our dollar going to shit in the last few years, it seems about right with what I would have expected, anyway."
Rockband,39xv6v,sudobyte,3,Tue Jun 16 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"Especially if you've already invested in a lot of content from the previous versions (DLC, exports..) it's not that big of a deal. For me the real issue is getting an XB1, which for me at this time is a big purchase for just a single game. (considering I'm a PC gamer and haven't console gamed except for Rock Band)"
Rockband,39xv6v,SilentR0b,2,Tue Jun 16 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"Same boat but PS4 and 300 songs on my 360. I'm going to have to sit this one out until either they figure a way to allow cross platform availability of transferring songs or giving me a coupon to redownload them on my ps4, or until I save up enough cash to buy an xone and this game with a bundle. Which is a lot"

Rockband,39xv6v,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:55:46 2015 UTC,I think this game is barely in it's Beta stage considering the first look we saw with IGN was stated numerous times that it was all Alpha gameplay.
Rockband,39xv6v,murkantor,2,Tue Jun 16 06:34:36 2015 UTC,That's what I'm hoping. That's how it was for RB1's trailer so it's possible. I just thought that after the showing in May they'd have something that looks better.
Rockband,39xv6v,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"It worries me that they made a commercial-esque trailer that uses game footage that looks almost the same as the ""pre-alpha"""
Rockband,39zopv,Goron40,6,Tue Jun 16 02:20:12 2015 UTC,Makes sense.
Rockband,39zopv,C_Rufio,2,Tue Jun 16 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"It's not very surprising; the controllers just won't work, not without the RB4-specific legacy adapter. Which is not available yet."
Rockband,39zopv,StefanGagne,2,Tue Jun 16 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I don't think the backwards compatibility is coming out of the preview program until around the holidays.  At the very least, I hope they are able to make The Beatles: Rock Band available, since those songs are locked to the game."
Rockband,39zopv,VinTheRighteous,3,Tue Jun 16 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Given the insane tangle of music industry red tape around that game in general, I wouldn't get your hopes too high."
Rockband,39zopv,StefanGagne,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"That game must be the biggest nightmare for HMX, I mean they can't do anything with it, it exists and that's all (it is a pretty game and I love it, but the Beatles Catalog is a bitch licensing wise)"
Rockband,39zopv,mattd121794,2,Wed Jun 17 04:18:36 2015 UTC,"Even then, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd have to write extra code to get them to work with the old games. Which would be a waste of money because if you had an XBone and adapter then why wouldn't you just get RB4."
Rockband,39zopv,Advacar,2,Tue Jun 16 13:39:05 2015 UTC,At least RB:Blitz would work with regular controller.
Rockband,39zopv,biosehnsucht,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:38:54 2015 UTC,that'd be pretty funny if it loaded up future dlc
Rockband,39zopv,OutsideOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"It might not be able to see DLC though, which means it won't work beyond the Demo.  Hopefully HMX just makes a Blitz 2."
Rockband,39zopv,Bront20,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"You could theoretically download your existing DLC into the emulator, but it's probably sandboxed per game, so you wouldn't be able to access it elsewhere or even another RB game, so now its taking up lots of space ...   Blitz 2 would be nice, or even just a ""Blitz HD"" quick port, but I doubt we'll get it any time soon ... they're likely stretched thin already."
Rockband,39zopv,biosehnsucht,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:25:19 2015 UTC,"Except Blitz stored the data in the RB or RB3 folders, so it looks in the folders for other games, so I have no clue if the system would even allow it."
Rockband,39zopv,Bront20,2,Wed Jun 17 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the adapter makes the controlers work with RB4, but they need to work with the old games instead, so the old games need to see them as the old instruments, not the new ones."
Rockband,39zopv,Bront20,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:22:16 2015 UTC,I think they should make RB1 work just to download the songs
Rockband,39zopv,negativexero25,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"Since we couldn't emulate a customs-compatible version (they would force latest title update) I don't really care, other than it would be nice to be able to export RB1 tracks (which would need emulation - but then wouldn't work anyways since the emulated drive it would save to would not be the One's filesystem).  I wonder if we can shove the RB1 exports into cloud save and pull them from there somehow?"

Rockband,39zxxo,Recreatee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's way more awkward on rock band. Which might be more accurate, but it's still hard to play."
Rockband,39zxxo,Anchor_Rancor,2,Wed Jun 17 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"For some reason they couldn't find the original masters for GH3 so they actually re-recorded it for that game.    When they made it for Blitz, they had the original masters, so it's fairly different from the GH3 version.     The GH3 version is much more fluid and is easier to play. The Rockband version kind of looks easier, but has a bunch of really awkward spots that make it tougher. It's still not an extremely hard song, though, just a fairly tough one."
Rockband,39zxxo,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:39:20 2015 UTC,That's really interesting. I always wondered why the version from GH was slightly different.
Rockband,39zxxo,LumpyArryhead,2,Fri Jun 19 13:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually thought for a while that it was a cover but that seemed impossible cuz it's honestly better than the original, modern production is just getting soooo good lol."

Rockband,39xuqf,nordee,2,Mon Jun 15 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"The lack of online multiplayer and the lack of any sort of lip service to plans for online multiplayer is a huge weight against me preordering since I don't have a PS4 already, but this feature sounds amazing enough that it could outweigh it."

Rockband,39xuqf,TommehVercetteh,0,Tue Jun 16 00:41:22 2015 UTC,"I've got it pre-ordered, just cause instruments are going to be damn near impossible to find after launch. For some unknown reason, after 3 core games in the franchise, we can't seem to get the option to pre-order an extra guitar to fill out our band.  But I'll cancel my pre-order a couple weeks before release if, by then, we have no news on online multiplayer, and at least an ETA. If we can't buy enough instruments to fill out our local band, then we should at least be able to have an online player fill in the last slot."

Rockband,39xuqf,valeforXD,6,Mon Jun 15 18:18:42 2015 UTC,I hope this doesn't fuck up the leaderboards because you could blaze through challenging solos easily with this.

Rockband,39xuqf,nordee,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:23 2015 UTC,Follow up question: what about with vocals? Does the vocal leaderboard let you harmonize your way to the top?
Rockband,39xuqf,wwwes32,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"I've wondered this too. With most songs, if the key doesn't change, you could find one pitch that fits and monotone the whole thing"

Rockband,39xuqf,ridethepiggy,2,Mon Jun 15 18:15:29 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see how Guitar Hero legacy guitars (or maybe even the keytar?) would work with this. Although I'd sacrifice custom solos if it meant I could still play guitar parts on my keytar.
Rockband,39xuqf,StefanGagne,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:35:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they said they're dropping support for GH guitars. This is probably why.

Loading loading every where.  As for the solo freestyle? It makes the game REALLY easy. Personally I didn't like it. It felt kinda like when you had star power on drums in the early rock band. Where notes would disappear and you had to play a few notes to do guitar power. This time it's just mashing

However, if by the end of September we don't have news on online multiplayer, MIDI adapter/Edrum compatibility, and individual instrument sales, I'll be cancelling it."

Rockband,39zvgb,forgot-word,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:00:48 2015 UTC,Not a fucking chance.  Preordering games is what is wrong with the gaming community these days.  They will make enough copies for day 1.
Rockband,39zvgb,StefanGagne,4,Tue Jun 16 13:05:44 2015 UTC,"In this case it's actually the opposite. The returns on the hardware are so bad that they aren't going to flood the market with guitars again -- they're using preorders to determine how many need to be made.   The boogeyman of ""Didn't preorder? UR SCREWD"" that GameStop likes to trot out? Actually possibly true in this case."
Rockband,39zvgb,Jmcglosson,2,Tue Jun 16 13:20:42 2015 UTC,"Not even possibly true, it's simply true.

If an item hasn't been released yet you'll be able to see the expected release date on the item's Product Detail page.  You can place an order for one of these items in the same way as you'd order anything else. We won't charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch the order.

Rockband,39xx9t,jimmyeppley,10,Mon Jun 15 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, they are putting these preorders out to gauge production numbers on the instruments. I doubt you will have a problem picking up the game on release day, plus there is the digital option."
Rockband,39xx9t,DrHairyMcTaint,2,Mon Jun 15 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you don't want new instruments, no reason to pre-order. Just spend the money you save on the  DLC you want."

Rockband,39xx9t,mfranko88,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:41:32 2015 UTC,the 30 songs are already out for Rock Band in some form or fashion.  you may already have some of these songs if you check the source where they are from (like some are from rock band 1 and rock band 2 20 free songs).  the 4 exclusive to amazon are new dlc though and may not be available right off the bat.
Rockband,39xx9t,chexmixho,0,Mon Jun 15 21:48:22 2015 UTC,The wording of the page makes me think the 30 songs are included in every game no matter the source.  I doubt the four songs will come later as DLC. RB3 had three pre-order exclusive songs through GameStop. They have never become available for regular DLC after nearly five years.  I could be wrong though.  HMX LET ME GIVE YOU MY PRE-ORDER MONEY!!!
Rockband,39xx9t,mfranko88,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"actually they were available only 1 to 2 weeks after the initial release date.   For reference they were Blue Monday, My Own Summer (Shove It), and Burning Down the House"

I believe they also said that it will work, just not on launch."
Rockband,39xx9t,dwfan24,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"I really hope they get something for the Drum Rocker. I wonder if their adapter would work, or if ION would need to make a new drum head."
Rockband,39xx9t,snootchie_bootch,2,Mon Jun 15 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"As long as the ions work eventually, i will be happy. I think ion is going to make a new drum brain though, from how much they stress wireless wont work, i think there is a problem with wireless.  I spent a shit ton of money on them, and I love them."
Rockband,39xx9t,dwfan24,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"If you weren't using one of the wireless models before now, you're not really using good instruments anyways.

Rockband,39xzts,RoxySox77,3,Mon Jun 15 18:38:28 2015 UTC,No it does not. Cymbals are a separate purchase and they will have new cymbals for sale. New cymbals are not backwards-compatible with older drum sets but older cymbals are compatible with the new drum set.

Rockband,39xzts,NemoEsq,3,Mon Jun 15 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"They should have a ""full, really full, we really mean it this time, band in a box"" kit. $500 or something but goddamn it you'd have everything."
Rockband,39xzts,Ryderraider48,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"And then sell one called the ""full concert"" bundle with 2 stage kits and the overdrive pedals for g/b and double bass pedals. THAT would be sweet!"
Rockband,39xzts,NemoEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"I forgot that, mainly because I have all of it already. I have 2 stage kits with daisy chained lights, overdrive pedal but never use it, and I have extra bass pedals. But yeah, a full concert bundle for like $750 and call it a day."
Rockband,39xzts,Ryderraider48,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:24:24 2015 UTC,Lucky! I'm in the process of trying to find a better paying job so I can get all of that. How much does an overdrive pedal cost these days?
Rockband,39xzts,NemoEsq,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt you can find one. I found one in a dusty corner of a Gamestop and paid like $5 for it. Never used it, still in the box. I still remember when you could get Stage Kits for $15 new in box if you could find them at Gamestops...I got like 4 back then."

Rockband,39zie8,dwfan24,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:49:38 2015 UTC,Why are RB1 instruments not considered legacy then?
Rockband,39zie8,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Tue Jun 16 13:11:27 2015 UTC,"They are considered legacy. The thing is, Harmonix has only confirmed that wireless legacy instruments will work on new gen consoles. Only the RB1 guitar was wireless."

Rockband,39zcj7,SilentR0b,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:59:20 2015 UTC,I would suggest you read the HMX FAQ on the announcement thread...it specifically tells you Xbox 360 -> Xbox One and PS3 -> PS4 only. Most of the questions on this subreddit are answered there.

Rockband,39wal7,toymachinesh,2,Mon Jun 15 09:11:02 2015 UTC,"Agh, I wonder what the other retailers will have for pre-order bonuses. 34 DLC tracks is pretty sweet!"
Rockband,39wal7,ridethepiggy,2,Mon Jun 15 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the 34 song pack is for pre-ordering it anywhere, because it later says people who order from amazon.com will get 4 exclusive tracks. So many different retailers will have different 4 song packs"
Rockband,39wal7,jordanlolss,2,Mon Jun 15 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I meant. Those 4 tracks aren't terribly appealing to me so it'd be interesting to see what exclusive tracks other retailers will carry.  I planned on buying at Best Buy for midnight release / gamer club discounts."
Rockband,39wal7,ridethepiggy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:18:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing those extra retailer-specific tracks will be generic DLC at launch or after. I'll just scoop it off my usual preferred seller (amazon) and buy anything I miss out on.
Rockband,39wal7,StefanGagne,2,Mon Jun 15 13:36:33 2015 UTC,Similar to The Doors pack last time?  I'm fine with that. DLC is DLC to me. More songs the better!
Rockband,39wal7,ridethepiggy,2,Mon Jun 15 13:39:44 2015 UTC,"Is it 34 songs, or is it 30 songs + 4 Amazon ""exclusive"" songs, or is it actually 4 songs (meaning the Amazon 4) and someone fat-fingered the 3 when trying to type 4?  STAY TUNED!"
Rockband,39wal7,espher,2,Mon Jun 15 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"Given 30's a nice round number, I'd assume it's 30 standard + 4 exclusive."

Rockband,39wal7,harveyglobetrot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"I guess the only thing that has me skeptical about it being 34 DLC songs is that none of the press releases that have been leaked so far have mentioned it. You would think having 30 free DLC at launch would be something worth trumpeting.  Anyway, I hope it is the case - free DLC is free DLC!"
Rockband,39wal7,BallsOfANinja,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:58:40 2015 UTC,I don't like that they only called out bundles for the pre-order songs. If you just pre-order the game and not an instrument will you still get the songs. Guess we'll have to wait and see.

Rockband,39wqak,wwwes32,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this doesn't surprise me. The RB3 songs at this point are the only tracks in the franchise that are currently locked to a disc (excluding TB:RB which exists in it's own world). RB1, RB2, L:RB, GD:RB, and RB:B have all had their tracks exportable and downloadable in some way. While I'm certain part of the holdup will be renegotiating licenses, I think they other factor is simply: this is the easier bit to throw on the back burner. I think primarily Harmonix focus is (besides having a hopefully flawless game with hopefully fantastic new hardware) making sure that the Song Library is as fleshed out as possible at launch, especially for those of us who have invested a lot within the franchise. That incredible DLC backlog from the previous Gen is what will make RB4 so very enticing, not just to old player but to new. More than anything I want to see that my massive song library is going to make it in tact, and this includes not just Harmonix DLC but also the RBN stuff from the 360. Since that seems to be the biggest beast currently that they need to conquer I wouldn't be surprised if that's where they are focusing their resources on at the moment, and then once handled for the most part, we will see an RB3 Export shortly follow."
Rockband,39wqak,That_Guy_Link,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Considering they're making this game for longevity and being concurrent and all, I think some of us are expecting everything on day 1. I'm actually encouraged to know they can add more features, exports etc... as we go along rather than ""This is it, deal with it until we make RB5""."
Rockband,39wqak,SilentR0b,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:48:25 2015 UTC,Absolutely. This is the game that will be here for the long haul. This is the platform for which Harmonix will build their legacy going forward. We've got time...plenty of time.

Rockband,39rai0,socomman,7,Sun Jun 14 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"It would really bother me playing RB4 knowing my RB3 disc had access to songs that I couldn't get on the new game. It's not just the pain of swapping discs, it's a whole new console. I'd love to just get rid of my PS3 and replace it with a PS4, but if there's no export, I'm gonna keep the PS3 around."
Rockband,39rai0,TommyWalker1237,-8,Sun Jun 14 04:48:53 2015 UTC,It pains me to hear people like you say that.  You can't have a PS4 without Plus. It sucks. You're going to get tons of free PS3 games and have no PS3 to play them on.  Sense. It make no.
Rockband,39rai0,smacksaw,6,Sun Jun 14 12:38:46 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping RB3 is exportable, although I'm curious as to their original reasoning behind saying it wouldn't be. All I know is they said it wouldn't, but I don't think I ever found out why."
Rockband,39rai0,nerdcrest,8,Sun Jun 14 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think they specifically said it wouldn't be, just that at the time they weren't planning to.  They also specifically said that that could change, and that they would take community feedback into account when choosing what to prioritize for porting, so it's fully possible there was just enough community support for RB3 disc export that they decided it was worth doing after all."
Rockband,39rai0,Quazifuji,3,Sun Jun 14 01:16:30 2015 UTC,i think it had to do with the way RB3 disc was licensed although by th e time they put out RB3 it was evident they were still planning on releasing a new rock band down the road (hence rock band sessions) that eventually got scrapped.
Rockband,39rai0,Sidman69,3,Sun Jun 14 01:44:04 2015 UTC,"The way I interpreted it has been that at the moment they haven't had any plans to do so since perhaps they hadn't been able to work out licensing agreements? Harmonix for the most part tends to be very careful with what they say after their promises with The Who's ""Who's Next"" and Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" could not come to fruition. At no point has it sounding like it would never happen, it just seems that currently speaking that it's not going to happen until further notice and they are ready to come out and say that it will indeed happen without a doubt. Unfortunately even hinting at the idea of it coming out usually leads to speculation and rumor that it will indeed come out and the community would roll with it even if it wasn't true."

Rockband,39rai0,jacktheBOSS,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:35:33 2015 UTC,"When Harmonix announced that they would be releasing albums on Rock Band, Nevermind was one of the major ones. Unfortunately for many fans it was something that took quite some time to actually materialize. Keep in mind that Nevermind was something that was hyped about since shortly after RB's launch in 2007, and In Bloom was an RB1 Disc track. The rest of the album released as followed:   Drain You (RB2 Disc Track: Sept. 14th, 2008) Nirvana Pack 01 (Released Oct. 21st, 2008)   Breed Lounge Act On A Plain Polly Something In The Way Stay Way Territorial Pissings  Nirvana Pack 02 (Released Dec. 1, 2009)   Come As You Are (Live from MTV Unplugged) Lithium (Live at Reading) Smells Like Teen Spirit    It was not uncommon for some full album releases to already have tracks that were on disc. The Pixies ""Doolittle"" album had ""Wave of Mutilation"" on disc for RB1 and we got the remainder of the album later. Same went for the RHCP's ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" which featured ""Give It Away"" on the RB2 disc with the rest of the album following later on. Unfortunately for Nevermind when the dlc finally came it lacked three of the its most iconic songs, and when we got those over a year later two of them were not even the album versions but live renditions (not to say I'm complaining, just stating a fact). Sadly Nevermind was a bit of a clusterfuck for Harmonix, and it coupled with the the inability to deliver the entirety of The Who's ""Who's Next"" (which was due to technical issues of not being able to get the Masters after they had already announced it) led , in my opinion of course, to Harmonix being very careful for what they announce will be released."
Rockband,39rai0,That_Guy_Link,3,Mon Jun 15 19:46:12 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping after E3 we'll have more meaty info to chew on and less rumors, speculation, and interpretation of vague words from HMX.  HMX is kinda known for being vague, comes with the territory when dealing with uncertain music industry contracts, but..."
Rockband,39rai0,StefanGagne,2,Sun Jun 14 01:47:29 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing a very well worded response on the RB forums recently where someone said basically this:    The reason is probably because RB3 tracks were authored in such a way that some stems were 'shared' and split so that you'd have a RB3 version of a particular song and a normal variant of that same song.  For example, a certain Queen song would have a RB3 version that has the tracks split perfectly, meaning the keys would be strictly on a keyboard track and guitar on another.. whereas the Normal version, you had seen some of the keys parts on the Guitar portion of the stem. Not all songs are done this way, obviously, but it made me think that the main reason some of this was held off was for two main reasons: 1 being the licensing issues (which to me was kind of a weak one, it's not impossible since they've had successes in the past with this) and 2 being that some of the songs that were authored for RB3 were awkwardly created in such a way that they'd have to be 'tweaked' to allow for export into the new program."
Rockband,39rai0,SilentR0b,4,Sun Jun 14 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"Every single song is being tweaked (well, more than tweaked) anyway for RB4 for vocal improv and the guitar freestyle features, so I don't think that would be a major concern."

Taking it apart and reseating it helps a little. Switched it to the green place since with pro drums it favors the green cymbal it seems. The cymbals are shit anyway. Get some 10"" pintechs and you're fine. The stock pedal sucks since there's no rebound and I'm looking to replace it. The pads seem to work fine although some times I know for sure I was on beat and get penalized by the game. They're not Rolands or Yamahas so I don't expect perfection."

But again, let's assume all 500 do. How much do you think it'll cost to port the code and assets over to Wii U? To test the port? To certify to release? Let's say maybe $500,000 to be conservative. Are YOU willing to pay $1000 for the Wii U version of RB4 to make sure Harmonix doesn't end up out of pocket with this? Or are you hoping that the 500 signature means exponentially more sales for HMX? What happens if they don't, will you foot the bill?

The Wii numbers compared to the PS3/XBOX came absolutely no where near and on top of that the inferior online infrastructure made it unbearable to do anything online including buying songs which is a lot easier on the other two platforms. I don't blame Harmonix on focusing on the two platforms that will make them money (I think they could make it on PC, however that platform has none of the DLC yet so it would be treading water then a guaranteed success) whereas on the Wii U 90% of games sold are Nintendo first parties and there's a reason all triple a developers are avoiding it."

If this is the case and they both work, I'll post again in this thread with links to the sellers that I used and maybe you can get working copies as well.  AC/DC was only $5.50 including shipping, and Rock Band 2 was around $20.

The mute bar over the strings and the plastic fingerboard, not to mention the cheapness of the guitar, are big time downsides of RB3 pro mode. In Rocksmith I'm using my ESP Horizon and it rules. Plus actually being able to hear yourself is a major improvement. Not mourning the removal of pro mode. Although Rocksmith doesn't have the catalogue."
Rockband,39mzf2,OldGravyLeg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:46:01 2015 UTC,"Right, I don't disagree that Rocksmith does pro-guitar way better than RB3.  As a matter of fact, it better do pro-guitar better than RB3 considering that is the main function of that game.  I was just pointing out some more excluded features that aren't making it into RB4 that the guys above me didn't mention."
Rockband,39mzf2,chexmixho,0,Sat Jun 13 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah. And it was probably super niche. Niche as in people who have sex with rutabagas. Although to be honest, Rocksmith feels kind of jive sometimes and a lot of the time you end up going to the sheet music since it doesn't have a good way of conveying rythmn. But so hype for RB4. Whee!"

Rockband,39ohji,Jmcglosson,3,Sat Jun 13 06:20:57 2015 UTC,"In the same sort of mess. Except my old DLC is tied to an Aussie account and now I'm building a library on my US account for when I get a PS4.  Anyway, officially, the only disc you can still export is Rock Band 1. Doesn't matter if you get a preowned copy, just need the disc and then buy the ""Rock Band Song Export"" from the PSN. Link here if you don't wanna search. https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/rock-band-song-export-key/cid=UP0006-BLUS30050_00-RB1EXPORTCCF0099 That'll tie it to your account. That being said, you can buy it anyway, disc or not.   In any case, that's the only game possible now. Green Day/LEGO/2 can no longer be exported. Beatles/3 have never been exportable.   I think that about sums it up. I have heard some people here have managed to coax Rock Band 2 export codes from EA reps, but I've never been able to get in contact with one myself. Sadly. 2 has a great song list. Sigh.   But yeah, 1 is still definitely exportable. And otherwise, just buy up all the packs still on the PSN."
Rockband,39ohji,Rizaria,3,Sat Jun 13 08:27:21 2015 UTC,"That's really unfortunate, Rock Band 2 was definitely my favorite as far as the on-disc setlist goes. Anyway, thanks for the help, pal."
Rockband,39ohji,gabbagabbas,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:26:01 2015 UTC,Just contact EA help out whatever it's called and tell them you need the code and they'll give it to you for two.

I picked up a used RB1 at a local gamestop the other day for like 99 cents (US) and then just bought the export key off PSN, and it worked just fine."
Rockband,39ohji,Rizaria,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I did too.  I was just wondering if the key sufficed.

Rockband,39ohji,Rizaria,2,Sat Jun 13 11:52:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, forgot about those.  Too bad I've missed that on sale so far. It'd have to be very cheap though, considering there's only four songs in it I like/want/don't already want but can also be bought separately. So...yeah."
Rockband,39ohji,LumpyArryhead,3,Sat Jun 13 12:33:03 2015 UTC,"RB1 can be done easily with any copy of disc and $5 on psn RB2 can apparently be done by calling and getting a code, and $10 on psn RB3 cannot be exported, yet, at least GDRB can no longer be exported LRB can no longer be exported TBRB cannot be exported, period, and its dlc is not playable in other games. RB Blitz includes all its songs playable in rb3 All track packs should still be exportable The 6 or so harmonix songs from RB2 are available as ""Rock Band Free Pack 1"" The 20 free dlc pack from RB2 codes are no longer valid, and cannot be obtained if you don't already have it    I think that covers everything."
Rockband,39ohji,jcsix,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:31:30 2015 UTC,I managed to export GDRB last week although it was a new copy (PS3). But everything else you have is correct :D
Rockband,39ohji,legendkiller595,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:09:55 2015 UTC,do you know for the track packs is it just buy the game and put it in system or do you have to find codes for those too.
Rockband,39ohji,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"If you mean exporting them, it requires a code from a new copy of it.   I have heard though of some people accidentally getting the ac/dc one for free when they called to try and get an RB2 code."
Rockband,39ohji,bigguy1027,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:23:35 2015 UTC,"Bought RB1 used from Gamestop today for $0.95. Got it home, bought the export key for $5, songs are on my HDD now, no problem.  Also ordered new still-wrapped copies of Rock Band 2 and AC/DC track pack, hopefully the codes with those will still work and I'll be able to export.  Can't export Beatles, still crying about that one... Not a huge fan of Green Day, so no worries on that front. Now all I really need to worry about is watching for Blitz to go on sale so I can grab that and I'll be set :P Thanks to everyone who helped."
Rockband,39ohji,mattd121794,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"I just exported 2 a few hours ago so I can confirm that works. So all you need is a code and $10.   I have an extra PS3 2 export code somewhere, if you don't feel like contacting EA.  Also, a week or two ago, EA live chat got me a few of the track packs too so you can try to get some of those too."

Rockband,39nqy2,OutsideOwl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:59:59 2015 UTC,Can go either way really.    People with 0 dlc  People who leave their fucking mics on the whole time  people who spam 500 songs in a row on the setlist  AFK leader  people who leave when they get stuck with bass  leavers mid song  and then finally you get a group together that manages to 4 band 99% gold songs all day long which makes it worth it.
Rockband,39pcgf,misfit_lenz,13,Sat Jun 13 13:13:39 2015 UTC,"""Rated T for Teen"" sells better. Simple fact of the matter. They aren't looking to alienate any potential buyers grabbing the game for their kids, and even having the language be optional would bump that up to Mature."
Rockband,39pcgf,StefanGagne,-2,Sat Jun 13 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"They can still sell unedited DLC songs, and as long as they have the ""Music Downloads not rated by ESRB"" warning in the game and it will have no bearing on their ESRB rating, like they've done in all the Rock Band games I think. Not going to dig out RB1 to confirm but I know that RB3 has the warning before the intro cinematic."
Rockband,39pcgf,FattyMcPatty,2,Sat Jun 13 17:06:08 2015 UTC,"That would still cut into dlc sales, kids do play the game. Parents who got wind of it probably wouldn't buy the game at all for their kid  Just say the word yourself dude"
Rockband,39pcgf,thewinnerisgeeg,9,Sat Jun 13 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"It's not gonna happen. HMX explicitly confirmed that they wouldn't be lessening the censorship in an interview some time ago. Not even considering that they would have to rate the game M, they actually get more complaints about certain words getting through, than requests to uncensor songs."
Rockband,39pcgf,TylerL320,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:43:14 2015 UTC,"The censorship seems like it's  actually going to be more strict. Little Miss Can't Be Wrong censors ""bitch""."
Rockband,39pcgf,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Sat Jun 13 18:57:20 2015 UTC,"It's really up to the label giving them a radio edit or already censored version of the song and how many explicit thing there are.  For example, Papa Roach - Forever, censors ""heroin"" just like the radio edit. But on Snoop Dogg - Drop It Like It's Hot, they mainly censor curse words and keep innuendo like ""that's whiter than what's spilling down your throat"".  I think it really depends on how much explicit content is in the song, the way it's used, and what the record label gives/wants."
Rockband,39pcgf,TylerL320,2,Sat Jun 13 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"I know sometimes Harmonix censors songs themselves, though. For example, the Pick of Destiny album from Tenacious D has an actual clean version that alters some lyrics, but rather than using it, the version in Rock Band just expels the swear words entirely."
Rockband,39pcgf,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Sun Jun 14 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"There's a good reason for that I think. It would probably be better to have blanks in the lyrics than to have altered lyrics because most fans would know the explicit lyrics and can just fill in the gaps.  I'm Not Okay by My Chemical Romance is the only instance that I can remember where Harmonix got a clean version with altered lyrics (""I'm not oh-fucking-kay"" vs ""I'm really not okay""). And that could have been just what the label gave them."
Rockband,39pcgf,mattd121794,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:02:44 2015 UTC,Still use the explicit version when I sing it in game (also Gerard's Vocals are a pain to replicate and my voice is higher than his...)

Rockband,39pcgf,smacksaw,7,Sat Jun 13 19:12:59 2015 UTC,You could also just sing the bad words instead of staying silent when they're censored.  Don't want mom to hear?

Rockband,39pcgf,10eazye,4,Sat Jun 13 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"A game rated T can't have any files in the game that could make the rating worse (like GTA San Andreas did).  Nor can it have DLC with a higher rating than the base game, so explicit DLC is out of the question (just in case you were thinking about that as a workaround)."
Rockband,39pcgf,valeforXD,2,Sat Jun 13 13:28:41 2015 UTC,isn't downloadable content not rated by esrb? because rocksmith got explicit lyrics on dlc

I could really imagine a Beach Boys game if it were done similar to Beatles RockBand.    Their career paralleled the Beatles in many ways.  A lot of their later stuff was super trippy and avant garde.  A lot of people only know them for their earlier 'surf' music, while that's only really a minority of their catalog."

Rockband,39i33q,Uglyhead,2,Thu Jun 11 21:39:57 2015 UTC,Ftl - [324.16 US Dollars]
Rockband,39i33q,PocoDoco,6,Thu Jun 11 21:55:34 2015 UTC,I'm sure it will be less than that. Just because the dollar is weak to the pound doesn't mean we will pay that many more dollars.  ... but it might be close. I'll say $299 at most
Rockband,39i33q,Uglyhead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:25:24 2015 UTC,Hopefully you're right. This was just an exact conversion (atm); 208.92£ = $324.09.    *edit- forgot about the 20% VAT in Europe.  Recalculated to around $269.
Rockband,39i33q,jordanlolss,7,Thu Jun 11 22:31:19 2015 UTC,$300? Isn't that a bit steep? I could've sworn the RB2 bundle was no more than $200 on launch
Rockband,39i33q,jacktheBOSS,5,Thu Jun 11 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, $300 would be ridiculous since the instruments haven't been significantly upgraded."
Rockband,39i33q,jordanlolss,6,Thu Jun 11 23:22:54 2015 UTC,Not to mention that you could almost buy another console at that price..
Rockband,39i33q,jacktheBOSS,3,Thu Jun 11 23:24:46 2015 UTC,Drum retail ~$100 + guitar ~$50 + mic ~$15 + game ~$60 = $225 - bundling discount = $210. That's my guess.
Rockband,39i33q,KungFuHamster,2,Thu Jun 11 23:30:50 2015 UTC,Probably $209 or $199 so it ends in the magical psychological 9.

Rockband,39i33q,jacktheBOSS,2,Fri Jun 12 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"The guitar bundle is usually $100, so that's only 40 for the guitar assuming 60 for the game. But the game is basically free to produce, so that's $60 that can slide in and out of the cost of the bundles."

Rockband,39is71,StefanGagne,3,Fri Jun 12 01:21:45 2015 UTC,"I've played a few of the Daft Punk customs that have been released. While they're fun, a lot of the songs are extremely repetitive. Random Access Memories probably has the best choices to suit the full band setup, and I suppose we might see some keys parts charted to guitar again now that it's not a separate instrument, so that opens up possibilities for variation there.   I'd say Daft Punk would be a good choice, but they should select only a handful of songs would be fun without grating by the end of them (looking at you, end of ""Get Lucky"")"
Rockband,39is71,evuldave,2,Fri Jun 12 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"I only know them for ""Get Lucky"" but I'd be fine with them in the game. I'd probably just buy that one song though.  I like that Harmonix occasionally tosses us a pop artist. I loved that they added Lady Gaga to the game."

Rockband,39is71,CyHawkWRNL,2,Fri Jun 12 04:50:54 2015 UTC,"Add me to the ""I'd be all for it"" list, but something to remember about the DJ Hero tracks is that they were mixed with other artists' songs (or in the case of the two megamixes, other DP songs) which worked as a way to minimize the repetitiveness of their offerings.   Get Lucky would be the obvious choice, as it tends to be more of a traditionally structured song with verses and a chorus."

Rockband,39hojy,spideyjiri,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:44:28 2015 UTC,"No input solution, using a primarily Xbox controller as the input so devs will target that instead of the Oculus touch controllers, leading to worthless controllers. Also I frankly think the HMD is unattractive. They're continuing to use a camera based solution for tracking for the headset and Oculus touch. And Oculus touch does not currently have an accelerometer, so let's say you swing your virtual sword over your head and it goes out of camera range, it loses all tracking for a brief period of time. So Oculus touch has some issues too.   Just compared to Vive it's disappointing, as Vive gets most of those right (though it's unattractive in its current form as well, Sony's VR is OK but not great) by including their controllers with every purchase so devs will know that users will have them, and using lighthouse to do room tracking. I mostly use the word disappointing because I wanted Oculus to really compete with Vive, but right now I don't see a reason to ever pick up Oculus over Vive."

Then, within the span of a week, I learned about RB4 (which only makes sense for me on XBONE) and No Man's Sky, a PS4 exclusive space exploration game using procedural concepts I've been fascinated by for years, soundtracked by my favorite band whose music makes so much sense in that universe it's incredible.  I'm looking at getting both systems for one game each, and I hate that idea.

I'm much more of a PlayStation person in general, but unfortunately it took me after an investment into Rock Band on the 360 to realize that.

I researched how best to import it, and 360 was the best way to go there. I think I remember something about it being a 360 timed exclusive (perhaps only in Europe, where I had to import) as well.

I just can't justify $100+ on a game, $400 on a console, and $60 a year for PS+ to play one game. I'll be giving up my DLC :("
Rockband,39e463,Jmcglosson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"I guess the silver lining is that you are working off a clean slate. Only rebuying the DLC you really want (if you go down that path) also means that you can cut out the bloat from your collection, like if you bought a pack even though you may not have wanted all the songs, or bought a song because a friend liked it/for a party."

They work on all GH games for wii, and everything for RB past 2. Beatles, Lego, and 3 will play.   Rock band instruments will work on all Band Hero and up (5 should play). I had a lot of damn trial and error. I have the Band Hero instruments, but I think it's because of how the game registers input. GH uses signals off of the controller, and the dongles do their own thing. Eventually Activision and Harmonix made them cross compatible."

Rockband,39aeqv,Kuroashi07,25,Wed Jun 10 12:11:45 2015 UTC,"Firstly, they read the subreddit, they know what we want (and they know that as posters in a RB sub we're a harder-core minority of sales).   The problem with songs is always the same- licensing. Music companies are scum, let us not forget. They still believe that piracy rather than poor service and pricing is the biggest cause of lost sales. Just look at the reason we aren't getting RB4 on PC, HMX tried to downplay it as much as possible because they have to deal with the companies, but the reason there is no RB4 PC is that the dumbass music industry thinks that being able to access the song files on PC will cost them sales of songs. Like anyone capable of installing a game doesn't know about TPB... they don't understand the century we're in, never-mind the decade.   Personally I'd agree with you, I have no problem paying for the songs I want from Lego Rock Band, which might make dealing with the record companies worth it? If HMX were just honest (as they tend to be) and go ""we had to pay again to secure these songs, so we have to pass to cost on to you."" That will be fine. (Oh some people will bitch but some people will bitch about anything).    I'm not hopeful though... licensing is a hard game."
Rockband,39aeqv,Ketomatic,2,Wed Jun 10 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"First, thanks for the info and taking your time to reply.  Second, I expected that it would be some sort of deal like that. But like I said, if HMX would say: ""cannot be done, y'all""... At least I would have some closure."
Rockband,39aeqv,ohsnapitsjf,11,Wed Jun 10 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"But like I said, if HMX would say: ""cannot be done, y'all""... At least I would have some closure.   They also don't want to burn bridges in case it's not quite a 100% chance they can't get those songs back, or other songs through the same channels. Diplomacy is a big part of this game. They've never thrown labels or bands under the bus, any reasoning  about what they could and couldn't get (including pretty much all the GH ""exclusivity"" agreements) has been spun from the message board rumor mills."

Rockband,39ctih,prs33,3,Wed Jun 10 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"They may not all be there on launch day but HMX has said the goal is to have ALL previous DLC carry over into RB4. So, you should be able to buy it on your XBone when the time comes.  If you have any disc exports, though (RB1, RB2, Green Day) export them NOW. The licensing rights are expiring soon. As long as you export them before that happens they'll carry over onto your XBone.  As for on-disc songs from RB3, we don't know yet. Maybe, maybe not. The music industry is stingy about this stuff."
Rockband,39ctih,StefanGagne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:42:01 2015 UTC,"On a slight tangent, does that transfer/rights expiration apply to Green Day? I thought they released all their songs as DLC at some point. I'm not sure if all the songs were released as DLC, but I certainly have some Green Day songs and I never bought GD:RB (and not just the couple of packs they released prior to GD:RB).  I realise you are talking about the full disc export from GD:RB, but it may not be totally lights out if they pull the export ability. Although I assume at this point that, as long as you can find a new copy, unless you genuinely only wanted one or two songs, it would probably be more economical to just grab the disc."
Rockband,39ctih,harveyglobetrot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:03:34 2015 UTC,"Some green day content was released as singles, for folks who didn't wanna buy the game or do the full-game export, yes. But if you have the full disc export and intend to use it, you're going to want to export that ASAP. Don't delay."
Rockband,39ctih,StefanGagne,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, cool - you should definitely export GD:RB ASAP. To be honest, it's best practice to always redeem these codes straight away (even if you don't intend on using them immediately) - you never know when a digital item will be pulled.  At the very least, even if you don't want to download it now, wouldn't you be able to redeem the code and hang off downloading it until later (say when you get RB4). Thinking of people who may not have access to a 360/PS3. I know on 360 you can redeem codes on the Xbox website and add it to a download queue/it will appear in your purchase history so you can get it later."

Rockband,39ctih,zeroomnislash,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:31:26 2015 UTC,"I believe once you purchase Blitz, the tracks are downloaded along with the game for play in Rock Band 3 (please correct me if I'm wrong, I did it a while ago.)

Rockband,3976sf,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Wed Jun 10 06:39:34 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this but I believe the RBN songs will still be available for use in RB4. I wish I could find the source, but I'm pretty sure that's what they said."
Rockband,3976sf,valeforXD,2,Wed Jun 10 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"That's a damn shame, not just for money reasons but also that a lot of damn fine songs were on rbn. Will miss all that remains, mayday parade, a day to remember, the word alive, BtBaM, and especially sunny day real estate (seven was one of my all time favorite drum songs). Countless others too, I hope harmonix makes a strong effort to get these lesser appreciated bands back. Also I'm blue :("

Rockband,3976sf,jonesy827,4,Wed Jun 10 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"No, you can just download them."
Rockband,3976sf,valeforXD,2,Wed Jun 10 05:25:00 2015 UTC,"The transfer is all based on the licenses tied to your account - MS/Sony keep track of all the purchases you made (including the export keys you bought to export RB1/RB2/Lego/GD/track packs), so when you open RB4 on your new console, they'll look at your purchase history and automatically pull all the tracks you are eligible to own from there."

I buy RB4 and move all my songs over, but then go back to rb3 on the 360 and buy more songs. Would those newly purchased songs instantly transfer or is it too late or can i do it again?"
Rockband,3976sf,OutsideOwl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:06:54 2015 UTC,That has not been clarified by HMX yet. They are still working out a lot of kinks.
Rockband,3976sf,mfranko88,6,Thu Jun 11 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"Welp, this basically absolutely confirms my suspicions - old DLC won't be cross-platform. I had 360 for all of my Rock Band gaming since my friends had it, but now most of them have PS4s. I was planning to get it, too, but I've sunk a lot of money into DLC (not to mention hardware and the like).   I don't like it, but I get it."
Rockband,3976sf,schentendo,24,Tue Jun 9 19:32:51 2015 UTC,Suspicion? I was under the impression that it was outright confirmed that DLC would only transfer within console families.
Rockband,3976sf,VinTheRighteous,6,Tue Jun 9 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"From this page, it was pretty vague:   ""Q: Will my old DLC work if I bought a different next gen console, i.e. Xbox 360 -> PS4? A: Cross platform DLC compatibility is not entirely within our control, as DLC ownership is managed by the 1st parties."""
Rockband,3976sf,schentendo,4,Tue Jun 9 21:44:48 2015 UTC,"As i understand it, dlc WILL transfer cross-platform, but only WITHIN the same console family: 360>X1  and PS3>PS4. I think they definetly WON'T transfer from one family to another, as (i asume) neither Microsoft or Sony would allow that. (same goes for using 360 instruments on PS4 or viceseversa)."
Rockband,3976sf,Trainingwales,2,Tue Jun 9 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"This has been a known fact since the day they announced RB4. The specific compatibility of instruments has been in flux, but they've said from day one that cross-platform song import is not happening."
Rockband,3976sf,BeeksElectric,2,Wed Jun 10 06:11:11 2015 UTC,"SO MANY QUESTIONS...and none were answered in the article!  1)  So is it possible to physically download all previous songs onto the XBox One right now?  If so, how do we do that?  And will it take an eternity like it did before?  2)  So we can't play Green Day RB at all in RB4?  3)  We can transport all the old RBN songs to RB4 right?  (they always mention ""the 2000 songs in RB""...which is confusing because there's actually 4000 when you include RBN songs.)  Why are they always ignoring RBN songs, does that mean they aren't included in the discussion?"
Rockband,3976sf,IBitePrettyHard,3,Tue Jun 9 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"1) Not yet. They haven't announced how we'll transfer it, just that we should have it registered to our XBox Live account as a purchase. So, if you already exported, you're fine; whatever software they make to re-download things will take it from there.  2) Sure you can! Just export it like you would normally into RB3.  3) We don't know if RBN songs will carry over. They've said they're looking into it but the priority is on legacy DLC."
Rockband,3976sf,StefanGagne,3,Wed Jun 10 00:01:14 2015 UTC,3) They said they'll try to start converting RBN songs after all the base DLCs are converted. Maybe.
Rockband,3976sf,Dared00,2,Wed Jun 10 08:49:48 2015 UTC,"You can't do anything right now. Unless you previously exported your copy of Green Day RB, you're out of luck. They have yet to make any mention of RBN songs."
Rockband,3976sf,BeeksElectric,2,Wed Jun 10 00:02:28 2015 UTC,"You can still buy all the songs in Green Day Rock Band, you just have to buy them individually from the store and can't use the export code anymore. It's a bummer if you didn't export them, but to be fair, you had five years to do it."
Rockband,3976sf,valeforXD,2,Wed Jun 10 06:19:20 2015 UTC,"If you exported Green Day then you're fine. If not, the albums are still available in the store; it will just cost a bit more."

We are very sorry that your LEGO Rock Band token cannot be redeemed any longer.  The licensee has discontinued the RockBand.com website as part of a restructuring to bring all their games under the HarmonixMusic.com website.  Whilst we can understand this could bring frustration, it is completely beyond our control as a publisher.   We are very sorry that the promotion to export the songs from LEGO Rock Band has ended.  With complicated music ownership rights, these sorts of outcomes can occur. For that reason we would draw your attention to the wording on the product coversheet which does state that the offer to export the songs may be “discontinued without notice at any time”  Apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience.  Thank you,  Paola.M WB Games Support   I'v tried phoning the UK support where people said it was fixed/got a code. I cant even get through using their UK number which is listed as (44) 8708500246."

Rockband,397nk2,Swaggifornia,3,Tue Jun 9 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"Only reason you'd need to buy older titles of the game -not hard to find for cheap, specifically for 360. Been a bit harder for me, of course.- is to export. And only the first game still supports that now. But I see you only own an XBone, so I guess that's a moot point.  DLC however is separate from the discs. So you can buy it whenever and it'll be tied to your account for whenever RB4 comes out.  Anyways, as a test, I went to the marketplace and here http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-AU/Product/Rock-Your-Socks/00000000-0000-400c-80cf-031345410829?cid=search As you can see, you can find them if you search by name. So I'd recommend looking at Wikipedia's big ol' list of RB DLC, find what you want, search and buy it. :P   Hope that helps you."
Rockband,397nk2,Rizaria,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"So I guess then that the on-disc songs are off-limits to me. Thanks though.   But for the DLC in the marketplace, I just buy it and can play it in Rock Band 4 without having to do some other stuff on another Rock Band title?"
Rockband,397nk2,Rizaria,4,Wed Jun 10 01:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sadly. If you have a mate with a 360 though, you can at least get a cheap used copy of RB1, connect your profile on his machine and buy the export key for that. Admittedly...you can buy that export key regardless. So the license would be connected to your account regardless. But Harmonix aren't quite saying yet how disc exports will be brought over. Whether they'll be made downloadable or whether you will need the disc...  Still, food for thought. The export key is only like, 5.99 I think.  As for the DLC, yep, you can just buy it now and not have to do anything to make it work with RB4. They've guaranteed that. So feel free to start stocking up as soon as you'd like/can afford to."

It's a fun pop song that's has both vocal styles, memorable riffs, and is catchy as hell in general.  As for your Kanye suggestion, I always thought Power would be a cool song to play. Not only is it a great tune but it's really well-known and a lot of people who normally don't like the dude enjoy it.   Kendrick's i (the single version, of course.) seems like it would be fantastic. Probably would be very hard on expert vocals, but it's got that funky Isley Bros guitar and killer basslines courtesy of Thundercat. Not too vulgar either, which is almost always a plus with non-rap fans."

Most hip hop doesn't have guitar in it so they would have to put guitar on synth, or record a guitar track like they did for the snoop dogg tracks"

I killed mi RB1 drum kit in a bit more than a year, even though I used silencers which not only reduce the sound but also protect the pads. The RB Beatles' drum kit was better but still not quite up to the task. However I never used the bundled drum sticks, I used some light Vic Firth (7AN or similar) or Promark, which still are heavier than the bundled ones. That being said I don't hit the pads as I would on an acoustic drum kit, I can modulate the force I use when hitting them.  However I have a PS3 and no plans to get the PS4...

I'm absolutely aware of the issues, and the fact that (especially those of you with the Ion kit) people have dropped significant cash into peripherals that they use to play our games. You guys are awesome, we love you, we want your business, and we still don't know what the status of the wired controllers are going to be.  But I promise that you have people on the development team (more than just me) who are aware of the issue and constantly pushing it on the agenda."
Rockband,38twxb,nordee,6,Sat Jun 6 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks.    I don't know what needs to be done to make them work, hardware, software or both.  And I've heard Microsoft is for some reason reluctant help on their end.  If the wireless dongles for the Xbox One are still in the design phase, I'm thinking the easiest solution would be to engineer the wireless dongle to also have a USB input for legacy wired instruments.  I'm sure somebody has already thought of this, but it can't hurt to mention it.   people have dropped significant cash into peripherals that they use to play our games.   Yes, but the return on investment has made it well worth it.  I've spent somewhere around $2000 on the game over the years, but I've gotten so much out of it.  I've played the game for probably about 2000 hours and had fun for every minute of it.  If it weren't for RockBand, I probably wouldn't own a real drum set or be taking drum lessons every week.  I might not be in a real band, but I'm writing and recording music all by myself.  When my drum teacher started showing me how to read musical notation, it was so easy.  It's basically a RockBand note chart laid out sideways.    Thank you and everyone at Harmonix.  RockBand has significantly changed my life for the better."
Rockband,38twxb,nordee,3,Sat Jun 6 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"Hey sorry for the late response.   It's so cool that you got into music and are playing drums. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. It's not that Microsoft is reluctant. Not at all. It's just that their controller security/compatibility system is more complicated and more hardware based than Sony's.  It's hardware, software, AND policy that we haved to work through. And to be brutally honest, we also have to balance this work against everything else that we're doing. As noted elsewhere in this thread there are not really so many wired controllers still around, and the absolute number of Ion kits and people who play MIDI drums via the converter box is (relative to the number of stock console drum/guitar controllers) pretty small.    So, yeah, I wish I could tell you anything concrete. It's still on our TODO list, along with a billion other things that we need to do to ship the game."
Rockband,38twxb,Starslip,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I found this post. My friends and I recently got back into Rock Band and we've been enjoying it a lot, and are looking forward to RB4. My roommate just purchased an Ion drum kit to play with, and everything I'd been reading only mentioned wireless controllers carrying over. So I'm glad to hear the issue is at least on the radar even if no concrete solutions have been found yet.   It's not that Microsoft is reluctant. Not at all. It's just that their controller security/compatibility system is more complicated and more hardware based than Sony's.    I'm wondering, does this mean that wired instruments might be slightly more likely to be doable for the PS4 than the Xbox One? Fingers crossed."
Rockband,38twxb,crumbete,3,Wed Jul 8 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Wait, are wired instruments not on the radar currently?

Rockband,38twxb,NemoEsq,2,Sat Jun 6 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I never got to play with them long enough to be a good enough player to notice their technical shortcomings. But 1) no cymbals and 2) hard plastic surfaces are hard on the hands AND make ridiculous amounts of noise. With the money you'd probably spend on modifications, you can find a used RB2 or TBRB drumset on Craigslist or the likes and be in a much better situation. I mean, if you're broke and can't afford one, fine, I understand - but then that's your reason. Don't justify playing with RB1 drums as if it was a superior device when it clearly isn't and getting a replacement for years wasn't expensive, and now can be had for relatively decent prices on thrift stores and second hand sales."
Rockband,38twxb,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"You're right about them not being better than newer kits.

Rockband,38twxb,espher,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"Also, if you haven't played the original set long enough to notice any technical shortcomings then why are you so insistent that it's awful?   Can be inferred from ~8 years of reports and ~7 years of RB2/RB3 drums, frankly. The RB1 set definitely has some major flaws, noise being in the Top 3 if not #1.   It's also pretty easy to go look at comparison or play one set for an hour after playing the other for far longer and tell what the difference is. You won't get all the nuance but you can definitely tell when something is off, much like you can tell the difference in feel/buttons between RB1 and RB2 guitars within five minutes of picking them up, or tell when someone has a bunk pad/cymbal within a song, or when a controller has a stick with a bad dead zone."

These are people who'll drop $200 easy on a mechanical keyboard and programmable mouse.   If you can't make wired stuff for console, fine. Make it for PC.

Rockband,38x16g,b4mv,5,Sun Jun 7 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"True but since a dev posted as well to say effectively the same thing- they know about it, it is on the agenda but it is not currently very high on the agenda. Added with the things that are more important to sell a lot of copies- most RB players did not splash out on ions or ekits, it's fairly unlikely to come by launch.   I'd love to see some sales stats for IONs + midipros vs total sales of even just RB3, would make very interesting reading! I won't be buying my next gen console to play RB4 until the midipro situation is dealt with (unless they release a limited edition RB PS4, then... well I am human...)

This thread has been made multiple times this week (mostly better received because they weren't as obnoxious about it), including one yesterday that a developer personally posted in with as current information as there is. They're trying. If they can't, it's not because they don't think their customers want it. They're dealing with roadblocks by companies who have way less vested interest in getting them working.   Honestly, you're probably more mad than most because you already bought the console, and you probably shouldn't have yet. ANY instrument back-compatibility was tentative until THIS week. I get frustration, but being a dick about it isn't going to help any.

But we've got this basically identical post from yesterday, except without the dangling threat of buying used out of spite, and a HMX employee giving you direct assurance that you're not being ignored.   I'd also assume that there's quite a few HMX employees who are going to be just as frustrated at having to scale back down to the standard drumkit. They're probably working on it on a completely selfish level, in addition to wanting to appease customers.  Just let it play out.

You get to keep your 1119 songs. Stop being a child and be thankful they are going to these lengths to let you keep what you have."
Rockband,38x16g,krystof_kage,-2,Sun Jun 7 16:46:31 2015 UTC,Can't please everyone...  These entitled gamers can never be pleased.
Rockband,38x16g,hardangelfan,4,Sun Jun 7 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"Between 1119 songs, an ion set, backing of amplitude, rb1/2/3/L/Be/G/Bl...    We're talking near $3000. I think this particular person is in a position to feel at least somewhat entitled."
Rockband,38x16g,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"To what? If a piece of equipment is impossible to get working on new technology, what are they entitled to? Overly high expectations?  I own a squier, mustang, keyboard, midi adaptor, and Ion set. By that logic, Harmonix really owes me special treatment. Except you know, I'm fully aware they have been TRYING and I'm not being an ass about it."
Rockband,38x16g,ohsnapitsjf,0,Sun Jun 7 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"Ummm... No. Unless harmonix promised if you buy our songs we will make sure it works for new gen consoled. If you buy IONs we will make sure they will work for new generations of consoles. Unless they actually said that... OP has no reason to bitch. It was HIS choice to buy IONs, not harmonix. Ppl just don't get that is extremely difficult to get old type of equipment to fully function with newer technology."
Rockband,38x16g,LumpyArryhead,3,Sun Jun 7 22:44:25 2015 UTC,"That's because it's really not that hard, unless you've made your shit proprietary in the first place, which is inexcusable money-grubbing in this day and age.    They literally got it so that anything MIDI would work with the old system, if they're not doing so now it's an issue of them not being willing to spend the money to get it done, which people that spend $3k on their video game have pretty legitimate room to criticize them for."
Rockband,38x16g,hardangelfan,-1,Sun Jun 7 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"Wow. There's... There's a lot here.   That's because it's really not that hard   lol   unless you've made your shit proprietary in the first place   In conformity with the consoles' regulations, I'm sure they did.   which is inexcusable money-grubbing in this day and age.   You're right, MS and Sony should have allowed controllers to be forward-compatible.   They literally got it so that anything MIDI would work with the old system   Different consoles using new technology they have to work out? nah, just c+p that code bro   if they're not doing so now it's an issue of them not being willing to spend the money to get it done,    Or being stonewalled by console makers or not having the manpower as an indie to accomplish it pre-release or   which people that spend $3k on their video game have pretty legitimate room to ...   Be upset about? Absolutely. Not buy the new version over? Of course. Accuse them of being money-grubbing and lazy for? Nope. That's where you get shut down here."
Rockband,38x16g,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"lol     If it's so hard, why did they not have this trouble with the last consoles?     In conformity with the consoles' regulations, I'm sure they did.     Seeing how you can get pc's to read them, with various software, I'm gonna go with no, they didn't.     You're right, MS and Sony should have allowed controllers to be forward-compatible.     Last word I heard was that they are. It seems to just be the midi adapter that's an issue.     Different consoles using new technology they have to work out? nah, just c+p that code bro     Yeah, I mean, obviously they don't have experience making them work with different consoles. I had almost forgotten how 360 and PS3 were the exact same systems with the exact same hardware and software.     Or being stonewalled by console makers or not having the manpower as an indie to accomplish it pre-release or     They're clearly not being stonewalled by console makers or they would have said so and that would have been end of story.    ""Not having the manpower"" is as literal an example you could possibly make of not being willing to spend the money. If you honestly think that's some kind of counterpoint...     Be upset about? Absolutely. Not buy the new version over? Of course. Accuse them of being money-grubbing and lazy for? Nope. That's where you get shut down here.     Making your shit proprietary is money grubbing. It's fucking definitive. There is zero reason to make shit proprietary aside from attempting to ensure you're the only company that can profit from it.    Lazy? Really? ""there's a lot here"" and you still have to straight up make shit up to put words in my mouth in order to insult me? Yeah that sums it up pretty well."

Rockband,38q7pi,Thrasher9294,11,Fri Jun 5 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"I totally know what you mean.  If this were 2010 and all of the instruments were on clearance on Amazon, I'd let my friends play whatever they want.  But new instruments are really hard to come by, and that's only if you don't care how much they cost.  The guitars I use when I play alone are the real wood Strat replica or the stock wireless strat.  When friends come over, I put those in the closet and bring out my RB1 wired strat and my GH3 wireless Les Paul.  The wood strat is my baby, and my wireless RB2 guitar works perfectly and hardly has a scratch on it.  It would be impossible to replace the wood one, and it would be super expensive to find a new RB2 guitar and I wouldn't want to gamble buying a used one on ebay.  For drums, I have a nice Roland e-kit that I let my friends use.  It's super durable, so I don't really have to worry about people hitting it too hard.  Also, I had to throw out my RB1 and RB2 drum kits after friends hit them too hard and broke pads.  Haha, I'd be more reluctant to let a friend use a stock Rockband drum set than to use my $2000 electric drum set!"
Rockband,38q7pi,kerminsr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"Are all of them plastic/rubber or are any of them mesh? I've got the mesh snare that I worry about durability sometimes, but don't care about beating the crap out of the rubber pads."
Rockband,38q7pi,Trues17,2,Sat Jun 6 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"They're all mesh.  I started out adding a Roland brain to an ion kit, slowly upgrading over time.  The snare and floor tom (green pad) are 10"" and the two rack toms (yellow and blue pad) are 8"".    I'm honestly not worried about a friend breaking them.  They're made to take a lot of abuse.  Haha the only thing I'd worry about breaking is the one cymbal I still have from the ion kit, it's so flimsy compared to the other ones."

Rockband,38q7pi,Forge_Goreman,2,Sat Jun 6 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"When it happened to the RB1 drums, it was fine because RB2 had just come out.  I was pissed when they broke my RB2 drums.  I had played with them for over a year without incident, and my friend comes over and brakes the yellow pad HALFWAY THROUGH THE FIRST SONG!  Like if you weren't deliberately trying to brake it then I'll eat my shoe.  It worked out in the end.  It made me get off the fence about buying an ion kit, which let to me getting my electric kit.  So maybe they did me a favor, but it didn't feel like it at the time."
Rockband,38q7pi,kerminsr,3,Sat Jun 6 15:06:35 2015 UTC,Wow. That's nuts. I have a friend who is an actual drummer and he can only use my electronic set or else he'd destroy the stock sets. I would have been so upset. If mine were broke by someone other than me.
Rockband,38q7pi,Forge_Goreman,2,Sat Jun 6 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"Actually my friend who broke the RB2 set has been a drummer for over 10 years.  He has one of the nicest Roland e-kits you can buy.   He's the kind of drummer that gets really into it and hits really hard.   I wasn't too worried when I let him play; I thought that I hit the drums hard.  I figured he'd know to take it easy on what's essentially a toy.  I mean you can tell after a couple of hits that it's not as sturdy as a legit kit.  I'm glad it happened when it did, though.  Ion kits were available on Amazon prime, I was making really good money at the time and could easily afford it, also companies were still making the adapters that let you add a real kick pedal to the set.  If I had to get one now, it would cost a ton, and I wouldn't be able to use a real kick pedal with it because they stopped producing the parts and you can't find them on ebay."
Rockband,38q7pi,kerminsr,4,Sat Jun 6 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"I don't care, really. But maybe because I have 18 guitars, 3 drum sets, 2 keyboards, etc."

Rockband,38q7pi,OutsideOwl,4,Sun Jun 7 01:35:50 2015 UTC,I have guest guitars that barely work for this exact situation. It makes me cringe when a friend is SLAMMING on the strum bar.  You want to use the guitar hero 6 axe? Here's the gh4 sunburst.
Rockband,38q7pi,Forge_Goreman,2,Sat Jun 6 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus, seriously.   It's like their thought process is ""I'm missing notes. Maybe the game doesn't realize I'm strumming. Maybe if I slam the strum bar through the body of the guitar, it'll work better! I'll beat this game into submission!""  That, and the people who hit a sustain, then physically grab the whammy bar (like take their whole hand off of the strum bar to grab the whammy bar) and yank it up and down.  There's a reason one of the guitars I still have double strums and such while the other works perfectly."
Rockband,38q7pi,JustLookWhoItIs,2,Sun Jun 7 19:32:23 2015 UTC,Haha. People always play as hard as they can when using the whammy. I've had friends who used it so fast and violently as if they were going to ejaculate at the end of the sustain.
Rockband,38q7pi,Forge_Goreman,4,Sun Jun 7 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"For me, the point of getting improved equipment is to make my RB parties better, so they're definitely getting pulled out and played. However, other than my DM6 drum kit, it's all stock RB stuff. If I had one of the nice wooden guitars or a pro bass...well, I wouldn't hide them in the closet, but if someone started getting drunk or rowdy I might strongly suggest they put the guitar down and step outside to clear their head.  I mean, I do have the Pro Squier. That doesn't get pulled out much, but if it does, I'll usually give a 45 second explanation on how to use it and how not to damage it."

Until recently I had any big issues, though I did retire a drum set, some cymbals, and guitar after a few years of use. But then I made the mistake of leaving my cymbals attached at a con back in February. Some jerkasses were so rough on the drums that two of the cymbals had pieces chipped off and the frame of the drumset where the red pad attaches got cracked. Now the cymbals are permanently attached to my Beatles drums that never leave my apartment.   I also recently got a wooden Strat replica (at the thrift store of all places) and it goes with me to cons, but I have a giant label on it saying ""NOT FOR ATTENDEE USE"" and I personally loan it out only to people I trust."

It was only there for testing the infrastructure of the RBN. It was never listed in the in-game store, and it was never listed in the marketplace either.

Rockband,38pguw,vespa59,4,Fri Jun 5 19:09:19 2015 UTC,All players playing together must own a song to play it together.
Rockband,38pguw,ModestMusician,-1,Fri Jun 5 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"Ultimately this is a shame.  The library gimping due to different DLC is literally the worst part of online play. Playing with random groups is fun, but not when you're effectively limited to the disc songs."
Rockband,38pguw,vsTerminus,3,Sat Jun 6 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"Can you play COD DLC with your friend if your friend only has the base COD game? No. It's the same with every game - when the DLC is paid, everyone has to buy it, or the dev loses money. If only you needed to buy it, and all your friends playing with you didn't have to pay, then that's 3 sales lost for every one they make because you and your friends don't want to pay them for each piece of DLC."
Rockband,38pguw,NemoEsq,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"You're not entirely correct. Quite frequently your example about maps does not drive 3 more sales, it just creates a divide in the group because one guy wants to play the new maps but his friends won't pay up so they either stop playing together or at all.  Arma 3, for example, allows everyone to use the new DLC content for free whether they buy it or not - at least in a limited capacity.  The helicopter DLC released new helicopters that anyone could ride in, but could only be flown by people who bought the dlc. Anyone could spawn themselves as the pilot in a private game though.  Allowing players to play songs they don't own while online might mean some lost sales from those who always play with friends, but in the end I find that those people probably purchased very few, if any, songs anyways.  You have to ask: What is the primary goal? To make the online experience just as good as the local one? Or is it to ensure at any cost that nobody plays something they didn't pay for?  If I get four friends together in my house, none of them need to own the dlc, the game, or even the console. But if I want to play with those same people online they all need their own copies of it all, and that probably hampers the experience and leaves people feeling disappointed more than it drives dlc sales.  I know, everyone is going to call me entitled and say that I just want things for free. That couldn't be further from the truth. I just want to be able to play the content that I paid for, no matter who else is joining me."
Rockband,38pguw,vsTerminus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"But that's not how it works. In the context of RB, DLC is the main line of income for Harmonix. In your mind, these people who aren't buying the DLC because they no longer have to, wouldn't. But this has been discussed on the HMX forums in the past, and in my mind and in the minds of many others, this would lead to ""groups"" being created to maximize gain vs expenditures - why would you and your friends buy 200 songs each (200x4x$2=$1600) when you can pool your money together and buy either 200 songs at 1/4 the cost($400), or buy 800 songs with the same $1600? That is more likely what would happen, and you're being naive if you think otherwise. You are, of course, entitled to play with the content you paid for. But you paid for that content under a license, and that license limits your use to very specific scenarios."
Rockband,38pguw,NemoEsq,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree about the groups thing.  It will happen for sure.  My argument is that the current practice still does more harm than good, and the benefits of allowing people to play songs they don't own in a limited online capacity* is worth it, even with the existence of those dlc groups.  * Let people play the song with a friend who owns it, but not appear on the leaderboard or get an individual score beyond the number of stars. Or something like that. In many cases, being allowed to play songs you don't own will only make you want to buy them that much more so you can play them any time.  Edit: Why buy 200 songs each at all? Everyone has different tastes and few people want to buy a song they hate just so they can appease their friends. I won't buy country music no matter hoe many friends ask me to because I hate that style of music. So it's not necessarily a lost sale; in many cases it's exactly the same number of sales, but with a better player experience when DLC restrictions don't decimate your online library."

Still, it can be done, but how much effort they'll put into that is to be seen."

I would pay 200-300 for a 3 light and fog machine system synced to the music. I've tried the PC method and while it's OK, its not even close to having it hooked up with Rock Band; so much so that people at the party noticed the difference. Parties without the lights are very bland. If they want to be the ultimate party game, then don't cut stage kit support off."
Rockband,38ks7v,MACST3R,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:58:35 2015 UTC,Bud for that price I know you can get DJ lighting that is sound sensitive and probably better suited for parties than a Rock Band peripheral.

Rockband,38iz2q,FattyMcPatty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:22:44 2015 UTC,"Well I didn't mean to offend anyone or anything, it's just that most games that you play online are more interactive. Players acutally have to play with each other instead of, you know, at the same time as each other like in Rock Band. Other games also have voice chat and stuff. Did Rock Band have that? It might have, I honestly have no clue because I only went on like twice.   If you like playing it online, that's cool too. I don't personally know anyone who plays it online though."

If I want to actually get any of the high scores, gold star the song, or actually play competitively, then I need to play online. I've played before and hit 1,000,000 halfway through, gold stars 3/4, then get going up, I was flipping out while my girlfriend just laughed at me. But I never had as much with the game as I did when I was with a full band all on expert. It's just not the same for me. If there isn't any online, then I'm sadly probably not going to get it.

We're still working through those details, but that sort of asynchronous multiplayer set-up is very compelling, and we know that people do want it, but it's very expensive. We're weighing that feature up against some of the other stuff that we're doing. One of the interesting things about our strategy here is that, just because some feature isn't there at launch, doesn't mean it won't be later on. We're going to respond to people telling us what they want. When players wish they could do things that they can't, we're going to be a virtual phone call away.    That's not a yes or no."

He sent me a message telling me to go fuck myself, only a little more creative than that. It was my first experience playing online with anybody. As such, I prefer to receive verbal abuse from real world friends.  Having said that, that's just my experience, and I realize a lot of people do still play online, so I guess it would be missed.

Rockband,38ijdu,BloodBend,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:18:25 2015 UTC,"I looked this up, not because I want to gameshare but because I switched to a different PS4 account name than my PS3 uses.  My PS3 has all my DLC of course.  So, without condoning gamesharing or anything, this is how you would get your PS4 to have your PS3 songs if you switched accounts like I did.  As I understand it, when you put an account on the PS4 it asks you whether or not this is the Primary PS4 for this account.  Since I am the owner of both accounts, I have selected yes for both of my accounts.    You can play any DLC on any account on the PS4 so long as the account that has the DLC has designated that PS4 as its primary device.  I know that's a confusing sentence.  Let me break it down like this:  Account X has the PS4 listed as primary, Account Y does not.  If I logged in to Account Y, I could play DLC from both accounts.  If I logged in to Account X, I could ONLY PLAY the DLC from Account X.  So the way people were theorizing that it could work is that, say for example you and your brother both had a PS4 in the same house.  You would set your account as Primary on his PS4 and he would set his account as Primary on YOUR PS4.  Then you'd log in to the correct accounts on the correct PS4s and you'd both be able to use DLC from each account.  Disclaimer:  This is as I understand it from reading multiple sources.  I have not put this into action as I cannot download RB songs on my PS4 yet."

I wouldn't have a problem with an opinion piece where the author goes on about how they don't like rhythm games, or how silly he thinks they are.  This author, however, went completely overboard trying to sound superior to it all.  I don't like real-time strategy games.  I just don't think they're fun.  But if some journo went to a LAN party where they're playing Starcraft or whatever, and then wrote an article about how stupid everyone was and how smart he thinks he is compared to the people playing the game, and how talking about politics in the Philippines is sooo much more interesting than playing a stupid game....

Rockband,38eudh,cloud3514,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"It's pretty interesting to hear that an experienced guitarist had trouble with the pro guitar. I guess if you're not used to playing a MIDI guitar, it would be pretty significantly different."
Rockband,38eudh,cloud3514,3,Thu Jun 4 03:47:22 2015 UTC,It's the feel of the buttons I guess. I can easily slide my fingers across on a normal guitar but the pro mustang doesn't... connect in the same way. Also the strings are hard to understand which one I'm picking. I still enjoy it though. I have to concentrate real hard.
Rockband,38dgo7,slipknutz,10,Wed Jun 3 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat. For the most part, my purchase of RB4 is hinged on two things: my e-drum kit needs to work, and the game needs to not look like crap."
Rockband,38dgo7,thewinnerisgeeg,4,Wed Jun 3 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"My purchase of the game depends on being able to use the MIDI-pro adapter, which I'm pretty sure communicates with the console the same way the ion kit does.  Harmonix won't lose me as a fan if they don't support it day one.  However, if they don't support it day one, I doubt they'll ever support it.  But then I hope that they at least make a new pro drum adapter for the Xbone.  I'm in the same boat as you, though.  I dabble with guitar and vocals, pretty much just to get achievements and complete the game.  I spend 99% of my time on the drums, and that's been at least 1000 hours since RB1 came out.  I'm still holding on to the hope that they will do what they can to make our preferred instruments work."
Rockband,38dgo7,kerminsr,2,Wed Jun 3 16:52:29 2015 UTC,Why would you doubt support just because it isn't out day one? Do you not trust hmx to add support asap after release? They've stated already they plan on improving the game as long as they can after release :I
Rockband,38dgo7,FattyMcPatty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"I should clarify that if it isn't supported on day one, and they haven't announced definitively that they intend to support it, then it will probably never happen.  I feel like the more time goes by, the less likely it is that they will start to support old peripherals.  Perfect scenario for me: they support the ion and the MPA on day one, with plans announced to sell an Xbone MPA and plans for ion to build an xbone kit.  As much as I hope they support my existing MIDI-pro adapter, I'm really hoping they'll make a new MPA for the Xbox One.  A controller that works natively with the console will always be better than one that has to have some kind of workaround for it to function.  So I meant that if they don't support the drums, that means they'll most likely be planning on making new peripherals that they plan on selling.  The fact that Mad Catz is co-publishing RB4 is actually really good news.  They are the people who make the controllers, but they now have more of a reason to make more peripherals to sell as many games as possible since they're getting a slice of that profit as well."
Rockband,38dgo7,kerminsr,8,Thu Jun 4 03:17:09 2015 UTC,"Here's the only issue I've got with your rant:   HMX, you need to support the ION drums on day 1, or you will lose me as a fan.    They're being very upfront about this being a work in progress, even after release. They're being very upfront about wanting to support ""as many legacy instruments as possible."" They're focusing much more heavily on appealing to current fans than gaining new ones, at least so far.   If they don't get YOUR use-case taken care of by day 1, it will continue to be worked on. It will not have been out of neglect. There are an unprecedented number of third-party manufacturers to deal with to collaborate with to do something that NO other company has dared try in getting controllers to be forward-compatible, which both console companies have taken huge lengths to NOT allow until now. To threaten your loyalty because ION didn't play nice, or Microsoft didn't allow access to those drivers, or whatever the case ends up being, is not quite fair.   Feel free to not buy until your drums are supported, that's not what I'm saying. But know that they already know you exist, and getting on a soapbox and giving them another deadline is petty, knowing their intentions and limitations."
Rockband,38dgo7,ohsnapitsjf,6,Wed Jun 3 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, point taken. I should and will remove that line from my post. I will still buy it, and I assume support will be included eventually.   My point is I would really like to have it available day 1. And I assume other ION kit users would too. And HMX might not realize that we need that support day 1. This is just trying to get their attention to make this a priority.   I could see how you are taking this as me being petty. It was more tongue in cheek. But, I could see how it would be taken the other way. You really think I would give up 1,600 songs? Ha, ha, ha, no."
Rockband,38dgo7,10eazye,2,Wed Jun 3 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"They stated that they'll try to support as many controllers as possible. ION could be the last instrument to be supported, if they get to it. tweet rock band."
Rockband,38dgo7,MonorailBlack,2,Wed Jun 3 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"I hope it supports the Ion kit,  too. Only issue is my Xbox connector cable is fried,  and may not work anyway."
Rockband,38dgo7,FattyMcPatty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"I'm all for support but I think it's a bit harsh to expect hmx have everything compatible day 1.   They already jumped through hoops getting the dlc compatible, as well as legacy instruments. They're an indie company putting in triple a effort to bring back a game that may as well have never come back.   Did we all miss the part where hmx will continuously update and improve this game post release??"

Rockband,38dgo7,pagit85,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"I am not sure I understand you correctly. I know in GH Metallica, they introduced double bass pedals for the drums.   But...I have been using two drum pedals for my ION kit for as long as I can remember. It comes with a splitter (or you might have to buy one), and it allows double kick pedals. I love it. It works in RB3, I haven't tried RB2, but I am sure it would work there too, because it literally is just split.   Hope that helps!"
Rockband,38eg0h,Blenke312,5,Wed Jun 3 17:55:20 2015 UTC,i think they should at least put LRB for sale in the Rock Band store like Green Day RB.
Rockband,38eg0h,Yahoo_Wahoo,2,Wed Jun 3 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"I'd just love if they put Rock Band 1, 2, and 3 too whenever 4 comes around.  I imagine a number of people are probably be going to have Rock Band 4 as their first. Just letting people getting caught up on the old songs is a good deal."

Rockband,38eg0h,sniffsnaff,2,Wed Jun 3 22:11:19 2015 UTC,They have valid export codes here in the UK still as of a fortnight ago. Sorry that doesn't help you :( but hopefully someone will see this and be spurred on to sort it out!  Anyone who wants the LRB export in the USA should contact Warner regardless of whether they own the game yet and request that they get more export codes so it can be sorted. It can't be that much effort so if demand is high enough it will probably get somewhere eventually.

Rockband,38empk,StefanGagne,4,Wed Jun 3 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"Relevant new information:  Tour mode has a number of endings; it's possibly not an endless mode like RB2's tour mode. Your bandmates can contribute to the decisions and choices made, but the tour is also friendly to solo players. Tour CANNOT be played online.  ""Asynchronous multiplayer is an idea we've put a lot of thought into but I can neither confirm nor deny anything."" (Why specifically asynchronous? That's basically just leaderboards, right? Synchronous is band play.)  Old wired instruments are NOT SUPPORTED, only wireless instruments. If this isn't a mistake, it's potentially huge, since a lot of old GH controllers are wired."

Rockband,38empk,chexmixho,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:45:40 2015 UTC,"The hosts said that, not an HMX guy, so it's second-hand information. It could be they misunderstood, but the way it was phrased is that WIRELESS instruments will work (with new dongles for 360/XBone) but WIRED instruments will not."
Rockband,38empk,kerminsr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:13:21 2015 UTC,Interesting news about the confirmation of wired instruments not supported.  I know that when Harmonix sent out the survey(s) that they said the majority of the people that responded had wireless instruments so it makes sense they are going to concentrate on those to give the biggest amount of users instrument compatibility.
Rockband,38empk,Yahoo_Wahoo,2,Wed Jun 3 21:04:42 2015 UTC,"It is a bit odd though, because a wired instrument requires no dongles and no specific broadcast hardware. It's just a USB device. Shouldn't it be EASIER to support?  But, Sony and MS have always been dodgy about flexibility in controller standards, so... who knows."
Rockband,38h1oe,kerminsr,2,Thu Jun 4 03:56:11 2015 UTC,Looks good. I'd think they'd look like the PlayStation existing dongles though.
Rockband,38h1oe,_johnning,2,Thu Jun 4 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"It was more of an idea of how I hope the dongles will work.    HMX has said existing wireless instruments will work with a dongle, but all of us drummers with ion kits or the MIDI-pro adapter have wired kits and HMX hasn't clarified whether or not wired instruments will work.  I was thinking that the easiest way to make old wired instruments work, especially since they're definitely making a wireless dongle, is to make the wireless dongle have a USB input for wired instruments.  That way they don't have to patch the Xbone or PS4 firmware, they can just plug into the adapter that talks to the console."
Rockband,38h1oe,thewinnerisgeeg,2,Thu Jun 4 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"This is perfect tbh. I would gladly pay 20, even $30 for this."

Rockband,38d2rh,madcowga,12,Wed Jun 3 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"The salient points...  A lot of discussion about GHL vs. RB4. Harmonix felt the core gameplay was good enough to build on without needing to change everything for the sake of changing it.  Harmonix already has a timeline of work ahead of them for post-launch features to add to the game. Good to hear.  No immediate plans for Morpheus VR, just the standard ""We're excited to see where it goes"" line.  The crowd will remember what songs you're ""famous"" for and will request you play them again."

The skips you're talking about happen about every 5 songs, but even worse, sometimes the system will just restart completely in the middle of a game.  We learned this the hardest way, as we had devoted an entire Saturday to beating the Endless Setlist III - We were halfway through ""The Beautiful People"" by Marylyn Manson (55 songs through) when the system crashed, ruining our entire progress. It was devastating and I'll probably upgrade to an older PS3 (or a PS4...)."
Rockband,38eohb,MmmmmKittens,3,Wed Jun 3 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"The restarts to the XMB aren't a slim PS3 issue, it's a Rock Band 3 on PS3 issue.

That kind of defeats the purpose of buying a new ""affordable"" ps3, though."
Rockband,38eohb,-xe,5,Wed Jun 3 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"replacing the ps3 hdd is really easy. Sony allows it, so IDK why you think you'd be voiding the warranty. Also there's a backup feature.   Someone gave you a reasonable solution to your problem and your complaining about it."
Rockband,38eohb,10eazye,-10,Wed Jun 3 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"Your definition of ""reasonable"" varies from mine.    Having to take apart a fucking playstation and replace parts of it for it to work properly brand new off the shelf is not reasonable, it's utterly ridiculous. The purpose of gaming consoles is exactly the opposite of what you're suggesting."
Rockband,38eohb,10eazye,7,Wed Jun 3 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"You really don't ""take it apart"". There's a little hatch on the side of the console and the hard drive just slides in/out on a tray. I'm not saying you should have to do this, the poor performance of the included drive is pretty pathetic, but it also couldn't be much easier to replace if you want to fix the problem.  Sony even has an official guide on their site."

Definitely not trying to save other people the same trouble when it would be cheaper and more effective to buy a used or a 4g and put in a ssd.

The default assumption for people is that when someone posts about a problem, they may want suggestions or help resolving that problem, so I don't know why you're being a snide prick about it. If you just wanted to bitch about it, edit that into your OP and save people the time.  Don't get me wrong - it's good to have the PSA, but it would have been far easier to reply and say ""I'm not looking to spend more cash to fix something that should work out of the box, but thanks for the information"" than to be a sarcastic dick to people giving you that entirely valid and correct information.

Rockband,38eohb,10eazye,2,Thu Jun 4 03:18:22 2015 UTC,"I hope this was cathartic for you.  In any event, ""just getting that out there"" serves its role as the PSA, as I mentioned, but doesn't indicate you're not looking for solutions with it, which is why I suggested replying to the person replying to you. Pointing out that a new hard drive would resolve the issue is valid information, tone aside, and you didn't have to respond to a shitpost with a shitpost.

Rockband,38azj0,wwwes32,4,Wed Jun 3 01:16:54 2015 UTC,Not too surprising given that harmonic is operating as an indie now. This isn't a multimillion dollar effort anymore. But if it sells well enough they can have the time and funding to add it -- the game is going to have ongoing development this time.
Rockband,38azj0,StefanGagne,2,Wed Jun 3 02:09:50 2015 UTC,How many people do you think they have working for them?  Assuming 20 people @ $50k salary for one year = $1 million... and that's just salaries.  It's a multimillion dollar effort.
Rockband,38azj0,KungFuHamster,3,Wed Jun 3 11:03:35 2015 UTC,"Obviously I don't have an inside line into Harmonix's budgets and I'm not a game dev. But I think the overall point stands -- they don't have a juggernaut like EA in their corner and they're a small studio. Online play is a major feature, expensive as hell due to the need for ongoing servers, and I can understand why it's off the table.  My hope is that their declaration that this will be an ongoing service more than a one-and-done retail SKU drop pays dividents. Multiple title updates, new features, new stuff added all the time... including online play. I certainly WANT online play."
Rockband,38azj0,StefanGagne,4,Wed Jun 3 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was kind of pedantic of me to nitpick on that point. I knew what you meant, sorry."

Rockband,38azj0,mike_gainor,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"I tried online play once. Even knowing the people, it was awkward. Big gaps in their play list, no feedback on what they were doing. It's weird."
Rockband,38azj0,KungFuHamster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:06:23 2015 UTC,"Online play with randos and no voice chat was actually possible back in the RB2 era. Less DLC released so more chances of having it in common, a better on-disc setlist, and songs were selected round-robin style.  In RB3, though, you were typically stuck with the on-disc setlist only, everybody could dogpile and spam the playlist, and it was absolute chaos. Unplayable.  If playing with friends, voice chat's a must. Trouble is getting that arranged, since hooking up a headset to an instrument's a wonky affair."
Rockband,38azj0,StefanGagne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:04:05 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad. If you get someone that only has on-disc stuff, drop out, play a song or 2 on your own, and go back and check for someone else.    If you get someone that's spamming the setlist with shit songs... drop out, play a song or 2 on your own, and go back and check for someone else.    I have literally 0 rl friends, or even online friends from other games, that actually play Rock Band or Guitar Hero. Everyone I play with is someone I randomly met in a pick up game. I leave the game running because I don't use my ps3 for much else, and my message box is generally filled with dozens of invites per week, 100% of them from people I met through ""Find players online."""
Rockband,38azj0,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:35:34 2015 UTC,RB3 online will ALWAYS be garbage for guitar players.  Nobody wants to be relegated to playing bass for 4 people's picks instead of alternating between songs like in RB2.
Rockband,38azj0,mokacoffay,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:54:38 2015 UTC,"You're not required to have a bassist. I play with just drummers, or with just vocalists, or with just drummer and vocalist, or with keys players, on a regular basis.    Also it's not quite nobody. There's occasionally people that will jump in and just stick to bass the whole time. Especially if you're good."
Rockband,38azj0,LumpyArryhead,2,Fri Jun 5 06:25:57 2015 UTC,As long as they add it in post release (not too long after) I'm fine

Rockband,38azj0,toymachinesh,2,Wed Jun 3 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"After watching the video of the actual question and answer, I'm quite confident in stating:    This is not saying what you think it's saying.    What he's referring to is an online career mode, where you would have a whole band going through the progression together. (think: find online players in rb3's ""career"" mode which NEVER gets used)      This is not asking about online quickplay, which I will personally give you a 99.99999999999999% confidence assurance will be in the game."
Rockband,38azj0,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:30:36 2015 UTC,I mean I don't really need this I guess. I play mostly solo. I'd rather have a solid solo experience anyways.

Rockband,38azj0,flcl4evr,2,Wed Jun 3 11:51:59 2015 UTC,"90% of my time is solo, 10% is in massive local multiplayer RB parties. But I did used to play online quite a bit back in the RB2 era, and I'd love to be able to play online again in RB4. I can wait for them to have time to properly add it, though, no need for launch."
Rockband,38azj0,StefanGagne,3,Wed Jun 3 13:05:58 2015 UTC,this Question and Answer are very strange. I'm going to wait till E3
Rockband,38azj0,toymachinesh,2,Wed Jun 3 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. Let's not all flip out from a vaguely worded non-response."
Rockband,38azj0,BeriAlpha,2,Wed Jun 3 06:53:47 2015 UTC,"This isn't quite deal-breaking, as I have always been a leaderboard hunter more than anything. But I do still try a random search once a month on RB3 if I get bored. I was looking forward to a possible return of score duel and other forms of online play too, but they definitely look doubtful."
Rockband,38azj0,OkSource,2,Wed Jun 3 04:29:54 2015 UTC,"Is it going to support online play at all? In case you can't get your mates over or you have some awful disease or something.  We're still working through those details, but that sort of asynchronous multiplayer set-up is very compelling, and we know that people do want it, but it's very expensive. We're weighing that feature up against some of the other stuff that we're doing. One of the interesting things about our strategy here is that, just because some feature isn't there at launch, doesn't mean it won't be later on. We're going to respond to people telling us what they want. When players wish they could do things that they can't, we're going to be a virtual phone call away.   This is bad. I won't buy the game without it."
Rockband,38azj0,Nick08f1,2,Wed Jun 3 01:17:23 2015 UTC,Me either. The game is just that much more fun when gold starring with a full band online. My local friends don't have the skills to do that.

Rockband,38cbti,evilclownattack,6,Wed Jun 3 09:11:52 2015 UTC,0%.  Harmonix does not have the resources to argue about this with Sony and Microsoft and its a miracle the game is being made in the first place.
Rockband,38cbti,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,3,Wed Jun 3 12:58:27 2015 UTC,0% chance because Sony and Microsoft would never let it happen.
Rockband,38cbti,PelvoDelFuego,2,Wed Jun 3 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"I think you'd best add the Xbox One to your budget now. If they do surprise us and make cross-platform DLC possible, you'll have a few hundred dollars to spend."
Rockband,38cbti,StefanGagne,3,Wed Jun 3 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"I did the same. Had a 360, switched to PS4 this generation, now I have to get an XBone for RB4. I weighed the numbers and re-buying all my DLC and buying new sony-flavored guitars and such wasn't as cheap as buying a new console would be."
Rockband,38cbti,sengoku,2,Wed Jun 3 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I play a lot on PS4, but I also own around 900 songs on Xbox 360.  At around $2/song (if the pricing remains the same), it's easy to do the math and see that it's much cheaper to just bite the bullet and buy whatever system you bought all of your songs on, than to start over.   Of course, there is also a point of diminishing returns, so if you bought 10 songs, you're not losing much. :)"
Rockband,38cbti,StefanGagne,2,Wed Jun 3 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"Yep. Also you have to consider hardware costs -- if your gear is MS flavored but you want to switch to Sony, that means new instruments.  In the end the math will point the way towards one console or another. Or towards eating food which costs money I guess that's cool too"
Rockband,38cbti,ohsnapitsjf,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:18:17 2015 UTC,It's not a real band simulator without 3 Ramen meals a day for a year or two.
Rockband,38cbti,thekindlyman555,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Same situation here. I just need a job to buy an XBone.  I said before this gen started that the only way I'd buy an XBOne was if RB4 came out and the DLC exported forward... And I intend to keep my word, assuming I can find stable work before it comes out."
Rockband,38cbti,Horse625,2,Thu Jun 4 02:36:55 2015 UTC,Literally none.  Thing is that you paid Microsoft for a product and now you want Sony to provide that product.  You may as well be trying to use a Burger King gift card at McDonald's.
Rockband,38cbti,ohsnapitsjf,2,Wed Jun 3 15:25:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, there's theoretical ways. If HMX had a crystal ball when they worked with Metallica for DLC pack #1, they could have had us set up Rockband Social Club accounts or something and tracked our purchases there, so we could cross-buy through them all these years later rather than straight through the console stores.   I'm certainly not MAD they didn't, it would have been so far ahead of their time, and lord knows if the labels would have gone for that anyway. But in hindsight, it wouldn't have been technically unfeasible."
Rockband,38cbti,DMan304,2,Wed Jun 3 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"You have to decide whether it's worth the price of an Xbox One or rebuying the DLC you want on PS4.  I have the exact same problem, but I think I'd rather spend $100-$200 or so on the best DLC I want back instead of buying a whole $300+ new system just to play one game."

Rockband,389jdm,gisdood,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:53:49 2015 UTC,Does the rockbandkickbox work for your double pedal? I tried to get double pedals working back in the day but the only products I tried would set it up to where if one pedal was held down then the other wouldn't register a kick.
Rockband,389jdm,gisdood,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"Due to the problem you just described, I wound up picking up a Roland KD-8 with a conventional chain-driven double pedal setup - which is what prompted the purchase of the rockbandkickbox to tie everything together.

I don't know how guitarists feel about this, but as a drummer it always felt like I was truly hitting the notes when they shattered into pieces in RB (I feel RB3 got this just right).

Rockband,387s4r,Edge2k13,-1,Tue Jun 2 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"I hope they don't make it too hard to avoid auto-picking songs. Random sucked and always tried to push you to songs you never play.  There's a reason I never played them, so don't offer them to me.  On that same note, please, let us remove songs so that we don't have to skip over them in our list. Many are just in the way, cluttering up the list."
Rockband,387s4r,Heiroglyph,3,Tue Jun 2 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"RB3's rating system solved both of those issues. Rate songs you hate a 1, and they would get randomly picked less often, and (after an update) you could hide them completely from the song list."
Rockband,387s4r,ohsnapitsjf,2,Tue Jun 2 15:52:48 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the ""one lighter"" feature carries through. So far nobody's asked HMX about that on camera; game journos tend not to do deep-dives on specific features that fans are interested in."
Rockband,387s4r,StefanGagne,2,Tue Jun 2 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"I fully expect all the QoL features they've come up with from day 1 to be in. They seem very focused on the party environment and casual player, anything to reduce the chore of navigating menus or lists will be prioritized."
Rockband,387s4r,ohsnapitsjf,0,Tue Jun 2 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"We stopped using random so long ago that by the time it became an option, we never new that was there.  That said, I'd still like them out of my song list completely and that's only an option with DLC. But if I hated the song, I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. The ones I want gone are songs that came on the disk and can't be removed or hidden.  It's hard enough to find songs with so much DLC without known bad ones in your way."
Rockband,387s4r,Heiroglyph,4,Tue Jun 2 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"They can, though. In fully-updated RB3, there's an option in the song filter to hide all 1-lighter songs. I don't remember which update it was, might have been TU5 (which would mean it wouldn't work with customs)."
Rockband,387s4r,ohsnapitsjf,2,Tue Jun 2 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"If you still play, I highly recommend the lengthy process of going through and star-rating your songs. Ever since I did that, I've had really awesome party mode every single time."

I mostly use it to hide dupes (i.e., song has non RB3 and RB3 version, hide the non-RB3 version), but also songs I don't ever want to play.  You can also use the rest of the range 2-5 to weight how much you like a song and affect random songs but eventually you find you're giving everything 2 or 5... lol"

Rockband,384qwz,logicalnoise,2,Tue Jun 2 05:59:24 2015 UTC,Except wired equipment only needs driver support(no re engineering of instruments or consoles) which should be easy especially if the wireless equipment will work.

Rockband,384qwz,logicalnoise,2,Mon Jun 1 23:18:22 2015 UTC,The driver that makes ION drums work would be identical to the one that would make any wired controller work(including official RB drums).
Rockband,384qwz,biosehnsucht,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes, but they might decide to lock compatibility to certain device IDs, to limit QA / support costs (i.e., if you make all 360 devices BC via the adapter, now you've got people complaining that rumble doesn't work if they use a 360 controller on the One, when the SDK for it is entirely different)..   Yes you can just build a driver and it should just work, but before you can release that into production you have to QA it against every possible combination of devices you may allow to be used, including previous gen hardware, current gen hardware, various combinations thereof, etc."

We are on the rooftop of a pricey hotel in Santa Monica, at a press event organized by Rock Band 4's developer and publisher Harmonix.  I'm standing at a safe distance, drinking fizzy water, eating puff pastry canapes and chatting to another colleague about politics in the Philippines. I'm having an OK time.  I'm supposed to be focusing my attention on Rock Band 4, but there's more chance of Ferdinand Marcos leaping onto that stage than there is of me mounting the boards, swinging a guitar strap around my neck and yelling ""whooooooo.""  I don't care about rock music. I dislike crowds and I dislike loud noises. I don't do public performances, excepting ""Toastmasters"" which I enjoy from time-to-time, along with half a dozen accountants, schoolteachers and self-improvement nutters.  rock band 4  Look, sometimes in this job you gotta cover games you don't really give a stuff about. I played some Guitar Hero ten years ago and I thought it was kinda stupid. This is not because rock star sims are stupid. It's a perfectly valid fantasy. It's just not my fantasy.  But I can tell from the people on stage, the fact that they are having fun and coming back for more, that Rock Band 4 has something to offer people who get together and enjoy each other and music and the whole rock-'n'-roll ethos. I'm jealous of their ability to enjoy this product.  If my grandmother, who does enjoy a good party, were here on this windswept hotel roof — instead of sitting in an old people's home in Manchester, watching Britain's Got Talent — she'd be up on stage, singing and yelling into the mic, mocking me for being a ""boring old fart.""  Some of the journos on stage are as old as I am and, frankly, no more rock-star-ish than a bag of spuds. This is a game for everyone. Except me.  All video games are stupid, of course. That whole thing of, 'you're not really shooting terrorists or winning the World Cup, you're just pressing buttons' is patronizing and simplistic but every now and again you come across a game that has so little emotional connection to who you are that you end up standing there, gazing at the screen and saying ""I'm just pressing buttons and my life has no meaning,"" to a slightly bemused PR person.  Music games are often about pressing buttons according to visual cues, which is probably why the whole genre collapsed a few years ago. That and the ferocious greed of Activision, which insisted on publishing way too many of these games. Must Read rockband 4 small Rock Band 4 is Coming  But Rock Band 4 is also not about just pressing buttons. Various instruments, including vocals, have been given carte blanche to express themselves in ways that are individual to the player, and be rewarded for their personal skill. It's not just about sticking to the colors and the lines. It's about adding your own flavor to the song, through drum-riffs and vocal meanderings.  I'm not entirely dislocated from the appeal of this feature. There was a time when half a bottle of gin and a copy of Lips on Xbox 360 basically turned me into Boy George. I can do a gorgeous ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me,"" assuming there's no-one else in the house.  But I found, with that game, that I could sing it worse and score higher, by doing what the software wanted me to do, rather than what my Tanqueray-fueled inner-Culture Club needed to release.  Rock Band 4, as Harmonix keeps telling us, is not so much about creating a game in which there are scores and channels and targets and RPGish upgrade paths (though they are all certainly present) but in creating a really fun experience in which people get to sing, guitar and drum their fave tunes their way and generally have a good laugh and not be booed off stage by AI douchebags. So far as I can tell, the company is making a good fist of this endeavor.  rock band 4  At the end of each song, the game offers up suggestions for the next track, which band-members can vote on. The AI crowd shouts out requests. This keeps the fantasy alive, avoids the tedium of back-tracking through menus, helps iron out the social difficulty of choosing the next song. This seems to me to be part of a convincingly earnest attempt by the people at Harmonix to do the thing they are best at, which is making music games that actually make people feel good, that allow people to have a good time.  There are new guitars and drums being made by Mad Catz (no keyboard) but you can use your old Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 wireless contraptions on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions, which are due out later this year. Exported songs from those old games can also be uploaded.  A new group of journos are on stage banging out some Fleetwood Mac. My friend, the one I was talking about the Philippines to, has wandered away. I go in search of a developer to interview. Perhaps there's a nice quiet room where we can sit and chat."""

Rockband,385nqt,BeeksElectric,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"As of the new Xbox 360 update, tools like USB XTAF and Party Buffalo are no longer needed, you can access the drive with Windows Explorer"
Rockband,385nqt,BeeksElectric,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:11:55 2015 UTC,It's a lot easier if you use RBtoUSB in C3 CON Tools.
Rockband,385nqt,Plumato,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"You'll open C3ConTools, then open RBtoUSB. When you open it, if you have your drive plugged in, it should detect it and list it, you'll select it and it will generate a list of the current customs on it (with a new drive there will be none listed). The app has an injectable copy of Title Update 4 built-in, so you can just click Tools at the top and select Copy TU4 to Drive and it will inject it for you. Then you can just right-click the song list, select Add Files, and select your RB3CON files, and it will inject them for you. When done, File > Close Drive, and you're golden."
Rockband,385nqt,sageamagoo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:35:28 2015 UTC,Ok so i right clicked the song cache and add the song files?
Rockband,385nqt,NemoEsq,2,Tue Jun 2 02:41:22 2015 UTC,"The song cache doesn't matter - you only need to really worry about it if you are injecting the upgrade files from the RB Harmonies Project. Just leave it as is and add the song files - the next you start RB3, it will detect all the new files, grind at them for a little while and add them to your cache on its own."
Rockband,385nqt,TangerineDiesel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:46:55 2015 UTC,How do i put songs into the song cache?

Rockband,37zh1o,SilentR0b,2,Mon Jun 1 21:50:34 2015 UTC,I really wish they'd host something in their hometown (aka my hometown) :/.  All these events in california makes me jealous and wonder if they are going to do anything in the boston/cambridge area?
Rockband,37zh1o,StefanGagne,2,Sun May 31 19:14:09 2015 UTC,It's probably out west due to the timing with E3.
Rockband,37zh1o,Scopitone,2,Sun May 31 19:35:33 2015 UTC,From a dev standpoint E3 has always been a blessing and a curse. You're swamped and super busy for months on end and then you have to devote resources to heading halfway around the country (or globe) to show off something that isn't finished so that it can potentially be ripped apart by people that aren't capable of assessing a half finished product. It costs a lot of money to get there let alone have a booth so I don't blame them remotely for killing two birds with one stone here. I'm sure they'll have a number of gigs similar to this one closer to release and I think it's great they're doing this for fans that aren't getting into E3.
Rockband,37zh1o,SilentR0b,2,Sun May 31 20:39:02 2015 UTC,I totally understand that... and kind of have no doubt they'll probably have plans for something local in the future.  Gotta fry the bacon while the pan's hot (E3).  I hope people get to go out there and check it out!
Rockband,37zh1o,canhasdrums,2,Sun May 31 22:38:01 2015 UTC,Wait has any rb4 game play been released yet? I'm not really up to date
Rockband,37zh1o,StefanGagne,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, IGN did a twitch stream of the game. Showed the ""Play a Show"" mode."
Rockband,37zh1o,StefanGagne,2,Mon Jun 1 00:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yep. However, they were playing a pre alpha build, so it looked like crap basically. Don't think that's how the final game will look"
Rockband,37zh1o,canhasdrums,2,Mon Jun 1 00:47:50 2015 UTC,"There were visual bugs like an overabundance of bloom and some deadlocked animations, confirmed by HMX devs.   But don't expect a drastically different game; I can't name many games shown 5 months in advance that looked nothing like their previews in the end."
Rockband,37zh1o,grylliade,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:46:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info everyone.  I'll check it out
Rockband,38075q,rjdiego120,3,Sun May 31 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, I use it all the time with Logic Pro X. On Mac OS X, it works instantly with a cheap MIDI to USB cable with no problems. It even has velocity sensitivity, which you would think wouldn't be included in a controller for a game that doesn't use it.  Make sure you try out the face buttons; square/X and circle/B adjust the octave. Additionally, holding the overdrive button will make the touch strip bend pitch instead of modulation. If you have a drum petal hooked up to the keyboard, it will act as a sustain pedal. There are a lot of subtle features in it, and it works really well for the price. However, only having two octaves sometimes ends up being a hindrance, but if you aren't performing live, you can work around it."
Rockband,3805x1,Mishatje,2,Sun May 31 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"This is a great move, getting the best player(s) in the community  involved in the hype train.  Hopefully they'll recruit a full band of people.  cough I could play bass or drums cough"

Rockband,3805x1,spideyjiri,4,Mon Jun 1 10:46:57 2015 UTC,Just seeing someone actually performing decent on a song will make a huuuuuuge difference.
Rockband,3805x1,spideyjiri,2,Mon Jun 1 11:16:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I'd say the same for Guitar Hero Live because everything we've seen so far has been laughably easy.  Watching the annoying people from IGN barely slug through songs in RB4 was painful to watch."

Or maybe I'm just shit at guitar.  That said, since I mostly sing, it bothers me when there's a very clear lead vocal part, but the RB chart goes apeshit charting background stuff for ""variation"". Feeling This (blink 182) and The Kids Aren't Alright (The Offspring) are examples I can think of off the top of my head."

Rockband,37yacr,Ketomatic,6,Sun May 31 12:52:44 2015 UTC,Feeling This by Blink 182 on vocals. Towards the end it feels like your singing the backup which is hard when you know all the words so you play guitar and vocals at the same time

Rockband,37yacr,Chaz2132005,6,Sun May 31 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"Guitar/Bass - Anything that should have been charted as hammer-ons and pull-offs but for whatever reason was charted as strums (I'm looking at you Snow (Hey Oh)).   Drums - Anything with excessive use of the non-dominant hand over the dominant hand (Foreplay/Long Time).  Vocals - Anything where they chart the vocals as higher even when the singer clearly goes down in pitch, or vice versa."
Rockband,37yacr,thekidwiththelisp,6,Sun May 31 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Snow is annoyingly difficult on guitar, but the chart is correct in where the HO/POs are."

Rockband,37yacr,Mariya_Shidou,3,Sun May 31 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"Also, I've encountered a lot of trouble singing when the harmony track has been significantly boosted in the mix (as in much louder than the album version).

Rockband,380kvl,espher,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would say 2 was the best. The only reason I hesitate to say RB3's was the worst is because RB1 only had something like 58 songs compared to RB2/3's 80+, though RB1 did have some great songs overall even with covers.  IMO RB3's setlist was forced to be not so great since they had to add in however many songs they wanted with keys. Not saying keys are bad but I feel like it brought some limitations as a whole."

It could have been an absolute knockout reveal. I was jonesing every day for a new article that was gonna blow my mind, but most of it just...didn't. Don't get me wrong - I am beyond stoked for RB4 and will be preordering the full band bundle as soon as it's available. I just wish they waited a month or two to show it off so people wouldn't be so focused on the pre-alpha graphics and more features could have actually been talked about.  But! E3 is right around the corner and this month certainly did get people talking about (and me playing) Rock Band again. So all in all, I think it did exactly what it was designed to do - let people know that Rock Band is back without revealing all the songs and features."

Rockband,37rqp5,frigginelvis,-1,Sat May 30 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"What difference does it make if Harmonix knows about C3 or not? They've allowed Guitar Hero to co-exist even though it's essentially the same thing as Rock Band.  I understand C3 not wanting to compete with RB4, but now it's starting to become a problem when SUPERIOR tracks are getting removed with the ANNOUNCEMENT of songs for RB4, a game that won't even be out for another 6 months. And regrettably, when RB4 finally does come out and they start up DLC again, there will probably be a lot of overlap between songs that the C3 customizers have been working on, which means more and more songs that will lose ANY keyboard support.  So why is it okay that they still keep Guitar Hero conversions up? Heck, they even converted the entire Beatles Rock Band game, AND added keyboard support for some songs."

You can't buy songs released for GH in Rock Band 3/4, neither can you buy TBRB songs (btw, TBRB is not an official C3 project). But you will be able to buy Somebody Told Me, so we can't and won't be any kind of distraction for HMX's sales numbers. Besides, we can't take back what's been downloaded so if anybody wanted to play Somebody Told Me on keys so badly they surely have gotten the song by now.

The cymbals split the toms and cymbals, making more challenging but realistic. You can turn the cymbals off if you want to as well.  Here are two videos of someone playing Tom Sawyer on drums, one with cymbals and one without: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrx7RXvDGnI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXnmGdCIjqg"
Rockband,37r8vj,MLC2,3,Fri May 29 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"Are you more interested in a real drum kit that can work with rock band or are you trying to find just the controllers? If you buy some sort of electronic drum kit, the benefit is you can use the same one for the last gen consoles as the next gen, provided they come out with another MIDI adapter (I'm assuming they will). If you need a drum kit now, then I'd suggest getting one, but don't count on the last gen controllers to work with RB4 when it comes out, as it hasn't been confirmed yet.  If you choose to go with an actual kit there are many paths, and when you start getting into electronic drum territory you start going from toys to actual instruments, you could spend anywhere from $350 to $5,000+.  For instance: I use a Roland TD-25KV (And previously a Roland TD-9) with Rock Band 3 using the MIDI adapter, and it works fantastically, but I just happened to already own an electronic drum kit and play drums before I found out that I could use an adapter to use it as a controller. You can find the adapter here: http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Rock-Band-Midi-PRO-Adapter/dp/B00409SOD2  You can save a lot of money by buying a cheap kit, the cheapest I've seen that has MIDI out for the console adapters is the Simmons 5D5Xpress (http://www.amazon.com/Simmons-SD5Xpress-Full-5-Piece-Electronic/dp/B00MNK2CMY), but if you want to use it as an actual drum kit you should also know that unless you buy from Roland or Yamaha, you're pretty much buying a toy, not an instrument. Anything around the $200 price range will work as well, but you will need to use a laptop to adapt the USB MIDI to MIDI Out if it doesn't have one."
Rockband,37r8vj,MrFluffyThing,1 point,Fri May 29 20:03:46 2015 UTC,I bought a RB3 Pro set (base+symbol pack). You can still find new packs out there though it wasn't the cheapest option. I've been very happy with it. I am however moving to an e-kit for better bounce and a less stiff bass pedal.

Rolling down the drum set by going up over the pads and onto the cymbals, and then you end by going down on the pad. Or snare flams played on one pad and one cymbal. Or those quick 16th note rolls down the toms in fills now have these impossible distances to bridge because you're going a foot away instead of two and a half inches.

Rockband,37ql06,Edge2k13,5,Fri May 29 16:39:48 2015 UTC,Kind of like in RB2 before every song
Rockband,37ql06,MLC2,3,Fri May 29 19:15:11 2015 UTC,This would be awesome. And have you announce your band before the next song
Rockband,37ql06,Chaz2132005,2,Fri May 29 18:15:30 2015 UTC,Was thinking about posting this over in the Harmonix forums. Probably too late in the game to add it at this point but maybe could be added later if enough people liked the idea.
Rockband,37ql06,The_Great_Kal,2,Fri May 29 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"It's NEVER too late. This is a pretty cool idea since we're getting so deep in this type of experience. If the idea gains traction at any point, it stands a good chance of going in."
Rockband,37ql06,Chaz2132005,2,Fri May 29 20:26:26 2015 UTC,yeah well they said this will be a platform with updates so you still should maybe we can get it in there
Rockband,37ql06,Ryderraider48,3,Fri May 29 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"I've wanted this forever! Like with little solo's and stuff. I think this would be one of the biggest things they could do to make it feel more ""real""!"
Rockband,37ql06,Advacar,3,Fri May 29 21:12:24 2015 UTC,I'd do it once and then shut it off. I really have no interest in trying to hype up my TV.

Rockband,37nyph,StefanGagne,18,Fri May 29 01:10:43 2015 UTC,"Me! I game mainly on PC, and RB is the only thing getting me to buy  into the next gen. And if it weren't for all the DLC I bought on the 360, then I'd be getting it for the PS4, haha"
Rockband,37nyph,thewinnerisgeeg,6,Fri May 29 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"Same here. I actually bought a PS4 just for Amplitude (I have no kids, so hey, disposable income to spend on stupid things) but I'm primarily a PC gamer... and all my Rock Band DLC was on my 360. Dooh."
Rockband,37nyph,ROFLBRYCE,2,Fri May 29 02:01:12 2015 UTC,Check out phase shift. You can get all the DLCs and setlists for every GH/RB as well as customs. Full controller support with 360/P3 peripherals too.
Rockband,37nyph,thewinnerisgeeg,3,Fri May 29 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely cool, and I'm glad it exists, but I'm primarily focused on the real thing. I love creating characters and bands, I'm REALLY looking forward to the RPG tour mode, things like that. Just playing the songs isn't enough."
Rockband,37nyph,ROFLBRYCE,1 point,Fri May 29 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"I actually have Phase Shift on my computer. The engine itself functions very well, and I really like the controller support it has too. However, I have some problems with it, (mainly visual/layout stuff) and although it sounds like a dumb reason, it's just not the same. Doesn't feel authentic."
Rockband,37nyph,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Fri May 29 04:05:26 2015 UTC,You can get skins that follow the style of each game. I use the RB3 one and aside from searching being weird works perfectly
Rockband,37nyph,G3ck0,1 point,Fri May 29 04:10:13 2015 UTC,"I'm aware. The skin does a good job of replicating Rock Band's look, but there are still minute differences that bother me. But with that being said, I won't say it's a bad game by any means. Its engine is solid, and honestly it has much more customization options than rock band, but in the end, the actual RB is more suited to my tastes  (also, as a pro drummer, i can not stand the 7-lane drum track. just sayin)"
Rockband,37nyph,Edge2k13,1 point,Fri May 29 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks. Sold my PS3 and I kind of feel like Rock Band again, this might be what I want."
Rockband,37nyph,chrisalmighty,7,Fri May 29 07:47:22 2015 UTC,Yup I'm buying an XBone as well just for a rock band machine. My buddy finds it amusing that I'm going this far for one game and was shocked to hear I've spent about a grand on all my current RB stuff already. This games a way of life man.
Rockband,37nyph,Edge2k13,2,Fri May 29 03:12:08 2015 UTC,A grand!? I'm feeling bad for the 3 grand that I've spent on this game. Haha.
Rockband,37nyph,BretRob333,1 point,Fri May 29 17:03:39 2015 UTC,I must catch up now!!! Though I think I've purchased just about every song I could want in the store as of right now ha ha.
Rockband,37nyph,ridethepiggy,6,Fri May 29 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"I actually have a PS4 now, but since I was a 360 gamer last generation, I'm probably going to be buying an Xbone just for RB4 so I can access all of my DLC."
Rockband,37nyph,Phildopip,3,Fri May 29 02:27:58 2015 UTC,I'm on this boat.
Rockband,37nyph,mike_gainor,5,Fri May 29 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Right here. Like a lot of people, my preference would be to buy a PS4, but the continuity of DLC has me locked into an Xbox One.   Rock Band 4 and Mass Effect 4 are the only games I really care about currently for this generation of consoles."
Rockband,37nyph,logicalnoise,3,Fri May 29 05:47:02 2015 UTC,I'm waiting to see if my ION set from the 360 will work on the Xbox One or not.
Rockband,37nyph,Goron40,1 point,Fri May 29 01:47:53 2015 UTC,If it doesn't it'll be because of licensing I'd think. Since its wired all it needs is a proper driver.
Rockband,37nyph,Advacar,3,Fri May 29 05:37:05 2015 UTC,"Why would you buy early, potentially missing out on any possible price drop between now and then?"
Rockband,37nyph,TheWarEagle,6,Fri May 29 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"Memorial Day sales. I got a reasonable price on one, and a discount 12 months of Live. I figured there wouldn't be any more large drops until Black Friday and no way am I waiting that long considering the game'll likely be out in October or early November."
Rockband,37nyph,WarConsigliere,3,Fri May 29 02:02:05 2015 UTC,"Good call, I thought about doing that too."
Rockband,37nyph,tubingan,1 point,Fri May 29 03:07:12 2015 UTC,They do sales a lot. There's almost always a console + free game sale. Just keep your eyes open for a deal you like
Rockband,37nyph,onlycatfud,3,Tue Jun 2 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Going to be getting an Xbone and none too happy about it.  I was planning to get a PS4 for No Man's Sky, but hundreds of dollars' worth of DLC said that's not happening.  I'm waiting until after E3, though - I've noticed a few sales on Xbone consoles, so I'm waiting to see if a new model's announced."
Rockband,37nyph,Crimsonclaw111,2,Fri May 29 10:10:59 2015 UTC,"I always held off on buying the next gen consoles but when I heard rockband 4 was announced. I figured the time was right, also considering the xbox one dropped in price.   I bought it because I figured I was going to get one eventually I actually used my xbox one for a while but since I built my PC a few weeks ago, I've been gaming on that and my Xbox one is just waiting for rockband 4 :)"
Rockband,37nyph,Mishatje,2,Fri May 29 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"Bought mine the day they announced it. Kind of an eat your hat thing, I had commented and been so critical of any RB4 news for so long, and was ""done"" with consoles if I was going to loose 3,000 songs of DLC. Always claimed if the DLC would be backwards compatible I would buy one immediately - I did.  I have turned it on a total of two times since, played maybe a half hour of assassins creed that came with it... :P  But it waits patiently."
Rockband,37nyph,wwwes32,2,Fri May 29 04:38:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a PC gamer primarily, but I own all the systems now. Xbox One is going to be my Rock Band machine and is why I pushed for one now.   I already owned a couple of digital Xbox One games thanks to that GameStop giveaway last year."
Rockband,37nyph,Unrealdude,2,Fri May 29 08:15:31 2015 UTC,"I got my PS4 a few days ago! Bought it while it was on sale so got a good deal. And of course, moments after I got it I saw a post by Harmonix saying that pre-orders are coming soon! Cannot wait :D"
Rockband,37nyph,OutsideOwl,2,Fri May 29 08:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yup. Getting a PS4 Arkham Knight bundle in June, but without a new Rock Band, I'd have waited for another year probably."
Rockband,37nyph,wearing2raincoats,2,Fri May 29 13:25:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, kinda.  I bought a next gen console for Rock Band 4, but chose the opposite console than the one I bought all my DLC for last gen. Unfortunately, I had to decide for the future, and realized that there were waaaay more PS4 exclusive games I'd want to play than to just get an Xbone for my past DLC.  Plus, you know... My buddy had a bunch of PS3 DLC, and from what I gather, I should be able to use his account to play with his stuff on my system until I break down and replace the $300 or so worth of my own."

Rockband,37nyph,mostdeadlygeist,2,Fri May 29 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"HMX has already said there won't be a Rock Band 5. Their plan is to make RB4 a continually updating game, ala Minecraft and such.   So, we MIGHT get keys back in the future... but that hinges on Mad Catz deciding to make new keyboards. Right now there's no cause for them to do so given the cost investment. If RB4 takes off, if it becomes viable again, maybe they will."
Rockband,37nyph,superkrups20056,2,Fri May 29 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"They said it'll be a while until it happens, and that they intend for RB4 to be a platform, but there will be a RB5 sooner or later.   It seems to me like Rock Band follows a tick-tock cycle. Rock Band 1 was revolutionary at the time. Rock Band 2 was a fantastic game, but it didn't introduce much. Rock Band 3 was absolutely amazing with keys, harmonies, and yes, pro guitar. RB4 looks like it will be a great game, but won't change much. It's basically RB2+."

It's taking me awhile to not suck mind you, I can only play a few songs on expert (I have a really hard time with fast bass). Has been super rewarding so far! I just picked up a cheap e-kit which I can't wait to try :p.     So yeah, buy 1-3 (they are cheap enough 2nd hand, though if you can get RB2 new, do so. I didn't- but I got lucky and traded a song pack for a code on this lovely subreddit). Stalk the local version of gumtree or craigslist for a cheap current gen instrument, one day I will find a cheap guitar with a working strum bar... one day.

Rockband,37ljxm,ApplicableSongLyric,2,Thu May 28 19:16:32 2015 UTC,No worries. :-D
Rockband,37ljxm,monopanda,3,Thu May 28 19:19:14 2015 UTC,20 free songs DLC code: F2QVJ-XJHMJ-FJF7K-WFFPH-F9KJY I've got it from UK EA Support few days ago and don't need it.
Rockband,37ljxm,badylq,1 point,Thu May 28 17:16:32 2015 UTC,I didn't take it but thanks for giving this out to someone.  I have tried to chat with EA support here in the USA a few times on a few different computers in the past few weeks and haven't had any luck with them recently.  Anyone else had this issue?  It just sits there on the chat page saying it is loading/waiting for an EA customer support agent and never does anything.  It worked a few weeks ago so I know it's not my account/computers I'm trying.

Rockband,37naiq,MrAllthat,1 point,Thu May 28 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"Only if you don't check out a guide on disassembling the guitar first.  I believe its just a large ribbon cable that you can cut if you really want them gone.  You need a phillips screw driver and a pair of scissors (assuming you don't have wire cutters).  I don't personally know which ribbon cable goes to what, but I'm sure you can find it with a little bit of googling."
Rockband,37kgfn,kerminsr,7,Thu May 28 07:41:37 2015 UTC,"Rock Band 2 was the golden age of peripherals, I remember seeing this stuff stacked at retailers.  Pretty sure that mic isn't compatible with the stage kit at the same time, since the stage kit is the mic controller. I haven't used mine in ages, but I'm pretty sure that's how it is.  One thing I couldn't find was that overdrive pedal, nice find. Got anything else to show off?"
Rockband,37kgfn,krystof_kage,1 point,Thu May 28 12:17:03 2015 UTC,"You can use the M.I.C. at the same time as the stage kit, it just uses up 2 player spots. Which is fine if you have only 1-3 players.   The only other Rock Band stuff I have is my nice Roland drum kit with the MIDI pro adapter mounted on a custom mount to my drum rack, and the wooden strata aster replica controller - which is amazing. It's a real strat with a strum bar and buttons instead of strings and pickups. It's a legit licensed product made by Harmonix and Mad Catz. The strum bar is clicky and the buttons are faster than the normal guitar controller. I think I got it on Amazon for about $70 back in 2011 when the music game craze was just dying down."
Rockband,37kgfn,krystof_kage,1 point,Thu May 28 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, I stand corrected.  I have the wooden strat too, for about the same price. I love it!"

Rockband,37kgfn,Edge2k13,3,Thu May 28 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's pretty amazing. Back in 2009 or whenever it came out, I thought it was kinda stupid. But I didn't realize at the time how much I would get into rock band, and how fun it is to feel like a rock star when playing"
Rockband,37kgfn,nerdcrest,1 point,Thu May 28 23:41:43 2015 UTC,"I remember picking mine up at best buy when they were desperate to get rid of them, and got mine for $20.

Rockband,37kgfn,Ketomatic,1 point,Fri May 29 02:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly really curious as to what you searched for all of this. I imagine just ""Rock Band"" would bring up mostly guitar controllers. (I do remember your post about the bass controller though, I'm insanely jealous of it.)"

Rockband,37kgfn,Bonerspider,1 point,Thu May 28 11:52:11 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the MIC controls will work? Old 360 controllers don't work on the XBone, for instance. Yes, old GUITARS are slated to work but they're a special case.  Let us know your findings when RB4 comes out. Maybe I'll scavenge an MIC off eBay if it works."

Also, they've said even DLC that can no longer be purchased will be available on RB4, if you've already bought it.  I'm still a little skeptical about this one, but we'll see."
Rockband,37lnkh,BaddDadd2010,2,Thu May 28 16:52:28 2015 UTC,Whats the difference between RBN and legacy songs?
Rockband,37lnkh,Chaz2132005,2,Fri May 29 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Speculations here:  Songs from your account will carry over just like every other game that does this (Ex. COD Ghosts, Rocksmith) The DLC will be free if you own it prior.  RBN I have no clue since there has been little talk about those songs then all the talks on normal DLC.  Songs removed I'd highly doubt carrying over since they would need to relicense it just to put it on the Xbox One/PS4 stores"
Rockband,37lnkh,Stinky_DungBeatle,3,Thu May 28 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't think anyone will have to worry about doing anything special to transfer their DLC.  It'll likely be very similar to cross-buy, where once you own a digital game on one system you also immediately own it on other systems."
Rockband,37lnkh,cdrock7,2,Thu May 28 15:15:02 2015 UTC,"I tweeted @RockBand and asked if songs removed from the store would transfer over as long as you bought them prior to removal, and they said yes. No idea HOW, but that was the answer I got."
Rockband,37lnkh,StefanGagne,1 point,Thu May 28 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"For Dance Central, you had to find the songs you previously purchased and hit the buy button.   The price was set at Zero if you had bought it in the previous gen.  I assume it will be the same.

Rockband,37if7f,illredditlater,2,Wed May 27 22:19:26 2015 UTC,This was something that the FSG guys did for DJH2 - flew a few of us out to the preview party for the press and let us go nuts on expert. It was great fun and they got some good footage of the game. (And of course we were super-stoked and became free advertising as we raved about the new features.)  I wonder if they need someone to show off the capabilities of the P-Bass...
Rockband,37if7f,CyHawkWRNL,5,Thu May 28 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to see who they recruit for bass, drums and vox!"
Rockband,37if7f,ridethepiggy,8,Wed May 27 23:13:48 2015 UTC,Ibite is v likely for drums.  Thenewnoelisoncruz was a popular dlc preview dude. Maybe bass or vox?  Idk who else is still popular/involved w sponsors for sure ATM. Rock band community is ooold.

Rockband,37if7f,toymachinesh,5,Thu May 28 20:51:42 2015 UTC,"It's pretty awesome, and I love the way HMX reaching out to the community for this game (not enough is being made of RBHP being integrated), but ""not-expert"" instrument players aren't why the stream wasn't great. The singer being unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the songs (to intentionally show off the improv feature), the audio mixing over the presenters, the inability to answer a majority of the key questions they were asked yet, and the general look of the pre-alpha build were the issues. And I don't think any of those things are going to affect the end-product, but I am glad they're trying things to shape up their marketing."

Rockband,37if7f,louster200,1 point,Thu May 28 05:50:34 2015 UTC,I remember when RB1 was preparing for release they did a stream with I think GameSpot? And they used people from harmonix to show the game off and they did it really really well. I don't know why they didn't do that this time. Not to mention in that stream they presented it like a show so the announcers actually stopped talking whenever they did a song so you could hear and see everything that was happening. Don't know why the IGN stream cocked it up so bad.
Rockband,37itnx,BaguetteStix,8,Wed May 27 23:06:52 2015 UTC,"I'd wait.. The new ones are supposed to have more improvements, PLUS I believe if you pre-order RB4 the instruments come in a limited edition red color :D"

I have a full set of functioning instruments and I'm still getting the full band bundle."
Rockband,37hgpf,MrBallalicious,7,Wed May 27 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"Nothing confirmed, but I think the RB2 bundle was like $180 when it came out.. So I'd assume somewhere between $180-$200"

Rockband,37hgpf,NickRL808,3,Wed May 27 17:58:02 2015 UTC,I'll use this thread to say we need a bundle with only the new instruments so we can buy the game digitally.
Rockband,37hgpf,SpecterJoe,2,Wed May 27 21:40:31 2015 UTC,Why? So you don't have to put in the disk? I don't think they would want to produce one without the game in it. They might put in a download voucher.
Rockband,37hgpf,NickRL808,1 point,Wed May 27 22:37:10 2015 UTC,Because all my games are digital and I'm sure a lot of other people's are too this gen.

Rockband,37f528,ItsJustReeses,12,Wed May 27 04:16:51 2015 UTC,My problem with the Guitar Hero Live setlist is one of instrument choice. I actually really like most of these songs - especially King for a Day and Cry of Achilles - but I would really like to be able to play them on drums and vocals as well. I sincerely hope Rock Band at least gets those two tracks.
Rockband,37f528,valeforXD,12,Wed May 27 05:48:04 2015 UTC,"I may just be paranoid about Activision's negative influence on the music genre. But if I was Harmonix I'd be holding my cards close to my chest so that the competition doesn't just swoop in and copy their set list/features. And at least Harmonix are letting the community submit song suggestions still. So when they do announce their song list, I reckon most of us will be happy with it.

Nope, GH Live was in development at least since October 2014: http://www.shacknews.com/article/86962/rumor-guitar-hero-returning-on-playstation-4-and-xbox-one"
Rockband,37f528,Dared00,3,Wed May 27 10:58:50 2015 UTC,Public rumors of Rock Band 4 started in July 2014.   http://m.digitalspy.com.au/gaming/news/a585527/rock-band-survey-hints-at-xbox-one-ps4-wii-u-release.html  3 months is plenty of time for Activision to start development and make an announcement to please their share holders.
Rockband,37f528,eviljimforever,2,Thu May 28 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Well, just because they hadn't announced it publicly doesn't mean whispers don't get around. They don't leak that sort of stuff to the press for obvious reasons, but there's always industry chatter.  I think GH:Live smacks of something done with very little time and effort, exactly what you'd expect if they were just doing another game as an FU to Harmonix."
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,2,Wed May 27 13:24:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely, it seems like they're pumping a lot of effort and risk into reinventing. If anything, RB is taking the easy way out by catering to its existing fanbase rather than pushing new boundaries.   I also personally think it's misguided and the formula HMX is sticking with generally works as well as it could. But it's not fair to accuse Activision of cashing in this time. They're out on a limb with a lot of their choices so far."
Rockband,37f528,ohsnapitsjf,5,Wed May 27 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"The only risk they have is the new guitar, and the only reason they did that is probably so they don't have to go through what Harmonix currently is going through to ensure compatibility. The fmv/music video method means they don't hire artists to work on it or have to make a character creator. The focus on only guitar means they don't have to pay to chart real songs, they could just take an MP3 and half-ass it. I just don't think it's coincidental that all their innovations also ""happen"" to be ways of doing things more cheaply with less work put into it. It will be reflected in the finished product.  Rock Band is putting a ton of effort (by an independent developer, no less) to make its giant library available in a new format and make their old controllers compatible with a new system. Maybe that's not innovative, but it's definitely something much harder to do because they know what their fans actually want."
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,2,Wed May 27 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"I can tell we're going to go around in circles here, but I think you're selling the full-motion video angle of the main mode of GH:L way short, both in ""effort"" and risk factor. That's not easy tech to make work, and they have no idea if it's going to pay off.   I certainly don't disagree with you in what HMX is trying to pull off being difficult (I said for a long time there was no way it'd be worth it for them to even try), but I think it's important that for the FIRST time, GH and RB are notably different games, rather than being different versions of the same game. It's just not worth the energy trying to take them down anymore."
Rockband,37f528,ohsnapitsjf,2,Wed May 27 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible I'm wrong and putting together this video was a huge effort that took great cost and time. But those camera swings are the moments when the tone shifts from ""yeah"" to ""boo"" and I don't think they are that hard to do. And creating a giant crowd from a group of 30 people isn't hard or costly to do either, not when you don't have to pay them to speak or focus on any of them for longer than a few seconds. It's risky in the sense that it might not be popular, but it's also them making a cheap-ass game, and Activision is notorious for that sort of thing.  I dunno, I'm biased because I like Rock Band better and also because I can't handle the first person view for very long without getting queasy. My wife can't handle it EVER, this game will likely be banned from my house, she wouldn't even be able to glance at it on the tv."
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,2,Wed May 27 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"Risk and reinvention? You mean cut all the extra instruments, cut actual graphics, and change the button placement ever so slightly? Out on a limb? The only reason anyone would ever pick up the stinking pile of shit known as GH:L, would be because they have no friends to play the obviously superior RB 4."
Rockband,37f528,DJStashcash,1 point,Sat May 30 13:51:29 2015 UTC,Sorry I insulted you by not condemning a video game that doesn't exist yet.  Relax.
Rockband,37f528,ohsnapitsjf,0,Sat May 30 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that they are changing their style, from the controller to the focus on only guitar, to the graphics... it seems more of an FU to people acting like you are."
Rockband,37f528,Redequlus,2,Wed May 27 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"The old saying goes, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". How many times has Guitar Hero tried to fix their broken system via reinventions now? At least a couple. But you are definitely right, they are making a rhythm game that doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. As someone that still plays my Rock Band games and pays to get songs, MAYBE that's not a good thing?"
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,1 point,Wed May 27 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"It was definitely broke though. What did they ever change that wasn't just following in Rock Band's footsteps? Open bass notes? They were just making not-as-good RB games, but now they are going to make an actual differentiation and be their own thing."
Rockband,37f528,Redequlus,1 point,Wed May 27 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"A fair point, and maybe this is their path towards getting more players. Maybe there is a huge number of people that are fine with getting new instruments and who like having some douchebag with dreadlocks either smile or frown at you. Maybe most people don't care about having songs made from actual guitar masters and maybe major bands/labels won't care that they will now get Spotify money instead of DLC money.  But aside from the network, which would definitely be something I'd be interested in on Rock Band, it sounds like it strips away all the things I like about rhythm games adding anything at all. And it also sounds like they haven't learned ONE DAMN THING from the mistakes they've made.  Yes, a problem was oversaturation, but it was also cheesy gameplay, a lack of real features, bargain basement dlc that you couldn't count on being there one year to the next... none of that seems like it's being addressed."
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,1 point,Wed May 27 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"I imagine the suggestion thing will be open for quite some time, as it might be used to see what DLC the community wants as well"

Wasn't RB4 announced earlier this year?  You actually think GH Live could have gotten this far in development in that short amount of time?"
Rockband,37f528,eatshitanddienow,6,Wed May 27 14:51:08 2015 UTC,The thing I've always liked about Harmonix games including Rock Band 1 & 2 is how much they put into quality of life changes with each iteration they release. The fact that Rock Band 3 gives you individual scores as well as band scores was HUGE for me as well as the entire menu system at your finger tips in song. I fucking love Harmonix. I stopped even paying attention to Guitar Hero after World Tour completely dropped the ball.
Rockband,37f528,oky13o,9,Wed May 27 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"""Nothing has popped up for RB new music wise.""    Did you miss the six song reveal on IGN?  Avenged Sevenfold – ""Hail to the King""  Fleetwood Mac – ""You Make Loving Fun""  Jack White – ""Lazaretto""  The Killers – ""Somebody Told Me""  Spin Doctors – ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong""  The Who – ""The Seeker"""
Rockband,37f528,Sayburr,3,Wed May 27 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"I realize that everyone has different tastes and you can't please everyone, but there's nothing there that interests me.  I'm sure it will improve for me though, I've been happy with their choices in the past."
Rockband,37f528,Heiroglyph,4,Wed May 27 15:27:26 2015 UTC,Huh I guess I did miss this. Tho not as exciting as GH: Live. Its still a nice start.
Rockband,37f528,Chaz2132005,3,Wed May 27 15:06:15 2015 UTC,I think GH setlist is worse just for the simple fact most of it is indie/pop rock and they use alot of synth in those genres where as bands like A7X and Fleetwood Mac are more instrument based
Rockband,37f528,Chaz2132005,2,Wed May 27 16:45:50 2015 UTC,Thats more of a personal taste thing imho. I like a lot of the songs that got announced for GH:L and think would be fun to play with friends.  Tho the 6 songs that have been announced for Rockband I like as well. I didn't know their was a few songs announced for Rockband and found out by making this thread (Yes did some googleing even to no luck). I just hope we hear some more news on it soon.
Rockband,37f528,triskaidekaphobics,2,Wed May 27 17:00:06 2015 UTC,No because I love some of the bands they announced and I doubt if gh:L was trying to do a full band experience it wouldn't be in it. They both will have good set lists I just think songs that can be played on multiple instruments are more fun
Rockband,37f528,Wolfbeckett,5,Wed May 27 17:08:05 2015 UTC,Link to list of Guitar Hero announced songs so far
Rockband,37f528,EvilChameleon09,2,Wed May 27 15:46:35 2015 UTC,Wow what a boring set list.  Almost all of the songs I like on it are already available in Rock Band.
Rockband,37f528,EvilChameleon09,2,Wed May 27 20:47:48 2015 UTC,Hopefully they just up and reveal the whole Rock Band 4 setlist at E3. None of this 6 songs every month nonsense. There's no need for such suspense. This isn't a Call Of Duty reveal.
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,1 point,Wed May 27 16:31:33 2015 UTC,Its a marketing thing. it adds hype to the game (As long as their is music people like). Hyping up a game = more sales.
Rockband,37f528,Advacar,1 point,Wed May 27 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"This isn't a game that needs hype. People are either going to buy it because they bought the previous versions and want a next-gen version, or they aren't going to buy it because they aren't fans."
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,4,Wed May 27 16:50:24 2015 UTC,Every game needs hype. Thats how you get the word of a new game being out. You would be surprised who DOESN'T know that a new Rockband is coming out.
Rockband,37f528,Advacar,1 point,Wed May 27 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Marketing adds hype to the game, not holding back info like song lists and releasing it in bits and pieces. If they want to announce more stuff, they should announce upcoming DLC, show off some of the costumes available, achievements, and other previews of gameplay. The big reveals on the setlist.... I'm not sure you're going to get a better place to do that than E3."
Rockband,37f528,illredditlater,2,Wed May 27 17:14:04 2015 UTC,not holding back info like song lists and releasing it in bits and pieces.   That is marketing. It's the best marketing they could do because it helps make sure that individual songs aren't lost in the full list of 80-something. I doubt showing costumes and achievements would get anywhere near the views of a new set of announced songs.
Rockband,37f528,eienshi09,1 point,Wed May 27 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"I remember when the Rock Band 3 setlist was accidentally leaked in full during a demo they were doing at a conference. I don't remember that affecting publicity or hype in the slightest, to the contrary, actually.  And I mean.... the game has a library of 2000 DLC songs. I'm sure these are going to be killer on-disc tracks, but how do you hype a handful of new songs when the sidenote is ""oh yeah, and if you pay an extra $5, you can download Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium and Come As You Are."""
Rockband,37f528,Plumato,1 point,Wed May 27 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"You're not on the marketing team though, you have no idea how it really affected things. And anyways, IIRC, Harmonix continued with the normal song announcements after that anyways.  Honestly, I'd bet what happened is that HMX intentionally leaked the list. It allowed them to give the fans (who are already buying the game) what they wanted while still doing the individual announcements later on for marketing to people who weren't buying the game."
Rockband,37f528,wwwes32,3,Wed May 27 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"I said this in another thread, but I'm disappointed so far as to how far Rock Band 4 is in the production line.  I feel like the announcement for RB4 was the moment they started working on it full time while they've been working full time on this new GH game for awhile.  Lets hope that we see more progress/updates by E3 this year.    (Personal opinion) I hope that Rock Band gets some of these metal/metalcore acts...  I really want to play Beartooth and more A Day to Remember so I'm glad that these bands at least got picked up by GH."
Rockband,37f528,ohsnapitsjf,6,Wed May 27 04:50:25 2015 UTC,"As far as the production thing goes, I mean, you have to consider that Harmonix is co-publishing with only Mad Catz. The GH guys are still backed by Activision money, which I'm sure still beats out whatever Mad Catz can offer. I think Rock Band will have more heart in it, even if we do need to be a bit more patient with it while GH is really starting to feel like an more mass appeal game, especially given the amount of alt radio chart toppers in the setlist.  Yes, the GH setlist has more songs revealed and confirmed but, in my opinion, none of them seem really fun to play on guitar, especially given a large chunk of them is top alt-pop radio stuff like ""Ho Hey"" or ""Before He Cheats"" and another large chunk are songs we've seen in the series already, like ""Paint It Black"" and ""When You Were Young"" and ""Cowboys from Hell"".  Ironically enough, I think that those alt-chart toppers would probably be more fun to play as a band since those songs would make for better ""karaoke nights"" where you have some mates over and each person takes a different part. But in GHL, you only have guitar which some of those songs are pretty simplistic in."
Rockband,37f528,TwoPlacesAtOnce,3,Wed May 27 05:39:39 2015 UTC,"It's easier to chart 0 notes lol. Metalcore generally consists of 0, 5, 7, and 8 frets. Since they have the open strum feature, it makes more sense for them to chart those songs I guess. The idea of GH:Live is starting to make more sense with more of the releases I'm seeing, in the sense of charting. At the same time, however, solos aren't going to be the same with only the bottom 3 frets to (how I see) emulate the high e (or I guess B and G as well), as top three emulate the low E (or D and A).  Those are just my 2 cents and opinions on the songs I've seen so far."
Rockband,37f528,illredditlater,2,Wed May 27 06:48:42 2015 UTC,"We'll just have to wait and see what we have polished by E3, really."
Rockband,37f528,loflyinjett,1 point,Wed May 27 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"I agree as far as the current build state. The more I see about the reaction to it, the more I think the IGN stream was a mistake. That was not a game ready for the public.   I don't think it's fair to compare GH:L's progress, necessarily. They're focused on completely different aspects of their game, and theirs lends itself to demoing better. It's brand new, and the live videos they shot don't really need any ""tweaking"" to look like the finished product will."
Rockband,37f528,illredditlater,2,Wed May 27 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"(Personal opinion) I hope that Rock Band gets some of these metal/metalcore acts... I really want to play Beartooth and more A Day to Remember so I'm glad that these bands at least got picked up by GH.   So I wasn't the only one who was thinking the same thing. When I saw a few more songs like these popping up my first thought was ""This really needs to get on Rockband...Or at least some of the same genre""   EDIT: You can downvote me all you want for A OPINION.

Rockband,37f528,glacier985,2,Wed May 27 14:41:45 2015 UTC,Authored a ton of DLC for the RBN. All I can say is that we or bands we've worked with haven't heard anything ... Hopefully the RBN songs will get moved over eventually as well.

I want to explore every nook and cranny of this thing, from impoverished coffee house strummer to corporate sellout.  And if you can breakup and reform, I wonder if I could sell out massively to get all the gear I want, then leave that band and join a fan-favorite touring gig group? So many possibilities! Hopefully no stifling limitations, either, like how in RB1 you couldn't solo the tour, and in RB3 you needed specific instruments for certain clothes."

Rockband,37e3y4,BaddDadd2010,1 point,Tue May 26 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"Songs could only be created on 360 thanks to Microsoft's XNA/indie initiative. The most popular/best-selling songs got ported to PS3, but it was only ever a very small portion of what is available on 360.  I've got over 350 RBN tracks. I will be sad (but not surprised) if I can't play them in RB4. Then again, I'm holding on to RB3 indefinitely for pro keys, guitar and bass anyway. So it won't be a total loss."
Rockband,37e3y4,calliope_clamors,1 point,Tue May 26 23:38:40 2015 UTC,Good call. I picked the 360 as my console of choice for Rock band early on and never paid much attention to what was happening on the PS3 side after that.
Rockband,37e3y4,Edge2k13,2,Tue May 26 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Really hope RBN song will carry over, found some really good songs there. Thanks for the reply!"

Rockband,37aa9t,KaySquay,1 point,Tue May 26 19:50:50 2015 UTC,+1 for immigrant song  Stairway to heaven is a given too
Rockband,37aa9t,ZmobieMrh,7,Tue May 26 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like Immigrant Song is the better choice, atleast for a party song, everyone singing the ""Ah-eee-AAAAAAHHHHH-AAAH"". Open the trailer to Rock Band 4 with Immigrant Song."
Rockband,37aa9t,RossC90,5,Tue May 26 16:33:40 2015 UTC,Not to mention this is the only Zeppelin song that's been allowed to be played in advertising and movies
Rockband,37aa9t,KaySquay,2,Tue May 26 19:48:35 2015 UTC,Well I think they've been easing up on licensing since What Is and What Should Never Be is in the movie Silver Linings Playbook and Good Times Bad Times is used in American Hustle. Both movies came out pretty recently.

Stairway to Heaven would be the obvious candidate, but that song gets as much hate as love whenever I play it at the pub. Some people like the idea of playing it, and others are sick and tired of hearing it."

Rockband,37aa9t,krystof_kage,2,Tue May 26 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"Amongst songs that are customs already, Dazed and Confused is the most balanced choice. If it were a song that isn't a custom, I would kill for either Over the Hills and Far Away or The Song Remains the Same."

If you never purchased the license (ie paid the ten bucks for the export), you are now no longer able to, as they no longer have the rights to sell it.  If you did pay for the license, it should still be in your purchase history and can be redownloaded from the Purchase History (Xbox 360), store Downloads List(PS3) or from inside the RB3 store (Wii, as they don't have a central system download history, so the song will be listed in the store, but only if already purchased)"

Rockband,375gyg,evilclownattack,3,Mon May 25 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Like I said, you're not using logic. The song is difficult because it requires techniques you've not acquired. I already gave you an example of whip it. Using your flawed logic, you'd say ""that song's only difficult because it forces you to switch from the yellow pad to the red pad a lot. Technique includes speed. Using your fingers to perform strokes is a technique. Which improves speed.   Visions is a song that skilled expert drum players can play."

Or perhaps there's an ""accoustic set"" where everybody is playing on accoustic instruments, kind of like Unplugged.

Weird hearing a girl character croon to Aerosmith.   I sometimes play mic and bass at the same time.

I mean, what's better than being able to chart your own songs with whatever program you use to do that with? I owned, and still own, a PS3 last gen, so I was never able to take a part of that, and it sounded like fun.  Also, if they could, I would like them to do a RB2 Export Key thing because I don't have that soundtrack on RB3. Along with that, if they got the licensing through, a RB3 Export Key."

Personally I have no issues with that but I'm not sure other people would feel comfortable doing it so this week I made it anonymous. I can play around with the form if people think it's something that they'd be okay with. For now you can re upload scores just make sure you write your username each time.

Rockband,372dro,evilclownattack,2,Mon May 25 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"Here's my feedback:  Awesome! I""m really glad we're doing this again. While I loved the idea of the Rock Legend award, I think it should be simplified.  Each week, pick three songs. You can play the 3 songs on one instrument to submit a total score for each instrument. In addition, one song has the Rock Legend award associated with it, where people can play all available instruments for the ONE song and submit scores for that.  I play Expert Guitar and Pro Drums. Say you picked Walk of Life for the Rock Legend song. So my week would look like:   Expert Guitar on Walk of Life, Rize of the Phoenix, and Livin on a Prayer for the Guitar Champ award Expert Pro Drums on all three songs Also do Bass, Vocals, and either Pro Keys or Keys (Only one counts, same for Pro Drums or Drums) on Walk of Life for the Rock Legend.   Just my thoughts for next week maybe, as that puts me at only 9 total plays and doing absolutely everything I'm interested in. Can't wait to play and submit. Also, I'm not familiar with google forms, but you may be able to put in a few columns for the current leaders of the awards by using formulas. Something to consider if this becomes popular again."
Rockband,372dro,OkSource,3,Sun May 24 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"I would respectfully disagree.  I really love playing every single instrument I can for each song, and I probably would lose enthusiasm if I was limited to one for each song."
Rockband,372dro,thekidwiththelisp,1 point,Sun May 24 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be limited, if you wanted to play all instruments they would all count for their respective instrument award. I'm just suggesting that what we're calling the Rock Legend award (total score across all instruments) be only for one song so it's less of a time commitment, as that may partly be the reason participation tapered off last time. Personally, I definitely have two hours a week I could dedicate to these challenges, so I'm cool with either way and be right there with you, but I'm not sure everyone does or wants to (hopefully more leave feedback)."
Rockband,372dro,cdrock7,1 point,Sun May 24 16:18:37 2015 UTC,I really like that idea. I'll play around with the spreadsheet later and see if I can edit out without effecting the results. If that's the case I'll update it later to show current leaders and such.
Rockband,372dro,thekidwiththelisp,2,Sun May 24 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"Hey just to encourage more people to do this - here are the paths I got for Rize of the Fenix (Guitar is from ThaBeast on youtube - Drums PuppetMaster).  Guitar (NON-OPTIMAL, SO REMOVED)  Bass (MIGHT NOT BE OPTIMAL, 4th activation could probably be moved a little)  1/B  2/4B  2/3Y  2/3G  2/NN  1/OD  Drums  2/  2/  0/  0/  0/  1/  Vocals  2/  3/  3/sk7 (after solo)  EDIT: All other paths can be found at http://ipather.tmullin.net/paths. Walk of Life has a calibration path"
Rockband,372dro,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Tue May 26 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"I wish you would not post paths until after the contest is over.  This is a very important part of getting high scores and gives a slight advantage to the people who can properly create them, and is one of my favorite elements of the contest, and you are removing this advantage completely."
Rockband,372dro,cdrock7,3,Tue May 26 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"Because this has gotten such a strong reaction, I will not do it again after this week. That being said, I do not see any issues with making and posting paths - we have websites dedicated to it, and the only reason I chose to post here instead is because Rize of the Fenix is not offered on that website."
Rockband,372dro,thewinnerisgeeg,2,Tue May 26 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, all of those paths are out in the public so it's just stuff you can look up. The guitar path here isn't even the highest score."
Rockband,372dro,Plumato,1 point,Tue May 26 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"As noted above, not all paths are public and not all public paths are correct.  Posting paths here does one of two things:   If it is not the correct path, it is unfair to all of the people who use the path to try and enter the contest.  They waste time with this incorrect information.  One of us could intentionally post an incorrect path so that everyone uses it and then submits their own score with the actual path. If the path is correct, it is unfair to all of the other people who have taken time to learn how to path and to path that certain song.  In order to score high in Rock Band, one must both have in-game talent and pathing skills.  Posting paths takes one of these qualities away, and ruins the integrity of the contest and the players with pathing skills.   That said, posting the winning paths after the contest is a fair contribution."

They waste time with this incorrect information.  One of us could intentionally post an incorrect path so that everyone uses it and then submits their own score with the actual path.    It's pretty easy to spot a bad path, though. Just play through the song using it, and if it's not close to the top score then you know you have an incorrect path.     If the path is correct, it is unfair to all of the other people who have taken time to learn how to path and to path that certain song.  In order to score high in Rock Band, one must both have in-game talent and pathing skills.  Posting paths takes one of these qualities away, and ruins the integrity of the contest and the players with pathing skills.    So we shouldn't use previously made paths even though they are readily available and proven to get top scores? That logic is similar to saying you should do complex math problems by hand, even though they can be done quickly with a calculator, just because people before you had to do them by hand. I don't see how it ruins the integrity of the contest. The availabilty of the paths makes sure that everyone can view them, and it's fair to the path's creators too, since they are the ones who decided to make it public in the first place"
Rockband,372dro,Plumato,1 point,Tue May 26 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"So, on how scores work...do you mean we're able to do multiple instruments on each song? Or just one overall?"
Rockband,372dro,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Sun May 24 07:05:18 2015 UTC,There are two things you can compete for. The first is the weekly instrument champ. There are three songs. Say I was competing for the guitar champ this week. I'd play through the three and upload my scores. My scores will be added up and if I'm the highest score for guitar I win this week. It works the same way for all the other instruments too. The other competition adds up all the scores you submit and awards the highest total across every instrument the Rock Legend award.
Rockband,372dro,cdrock7,1 point,Sun May 24 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, so example: drums week 1, guitar week 2, etc."
Rockband,372dro,Storm360,1 point,Sun May 24 16:14:54 2015 UTC,No not as it is currently. Now you post scores in whatever instrument you want. There will be champ of the week for each instrument. Drums guitar bass vocals pro drums pro keys and keys.
Rockband,372dro,Storm360,1 point,Sun May 24 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"Ohh, okay. Thanks!"
Rockband,372dro,Storm360,1 point,Sun May 24 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone. When we were deciding on the format of the competition, I brought up my idea of how I was going to do this. There would be 4 songs per week, but each song would have one instrument assigned to it, and you would have to submit a score for that instrument only. There would also be challenges that allow for participation in the lower difficulties, like getting 100% on a solo, or getting a certain % overall. All of this would be scored by a point system. 2 points for the person who gets the highest score on the song, and 1 point for anyone who completes the song's challenge.   I'd like everyone's input on this, be it positive or negative, as it helps us know what to do next time around. Also, if you have your own idea, we'd love to hear it. Suggestions can be made through here, or through the suggestion poll in the score submission."
Rockband,372dro,cdrock7,1 point,Sun May 24 12:46:24 2015 UTC,"In order to receive the Rock Legend of the Week award, do we have to play on BOTH legacy drums and pro drums?  Also, BOTH legacy keys and pro keys?  It looks like competitors will have to submit 17 scores this week if I'm not mistaken, and 18 if you are accepting Harmonies for Walk of Life."
Rockband,372dro,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Sun May 24 12:57:55 2015 UTC,You don't have to play every single instrument. I'm just going to add up all the scores that get sent in and whoever has the highest across the board wins that particular challenge for the week. It was originally meant to encourage people to play more instruments and leave their comfort zone.  But I think pro charts are worth more so if those are played it'll give you a sight edge? I will only count the highest score posted. Be it pro or standard for those instruments.
Rockband,372dro,AllIWantIsCake,1 point,Sun May 24 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"Getting a new e drum set up so gonna hold off until I've fully set everything up.

Rockband,374raq,invudontseeme,3,Sun May 24 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"The drum fills can be turned off, so it's like the free fills in rb3"
Rockband,374raq,thejordan92,2,Sun May 24 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"My understanding is you still have both RB3 options:  free fills, and no fills at all (so it plays the charted notes).  But being able to save and use your own free fills would remove the problem of lag for the free fills, which might be worse on RB4 than on the last gen systems."
Rockband,374raq,BaddDadd2010,3,Sun May 24 22:35:13 2015 UTC,I understand if they need to make the on disc songs swear free to get their teen rating. But DLC songs should have the option of being uncensored since the ESRB has no say in what content DLC has. maybe even put out a uncensored pack thing for free with all the on disk songs. Hell do what Total War does with the gore pack and charge 5 bucks. I hate those awkward silences in the songs that I would definitely pay it.
Rockband,374raq,Pepperyfish,2,Mon May 25 01:24:17 2015 UTC,"They had the ""learn a song"" section in RB3, but it was only for pro instruments."
Rockband,374raq,Beebou,2,Sun May 24 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"I saw the section, but noticed it was only for pro instruments (and not pro drums). I wasn't quite sure what it was, but it sparked the idea for me."
Rockband,374raq,Plumato,2,Sun May 24 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"The huge, HUGE thing with Custom Songs is licensing. There are bands that REALLY don't want their music in rhythm games, and technically if the companies cared enough, they could sue every person that has made a custom track. Custom songs are never getting supported, lol. It's the hard truth that we all hate. RBN is the closest to customs we'll ever get because the fans chart, not Harmonix.   Wii, however, can play customs online on RB3 because they don't support Wii anymore, lmao."
Rockband,374raq,kerminsr,1 point,Mon May 25 08:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ability to turn off the foot pedal would be great. As far as I know, the ""hero"" games all had this ability from the beginning. And it wouldn't just help people who have neighbors, there are a lot of disabled gamers who can't play drums in RB because they don't have this option.   I agree with you about the singer being able to activate overdrive with the select button. It's so annoying having to wait for a quiet moment to shout ""woo!"" Only to have it not register."

Rockband,371z5s,djx1100,5,Sun May 24 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's damn near perfect, if sometimes perhaps not lenient enough. For the most part, if I miss a note it's my own fault. But I feel like if I get an FC in RB3, it's so much more satisfying than in Guitar Hero for some reason."
Rockband,371z5s,valeforXD,2,Sun May 24 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"Guitar Hero (3 and up) is known for giant hitboxes, whereas Rock Band has some of the best. Harmonix knows best tbh."
Rockband,371z5s,Plumato,1 point,Sun May 24 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just went and played Warriors of Rock to try and find out why, and notes are so easy to hit on that game. I mean, there's more notes, generally, but it still feels easier than Rock Band. Also, failing seems to be a lot harder due to the crowd meter being more lenint, as well. I eventually just gave up with it because, as it turns out, playing it on a slim 360 gives it a really weird audio desync issue."

Rockband,371z5s,valeforXD,3,Sun May 24 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know what's wrong with your audio calibration... seems to work fine for me. I imagine that's the root of the issues, because the RB3 engine feels fine to me and I'm pretty sure it's like, objectively more lenient than the RB2 window.   The only issue that sometimes annoys me is when there's a hopo quickly followed by a strum (like in a G-G-r-R-y-Y-b-B-y-Y type pattern - lower case hopos) any if you try and strum the hopos it kind of screws you."
Rockband,371z5s,TheRingshifter,2,Sun May 24 10:44:48 2015 UTC,I find guitar/bass much easier due to timing windows or something. Drums on the other hand I find a lot harder.
Rockband,371z5s,Sturmgewehr44,2,Sun May 24 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't like Rock Band before RB3, I had only played guitar hero.  When I bought Rock Band 1&2 (They came to Finland at the same time) and I hated them, I couldn't tell the difference between hopos and regular notes, the highway was weird and the games just overall felt wonky and almost broken to me.  I got the Rock Band full band combo later for 50€ and the guitar was SO horrible that I  couldn't use it, I used the drums to play GH Metallica, until they fell apart because they were insanely cheap (since  then I've bought four of them, every one them broke in a few months).  It wasn't until 2012 when I got RB3 as a present and I was like ""yippee, another game I can't get into"" but it was different, the highway was more like GH, the notes looked way clearer, the vocals weren't confusing and annoying as hell with that twitching arrow shit and it felt all around a million times better!  These days I mostly play Rock Band and only switch to GH occasionally."

Once I got it absolutely perfect, I preferred the RB3 engine.   But being even 5ms out on audio was enough for overstrums to start happening, so I hope RB4 has something more 'real' to use for calibration."
Rockband,370ufj,cdrock7,2,Sat May 23 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"How does the HH pedal sensor work? I assume it doesn't use an upright drum head and beater like the bass pedal does, is there just a piezo in the pedal? If so do you have access to it to dampen it? Normally I would recommend simply changing the sensitivity settings but your post says there is no middle-ground. You might be able to make a middle-ground with a dampener like a small piece of foam or tape between the piezo and the pedal."
Rockband,370ufj,smapti,3,Sat May 23 22:44:50 2015 UTC,"HH pedals in kits like that are typically reed switches or something similar to the actual RB or Ion pedal. There's a magnet that triggers the reed switch (basically closing the electronic circuit) when it gets close to the reed switch.   That said, your idea might still work. There's a radius of sorts around the magnet where the reed switch will be triggered. Reducing the pedal travel might help (maybe) by increasing the minimum distance between switch and magnet.   OP, you might also try ""burying the beater"" or keeping your foot down between notes instead of lifting right away. See if the pedal triggers when you have held it down for a second or two and then release it.   Or, it might a short in the pedal itself that's causing it."
Rockband,370ufj,zptc,1 point,Sat May 23 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, you taught me something! But now I'm slightly confused, how can an electronic binary switch have a sensitivity setting?"

Rockband,370ufj,thewinnerisgeeg,2,Sun May 24 01:11:08 2015 UTC,"Why don't you try the bass pedal? Hi-hat pedals are weird, honestly. With my kit (Behringer XD80USB) the hi-hat pedal doesn't work for its intended ingame purpose, but can also be used as a bass pedal. I use my normal chain driven pedal because I prefer it, but the few times I have used the hihat pedal for bass, i noticed that yellow cymbal hits wouldn't register if i had the pedal pressed down mostly, but not all the way. Anyways, I would suggest at least trying the actual bass pedal. Have you used one before?"
Rockband,370ufj,psivenn,2,Sat May 23 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"Does your kit's brain have crosstalk settings? Those are probably what you need to adjust.  I don't know why you would say the hi-hat pedal is more precise than a real kick pedal. More like the RB/GH pedals, yes. My favorite part of my e-kit is the kick pedal."
Rockband,370ufj,evilclownattack,1 point,Mon May 25 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, and my cause wasn't actually the kick trigger, it was the pedal itself.  The way it was set up would have it bounce slightly off the surface of the trigger and fly back, which would register as two hits.  I would recommend adjusting whatever pedal you're using.  Then again, I prefer using the hihat pedal as my kick in RB anyways because a regular pedal is ""imprecise"", buts thats just my opinion."
Rockband,370ufj,evilclownattack,1 point,Sat May 23 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am using the hi-hat pedal.  I have it mapped to output the bass MIDI note (33).  Does your hi-hat pedal not overhit?  I haven't even taken the regular bass pedal out of the box, because I know I wouldn't like it. :P"

Of course YYZ doesn't, but YYZ is both iconic and a staple from GH2, a game without vocals. Is EITS really super big among the average music crowd save for ""Your Hand in Mine""? Loop-pedal based bands like El Ten Eleven or even third-wave bands like EITS have song that feature really slow builds or constantly repeating parts, things I can't imagine being fun for anyone who doesn't already know the song   I'd say definitely look more for bands that have Post-Rock influences in their music.

Rockband,36z6lc,lau1159,2,Sat May 23 10:46:42 2015 UTC,"The dongles just look for the signal of a compatible guitar in its radius.  Idk if it's possible, but I've never heard of anyone making their own dongle.  Unfortunately if you need one the best thing to do is to watch eBay a lot.  All ""full band"" Guitar Hero games (so World Tour and everything after it) are fully compatible with Rock Band instruments.  As for the calibration, it might actually be because GH has a way bigger ""timing window"", or the amount of time you have to a hit a certain note.  Calibration is a complete pain in the ass and in my case it's impossible to get perfect because of controller latency.  The best thing to do is experiment with the manual calibration numbers until you find something that works."
Rockband,36z6lc,evilclownattack,2,Sat May 23 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"As long as A/V latency remains consistent, it should be possible to get it right by calibrating so the game knows how much latency there is, and the game just accounts for that. (Though you can't fix vocal playback (your voice, not scoring) latency - that would require time travel)  Having said that, the home theater in a box that my dad bought, it's latency goes up over time the longer it's turned on... reboot the AV receiver and audio latency is around 60ms, after an hour or two recalibrate and latency is around 180ms... and just switching from Dolby Digital to uncompressed stereo in the game, while reducing latency a bit, doesn't prevent this weird behavior. It gets so bad you notice it while watching regular TV."

Rockband,36y31f,valeforXD,11,Sat May 23 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to focus on bands that lack keyboards, at least as a primary instrument.  Where is My Mind? - Pixies. We have all of Doolittle, it may seem a bit boring but it would be a good lower-tier song.  Maybe another Stone Roses song, like She Bangs the Drums or I am the Resurrection. We only got one from them, so they have more coming.  Chelsea Dagger - The Fratellis. This one has been long overdue after the Fratellis pack. I am shocked we didn't get more based off of how fun that pack was, especially this song.  Mr. Jones or Big Yellow Taxi by Counting Crows. We got Accidentally in Love so we should probably see more of these guys.  Something by Weezer - my guesses are Surf Wax America or The World Has Turned and Left Me Here  Maybe we could see another Radiohead song? I won't get my hopes up for that, though we only have two so far, and Just or Paranoid Android would be great for the game.  Last Nite by the Strokes; we got Reptilia and Under the Cover of Darkness, there is hope for another Strokes song.   Similarly, something by Modest Mouse (probably Dashboard).  Something by Blink-182 as well; Carousel?  We only got two Kelly Clarkson songs, and there are a few decent pop-rock jams she has that would lend themselves well to Rock Band (much better than Stronger and Miss Independent at least).  I'm also hoping for Mastodon; it seems like a realistic possibility.  My Chemical Romance - This Is How I Disappear  Arctic Monkeys - literally anything off their new album.  Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun or Add It Up  Also I'm hoping for more Simon and Garfunkel - last time they came around we didn't even harmonies for them, which is a real crime.  The Clash - Safe European Home (or something else from Give 'Em Enough Rope)  As far as new, unseen artists go, I think some realistic options include The Vaccines, St. Vincent, and Mac DeMarco"

Rockband,36w1hf,thewinnerisgeeg,15,Fri May 22 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Character creation was off the table at one point? That's... kinda scary. I know with keys and pro being dropped a lot of folks are concerned the game's a step backwards rather than forwards, and if we only had premades to play with it'd definitely step back.  Also, a lot of the little details they're talking about aren't going to be noticeable. I remember on the IGN stream chat was screaming bloody murder about how bad the game looked and how nothing was improved. (Granted, twitch chat just loves screaming bloody murder at everything and rarely needs an excuse.) Hopefully there will be a few very obvious improvements we can point to, also."
Rockband,36w1hf,StefanGagne,8,Fri May 22 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Also I think the twitch stream degraded the quality of the visuals.  But yeah, looking up close at these items they look really good, but the game looks functionally identical to RB3 for me when looking at it in action. Hopefully lots of polish gets added before release and they fix the look of the UI, which I don't really like right now."
Rockband,36w1hf,thekindlyman555,5,Fri May 22 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'm worried this game will be too rushed. I feel like the decision to continue production on the game (""full time"") was when the GH rumors started to happen. At production level guitar hero is paces ahead of Rock Band 4 even though RB4 was announced first."
Rockband,36w1hf,illredditlater,3,Fri May 22 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. They're developing along two completely different lines -- one traditionalist (backwards compatibility of old instruments and DLC due to users having extensive libraries) and one experimenting (chucking everything old in favor of something completely different). Both are fully realized concepts, one is just straying very far from its original course.  Honestly, I'm glad they took this route. I WANT to use the hundreds of dollars of songs I bought. My main concern is that they're abandoning features which were already in place. They aren't beholden to INCLUDE keys and pro guitar in every song moving forward, but why disable it for songs we already own?"
Rockband,36w1hf,StefanGagne,6,Fri May 22 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"Because they'd have to put all the effort of porting the charts into the new RB4 engine, code all the keyboard animations, put in new keyboard art assets, make sure it runs ok and looks good, all for very little benefit.  Keep in mind that this is a brand new engine so it's not like they're removing stuff from the game so much as they are failing to add it back in to the new engine. It's a lot more work to completely reconfigure keys to work on the RB4 engine than it would have been to just keep them there if they were using the same engine."
Rockband,36w1hf,thekindlyman555,2,Sat May 23 04:50:35 2015 UTC,"That's one reason I wish they'd gone with keytars in-game. Basically the same animations as guitars for the body, just variations for the fingers. None of the awkwardness of having a keyboardist stuck on stage in front of a piano while everybody else has to animate around them.  They've said RB4 is a living platform, that they're gonna patch in new features. MAYBE they'll add keys back in? I doubt it if Mad Catz doesn't want to release new keyboards, but wouldn't five-lane key parts work just as well on a guitar?"
Rockband,36w1hf,StefanGagne,2,Sat May 23 04:55:53 2015 UTC,"They'd still have to model and animate a range of keytars (and probably pay licensing fees to show brand names) for a feature that they don't immediately plan on continuing. It's a time and money investment that doesn't benefit anyone except the small number of people who want their keyboard to carry forward (who can still play on RB3 if they want)  I understand the pain, I'd like it if they kept everything from the previous games (except the bad features) and just added to it, but Harmonix is a small, independently funded and published developer and they need to prioritize their spending to where it will be most beneficial to the majority of gamers. Hopefully RB4 is a big hit again and HMX can get the funding and desire to add keys back in retroactively."
Rockband,36w1hf,thekindlyman555,1 point,Sat May 23 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"My point is just that I don't feel like the game is anywhere near complete and they are considering leaving out some expected features (character creation being one of them). I'm not saying that their design choices are bad, I just feel like this game is going to be rushed out to compete with the new Guitar Hero. The Guitar Hero demo and soundtrack is already more polished than anything Rock Band has shown so far and just makes me nervous that the initial offering of RB4 might be barebones and lackluster."
Rockband,36w1hf,illredditlater,2,Fri May 22 23:52:38 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind this is still pre-alpha gameplay. Lots of polish will still be going into it before it launches.  Also RB4 was announced BEFORE GH:Live was confirmed to exist. So I don't see how you can argue that they're rushing it to compete with Guitar Hero, since when they announced it, GH:Live wasn't revealed yet."

Rumors were flowing and they wanted to be first ones to the party. They announced the game before major features were even finalized. We still don't even know at this point if our old instruments will work yet that was one of their big feature pushes. When Guitar Hero was announced they had working demos that they sent to publicists, had a track list of roughly 15 or 20 songs, and explained the features of the game. It wasn't like, ""yeah, we're trying to make this live thing happen, but we can't confirm yet if it will.""   I'm nervous because Rock Band's announcements have been vague and what we've seen so far is a very pre alpha of a game, very rough confirmation of which songs will transfer over, 6 song track list, very few random new features, and that's about it. They have a lot of work ahead of them if they are looking at a Q3 or Q4 release."
Rockband,36w1hf,illredditlater,2,Sat May 23 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"Guitar Hero has the backing of the biggest publisher in the world in Activision, whereas Harmonix is independently held and has to self-finance the game or find funding from external sources."
Rockband,36w1hf,thekindlyman555,1 point,Sat May 23 04:46:22 2015 UTC,"This is true and just makes my point stronger. Harmonix is rushing this project out within the year for a game that's still in alpha stage while GH looks farther ahead and has more support. I could care less about guitar hero, but I'm using it as an example because it feels like rock band is severely behind in the dev cycle, they are going to rush this game out so they don't fall behind guitar hero, and any lacking features they'll just say that it's because they can add the features later since they'll be updating the game."

Rockband,36spjd,kerminsr,6,Thu May 21 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"the precision bass is probably the greatest yet most underrated thing for rock band. at this point, I don't think I could play without the split strum bar, its so fantastic  nice find OP!"
Rockband,36spjd,OperationQuip,8,Thu May 21 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who only plays bass when he comes over to play, he always up strums like he's playing a real bass. I can't wait to show this to him!  I was surprised to find that the strum bar is clicky, unlike the standard strat controller. It's definitely a high quality guitar.   When I shop on eBay, I always search by term instead of going to the category I want to shop in. Sometimes people list things in the wrong category, and a lot of people end up not finding the listing because of this. This was listed under ""electronic gadgets"" and was titled something like ""mad catz wireless bass controller - xbox 360"".    Anyway, can't wait to get home to play it!"
Rockband,36spjd,OperationQuip,3,Thu May 21 22:15:32 2015 UTC,"yeah, this was my first real instrument (I had previously played occasionally at friends' house - but not frequently enough to acquire skills) so as a consequence I can only play while strumming upward / plucking  like a bass haha  seriously you'll enjoy it, its one of the better guitars around and yeah its really solid and has a very feedback-driven strum bar"
Rockband,36spjd,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,6,Thu May 21 22:22:42 2015 UTC,Plus you got a couple DLC songs that were pulled from the store!
Rockband,36spjd,SharkSocks,6,Thu May 21 21:41:55 2015 UTC,::update::  The code worked!  I'm surprised. I was expecting a message saying it was no longer available.
Rockband,36spjd,jimpbblmk,3,Fri May 22 02:45:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm curious to see whether the code will work or not. I think I already have two of the songs anyway.   I would have happily paid the price I paid even if it didn't come with the DLC code or the game disc. I already own it on Games on Demand and have a 2010 disc (before the update that prevents customs from being played).  So I don't know what I'll do with the disc. I'll prob give it to my niece along with my old wired RB1 controller.
Rockband,36spjd,SharkSocks,2,Thu May 21 22:06:46 2015 UTC,Big mistake. Mine stopped working a week after I got it and madcatz support was godawful at best.

Really helped my buddy focus more on the game since he usually got stuck playing bass, and, let's face it, some songs are just plain boring on bass.

I'm trying to play it as it was meant to be played: with 2 fingers alternating up-strums.  It's so hard!  Using 2 fingers is really throwing me off, but I noticed that I was starting to get better after a couple of songs.  For me, the best part about Rock Band was seeing my skill level progress.  It's cool how even 7 years after RB1 was released we can buy a new instrument and it lets us experience that feeling of progression all over again."

Rockband,36ugad,iBuildSpeakers,6,Fri May 22 05:38:30 2015 UTC,"I wish they would, but I doubt it.   They haven't said either way, though.  My guess is that they removed versus mode because it doesn't fit with what they want Rock Band to be: a party game where people get together and play together as a band.  They want people to cooperate to play songs, just like real bands do.   So I can see how it doesn't fit with their vision.  That doesn't mean I don't like playing against other players to see who comes out on top.  I'd love it if they brought back versus mode and daily challenges."
Rockband,36ugad,kerminsr,1 point,Fri May 22 06:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a bad feeling too.    We used to have guys vs. girls singing competitions.  So much more enjoyable when they're sharing/battling within a single song rather than having to wait for it to be completely over."
Rockband,36ugad,z0oinks,4,Fri May 22 06:11:38 2015 UTC,"I hope they add it back in, but not just local. An online versus mode would be fantastic, as the only person I really play with also plays drums"

Rockband,36ts6o,BigBananaDealer,11,Fri May 22 01:37:24 2015 UTC,"I never really understood why ""Lump"" was listed as hard as it is on drums. Maybe it's just how I play, though."
Rockband,36ts6o,ClarkGable,10,Fri May 22 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"Most of the Rock Band 3 setlist, honestly. But the one that sticks out the most is ""Something Bigger, something Brighter"" being 7th tier on Guitar when it belongs in fifth tier at best. Also, ""Joker and the Thief"" on bass is one of the easiest things I've ever done; it's definitely not tier 6 material."
Rockband,36ts6o,valeforXD,5,Fri May 22 02:39:48 2015 UTC,IIRC The Look is a five difficulty bass song when it should be much lower.
Rockband,36ts6o,doyoh,1 point,Fri May 22 03:34:25 2015 UTC,"it's devil tier, when it should be like 4 tier"
Rockband,36ts6o,SaintSchultz,2,Fri May 22 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly it should be even lower, like tier 2-3. I was shocked when I played it, expecting something near impossible, not just a bunch of strumming."
Rockband,36ts6o,Mariya_Shidou,4,Sat May 23 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of stuff in RB3, Something Bigger, Something Brighter, like /u/valeforXD said. I think almost everything on Lasso is overrated, same with the H.I.M. song. Vocals on Llama are super easy, in my opinion, it's really fast, but there's no crazy pitch changes. The Look being top tier on bass is a travesty. Sister Christian and Foolin' on guitar are rated pretty highly, but there's only one challenging part in each.  tl;dr, I disagree with 90% of the tierings for RB3"
Rockband,36ts6o,valeforXD,3,Fri May 22 07:25:21 2015 UTC,"I guess if you take just the RB3 songs and compare them all to each other, they sorta make sense. But when you introduce DLC, suddenly these ratings make no sense."
Rockband,36ts6o,Mariya_Shidou,5,Fri May 22 07:55:19 2015 UTC,"The way they tried to do it, I'm pretty sure, was to have an equal amount of songs in each tier for every instrument. That's why there's some really goofy stuff like the examples in this thread and the one before it."
Rockband,36ts6o,spideyjiri,3,Fri May 22 09:11:02 2015 UTC,"Walk Of Life.  Devil tier on guitar, are you shitting me? So, apparently afterlife is clearly easier than Walk Of Life then."
Rockband,36ts6o,TellMeWhyYouLoveMe,2,Fri May 22 13:29:31 2015 UTC,Don't take the Rock Band 3 tiers seriously because they were definitely fudged up to make an even amount of songs per tier.
Rockband,36ts6o,Blenke312,2,Fri May 22 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"I never understood why 'Ramblin' Man"" is a 7 tier song for both bass and guitar.  It really isn't that difficult.  ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver"" should have been a 7 tier song on bass instead of ""The Look"""
Rockband,36ts6o,LumpyArryhead,2,Sat May 23 03:06:25 2015 UTC,Hey There Mr. Brooks has no business being tier 7.    It's especially amusing for me because my sorting puts it right next to We Are The Nightmare which is listed as t6 when it's a mid t7 song.
Rockband,36ts6o,Riker87,1 point,Sat May 23 11:58:23 2015 UTC,Rock Rebellion by Bang Camaro is tier 7 on guitar when in my opinion it should be on the high end of tier 5. Other than the solo there is nothing all that hard in the chart.
Rockband,36ts6o,KJT22,1 point,Fri May 22 04:36:43 2015 UTC,The ending can make people fail pretty easily if they aren't good enough. They don't do the best when it comes to rating songs or even charting them so there's that too lol

It took me forever to FC specifically because of how tiring the first two verses are.  It's basically Run to the Hills-lite.  At least it's fun, unlike RttH.  Only because of the choruses though.  Also, disco beat songs are always overrated on drums.  If they're fast and tiring (or utilize weird sticking patterns) they deserve it, but most of them are boring as fuck but still always seem to get 4 dots or more.  Even user-created charts tend to over rate them."

Rockband,36scvh,Ocean_by_Kramer,8,Thu May 21 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes the click strum bars so great is how you can hear yourself strumming. This makes it easier to keep time in fast strumming sections. With the Rock Band guitar, there's this sense of no definitive point at which the strum has been completed. You just sort of strum and it feels like the bar is hitting some kind of padding. Mad Catz should make one with the micro-click strum bar in addition to the one they currently make.  Also, the rep mentions something about how the micro-click is unreliable. Sure, I've had a guitar hero guitar hero guitar break sooner than I'd like, but that was the GH3 Les Paul, and the issue was the fret buttons. I've had many more problems with the Rock Band guitars than I have had with any other plastic guitars."
Rockband,36scvh,mbsurfer,2,Thu May 21 19:49:27 2015 UTC,I know in Guitar Hero controllers they used Alps switches which is a clicky button switch often used in keyboards

Rockband,36scvh,Ketomatic,1 point,Thu May 21 23:21:19 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT IT'S BIG BOY BARRY. I knew he worked for mad catz but seeing him made me amazingly happy. That was such a cool show when I was a kid...
Rockband,36scvh,JiminyWillikerz,1 point,Fri May 22 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"Don't know if it was just me, but I could barely hear what they were saying with the music being so loud. Did anyone notice that USB port under the battery cover on the drums? Did they say what that would be used for?"
Rockband,36scvh,Evmista,1 point,Fri May 22 01:59:32 2015 UTC,My guess is it will be used to update the controller as well as for plug and play. The latter is speculation but I'm pretty sure about the updates.
Rockband,36scvh,TehScout,1 point,Fri May 22 13:29:33 2015 UTC,Did anyone catch the song they used during the drums presentation?  Heartbreaker by Pat Benatar confirmed for RB4!
Rockband,36scvh,SharkSocks,4,Fri May 22 05:29:21 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was previous RB DLC
Rockband,36scvh,xondak,-5,Fri May 22 09:14:00 2015 UTC,Too bad this isn't coming out for PC. I won't be getting it if there's no PC version. :/
Rockband,36scvh,evilclownattack,4,Thu May 21 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"There has only been 2, technically 3 GH or RB games to come out on PC, none of which did well because of the ""party"" aspect of these games which really only works on console.  And with a now indie budget, there's absolutely no chance Harmonix will make Rock Band 4 for PC."
Rockband,36scvh,xondak,-1,Fri May 22 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"In Guitar Hero and Rock Band's heyday, PC wasn't the gaming platform of choice. Now it is. With Steam Machines coming out, I think Harmonix would be shooting themselves in the foot if they didn't bring their game to Steam Machines."
Rockband,36scvh,evilclownattack,0,Fri May 22 10:39:26 2015 UTC,"GH/RB are known for their appeal to casual gamers, and no casual gamer will own a Steam Machine.  There is no denying that a PC version would sell way less than console, which would make it completely not worth developing at an indie studio that barely has the budget to make the games on console in the first place.  It would also take extra time and money to create PC hardware and bundle it, and copy the massive library of DLC to Steam.  It's just not worth all of it for a studio like Harmonix."
Rockband,36scvh,xondak,-1,Fri May 22 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"While there's a difference between an indie studio making an indie game and an indie studio producing a AAA release, most indie studios agree that supporting all targeted platforms at launch is more cost effective than doing soft launches afer the games been out for a while.   I think you may be exaggerating the cost of porting and supporting DLC, hardware, and such. Both the Xbox 360 and PS3 peripherals work on SteamOS with limited additional cost. Saying they need separate PC hardware is ludicrous.  Also, I take exception to the idea that no casual gamer will own a steam machine. I'd have to disagree. Most of my casual gamer friends are excited for Steam Machines."
Rockband,36scvh,jacktheBOSS,3,Fri May 22 15:46:55 2015 UTC,I would cry. And there would never be another problem with moving the games to the next gen.
Rockband,36scvh,tubingan,0,Fri May 22 01:43:53 2015 UTC,I assume we're gonna need a type of adaptor for connecting both kick pedals. I wanna know more about that.
Rockband,36scvh,mystakin,8,Thu May 21 21:52:58 2015 UTC,The RB2 and (I assume) RB3 kits just have two kick ports in the back of the center console. I would imagine the RB4 kit would be the same.
Rockband,36scvh,tubingan,1 point,Thu May 21 22:53:11 2015 UTC,Really? My RB2 drum kit only has 1.
Rockband,36scvh,SharkSocks,2,Fri May 22 02:10:53 2015 UTC,There's a black headphone jack sized mystery port above the kick pedal port. That's where the second one goes.
Rockband,36scvh,10eazye,-1,Fri May 22 09:15:07 2015 UTC,"Not impressed. They don't seem that much better. Hopefully my GH instruments are supported because, having to use RB4 instruments would be beyond disappointing."
Rockband,36uc5w,ToonamiGuy,2,Fri May 22 04:40:30 2015 UTC,"I called last week looking for a Rock Band 2 export code, and the first code he gave me was Country Pack 2. The code ended up being labeled as ""Rock Band 3 Export"" so if they weren't able to find it for you I think it'd be worth a shot to call and ask for that instead."
Rockband,36uc5w,MechaSheeva,2,Fri May 22 14:27:51 2015 UTC,This reply helped me get a tech to figure out how to get me a Rock Band 2 Export code so thank you very much! Probably off to grab a copy of Rock Band 1 from Gamestop tomorrow for 89 cents so I can export THOSE songs too.
Rockband,36uc5w,sniffsnaff,1 point,Sat May 23 06:19:46 2015 UTC,"Got AC/DC. Thanks buddy! I have been trying to find one of these new around forever! Appreciate it. :)  And yeah, tech support at EA is very conflicted. Been trying for ages to get my legit bought new Metal Track Pack to work and they just don't seem to have a clue."
Rockband,36uc5w,catsrocktubas,1 point,Fri May 22 04:55:14 2015 UTC,did the code OP provided allow for a free download for you or did you still have to pay licensing?
Rockband,36uc5w,sniffsnaff,1 point,Fri May 22 04:56:16 2015 UTC,I haven't loaded up the game yet but I'm pretty sure the ACDC pack is just a straight download with no fee
Rockband,36uc5w,MoltenLavaSB,1 point,Fri May 22 07:33:29 2015 UTC,how did you get them? did you just ask them for it?
Rockband,36rucp,Chaz2132005,4,Thu May 21 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"Main Games: Yes  Rock Band 1 you don't even have to buy new - no code is involved, just boot the game, fully updated, and there's an option to 'export' the tracklist  RB2 you will need to buy new to get a code, but if you get the code, I think it's still possible to export.  Rock Band 3 will not export to RB4, at least not right away. As such there are no details on whether a code would even be needed (as, on 360, at least, some physical copies of the game didn't have a code, and the game was also sold digitally with no code).  Side Games - Not entirely  Lego Rock Band can no longer be exported  Green Day Rock Band can no longer be exported (but all of its songs can be bought in the DLC store anyways)  Beatles Rock Band was never able to export at all.  Rock Band Blitz exports automatically, no codes or even separate downloads needed. Its soundtrack is downloaded right into the RB3 folder on your console, which is where the game gets its songs.  Track packs I don't know much about, but I think they still work if you can get them new/with unused code.  Do make sure you're sticking on the same console family (as you didn't specify). 360 songs will only carry forward to Xbone and PS3 only to PS4."
Rockband,36rucp,sudobyte,2,Thu May 21 17:40:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I plan to get it on PS3 just need to find a way to get a cheap one so I can do it and the. Get rid of it
Rockband,36rucp,floydhead42,1 point,Thu May 21 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"Rock Band 1 and 2 both still export just fine on 360, I did so a few weeks ago."
Rockband,36rucp,sudobyte,1 point,Thu May 21 17:10:44 2015 UTC,How much does it cost to export?
Rockband,36rucp,illredditlater,1 point,Thu May 21 17:56:28 2015 UTC,For US/Canada at least:  RB1 - 5 bucks  RB2 - 10 bucks  Blitz and track packs are free
Rockband,36rucp,illredditlater,1 point,Thu May 21 18:02:46 2015 UTC,ok awesome i can do that ill be figureing out how to do this next week
Rockband,36rucp,sudobyte,1 point,Thu May 21 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"At the moment rock band 3 won't export. Rock Band 1 and 2 might, but good luck finding them new. I don't think you need a new copy of rockband 1 to export though."
Rockband,36rucp,Ketomatic,1 point,Thu May 21 17:14:28 2015 UTC,Can I control the game without the equipment
Rockband,36rucp,Ketomatic,2,Thu May 21 17:55:54 2015 UTC,You can use a controller since that's the needed piece to play vocals.
Rockband,36rucp,idonthaveimagination,1 point,Thu May 21 18:01:04 2015 UTC,thank you
Rockband,36rucp,Bwian,2,Thu May 21 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. The Mic uses the default controller to actually navigate menus, so if you start the game with a controller it will just assume you're a vocalist (it might whine about the lack of a mic plugged in, but it should still work)."
Rockband,36rucp,Jedmart,1 point,Thu May 21 18:01:17 2015 UTC,ok thanks!
Rockband,36rucp,Jedmart,1 point,Thu May 21 18:14:49 2015 UTC,RB1 I had no problems with. RB2 the code I had didn't work since you needed the online code conversion thing. But I got one from this sub and it worked fine! Both my copies of RB1 and 2 were second hand.
Rockband,36rucp,chexmixho,1 point,Fri May 22 01:18:26 2015 UTC,Do you have to have the console to do it or can I go on harmonix website so I have them for when rock and 4 comes out
Rockband,36rucp,Bwian,1 point,Fri May 22 01:25:42 2015 UTC,You need the console to export them now. I'm sure they will have export options that don't need the console when RB4 comes out on the marketplace.
Rockband,36rm7m,Sturmgewehr44,1 point,Thu May 21 15:57:16 2015 UTC,RB hasn't had a patch in a few years. Is your xbox old? Because that could be the problem. I've had my old xbox for close to 5 years (original Arcade model) and recently it would do what you're talking about very frequently. I only tested it on guitar though. I just bought a newer xbox in better condition and everything was fine again.
Rockband,36rm7m,thewinnerisgeeg,1 point,Thu May 21 16:22:22 2015 UTC,It's the slim model that's at most 3 years old.
Rockband,36rm7m,Storm360,1 point,Thu May 21 16:40:46 2015 UTC,Have you tried removing everything (hard drives etc) from the console and seeing if it works? I have a launch 360 that plays RB perfectly so I don't think its age
Rockband,36rm7m,Storm360,1 point,Thu May 21 21:25:19 2015 UTC,"Just tried it without the hard drive in, got about 3 freezes within the first minute.  There is a slight chance that it could be the disc, which is pretty scratched up, though I figured installing it to the hard drive might fix that."
