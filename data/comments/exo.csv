I think he just cares so much about his voice that he never thinks he's good enough and puts too much pressure on himself.

exo,3e01pa,yukiowillll,6,Mon Jul 20 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Usually it just cause what's called flash blindness, like during a camera flash. I can't remember the exact number now, but technically if you have continuous exposure for about 10 s on your retina, it can then cause permanent damage. That usually doesn't happen because your eyes usually sense a light source pretty fast and will move/blink in reflex to avoid it. There are also more powerful laser pointers, like colors other than red, but I can't remember the specifics again."

Those lasers are dangerous to the eyes, and even if they didn't take eye damage they could easily have distracted the boys, which can be SO dangerous on stage.

All of those idols and trainees expect to work and promote in Korea. So all of them speak Korean, including their international members. You have to know the local language, obviously, in order to succeed. I don't think Jongdae and Minseok even thought about the prospect of being in EXO-M much less working mostly in China. It had to have been hard for them too, having little to no Mandarin proficiency. The difference is right there. All of them expected to work primarily in Korea.  Also, I think even most Korean idols have very little time to see their families during the year, apart from holidays. Yes, they're still in Korea, but still. Surely Tao knew what he was getting himself into, signing on to SM, a Korean company?  I understand the feeling of homesickness, and it's fine to feel that way. I've lived/worked abroad for a few years too. I'm not going to be one of those vile netizens mocking his tears but I don't see why he was crying over this. He needs to move forward with his solo career and not dwell on the past so much (which I know is very recent)."
exo,3du7aw,CinderNine,6,Sun Jul 19 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"I think everything you said are great points. I just have a few things to add. While international idols become proficient in Korean, they usually don't get to native speaker levels. And this makes it hard for them to get offers in tv (unless playing that exotic/international angle) or movies in Korea.   I think international idols expect to do the group music promotions in Korea, but also expects to do solo stuff in their home country. That is if they get popular enough in their home country, like 2pm's Nichkhun or Victoria of f(x).   Some of Lay's recent interviews were very insightful. I think he knows exactly what he wants out of his career and if there's anyone that's going to stick it out with EXO it's going to be him.   Like I said before, I think Tao's exit was ugly. He's an emotional person and he's not quite on the same level of maturity like Lay. It just sucks for a young dude to be consistently attacked by netizens.   Edit: I feel so much for Minseok and Jongdae. You can see them trying so hard to learn Chinese. Also, every time I see them not in EXO-K members only commercials it just kills me. They are Koreans and they can't work with their fellow Korean members despite the state of EXO-M pretty much in shambles. Jongdae deserves a solo album more than anyone. And Minseok needs to be showcased more period."
exo,3du7aw,lu-exo-lu,6,Mon Jul 20 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"I feel that Xiumin and Chen are in a type of purgatory - they can't get CFs in China, but they can't be included in the ones in Korea.  I'm surprised they are still doing exo-k only commercials at this point.  At least they seem to have some recent personal gains, with Xiumin on Crime Scene and his upcoming movie, and Chen with the musical."
exo,3du7aw,BECKSTERRRR,5,Mon Jul 20 01:18:56 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Xiumin and CHen had any say in debuting with EXO-M or was it just, ""You guys are debuting with the Chinese subgroup of our new boy band, if you don't like it theres other's who will fill the slot."""
exo,3du7aw,styleszz,5,Sun Jul 19 22:09:20 2015 UTC,"Probably tried to sell it like you can make a lot of money in China...  But seriously, I'm sure Lee Soo Man thought long and hard (I read somewhere that EXO was his last boy group for SM) and has his own reasons for picking Jongdae and Minseok. IMO, Jongdae is the best vocalist and EXO-M needs him.   Minseok is well rounded...although they never showcase his talents. He dances/sings well and rap decently.   They're both mature too."
exo,3du7aw,HurricaneBeifong,7,Mon Jul 20 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"While I think Tao could have left in a classier fashion I don't think anyone deserves the type of hate Korean netizens dish out while hiding behind the anonymity of the internet, not to mention that he also has a lot of Chinese netizen haters too."
exo,3du7aw,Light_Blue,4,Sun Jul 19 14:54:17 2015 UTC,i guess i kinda get why they would feel 'betrayed' but seriously why do they have to immediately call names. i guess some people just have no sympathy for others at all. also can someone please explain the pigeon stuff? i read about it more and more these days

EXO also took home a whopping thirty wins on music shows and won first place in YouTube's 'Most Watched K-Pop Video' of the first half of 2015. Can you handle all this good news?  Meanwhile, EXO will hold fan signings at Seoul's COEX Artium this coming 16th and 17th and at Beijing's MasterCard Center on the following 18th and 19th, which will be the last of their promotions for their second album. SM also stated, ""At this event, fans will get to chat with the members through EXO's official fan club EXO-L's home page, creating a special time to [for the members] to talk with their fans.""  The power of EXO is going strong and it will likely continue into the second half of 2015 so keep on rooting for the boys!     I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles."

Wow Koreaboo, at this rate I should be a journalist.   All you had to do was scroll down and read the PD guy's previous weibo update (I assume your staff can read Chinese since you translated his newest update in your article) to figure out that Lay was at the Shanghai Media Group TV station's post production department visiting the staff of the show he's currently on (Go Fighting). While at the station, he got invited to go live last minutely on the Entertainment news show mentioned in this stupid article. And so it seems like the show was also preparing some Tao related news.   With all the Chinese ex/members of EXO active in China, this isn't really much of a big deal/surprise. It's really just bound to happen.   Good job. Slow clap. You can't even get your click bait story right.   Edit: I can't spell"

exo,3d6pm3,Everlind,5,Mon Jul 13 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Tbh, I'm not sure why he bothered to unfollow Sehun if he's still following Lay...unless bad fallout or something. Also, he still follows some other SM people...Siwon and Zhou Mi. He also still follows Luhan.  I get that strategically/PR wise he should still follow Lay since the Chinese general public has a very strong sense of national pride/unity and will probably give him major shit if he did that to a fellow countryman, like all the hate he got when he unfollowed Kris and wrote about betray on weibo. People were telling him to go back to Korea and even questioned if he was still Chinese. It's ridiculous that national identity gets dragged into this but that's the reality.   Also, China is where he will work now and all the other Chinese members are active there. Maybe they'll eventually interact publicly one day so better not to burn that bridge. Kris, Luhan and Lay all still follow each other on weibo.   But then again, Sehun's probably the most popular EXO member in China and I don't know if Tao'll get hate from the Chinese Sehun fans.  Anyway, I wonder if he'll re-add Kris or something ha. So close to yet so far away from the end of all this drama!"

exo,3d494a,perfectnamja,2,Mon Jul 13 11:59:40 2015 UTC,For 3 months people hated on Tao for all of this. They called him a traitor and a liar and many still call him like that. And now there's people who hate on Chanyeol (and I really hope they don't go after Baekhyun too) for unfollowing Tao.   When did this became a war?  Team Tao vs Team Chanyeol? Wtf is wrong with these people?
exo,3d494a,A_dead_Teemo,4,Mon Jul 13 13:55:35 2015 UTC,Tao has had a lot of support on social media in addition to posts calling him a liar and a traitor.  There's lots of posts from fans saying they will support him no matter what.  It's very invested fans who feel that way who are hating on Chanyeol for unfollowing Tao.  They feel that he (and Baekhyun) should be supporting Tao's endeavours because it's what Tao wants to do no matter what.
exo,3d494a,mariabeggi,6,Mon Jul 13 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"I think its okay if they don't want to support him. I don't really know how I feel about all of this, but I guess they are not okay with how everything turned out. They must feel hurt..."
exo,3d494a,A_dead_Teemo,2,Mon Jul 13 14:19:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know that. I was and still am one of the fans who support Tao and in or out of EXO he is still my precious baby peach. But hating on Chanbaek is unnecessary. We don't even know why they unfollowed him. And tbh this is just freaking Instagram, nothing more than an sns. Not following him on Ig doesnt mean they hate him or that they don't support him. We will never know about this unless they speak about it and I doubt that they will"
exo,3d494a,Zarilea,2,Mon Jul 13 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"I think all this following and unfollowing thing that's going on between the boys is childish. I don't really have much of an opinion regarding Tao's decision to leave, but all this stuff makes me think they were  ""fake"" friends. I know the rest of the boys probably felt betrayed but... I don't know. All this drama makes all of them look ugly."
exo,3d494a,contagiouschemi,13,Mon Jul 13 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"I think before they are friends they were co-workers. Since with most kpop groups management builds the group, it's not you and your buddies getting signed by a label.  Like any work place you get along with your co-workers and spend time with them (at work and outside work), but at the end of the day there are people you get along with better.  Additionally if there's a falling out between friends it doesn't mean friendship before was fake, it just means that something irreparable has happened and this is how they are dealing with it.  It's just on view for the rest of us to see."
exo,3d494a,Zarilea,8,Mon Jul 13 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"Also if they're feeling betrayed or any sort of feeling like that then they're perfectly right to unfollow him, if I feel like someone has wronged me I don't want to continuously see their posts on social media"

I just hope that one day he will be given the freedom to either produce a song for EXO or release something by himself - a mixtape for example - and kill me  a fan can only dream..."

exo,3d1dl2,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Sun Jul 12 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"No particular reference! I think on showtime Suho was always paying for things and they call him rich. I honestly can't remember where I saw/read most of this...  He's from a good family, his dad is a professor I think. They live in an expensive part of Seoul. He went to a good school and I think got into a really good University. I think they also call him the second Siwon (but 10cm shorter lol) of SM because A) they supposedly look alike and B) they're both rich. Although I think Siwon's family richness is on a different level."

I'm only like 15 - 20 minutes in, and you have done everything in your power to avoid ANY close up shots or focuses when he is soloing or whatnot.  We all KNOW he was there.  If you weren't going to show or acknowledge him at all then why bother releasing this version of the concert when we already have the Japan one?  You are NOT showing the full experience.

exo,3d0mtp,perfectnamja,6,Sun Jul 12 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this, but I've been thinking about what's happening with Tao, and what I'm seeing on social media about it.  I am bothered by some exo-ls idea that apparently an idol is above critique and can't be questioned in their motives.  You should be able to look at something objectively and not be seen as an ""anti"".  I don't believe in just blindly supporting anyone.  For example, you can be a Lay or EXO fan and should be able to say ""Yeah he took that betrayal too hard on Go Fighting, he really blew that out of proportion"" and not get dragged because how could you think that and call yourself a fan. In the same vein you can be a Tao or EXO fan and say, ""I think Tao is serving his own interests here because of x, y, z evidence"" in discussion and not get told to shut up, keep your opinions to yourself or being labeled ""not a true fan"".  I'm not talking about being an anti and saying terrible things about an idol, but just realizing that you can be objective and have a conversation about it.  I think there's people who feel that way but don't want to say anything because fervent supporters will attack them, blame SM exclusively and not be open to the discussion."
exo,3d0mtp,HurricaneBeifong,5,Mon Jul 13 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah people's emotions about kpop can be super extreme, so it can be hard to express a moderate or negative emotion without someone getting in your face about it.

What the heck could you say about him? He's a fairly good singer, he's a pretty good leader, he's a really nice guy. People are dumb. Don't let it get to you, Dom."
exo,3d0mtp,DinoDomi,2,Tue Jul 14 04:21:27 2015 UTC,I don't know why he's getting hate. He somehow got dragged into the drama that's been happening lately and he has nothing to do with it whatsoever. sigh I'm so sad he's getting unnecessary hate. My thoughts right now.

But what these people are doing... actively hating him, by making hate blogs around him... like WTF why?  He's literally one of the kindest, hardworking members.  He genuinely looks after everyone and tries so fucking hard to lead this group.    That's not to say he's perfect.  Hell, none of them are.  And of course call a member out and criticize when they do or say something problematic.  But straight up hating and disrespect?  In my book there is no excuse for that."

exo,3d0mtp,Avaria_,3,Sun Jul 12 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"I almost can't believe they're coming back so soon after their first tour here, but it makes sense with how fast the shows sold out. You're so lucky! I payed $175 for my ticket and I didn't even win the hi touch (the person in the seat next to me did tho ;~;). Who's your bias?"

exo,3d0mtp,Avaria_,3,Sun Jul 12 18:08:19 2015 UTC,Ahhh I have way too many biases >~< Jhope is my BTS bias followed very closely by Jimin. For Exo it's Kyungsoo and my ultimate bias is Yongguk from B.A.P. Will this be your first fansign/hi touch or have you been to any others before?
exo,3d0mtp,Titaneon,2,Mon Jul 13 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"My first one. And I'm so happy it's with BTS.  Don't get me wrong, I love EXO. So so much. I would love to have a fansign with them... but I love BTS just a little bit more.  I'm debating on drawing some fanart of them and giving it to them :D Then having them sign some copies for me to take home cx I really doubt they'll keep the drawing but I'd really love for them to at least see it, ya know? c:  EDIT: I LIED. I FORGOT. I've been to a fanmeet/sign with a group before, but not a kpop group. It was with IM5, idk if you've heard of them. That was a complete disaster, though cause it was really last minute. Hopefully I'm more prepared this time since I know a couple months in advance."
exo,3d0mtp,Avaria_,3,Mon Jul 13 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"Hopefully whatever management group putting on the fansign is a good one because it makes a big difference! So far I've had a hi touch with B.A.P, VIXX, and a hi touch/fansign with Block B. VIXX was, sadly, a little disappointing because the management company was a mess and rushed us through the whole thing in about 2 seconds flat T-T  I haven't heard of them before (probably bc I'm old and not hip with the times lol) but I hope your Bangtan fansign goes a lot smoother for you!"
exo,3d0mtp,Titaneon,3,Mon Jul 13 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh. Okay, that fansign was a really great experience, though. It's a long story and I wanna share so buckle your seatbelt and prepare for extreme cringe.  It was July 2014... A young Avaria was on vacation in San Antonio. She knew her favorite boyband was in town for a concert with Mr. Todrick Hall, but unfortunately she was unable to purchase tickets because the concert was that night. The night she and her family were to return home. For their last day in town Avaria's family decided to go to Six Flags because her little sister wanted to get a henna tattoo. As they walk into the park, something catches Avaria's eye. A sign, just like any other sign. However, there was something special about this sign. It had the logo of her favorite boy band, IM5, printed on it with the words ""Come and meet"" typed above it.  She screamed like she had never screamed before. The fansign was but an hour away. She asked at the assistance center to find out where the event was to happen and waited. Slowly more and more young women and girls entered the establishment with notepads and such, hoping to have their favorite idols sign something for them, but she was in the front of the line. She would get to see them first. After a few more minutes of waiting, she glanced up the stairs into the room that the boys would be in and saw him. Her bias, Will smiling down at her. She screamed which caught the attention of girls around her and led to a scream fest.  After a few more minutes, a representative came down the stairs and explained the procedure to the girls waiting in line. She gestured for the first few to follow her upstairs, Avaria being in this small group of five. She slowly entered behind the two girls in front of her, the five boys that were sitting behind a table standing up to greet them. Avaria waited patiently at the end of the table as the two girls went ahead of her, at a complete loss for words.  ""Hey, there,"" she heard a voice say. She slowly looked up to meet the eyes of him. Will Jay Behlendorf. She could feel the blood rush to her face as she slowly stuttered.  ""H-hi..."" He smiled at her as tears threatened to fall. ""Oh my gosh, Will!"" She went in for a hug, wrapping her arms around him as his went around her as well. After a moment, they parted, her entire body shaking from the nerves. She couldn't think straight and stood there in silence, trying to decide what to say.  ""So... it's pretty hot here in Texas, isn't it?"" She stifled a laugh, the nerves slowly leaving her.  ""Yeah, it is... I'm kind of used to it, though. I live here.""  ""Really? In San Antonio?""  ""No, I live a few hours south of here. I'm on vacation.""  ""Well, I live in L.A. It's a lot cooler there than here.""  ""Yeah, I've been there before, the weather was really nice.""  ""Alright, next please!"" the representative said. Avaria looked towards her, then back towards Will.  ""...So, do you have anything for me to sign?""  ~~~  TL;DR: The cringe. I Literally talked to him about the weather. The freaking weather. It doesn't help that he's just as awkward as I am, either. This is why I'm hoping to prepare something to say to BTS. I don't want this to happen again. Godamnit."
exo,3d0mtp,Avaria_,3,Mon Jul 13 04:41:23 2015 UTC,Ohh that's so exciting!! Does everyone who attends the concert get to go to the fansign? Or are people selected?
exo,3d0mtp,oshuddup,2,Sun Jul 12 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"The hitouch is for anyone who attends. The fansign you have to pay a bit extra for, but the ticket was so cheap I'm willing to do that cx"
exo,3d0mtp,Avaria_,3,Sun Jul 12 18:09:27 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I would too! So are you already thinking of what you're going to say to them/ask them at the fansign? :P"

exo,3d0mtp,Titaneon,3,Fri Jul 17 20:16:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I hope those users get reported and there's enough uproar in the community for people to understand that there are consequences to that stuff. I'm sure your concert will be great!!
exo,3d0mtp,mariabeggi,2,Fri Jul 17 20:17:29 2015 UTC,"God, this is like that BigBang thing all over again. At least they didn't cancel the entire concert, that would've been so sad for the Northern ARMYs."

exo,3d0mtp,mariabeggi,4,Fri Jul 17 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"Has anyone else experienced unnecessary negativity towards liking kpop/kpop guys? I showed some of my 'open minded' friends a pic of Baekhyun because I was admiring his eye make up and all they could go on about was how gay he was and how he and kpop guys aren't 'real men'. All I could think was, if they have a son later and their son likes make up (or other 'non manly' things) are they going to say those things to him too? (I understand it's not the norm in the West for guys to wear make up, but it's not unheard of for performers...) Sorry to put a damper on the mood, I was just so dissapointed cause I've known them for ~9 years and did not expect this from them. I guess I'll have to watch some crack videos to cheer me up. :P"
exo,3d0mtp,oshuddup,2,Sun Jul 12 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"All my friends mostly told me: they're ugly, they don't make their own songs so they don't deserve recognition, they all look the same, Yixing is ugly (she's dead now), they look like girls, etc etc. While I know its a matter of taste, I strongly disagree with everything. And I love makeup on guys. I once painted my ex-bf's nails black, and I thought it looked awesome. And I always asked him to let me put make-up on his eyes but he didn't let me :c so emo"
exo,3d0mtp,HurricaneBeifong,3,Sun Jul 12 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's one thing to have a different taste but this is just bashing from them.. :S I don't really understand where the negativity comes from though. The argument that they don't make their own songs is silly, because even famous artists in the US don't write all of their songs lol.  Aww well at least he let you paint his nails!! Haha that sounds fun to me too."
exo,3d0mtp,Avaria_,2,Mon Jul 13 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly! And they can dance, sing, play instruments, perform and act. Its okay if they don't know how to compose, its not an easy thing to do if you want quality songs. They spent all their time learning how to sing and dance and other stuff, it's totally okay if they don't compose their songs, they are the ones performing them and its enough for me to feel really proud of them. And we have Promise, that is the most beautiful song of all times.   god they are amazing"

I decided to go with the stud instead of a ring because I figured it would snag my hair less but I'll probably get a ring (like Kai's in LMR) once it heals. It didn't hurt at all to get done, but of course it's starting to ache pretty good now. I feel kind of weird about it now but I think I just need some time to get used to it- I haven't gotten a piercing since I was like 7.  Edit: the more I look at the pic though, the more I like it :).

exo,3d0mtp,HurricaneBeifong,2,Thu Jul 16 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't been on the sub because of the time difference in Taiwan lately, but I feel like I should have popped in. So Tao's basically just not a member anymore. That was a great bit of fucking sobstory to have been dumped on me in a total of five minutes of checking the sub's posts for the past week.  A perk of being in an Asian country is being able to walk to your local CD shop and purchase an EXO album without going online! So I did! I got myself a Lay Chinese version EXODUS album and and good ol' MAMA poster, EXO-M of course.   The only downside to being in Taiwan is that since I'm a halfie, I look white to people in Taiwan (which is weird because I thought I looked Asian but I guess not Asian enough) and the girls in the EXO section of the store just looked at me in the most condescending way. Which was sad. I saw that they had EXO Wolf merchandise and I was like OMG FRIEND I LOVE EXO TOO LET'S TALK ABOUT EXO AND OUR BIASES OMGOMGOMGOMG but no they hated me ;~;  Anyways, that's how Taiwan's been~"

What did I miss?   As for me, I read 10080 this week and it fucked me up. So many emotions, ChanBaek is love and life for me right now. This fic got me crying from the first paragragh and after finishing it, i was crying the whole day and I cry again whenever I think about it. So beautiful yet so sad ;-; starts crying again  Aside from the sadness that came with 10080, the past few weeks i've been listening to EXO M's Mirotic and I have only one thing to say: I WANT THIS SONG TO BE PLAYED ON MY FUNERAL! PLEASE! Like ??????? I dont even know what's going on. Jongdae's voice? A+++++++++++++! Yixing and Minseok have some decent lines and are freaking killing it! Luhan looks so damn good I'm not gonna start talking about his voice cause I will never be able to stop and Taoris' rapping, jeeeeez. If anyone doubts how good Kris and Tao's voice sound you better listen to this video and never talk again. Everyone sound so good and look so hot help me  Also, I officially hate Jongdae because he is fcking my bias list and he has no permission to do it whatsoever. And he's going to be on a musical soon, what am I supposed to do? This boy is a bias wrecker, gtfo Chen! LEAVE ME ALONE!  Lastly, I was watching TLP in Seoul the other day and I noticed that during the show not only did they cut Luhan's parts but the camera never, and I mean it, never showed him. Like he was singing, you could hear him or see him in the background but the camera would point on someone else or on the fans. I kinda I understand why SM did this but its so lame. Like you know he's in it, if you dont want to show him why are you even selling this? Since you decided ""fk it i paid to make this"" at least show us some Luhan. But I guess I should be happy they didnt blur him as they have done in the past. Oh and btw, do any of you kind people have the link for the TLP in Japan with the subs? I lost the link and I can't find it :/  this is a rant, i know but fk it"

exo,3cwvna,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Sat Jul 11 14:10:53 2015 UTC,It's a little weird. Lay has a really good relationship with Hunan TV because Hunan is his home base. He's been on their programs since he was a kid as a child performer. Lay has been doing really well popularity-wise in China too especially due to his participation in Go Fighting! Why would Hunan TV do something like this? Unless there's some kind of genuine mistake?  Something just doesn't add up. Hm.
exo,3cwvna,maywind,2,Sun Jul 12 00:26:28 2015 UTC,"However, it is expected that Lay will still appear on the show in the “celebrities” segment and that Tao will be filming for the show starting next week.

exo,3cwvna,Shogun_Ro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:16:35 2015 UTC,I guess Tao is a bigger celebrity then? or it could just be a simple mistake with the hints and whatnot.
exo,3cwvna,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Sat Jul 11 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Unfortunately, Tao has a lot of haters (at least online) in China. But if you look at numbers of weibo followers, it's Kris>Lay>Luhan>Tao>Sehun. The rest don't have weibo.  I also saw something about baidu (Chinese site) fan clubs numbers... can't remember where now but someone was curious since T-ara surpassed SNSD in terms of baidu fan club members so they looked it up for EXO. And it was Lay>Sehun>Yeol... and I can't remember the rest.   Yeah, I hope it's a just a mistake. But I doubt Lay and Tao will appear on screen at the same time."
exo,3cwi28,asdfjklmthrowaway,7,Sat Jul 11 11:01:18 2015 UTC,His studio also reblogged the news that Tao is going to be the 4th judge/mentor on the 3rd season of the show Let's Sing Kids.

exo,3cwgye,A_dead_Teemo,3,Sat Jul 11 12:07:01 2015 UTC,"Well I don't think we'll ever know their personal feelings, unless they choose to voice them.  Now that Tao will be actively solely in China, instagram kinda becomes his outlet/promotional tool  with the international fans (since IG is banned in China). And by unfollowing the rest of the members he's saying I am no longer associated with EXO imo. And to make it not awkward, he just went ahead and unfollowed everyone. And like I said, he hasn't changed his weibo followings because the Chinese media will have a shit storm with that one.  Sehun was following people, even Miranda Kerr at one point and had a different user name.  It was @xlkslb_ccdtks, which stood for every member's name and ordered by age before it was @oohsehun cause shit happened and he just unfollowed everyone eventually.   Seriously though, everyone should just pull a CL and never follow anyone in the first place cause A) it spells out that this is my channel to promote only myself and B) no one gets bashed for unfollowing anyone."

And now whenever talk of him leaving comes up, that post gets to see the light of day in Chinese media.  It'll be interesting to see how and what he does in China, given the fact that there are lot of netizens who appear to hate him, and that rap/hiphop isn't really mainstream.   Edit: I'll probably get downvoted for this too."
exo,3cszps,A_dead_Teemo,7,Fri Jul 10 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"Ha, I actually forgot about it until all of this drama about him leaving came up! Unfortunately, he kinda screwed himself up with that.  I agree with you, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how his career goes. I mean, he only seems to have a positive image with international fans? It seems both China and Korea aren't very supportive of him, though I could be very wrong. At least with Kris and Luhan there was initial doubt and gossip, but the public (Chinese, idk about Korean) ultimately accepted it as truth that they were ill and being overworked. But for Tao.. idk, we saw pictures of his injuries, but the whole recording solo music/dancing/having fun on vacation (while supposedly resting) thing isn't really helping his case. It actually makes him look sketchy.  As for his music, I feel like it won't work out due to its genre, but who knows? I think he should just do acting, imo. For China, that seems to be a tried and true path... But it would be hilarious if he had to work with Kris lol  Edit: omg this makes me look like I hate Tao. xD I'm just trying to look at it objectively, I promise!"
exo,3cszps,mariabeggi,5,Fri Jul 10 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're being pretty objective and unfortunately some people will still see any analysis of the situation as bashing. Yes, we don't have the complete picture (and we never will) but it shouldn't stop anyone from forming and voicing an informed opinion. Sorry, I'm just really against it when people say you shouldn't judge because you don't know everything etc. First of all, it's personal opinion and obviously we form opinions on limited info or without knowing the whole situation all the time irl, so why not here.   Honestly, I don't know how it'll go for him in China. I remember reading his father's original letter on weibo and 9/10 of the top upvoted comments were negative. And it seems most Chinese commenters think he's using his father 'forcing my son to leave' as an excuse because of what he so dramatically wrote/felt about Kris leaving in the past. However, he does have a fan base too. I've already commented about the injuries and treatment in the states before so so I don't want to rehash it here again.   I also think he'll for sure branch out into movies. While the Chinese music market is 'big-ish' purely due to population, artists still make money through touring, like everywhere else in the world, but it's particularly that way in China because zero crap is given about copy right and intellectual property. I remembering vacationing in mainland China and I don't think I saw one legit copy of an album in a music store (in a non touristy area). I hope for Tao's career that he doesn't work with Kris because Kris can't rap, in English or Chinese. Sorry it's the truth. On the other hand, the Chinese movie industry is way bigger and more established. And he'll get lead roles/roles that pays a lot because of his name recognition. I just hope papa Tao will let him act in a martial arts/action movie, like Tao said he wanted to try, cause that may leads to more injuries."

exo,3cszps,momobota,4,Fri Jul 10 16:48:38 2015 UTC,Only Lay can do that it seems...
exo,3cszps,perfectnamja,14,Fri Jul 10 17:16:11 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to be mean but why would Chanyeol be supportive. Tao already removed EXO from his ig bio. And not too long ago Tao's exodus CD contained the message 'believe me we'll always be together'.  Chanyeol also unfollowed Luhan so at least he's consistent.  Edit: I hope SM's just wording the official statement now so everyone moves on.
exo,3cszps,PM_ME_YOUR_FOOD_OR,9,Fri Jul 10 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm not upset at Chanyeol.  I'm looking at it from the perspective of what this means as far as Tao's reasons and methods of departure. If he had everyones support I would take it as an indicator of his departure being justified, but the idea that he hasn't got that support suggests that his departure didn't have the groups best interest in mind :("

exo,3cszps,perfectnamja,3,Fri Jul 10 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"On weibo all the Chinese members still follow each other, except Tao, who only follows Lay.  I think it's because they don't want to get backlash when they unfollowed someone...and Tao, well he gets emotional and do things."

exo,3cnxhp,EXOFAN,9,Thu Jul 9 14:22:51 2015 UTC,"He's the one in red.   Well, shaving where and how much is really a societal thing and it's more of a norm for asian male celebs to shave their armpits. Asians are generally not that hairy to began with and there's a negative/exotic connotation with hairiness, just like with darker skin. Often times, when a male celeb is in a sleeveless top and raises his arm, he'll often use the other hand to cover up his arm pit out of courtesy/social norm.   Edit: I've definitely seen Lay with hairy pits though. I think he shaved it for the Exo'luxion concert series since he has a dance solo in a tank top."

exo,3clpog,lexxxluthorrr,4,Wed Jul 8 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"CONTINUED  You're shocked into silence. Words just won't come out. Your head is spinning. What the fuck did Baek just say to me? you think. You don't know how much time as gone by since he popped that damn question but by the look on his face you'd guess long enough to make him feel extremely worried you'd say no.   I gotta say something quick before he starts crying omg. & Just as you're about to respond you realize that Baekhyun actually hasn't moved or changed expression since your inner dialogue started.   ""Has time.....frozen? Wha- what's happening?"" you manage to stammer out. You frantically look around the room, nothing is moving, dust particles are frozen in the air, the tree lights are paused mid-twinkle, the cheesy Christmas special on the TV has gone still.   You shakily & hesitantly reach out to touch Baekhyun's face when suddenly Kai appears out of nowhere, Tao, Lay & Chanyeol in tow.   ""WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING? TAO, DID YOU DO THIS? WHAT ARE KAI, LAY & CHANYEOL DOING HERE?!"" You're screaming at the top of your lungs, these idiot boys ruined you perfect marriage proposal, (even if that little bugger Baek was hours late).   Tao looks at you cooly as he removes his Gucci glasses. Why the fuck is he wearing those it's dark & we're indoors? ""We're here to stop this proposal. I can't allow my beef brother to marry you when Chanyeol loves him more. Baekyeol for life. Bros before hoes.""  Just then you realize that while Tao was speaking Lay had moved over to the frozen Baekhyun. He reached for Baek's head & held it in his hands. ""You may not know this, but part of my healing abilities include being able to manipulate memories. I usually use this aspect for PTSD, but as Tao said, bros before hoes. I'm removing you from Baekhyun's memories & inserting Chanyeol in your place."""
exo,3clpog,lexxxluthorrr,4,Fri Jul 10 03:37:10 2015 UTC,"You attempt to run towards Lay & Baek but you realize that Tao has frozen your body from the neck down. You desperately look towards Kai for help but he’s looking at his phone paying no attention to the situation at hand. That asshole is probably texting Sehun or Kyungsoo, shit.  You turn your head to see Chanyeol glaring at you menacingly. He looks just like how he did in his Exodus teaser except he’s not in the middle of a forest he set on fire.  “Chanyeol, “ you sob, “WHY? Baekhyun loves me & I love him!”  “PLEASE. I love him more than you could ever love him. I love him more than I loved my ferrets. I love him more than I love Sandara noona. & He loves me. You just manipulated him into loving you. You must be able to control minds. But soon, Baekyeol will live on. Our ship will finally sail into the sunset, just like the last ship to leave middle earth in the end of Return of the King.” You beg & plead for them all to stop this nonsense but they all begin chanting “bros before hoes” like gregorian monks. It was oddly hypnotic & it somehow shut you up & you blacked out.  You came to just in time to witness Tao preparing to press the play button on time. You can move again & as you look around you realize that the rest of EXO is also there now. Everyone is gathered around where Baekhyun had been frozen on one knee in front of you, but in place of where you had been standing, Chanyeol was now in your place.  Before Tao started up time again for Baek, the 11 other EXO members turned towards you & in unison said, “There’s no hope for you. There’s nothing you can do.”  You sat there on the couch knowing they were right, there was nothing you could do to stop this madness. You try to reason with yourself. Well, before Baek & I met, I was a big Baekyeol shipper. Maybe this is meant to be. Maybe if I tell them that, then they won’t burn me alive.  With a snap of his fingers, Tao set time in motion once more.  “Well? Answer me already! Will you marry me…Chanyeol?”  “YES BAEK YES OF COURSE! Let’s elope right now.”  “Not so fast,” scoffed Sehun. “There’s no eloping. If you’re getting married, you’re gonna have a real wedding. I’m gonna plan it & we’re gonna do it right.”  You remained on the couch, invisible to all 12 of the boys as they exchanged hugs and laughs & clinked glasses in a congratulatory manner for their bros’ engagement. Seven tears slide down your cheek.  Suddenly, you wake up. “Holy shit,” you say, “I just had the craziest dream Baek, there was the rest of EXO & this bros before hoes stuff &…HAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!” You burst into laughter. Hysteric laughter.   Just then a man in white opens the door to your room. Your white, sterile room with padded walls.   “How are you feeling? Looks like we may need to up your medication dosage. You’re having those dreams again aren’t you?”  END"

exo,3cg387,Bmoresgoddess,9,Tue Jul 7 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Exo L is the name for the fanclub, so that what fans call ourselves. Exo itself is generally split into two groups, Exo-K who perform in Korean and Exo-M who perform in Mandarin Chinese.  Two members have definitely left, both of them Chinese members from M: Luhan and Kris (Wu Yifan). It's generally accepted that they left because SM, the company in charge of Exo, treated them realllllly shitty and overworked them like crazy. Another Chinese member, Tao (Huang Zitao) may also be leaving for similar reasons, plus a long series of injuries that were never allowed to heal properly. He isn't on the new songs on the latest repackage and he isn't promoting the songs with the group. He's currently in LA.  That leaves 9 members definitely still in the groups. Things are a little questionable as to the future of Exo-M since so many members aren't around, but that's the basic rundown.  Hope this helps!"
exo,3cg387,HurricaneBeifong,3,Tue Jul 7 17:32:04 2015 UTC,It does! Thank you so much!
exo,3cg387,Zarilea,4,Tue Jul 7 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"Exo hasn't ""split up"". They are still very active and promoting. Unfortunately, two members of EXO-M have left after they merged into one group. Kris and Luhan are currently dealing with SM to break out of their contract.   There has been rumors of Tao leaving EXO but it's just rumors and nothing has been confirmed yet. He is currently doing his own thing and not promoting with the rest of the group. There has been no official statement regarding his separation from EXO or SM. So right now, the only two members that have officially left EXO have been Luhan and Kris.  Of course, the members have their separate activities going on. D.O is currently filming a drama. Lay has his own studio in China and has been promoting solo over there, like Chanel, the SM mobile game and Go Fighting. But don't worry, Lay has informed us that he will not be leaving EXO.  EXO-L stands for EXO-LOVE which is the fandom of EXO. It's EXO-M & EXO-K fans coming together and supporting EXO as a whole.   I'm a new EXO fan so correct me if I'm wrong. :)"

exo,3cg387,A_dead_Teemo,5,Wed Jul 8 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what everyone has said is true. EXO is still an active group and two members from EXO M have left for personal and health reasons. There is a chance that another member, Tao - also from the M subgroup - might leave for health reasons but the rumors about him leaving are flying around for 3 months now and the last SM update said that they are still negotiating with him so we don't know for sure. He is getting treatment and studying music in LA at the moment and he's hanging around in pretty much every amusement park there so if you are in LA you might even see him but if you find him pls don't stalk him :p  Btw the terms EXO K and EXO M aren't used too often anymore mainly because they perform and promote together (mostly in Korea) but SM hasn't officially ditch them yet.   As for EXO-L, I think I've heard Suho, the group's leader, say that the name of the fandom came from the fact that the letter L connects the K and M letters in the alphabet just like we connect with them thus ""We Are One""."

I know it is irrational to be upset about this because we obviously only know a small portion of the story and ultimately Tao has to take care of himself and do what makes him happy, but it still hurts."

exo,3cdv2h,maywind,7,Tue Jul 7 10:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly puzzled by some of the reactions here saying this is contrary to what Tao's dad claimed as the reason for Tao ""leaving"" SM.   I've read Tao's dad's original letter / blog post. Tao's dad said that Tao endured many injuries but his family put up with it all because SM promised Tao that the company would be supporting his solo activities and would be setting up a personal studio for him in China. Tao's dad even had extensive talks with SM officials about this and shared many ideas with SM. However, when news came out that it was Lay who would be getting his own studio and not Tao, Tao's dad felt disappointed and betrayed on behalf of his son (especially due to the many injuries Tao sustained and one of them wouldn't even heal properly anymore because the best time to treat it was already past). From Tao's dad's perspective, SM misled them and promised them something that they never delivered. This, compounded with Tao's injuries, was why he made the decision that Tao should withdraw from SM.  I don't think any of this is in conflict with Tao wanting to pursue his solo career now. He had always intended to do this, just not with SM anymore (who in Tao's family's eyes, was a company that used him and misled him with false promises).  Also, I'm very clearly making a distinction between EXO and SM here. To me, Tao's dad's issues were with SM the company, not EXO the group. His dad made him leave SM and of course this meant he had to withdraw from EXO too. But, based on his dad's account of what happened, Tao did not voluntarily want to leave EXO the group."
exo,3cdv2h,asdfjklmthrowaway,6,Tue Jul 7 14:08:39 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good example of reading the same thing but drawing different conclusions based on one's life experience.  While I don't doubt his father's legit concern regarding his own child's health I don't get the betray comment in his letter. And unfortunately, the Chinese language is not one that's innately or concise. Essentially reading the Chinese original, Tao's father said he was excited to discuss details of setting up his studio. And that after signing the contract SM said they'll announce the news for Tao and another member together. The talk was going on so well that all it lacked was some signatures when the news for the other member's happened. And he went on saying that he wants to say so much that there is nothing to say.   The last part particularly left me ???  I just don't get how this is an act of betray. Lay is a saint and works so hard. I see Lay getting his own Chinese studio as a reward of his hard work but also a step forward for Tao, and a change in SM Chinese market strategy. And what is the hurry to set up the studio? Even Lay said in interviews that it took many years of discussion to get it. And since Tao's injured he should be resting and not working in China. Even more senior people like Victoria of F(x) and (rumoured) Zhou Min of SJ-M are working on but haven't got their studios yet. As as much as I find Tao baby endearing I don't think he's on the same maturity level as Lay. Also, what other Korean entertainment companies give their Chinese artists their own studio? None. And it's not as if Tao didn't have solo stuff in China under SM on top of EXO promotions last year. He was casted in a big movie (before Lay) and made some variety appearanches with Heechul (I think) and Chen.   Edit: Wrt to the injuries, I work in the medical field and I feel I already wrote a lot on this. Not gonna rehash things but I just want to say that it drives me nuts when people on social media thinks that getting treatment the States is the cure all end all. A partial achilles tendon rupture needs rehab (be it in US, China or Korea) and rest. There is no magic surgery or pill. And unfortunately tendon injuries are prone to reinjury (like he did on the CMB stage) and can take a long time to heal. Also, it makes me laugh when people argue about his ligament injury because last time I checked,  the achilles is a tendon and not a ligament. Anyway, if Tao's comfortable enough to start dancing again then obviously good for him.   Edit: one last thing, I want to point out is that there is no magic window period of recovery that you can miss for most of these chronic conditions brought upon by dancing."
exo,3cdv2h,maywind,2,Tue Jul 7 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the betray.    I don't disagree with the rest of your comment, but want to clarify why I thought his dad felt betrayed. Tao's dad traveled to Korea to take Tao back with him because of his concern for his injuries. SM, to change the dad's mind, approached him to talk about Tao's future career development with solo activities and said that they'll make the announcement alongside the news of Lay's studio. He said the talk with SM progressed to the point that all that was missing were the signatures on the line. But SM, instead of waiting for negotiation with Tao to be finalized so announcement for both Tao and Lay could happen at the same time like they promised, went ahead and announced Lay's studio first. Tao's dad was probably upset because why couldn't SM just waited a bit for Tao's contract to be finalized? Was SM really negotiating this with them in good faith or were they just dangling a carrot in front of their faces?   Like you pointed out, this is where further details could help us all understand the situation better. Yes, SM was probably wrong for not waiting for Tao's contract to be finalized before announcing Lay's studio, if that's what they promised Tao's dad. Yet, I can't help but feel that there has to be more going on here for Tao's dad to abandon negotiation with SM like that especially since they were so close to coming to an agreement. What truly caused the negotiation to fail?   Anyway, I'm going to stop here because I'm perilously deep in wild speculation territory now. My original intention for commenting was simply to point out that Tao did nothing wrong by beginning to train and rehearse again. This is completely consistent with what his dad wrote in his letter."
exo,3cdv2h,perfectnamja,3,Tue Jul 7 19:01:56 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly the news of Lay's studio was leaked early (since it was right when Exodus/CMB came out). SM made a statement because if not fans would have assumed the worst. That's why the language of the statement and Lay's comments in the days after were deeply focused on how it was supported by SM and how he's honouring his contract.
exo,3cdv2h,maywind,2,Tue Jul 7 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks. If that's the case, that would explain why the news was announced early."
exo,3cdv2h,perfectnamja,3,Tue Jul 7 22:37:34 2015 UTC,"Here is the article about it.  Note the entries for April 7th and 8th.  This is why it wasn't announced together.  At this time all the focus was on Lay, who at this point was already filming ""The Baby From Universe"", and had to do a video feed for the Exodus press conference because he was filming.  Then he was only able to perform the comeback stages for CMB.  His last music show was the Inkigayo come back stage on April 5th.  He was getting a lot of hate for it and then when the news was leaked about the studio it was like fuel to the fire.  SM and Lay had to put out the flames, and clearly by doing so aggravated Tao's dad."

It's been 3 months that he was resting without doing pretty much any type of work, and by work I mean SM hard and we-are-pushing-you-till-you-can't-walk kind of work. He got treatment, ofc he should be able to dance again and if he is dancing right now I trust him enough to believe that his body is ready to do it. This is something that he loves and he stayed away from it for so long.   And I seriously cannot understand how anyone can believe that his injuries were a lie and that he ""left"" for the money. I seriously can't. Nothing is known to us, 0 details, yet you go to judge him.  At least show some respect to Tao before you shit talk about him   (edited because of typo)"
exo,3cdv2h,anigym6,2,Tue Jul 7 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"THIS!  You all KNOW how hard the EXO choreographies are, even with everyone at full health, strength, and stamina.  Just because he's able to start dancing again does not mean he's able to jump back into the ridiculous 24/7 practices and performances that EXO does.    Also, Luhan left because of health reasons.  Yet no one bashed him when he began dance practices again outside of EXO.  Please everyone, this is not anything to feel betrayed about.  This is GOOD.  It shows he's recovering.  It shows he still wants to be an entertainer.  It shows that with a little more sane schedule that he's able to bounce back quickly.    SM ARE YOU TAKING NOTES???"
exo,3cdv2h,A_dead_Teemo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly! And the fact that he is dancing/recording doesn't mean he's going to make a solo album. It means that Tao is able to slowly go back to working again which is great for him since it's something he loves.  And about the article and the pictures, the site is speculating that he might be recording his own thing, they can't and aren't confirming anything. Even if it's true, I bet it would be officially revealed from Tao himself or his studio. Not a news entertainment site. And we don't even know, maybe he's recording an endorsement thing or something for SM. We legitimately have NO IDEA, yet he's been called a traitor and a liar again."
exo,3cdv2h,styleszz,2,Tue Jul 7 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I keep seeing people bash him for no real reason. It wasn't just the injuries, it's how shitty SM is in general. After so many people leaving in a year, you'd think they would try to review their current practices..."
exo,3cdv2h,mariabeggi,2,Wed Jul 8 04:15:45 2015 UTC,I feel hurt even if I know I don't have the right to feel this way...
exo,3cdv2h,Shogun_Ro,3,Tue Jul 7 11:04:48 2015 UTC,"I'm just happy Tao is doing music again. I don't really care if he is with Exo at this point. Don't get me wrong, it won't be the same without him but at the same time I like him as a person (whatever little I know about him to base it off of) and I just want to see his next phase in the music business."

exo,3cdv2h,HurricaneBeifong,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"Rumorhasit.mp3  Yall, kpop is 90% rumormongering. It's a shitty weird situation, I KNOW, and I wish we had more info too. But this is just another rumor. Don't get too worked up about anything until Tao says something. I don't speak any Chinese so I can't vouch for this source, but there's so much stuff flying around out there so the best thing to do is wait until we hear it from the horse's mouth.   This was the first thing I saw this morning and I'm upset too but let's not use it as a reason to be nasty to Tao. He gets enough of that from antis and as much as we want this resolved, this still isn't a final answer."
exo,3cdv2h,styleszz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm not getting why people are hating on him so much for this. SM doesn't exactly have the best track record with their idols. I don't think it's just about the injuries but they've already caused a distrust between themselves and Tao's party. It's only natural for his dad to want his only child to leave a company that's been ignoring his health.  His current solo activities are probably not as intense as the activities SM gave him. SM gave him a set schedule for practice/training/whatever whereas his current solo activities probably allow him to have more freedom with his schedule with consideration of his current health status (i.e. what he can or cannot do with regards to dancing). It's a win-win situation that anybody would have taken.   Anyway, I honestly don't think him leaving or not being a part of EXO should affect a person's opinion of him. He is still Huang Zitao, AB style kung fu panda."

His expressions are hilarious and I can't stop laughing everytime I see his face.   Oh and I'm glad Lay's hanging with the cast. It seems like he's having a lot of fun and he looks so careless :)  Gosh am I losing my mind? Show Luo kinda reminds me of Luhan here and that's pretty odd cause he doesn't look like him"
exo,3cc5mx,A_dead_Teemo,3,Mon Jul 6 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"That's Show Luo. He's like the variety king of Taiwan. He's a really fun (and funny) guy and a great dancer.  The cast actually went to an EXO concert in Shanghai to support Lay. They had to arrive right before the concert started in order to not cause mass hysteria among the concert-goers (the rest of the cast are actually a lot more famous than Lay / EXO is in China). When Lay gave a shout-out to them during the concert, the crowd just exploded at realizing the celebrities sitting among them."
exo,3cc5mx,maywind,2,Mon Jul 6 20:08:51 2015 UTC,On the show he really looks like he knows how to entertain so I'm not surprised to hear he's a variety king.   And yes I remember they went on one show but with all the tension from ep 2 I kinda forgot that everything is ok rn. Ty!

exo,3cbmfy,Zarilea,9,Mon Jul 6 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"Overdose got me into EXO. In terms of non title tracks, I love Heart Attack and Thunder. Exodus & the repackage were just solid albums. I was so disappointed that there was no El Dorado music video...all those wasted easter eggs in the CMB MV. If El Dorado had a MV, I'd imagine something dramatic that tied together all the path code teasers. I would also die for a Hurt MV.   I speak Chinese so lots of the earlier stuff with questionable Chinese lyrics were major turn offs for me...I do love History and the pocket dance (probably unpopular opinion) though. Oh, and I can't stand MAMA. I would erase it from history if I could."
exo,3cbmfy,asdfjklmthrowaway,4,Mon Jul 6 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it kind of tick you off in LMR when they sing ""wo de WEE zhou quan dou shi ni"" instead of ""wo de yu zhou quan dou shi ni""? unless my hearing is bad and please ignore this I mean it's basically one of the main lines in the song. But it's not like I can speak perfect Mandarin and Korean anyways :P"
exo,3cbmfy,wistfulove,5,Mon Jul 6 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yes...but I've learnt to make peace with the Mandarin pronunciations. What bothers me more is Suho's line ""sooo tonight..."" because I hear ""saaa tonight"".  I mostly listen to the k versions because I can't stand the transition from understanding when Lay sings to not understanding or only getting some stuff here and there. It just makes the whole thing feel off. Also, why doesn't LMR have subtitles? It needs subtitles. That's like a standard in Chinese music.   Regardless, I am very very proud of the boys' improvements, especially Xiu and Chen. I mean, I can't even understand Tao half the time when he raps because of the slurring. Soo is naturally good with any language but of course he has off words. Suho tries hard and you can tell. Sehun is surprisingly decent, especially since it's rap. When I hear Baek and Yeol though...how should I put it...need more lessons."
exo,3cbmfy,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Mon Jul 6 19:58:19 2015 UTC,LMR does have subtitles! You just have to manually enable them on YouTube now.
exo,3cbmfy,extrasolarplanet,2,Mon Jul 6 22:11:18 2015 UTC,TIL. This must be the first time they did it though. I'm pretty sure youtube CMB has subtitles.

exo,3cbmfy,cheshire26,3,Tue Jul 7 00:48:46 2015 UTC,The google translated Chinese.   The very questionable English.  The what I call Morgan Freeman sci fi beginning.  The Georgian monk chant.  The wild Kai/Xiumin and full face tat.  I can go on...
exo,3cbmfy,asdfjklmthrowaway,4,Tue Jul 7 01:55:39 2015 UTC,Overdose is probably my favorite title track. It's what (finally) got me into EXO too.  I don't even know Chinese but because every Chinese speaker has said that about the M versions of their songs I can't help but sense the awkwardness whenever I hear them (as beautiful as the M songs sound vocally).
exo,3cbmfy,pathcodejpa,2,Tue Jul 7 05:50:35 2015 UTC,Easter eggs? Do tell!
exo,3cbmfy,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Mon Jul 6 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm on my phone so I can't link you the vids to the exact time, but if you watch the Chinese ver of CMB, you'll see the jeep in the beginning of the garage scene has an El Dorado plate. The K version's transition shot from the garage to the next room with Chen also shows an El Dorado sign on the door.   Edit: Also, right before CMB came out at the Exo'luxion in Seoul concerts, out all the new songs that were previewed/performed, El Dorado by far had the best set/props/choreo. Hope was raised and then dashed. Ugh."
exo,3cbmfy,ifweburn,2,Mon Jul 6 18:55:30 2015 UTC,Do people really not like that dance? I love it. I call it the pants dance and get very sad when they're not wearing the baggy pants while doing it.
exo,3cbmfy,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Mon Jul 6 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"I remembering hearing people bashing it. But yes, it's so sad when they are wearing non baggy pants and just do nothing during that part."
exo,3cbmfy,brianna_rune_,6,Mon Jul 6 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"I've always liked ""What is love"". Recently I have been listening to ""What if..."" and ""Promise"" .... OH! and ""Let out the Beast"".   I really hope they make a ""Promise"" MV."
exo,3cbmfy,anigym6,7,Mon Jul 6 17:44:50 2015 UTC,Tell Me What Is Love (It's the sequel/follow up song to What Is Love)! It's such a great song and they need to put it on an album because it's actually better then the original song (and What Is Love was amazing)!
exo,3cbmfy,AlphaBaby,4,Mon Jul 6 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"Black Pearl because no matter what version I listen to...    Teaser  XOXO K or  XOXO M Rearranged K or Rearranged M even as a Female Acapella choir cover   ... doesn't matter.  It is fucking incredible and hits all of what I want out of a song: intense, emotional, and energetic with (in the case of all except the acapella) massive EDM influence.    GOD JUST-ARE YOU READING THE LYRICS TO BOTH VERSIONS?  DO YOU HEAR THE HARMONIES?  DO YOU SEE THE DANCE? HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS SONG???  Thou dat El Dorado..."
exo,3cbmfy,islimp,2,Mon Jul 6 20:33:22 2015 UTC,Haha yep. Black Pearl is amazing...like beyond words good. El Dorado came out and I had a slight crisis between the two...which would be my favorite EXO song??? I'm still with Black Pearl though. That song is perfection.

exo,3cbmfy,VVU,3,Tue Jul 7 02:21:53 2015 UTC,"It's too hard to pick! EXO's discography's just too good to pick only one favorite song.   My current favorites are My Turn to Cry, Baby Don't Cry, Love Love Love, and Christmas Day; in fact, I just love all their ballads and I usually skip ballads. I love the Boyz II Men vibe I get from these songs. Plus, the Christmas Day choreography with the suspenders.... ::fans self::  Two of my all-time favorites are: Hurt, and Overdose (they're just so dramatic and awesome)"
exo,3cbmfy,pathcodejpa,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"I really like Promise, and Growl, of course. Recently, I've started to listen to the Chinese Thunder-Xiumin's voice is too awesome in that."
exo,3cbmfy,DinoDomi,3,Mon Jul 6 17:41:51 2015 UTC,Love those songs too <3 EXO really has a great discography.  I've gotta listen to M's Thunder. As long as I get to hear Xiumin singing!!
exo,3cbmfy,sprittany,4,Tue Jul 7 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, all the tough choices! My favorite songs are Love Love Love (mostly the acoustic version), Baby Don't Cry (omfg Suho and his angelic voice <3), Angel, and Growl.  Edit: Welcome to the EXO fandom! I hope you have a great time on this subreddit. People here are really nice and you can get along well with them."
exo,3cbmfy,ifweburn,4,Mon Jul 6 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Run, specifically the Chinese version. This song doesn't get a lot of love but it's my absolute top one, and I don't think it'll ever be beat. There's just something about it, when I listen to it I feel oddly... at peace? And I like the lyrics to it as well, specifically the chorus:   ""Let’s run for love together, run, // Happiness smiles Hello Hello E-Yo // Hand in hand running, run, // Until the very last second E-Yo // Throw away all your troubles, // This moment is so beautiful, // I close my eyes and hold you in my arms // I just want you to know, now, // How important falling in love with you is to me E-Yo // My heart is racing""  I can relate to it because a lot of times all I want to do is take the hand of someone I love and run with them. Also, I love Tao's voice in this song and I love that short little Xiuhan duet near the end~"
exo,3cbmfy,maywind,3,Mon Jul 6 18:47:24 2015 UTC,Run is a beautiful song. Definitely top 5 for me.

exo,3cbmfy,Enrys,5,Mon Jul 6 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"Favorite song? Love Me Right. It's just perfect. I love the guitar in the background. I love the summer happy vibe, perfect for driving around town. Also, I just love the star references (galaxy, milky way, universe...) So pretty!! And Channie's ""I just wanna make you love me~"" line is just swoon  Runners up: First Love, Transformer (The song I've listened to the most), Thunder, Heart Attack, Two Moons (Best workout song!), and Love, Love, Love (Acoustic)   Wow I like too many of their songs lol"
exo,3cbmfy,Enrys,3,Tue Jul 7 05:01:19 2015 UTC,"Probably Growl or CMB, because I know the dances to them.  What puts Growl over CMB is the more hip hop feel of the song."
exo,3cbmfy,oshuddup,2,Mon Jul 6 19:51:19 2015 UTC,The dance to Growl is much more fun to watch.
exo,3cbmfy,cheshire26,3,Mon Jul 6 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's cooler to watch/perform, but CMB is more fun to watch/perform. I hope that makes sense."
exo,3cbmfy,perfectnamja,3,Tue Jul 7 12:10:54 2015 UTC,"What is Love is the best, my fave from them. Other than that ummm... I dunno actually I really like most of the title tracks, the Growl remix with the extra choreo and everything was pretty great so there's that. I actually really like Tender Love - at first I didn't like it a lot but then it grew on me."

That song is what got me into EXO and I thought they were actually a new TVXQ because of what they wore in the MV! But then I found out there were 12... And then I remembered my mom showing me the MAMA MV which I pretty much hated at the time...  But yeah... Love What Is Love and Christmas Day and The Star (the rap lines from Kris are cringe in the best way possible) from their Christmas Album... Also love Overdose, Thunder, Growl, Call Me Baby, Love Me Right, XOXO...  Songs I dislike? Wolf, Peter Pan, Black Pearl, Transformer... all the ""themed"" songs are meeeeehhh.  Fight me. >:P"
exo,3cbmfy,kittenmittons,3,Tue Jul 7 01:13:00 2015 UTC,"I am so late to this post!  My top favourite would be Hurt, there's just something about it that hooks me.  I would give anything to see a Hurt MV."
exo,3cbmfy,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Tue Jul 7 04:16:38 2015 UTC,My favorite is Tansformers and El Dorado!

exo,3cbmfy,ifweburn,3,Tue Jul 7 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"Hate to be typical, but Growl is piece of pop music perfection. And it should be - SM hired some of the top pop composers today for it. They used a concept that is not overused in pop music (possessiveness and aggression) and gave them an amazing choreo.  Second place has to go to Promise for me. It's a typical asian ballad, but I really love the rap for it. Chanyeol is so intense! But the boy needs major Mandarin lessons if he's going to try to fill in for the chinese raps."

I have no idea how/when I became Jongdae trash (he was my ""second bias"" for some time and I reaaaally didn't wanna change biases again), but I'm pretty sure Call Me Baby was when I finally accepted it lol why How is he my bias. So gross. ugh  I'll take any excuse to spam gifs lmao sorry not sorry"

I managed t make it til last week without seeing it and now my life is ruined."

exo,3c8r35,HurricaneBeifong,9,Mon Jul 6 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"I got into Exo in the interim between Luhan leaving and CMB.  I watched all the MVs, Showtime and other variety without really having a bias, I just wanted to remember everyone's names (sort of like digital flashcards).    It took a bit of time but my first bias was and still is Lay.  I first noticed him in Wolf, but my fate was sealed seeing CMB.  but his character really put him at the top.  I really admire his ambition and his drive to always be the best he can be.  From what I can see he's determined to achieve his goals without compromising any of his commitments.  His work ethic is a motivator, if you ever feel like being lazy just ask ""What would Yixing do?"".  He also really seems to care about those around them and their wellbeing (not that the others don't, but I see it with him).  He's a good soul.  He's also an amazing performer.  He sings, dances amazingly, plays instruments, composes.  And he's not hard on the eyes in the least.  He's a huge adorable dork.  I'd clone him if I could.  I didn't have a second bias for ages, but I'd have to say Suho would fill that spot."

exo,3c8r35,arinana,9,Mon Jul 6 06:27:20 2015 UTC,"Luhan is my bias ever since I saw Time Control teaser for the first time~ ngl it was his face that attracts me at first, I mean omg look at that face, he looks like my next mistake you definitely don't see that kind of perfection on daily basis. but then I saw how this ball of prettiness manliness acts around his peer and his mannerism and his humble demeanor and I feel like falling all over him again for the second time. he's just so lovable. you can see how much he values his relationship w/ other ppl and I can see why Laogao sticks with him through thick and thin.   contrary to what ppl in the fandom might encounter (heck even my sister went through this whole who's-my-bias-in-exo-for-this-week phase), I've never had any problem bcs luhan is always on top of the list. for second place to fifth place though, that's diff story. but, technically my exo bias rn is kyungsoo, bcs who could resist this compressed ball of pure fury adorable bae?   but luhan, so far, has always been my ultimate exo bias from their 2012 debut."

exo,3c8r35,styleszz,3,Mon Jul 6 02:59:17 2015 UTC,oh God don't remind me of that I still haven't recovered from Matt praising our bb boy like nooo my fave person talking positively abt my other fave person I'm sobbing here ;A; I just hope Lu can be shameless for a sec and ask him for a selca bcs lbr that would be a world treasure   ikrrr omg I can't help bt feel like a proud mom fan everytime he did something. my friend said that he is brought up well to bloom into someone as amazing as he is now and I cannot agree more. his humbleness never stops to amaze me TT_TT

I hope to see lots of Lu and TFBOYS when I head to China at the end of this month!!!
exo,3c8r35,styleszz,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"TFBOYS ARE SO ADORABLE!!! Where in China are you going? I'm going to Shanghai in a week, I haven't been there after EXO got popular, I am expecting to see loads of commercials and promotiona from Lu and probably  EXO as well! Probably other artists as well now that I think of it. Can't wait!!"
exo,3c8r35,pea_nut,2,Tue Jul 7 05:36:17 2015 UTC,Ooh awesome!! Going to guangzhou! That's where my family lives. Although I visited shanghai about 5 years ago I haven't been back to visit family since about 7 years ago so I'm not sure what's it's like anymore!!
exo,3c8r35,styleszz,6,Tue Jul 7 10:49:45 2015 UTC,I liked Kyungsoo first because of his voice. After I started to watch their variety shows and interviews I started to become PCY trash because he just won't shut up. Im a pretty quiet and reserved person but all my friends are loud and crazy. It makes me happy to have chaos around me and yet I don't want to participate in it myself.
exo,3c8r35,fire_friendly,5,Sun Jul 5 23:56:41 2015 UTC,Sehun was my first bias. It quickly changed to Tao though and has been that way since~
exo,3c8r35,sprittany,2,Mon Jul 6 00:50:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, I got into him through interviews xd"
exo,3c8r35,sprittany,5,Mon Jul 6 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"I had such a superficial reason but, Kris. EXO is my first kpop group and Kris could speak English. So I thought, ""That one... he's the one."". I still love Kris of course, but I rather quickly became Minseok biased. Minseok is way beyond the title of ultimate bias that can not be replaced in my heart. @_@"
exo,3c8r35,Shawtaay,3,Mon Jul 6 18:36:32 2015 UTC,Mister too much gel crazy hair Kai~
exo,3c8r35,linkedhorizon,5,Mon Jul 6 04:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kai caught my attention very quickly at first. Can't deny he's gorgeous and talented. Despite how dazzling he was, it turned out to be just a flash in the pan for me--especially once I got to see some of their personalities. Chen is a nice, slow burn ;)"
exo,3c8r35,onomatomoeba,2,Sun Jul 5 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"But the gel is too good. Kai shall be bathed in the blood of RPG gel monsters...Bless it be The New Founding Fathers...What(sorry, sorry...I was thinking of The Purge movies and RPG monsters, I'm sorry =< (OxO)>  )."
exo,3c8r35,brianna_rune_,3,Mon Jul 6 01:53:45 2015 UTC,my first/current/forever bias will always be my deer lulu <3
exo,3c8r35,styleszz,2,Mon Jul 6 01:28:26 2015 UTC,"Lay for me! I'm a Call Me Baby era fan so I think I caught Yixing at his prime and dayumm is he a heart stealer! Those dimples, hip thrusts, and dazed look; I was a goner the moment I set eyes on him!   But Chen is gradually crawling up to my bias spot! His voice, cheekbones, and overall dorkiness is too hard to resist!"
exo,3c8r35,didiersin,3,Mon Jul 6 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"[WARNING : LONG POST AHEAD! WARNING!] At first it was Kai. He looked really nice and could really dance (which SM knew since he was marketed the most during the debut). He looked so good that he was the only KPOP star that my classmates thought was attractive (and the only EXO member that they knew was a male because they just don't know MANLY looks when they see it). Plus he could quickly turn adorable so...    Plus when I first started paying attention to EXO (awhile after WOLF was released)I noticed that he was darker than the others (especially in pre-debut photos) and with all the dumb stuff SM did (like calling him the foreigner in WOLF promotions even though he is Korean/the braids(OK they were a little cute but it still rubbed me the wrong way)/ not really doing anything about him being made fun of his skin) + dark skin not being seen as equal to light skin in Korea and naturally dark-skinned Koreans wanting to bleach their skin, I knew that he was having a bad time. This actually made me (along with a lot of other African-American/African/Black KPOP fans in general) really like/bond with him.  [And recently, he has started liking his skin a lot more , and I am just like you GO Kai!]  But there was a member I always noticed but never payed any attention to...Until I realized that the voice of who I consider the best voice in EXO but never checked (and he would kill us all if we disagreed but I won't make that joke.....Not gonna type it) is Do Kyungsoo! I saw some videos of him sing english R&B and he just was amazing! Like how can this super smooth R&B voice come from someone who looks so young and cute (turns out he is 4 years older than me sooooo). I showed my mom this to see if I was hearing it right, and she liked his voice (and for my mom, you have to be in the top 20% of talent in singing or instantly you suck. She does not even think Beyonce sounds that great (except Love On Top is I remember correctly).). And as time went on, he started to look really hot as his jaw-line sharpened and SM started dressing EXO correctly + matched with his mature personality and his deepening voice and those great lips/eyes/face shape he already had, I just started to explode (joy....Exploding joy ladies and gentlemen).  [Plus during his more cutsy moments, he kinda looked like a crush I have/had, so he reminded me of my crush...Does Kyungsoo like super hero movies?]  OK, I'm done (ugh, I fangerlled so much...Need hot bath...Need food)...."
exo,3c8r35,brianna_rune_,3,Mon Jul 6 05:46:03 2015 UTC,"ME TOOOOOO AGH At first Kai was my only bias in EXO because his dancing is so ridiculously good and his face HIS FACE Then Kyungsoo somehow snuck in. Probably during the time period where I listened to ""Tell Me What is Love"" nonstop for a couple weeks.  And I love how awkward-quiet Kyungsoo can be sometimes with a bit of strange behavior sprinkled in. They're basically tied right now for UBs. And Kyungsoo kinda reminds me of my longest crush too ~ Their eyes are similar heh OvO"
exo,3c8r35,ltangerines,2,Mon Jul 6 01:25:18 2015 UTC,"Kyungsoo's voice is the voice of Siren (because he will use it to call us to him and then....He will destroy us all!....Sorry, Billy And Mandy reference). And is Tell Me What Is Love on one of the albums? Kyungsoo has JUST enough english in that song for my family to love it!  And as with my crush, I think it was the eyes, mouth (although the lips were not as big), face-shape, butt (The Kyungsoo butt is bigger, but both are big for boys) and similar maturity/quietness/weirdness (although he needs more nerd in him). I actually think that another reason Kyungsoo also became my favorite member was because as I realized that me and my crush just wasn't happening, I could just think ""I don't need to worry about my crush! If one guy in Korea can look somewhat like/a bit like him AND have a super smooth R&B voice (which is a super bonus), then I can find more in America""...(insane thoughts, I know but screw it, I'm broken hearted so let me be cray-cray for a moment)..."
exo,3c8r35,brianna_rune_,3,Mon Jul 6 04:18:18 2015 UTC,"My first MVs were Call Me Baby and Growl, and after watching a few performances, Kris stood out to me for his looks.  After watching Showtime and their radio shows, HOLY BALLS I am in love with Tao. He's so whiny and needy and adorable while being gorgeous at the same time. Kris kind of strikes me as a slightly arrogant but awkward guy, which I'm not into at all.  I've also started appreciating Chanyeol on talk shows. He's definitely the guy that gets the party started, and I like his charisma."
exo,3c8r35,Light_Blue,3,Mon Jul 6 05:43:42 2015 UTC,Sehun is forever bias
exo,3c8r35,CNtotheBLUE,3,Mon Jul 6 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"Tao ~ always was, always has been ~ baby panda panda.  But Xiumin is bae. Always conflicting hahaha"
exo,3c8r35,pathcodejpa,3,Mon Jul 6 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"It has always been and probably will always be Xiumin (he's just so cute and I absolutely love baby faced guys), but all the other members are really testing me lately!"
exo,3c8r35,perfectnamja,3,Mon Jul 6 04:34:23 2015 UTC,I want to know his anti-aging secrets.
exo,3c8r35,pathcodejpa,3,Mon Jul 6 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"I swear he takes good care of himself. It's not just his urjjang face, but his body especially those abs~"
exo,3c8r35,oshuddup,3,Mon Jul 6 05:26:35 2015 UTC,I think I noticed Kai first with his dancing in the growl mv but after watching showtime and weekly idol I was drawn to Tao because he was so adorable on everything and his Korean was so cute also I mean he's pretty hot too
exo,3c8r35,pea_nut,3,Mon Jul 6 08:14:52 2015 UTC,"Mine was and still is Lulu, I saw him in History and was like ""ok the fuck is kpop ooh Chinese I speak it this song is catchy as hell WOW THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT WHO IS THIS ETHEREAL HUMAN BEING???""   I recognized him and Kai from Maxstep too! I suppose Kai was also one of my first biases simply due to more exposure of Kai compared to other members in the beginning.  I have an affinity for M since I speak Chinese, so I especially liked him and Yixing and when they were so shy and humble and adorable (but still sexy as hell when performing) and stayed more in the background I totally could not get out of the hole that is EXO fangirling. Y'all can blame Showtime for that. Lol  I get why Lu is still so frakkin popular. He's relatable and loveable. Also I love his Chinese dialect:)"
exo,3c8r35,baeknshake,3,Mon Jul 6 05:26:59 2015 UTC,"My first bias was Baekhyun (starting with History) and has been Baekhyun ever since. When I was researching EXO, he was the one I stumbled across that I said ""Oh, he's beautiful."" But when I looked at fan-sign pictures I saw he looked kind of... normal, too, which I liked. There was just something distinct about him that I could pick out.   I've been tempted by Kris, Luhan, Kai, Chanyeol, and even Suho on various occasions, but I've always loved and adored Baekhyun and deep down knew that he was my bias. In fact, he might be my ultimate bias, though only Kai & Chanyeol have retained high positions (Lay is up there now as well).  I just love everything about him from his lame jokes to his talkative nature. In a way, I see a lot of myself, minus the fact I can't sing. So yeah. I adore Baekhyun. He is my spirit animal."
exo,3c8r35,empoere,3,Mon Jul 6 05:35:13 2015 UTC,the first mv i watched was M's call me baby and i was like who is this beautiful man sitting on this beautiful car? and i thought he would be all badass but then i watched showtime and hes adorable and giggly. i love tao. then he LEFT so he cant be my current exo bias at the moment and i was trying to work out who the other cute blonde one was in the video and it was lay (for a while i thought it was tao..... how) and now im in love. i got my friend into exo and shes a fan of yixing too so theres always photos being exchanged and its so nice that lay is out there being wonderful and kind and polite and talented and looking good as hell and every time i see an interview with just him im amazed by how humble he is and how well thought out his answers are. im in too deep but i dont care i love it
exo,3c8r35,Zarilea,3,Mon Jul 6 06:33:41 2015 UTC,"My first bias was and still is Lay. I got into Exo back when ""What is love"" came out but never really paid much attention to them. I just thought it was a good song and the guys were super cute.  I didn't follow K-pop much so it took me a while to actually find out about ""Call me baby"". That's when I finally noticed the group and saw blondie Lay. Fell in <3.  Though I must admit that I have had a little crush on Chanyeol since I saw ""Exo next door""."
exo,3c8r35,kittenmittons,3,Mon Jul 6 10:56:56 2015 UTC,First it was Kai because dancing machine. Then I turned PCY trash for life
exo,3c8r35,thegirlinthetardis,2,Mon Jul 6 14:25:55 2015 UTC,Chanyeol! I still love him to death but the more I saw of Kai just stole my heart.
exo,3c8r35,mariabeggi,2,Mon Jul 6 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"I could die staring at Lay. He was my first and it hasn't changed. Everything about him makes me happy. It's not just how he looks or dances. It's everything... I don't know I just want to make him happy forever :c if I could  Then at the beginning I was like wow kai is so pretty no one can be at his level but then I grew attached to Kyungsoo, Minseok and Chanyeol. For more than looks. They are all together in spot 2. But I really really really love all of them. No one is not necessary for me. They all are perfect and talented and I'm so proud of them just for breathing cause god I care so much about them."
exo,3c8r35,raexrae,2,Mon Jul 6 07:48:15 2015 UTC,First bias was Tao.  ;~;  He was the first one whose name I could remember.
exo,3c8r35,ifweburn,2,Mon Jul 6 10:39:32 2015 UTC,"Kai. When they were debuting, I was absolutely wooed by the fifty billion teasers featuring him. My current bias is Chanyeol though."
exo,3c8r35,islimp,2,Mon Jul 6 10:56:31 2015 UTC,Lay!! And then it (immediately) changed to Kyungsoo. But Lay really caught my attention during his part in Call Me Baby. And then Kyungsoo's high note happened. Hahahaha
exo,3c8r35,lecheplan,2,Mon Jul 6 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"First guy was Lay because of that hair swipe in Overdose. At first, I thought it was Chen, so I was telling my friend that has been wanting me to get into Exo that I liked Chen. Derp.   But after I started watching Showtime, I starting falling for the happy virus. His Instagram post holding a lightsaber finally won me over."

exo,3c79c5,deviantgrace_,2,Tue Jul 7 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"Okay turns out I need a life bc I know where a lot of these are from lol.. sorry it got long but hopefully I am helpful.  The first one is at the end of their performance of Happiness by HOT. Not the exact same angle but I think this one's better >< You didn't ask but I'm gonna throw in EXO-M's perf of Candy by HOT from the same time because it's too cute and painful  For the MAMA 2013, just Youtube search ""exo mama 2013 teaser"", there's multiple videos for that.  The Kaisoo radio gifs is from Cultwo Show Radio on 130711, idk about that specific fancam but sure you'll find it if you use that date xd  Ugh I kinda know where the Xiusoo fake subs thing is but I can't find it T_T  EXO M noms is from Ceci Magazine BTS  I think the one where you can't tell if it's crack was said at a concert? Not 100% sure though.  Tried searching for the Lukai silliness, couldn't find it. But it's BTS of them shooting for the Growl album.  Pretty sure the one where you need context lol is from here  I think the one of him shaking his head is from the unreleased version of the MAMA video here.  The one of him getting beat up is from Star King  And that's all I know~"

exo,3c79c5,asdfjklmthrowaway,6,Tue Jul 7 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"I found this test on  tumblr which estimates the celestar compatibility of you and your celebrity crushes and how your relationship would work. So, thirsty me of course had to do it with every EXO member and since pretty much nothing else happened to me this week here's my results:  First I did Chanyeol and I'm disappointed because I only got a 82.23% with him which is total bullshit but the ""sexy time"" ;) with him was a 87% so that's kinda okay.   With Tao I had the lowest score, a freaking 41.05% which is shocking because we would be like perfect for each other.   Next Xiumin and I got a 72.65%, with Yixing a 69.06% and with Sehun a 84.20%   But my best result ever was with guess who?  KIM FUCKING JONGIN! ME AND KAI GOT A 137.82% is this even possible? Needless to say, we would be perfect together and all you Kai stans can back off because we are getting married.   The rest was: Chen 76.18%, Suho 95.77%, Kris 99.07% fk yes!, Baekhyun 75.40 and Kyungsoo 65%. Unfortunately I couldn't find Luhan :/  Also I HAD to do some pairings so I checked Kaisoo who had a 130.95%, Chanbaek 63.53% and Sekai 66.54%"

exo,3c79c5,oshuddup,3,Mon Jul 6 03:41:16 2015 UTC,Guys I didn't post this separately because I didn't want to be that person... but seeing this was pretty disheartening.   EXO-M FB page no longer lists Tao as a member.
exo,3c79c5,HurricaneBeifong,3,Mon Jul 6 16:37:16 2015 UTC,"Well he's not active right now so it's not that odd tbh. And I'm not taking this very seriously. I mean we have seen worse news and not a single word from SM so who knows?   For me, all the news I got from Tao today is this pic of him eating ice cream with his friend while being blonde and extremely cute again"
exo,3c79c5,RowieMonster,3,Mon Jul 6 17:43:20 2015 UTC,I saw it on tumblr and OP said the profile still had Tao's name yesterday so...I'm really hoping it's not a precursor to something official.

Also jesus christ my friends have entrusted me to come back bearing goods from their respective groups lol
exo,3c79c5,HurricaneBeifong,3,Tue Jul 7 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Was it a recent drama or was it older (meaning was Soo younger or the age he is now)? If it's older it's ""It's OK That's Love"" and he's beautiful and amazing in it and you will cry so many tears. It's on Netflix and you should watch it. The newer one is ""Hello Monster"" or ""I Remember You"" depending on the source. He's only in a few eps of that but he's AMAZING.  Yo that is a heavy burden, may the kpop gods be with you."
exo,3c79c5,HurricaneBeifong,3,Tue Jul 7 19:51:44 2015 UTC,I think it's the new one about murderers or something   For the few seconds I saw him he looked great so yeah :D
exo,3c79c5,HurricaneBeifong,2,Tue Jul 7 19:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's Hello Monster! He's frankly awesome in it, you can look the show up on Viki if you're interested, it's got full engsubs. The whole thing is definitely a lot like the BBC Sherlock series, down to the music, but Soo is really something else."

It appears that our lovely Miranda now prefers snapchat instead of insta and to be more specific she prefers snapchat's founder  You can tell Sehun to go back being like this
exo,3bvpnr,contagiouschemi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:41 2015 UTC,TIL Miranda got a better looking love interest. Good for her. The Australian billionaire she was linked with before was a lil' bit below her level looks wise.   Poor Sehun. But we will never go back!
exo,3bvpnr,contagiouschemi,2,Thu Jul 2 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Tbh it's her lost. Look at this boy, he doesn't need this bad noona. He can rap, he can dance and he has a better booty than her. She can stay with her snapchat guy. Who needs Miranda when you can have someone as goodlooking as Tao?  Oh and I just noticed that you called Sam a ""pet"". Let me explain to you that Sam is officially like a little brother to me since we are both Chanyeol's babies. Don't mess with my little bro lady"

It’s a little overwhelming when someone like Luhan shows up with fans. I think the first night before he started shooting there was something like 400 flower arrangements that came to the hotel and took up the entire hallway. I just found everybody in the cast was just so kind and welcoming to the Western actors. They're all wonderful, talented actors, so working with them was very easy. But I was impressed by how.... I mean, if somebody hadn’t told me that Luhan was as huge a star as he is, I wouldn’t know it by the way he carries himself, which is very impressive.   Here's a link to the full press conference, no English subtitles yet! Luhan's part at the press conference starts at around 55:30."

exo,3bpvih,wistfulove,8,Wed Jul 1 05:21:11 2015 UTC,Okay this is getting a bit ridiculous lol

exo,3bozhk,wistfulove,2,Wed Jul 1 01:41:59 2015 UTC,I'm not sure either.  I thought maybe Sehun if I squint really hard...

You made a fangirl extremely happy with these news! :D  Edit: This fangirl isnt so happy anymore. In one of the pics its clear that Chanyeol has a bandaid on his left thumb and I can't stop thinking that he might have hurt it like that other guy did the last time Yeol went to the jungle. I know i'm overthinking it but I can't help it. At least he is wearing some sort of sandals which look so huge because he is a freaking giant and that's kinda funny and distracting"

It's been about four hours now since I've woken up and I finally understand what this post is about. I'm no longer as concerned. I feel stupid 😂

Spoiler (not really): So Lay had to work at a hotel restaurant kitchen for a day.  He was clearly failing to meet the work target so the head chef suggested he make up for it by going out to bring customers into the restaurant.    So precious unicorn is lost as always and asks a hotel worker where to go to find people. The nice guy told him to go this way but not the other way to Nanjing Road because there's way too many people there.  What does he do? He goes to Nanjing road, aka the longest pedestrian shopping street in the world. Think Times Square of China. Bahaha, oh Yixing."

exo,3bitrt,LuTaKrM,7,Mon Jun 29 16:07:12 2015 UTC,"I mean it's so common in kpop I'd be surprised if none of them had... I only really see a significant difference in Kai's eyelids, but I think everything else is just natural changes from growing up."
exo,3bitrt,HurricaneBeifong,6,Mon Jun 29 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"Koreaboo has the most clickbait articles ever tbh... it was just a KPKF blog post (which was posted like a week ago)...   But yeah, we'll never know whether they got surgery or not and how much surgery they got, but it doesn't even matter because looking good is part of their job, and if someone is judging them because of surgery then they're not even a real fan.   What people need to do is go to sites other than Koreaboo to find KPOP ""news"", because they've been twisting stories around to make them sound more dramatic -.-"
exo,3bitrt,iampotato_worshipme,8,Mon Jun 29 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think most fans don't think it's a big deal. I certainly don't. The visual aspect of kpop is huge and obviously it's a personal choice.  My only issue is with people who clearly have body dysmorphic syndrome yet keep on getting revisions/'upgrades'. They should get some psychological help/counselling first and foremost. I'm looking at you Park Bom. And shame on those surgeons that still operate on them.  In terms of the actual surgery part, I think it's best to not make drastic changes because there's no going back, or it's very difficult. For instance, the reason Luhan looks so feminine is because whoever did the jaw reduction was a little over zealous.   Edit: I personally don't think Soo or Minseok got anything done. And if they did, the surgeon did a very subtle and good job. However, getting plastic surgery doesn't make anyone a greater or lesser person."
exo,3bitrt,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Mon Jun 29 17:07:06 2015 UTC,Til that luhan got a jaw reduction  Soo got his eyes done but I'm not too sure about xiumin
exo,3bitrt,oshuddup,2,Tue Jun 30 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Really, about Luhan? Yeah, most likely.   What makes you think Kyungsoo got his eyes done? Double lid, or inner corners or other? Because some people think he got his inner corners cut because he has prominent epicanthic fold when he closes his eyes.   per his stans, Xiumin gets fillers in his chin. But those are only temp. Sooo many kpop stars getting chin fillers, so odd to me."
exo,3bitrt,MaryRoseRobin,2,Tue Jun 30 09:41:27 2015 UTC,"Actually the epicanthal fold is what you call the bit of skin that may cover the visible part of tear duct that's usually seen on Asians with nonolids. Also, you see the feature in people with Down syndrome and temporarily in babies. Epicanthoplasty is the procedure that remove the epicanthal fold. In doing so, the tear duct is revealed and that makes the eye appear wider, especially when done in combination with asian blepharoplasty. Lateral canthoplasty is usually done for lengthening the eye or to fix a droopy eye. I don't think Kyungsoo had epicanthoplasty since his eyes doesn't have epicanthal folds in baby pictures and he always had a wide eye look. Sometimes, not always, you can see the scars around the tear ducts or inner eye corner, but these can usually be revised.  He always had double eye lids but he could have had asian blepharoplasty to deepen the folds or to evened them out. Maybe that what you're referring to about his eyes when they're closed? Since asian blepharoplasty essentially is creating a controlled scar line, and scars don't disappear like a natural skin fold does when the eyes are closed.   I'm still not sure about Xiu since there are so few pictures of him predebut but I think he probably did. And I don't really consider fillers plastic surgery since they're usually done by dermatologists, at least here in North America lol.  Edit: Also, I'm not trying to be mean. Just wanted to clear some things up!"
exo,3bitrt,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Tue Jun 30 11:04:31 2015 UTC,"You're not being mean? At all. And and you're right, expect Kyungsoo does have it. It doesn't have to fully cover the tear duct.  Kyungsoo The bit of skin that doesn't close with his eye when he blinks, that's the fold.   Baekhyun has a less prominent one  Chen doesn't have a notable fold  this little boy does  Kyungsoo's eyes when their closed.  that little space on the left side is why some people think he's gotten a epicanthoplasty or just ""corner cutting"" I think they envision a surgeon cutting into the side of his eye and... removing a part that made everything ""seamless."" But it's just his eyes~   the thing is... you can just move the fold a bit. You don't have to get rid of it. A magic epicanthoplasty is what I've seen it called. So, I can't count out him having *maybe"" having that done. His predebut pics are all so lq. If I had to bet $20, I'd say no, but good subtle work can just blend in with a face.   Yeah, it's not PS, just cosmetic. I want filler in my nose! It's hard to tell because he's lost so much weight. But idt he's been under the knife. Lay too, because of his blood condition, doesn't seem to have gotten anything done."
exo,3bitrt,MaryRoseRobin,2,Tue Jun 30 12:21:01 2015 UTC,I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to be looking for in each of these gifs xD is it the double eyelid or the eye corner thing?
exo,3bitrt,oshuddup,2,Tue Jun 30 15:23:48 2015 UTC,Corner thing
exo,3bitrt,MaryRoseRobin,2,Tue Jun 30 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, you know a lot about this! Well I'll take your word for it xD also any pics on Minnie's fillers?"
exo,3bitrt,oshuddup,2,Tue Jun 30 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"You can probably best see the difference in most photos since ~2015? It's just that his chin has been more pointy when it was more rounded before. Then again, he also lost a lot of weight so that's why I'm not 100% certain."
exo,3bitrt,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Tue Jun 30 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, jaws don't grow smaller like that. And Kris and Baek did too (another TIL?). Actually, the jaw reductions were the most obvious looking plastic surgeries for me, especially when you look at Kris' and Baek's high school pictures. Good thing their surgeons didn't go overboard like whoever did for Luhan. I don't think Soo got anything done but I already wrote a wall of text about it above below :)"
exo,3bitrt,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Tue Jun 30 11:07:23 2015 UTC,Shocking /s
exo,3bitrt,Lotheim,8,Tue Jun 30 00:56:25 2015 UTC,"So they might have done plastic surgery, so what? Why is it a bad thing? Are we seriously going to judge someone because he changed his appearance? Like, I thought people were over with this. If you dont like something about your body you are free to change it. How is this bad? If they are more confident with their new noses, lips or whatever they have changed, am happy for them and for anyone who did it, no matter if they are famous or not. Some people make plastic surgery look like the absolutely worse thing in the world.  As for you and the 300 who agreed with you,   [+300, -27] Can you take out the three traitors?   Girl you better prepare cause i'm coming to kick your hating ass. Just because 2 OF THEM left the group (for their personal and serious reasons) doesn't mean they never existed as members or that they are traitors. They will always be part of EXO and if you don't like it take your hate and get out  sigh, sorry I have been into fight mode all day long"
exo,3bitrt,A_dead_Teemo,3,Mon Jun 29 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're right in general- there's no reason to be shitty to people for getting PS. My issue here is that if the boys did get any, it wasn't because they weren't happy with their appearance, it was because of huge massive huge huge pressure from SM and the kpop business in general. I'm sure they knew what they were getting into, but they would have had to get these surgeries when they were CHILDREN, which is definitely not cool imo. I'm not mad at people for getting surgery, I'm mad at the cultures that make them feel like they have to."
exo,3bitrt,HurricaneBeifong,2,Tue Jun 30 13:10:40 2015 UTC,"I understand that getting plastic surgery at a very young age is not ok, especially before the age of 21 when their bodies are not in their ""final form"" yet (pls excuse my lame explaining) but I do think that they are happy with their bodies and faces now. Also somehow in this particular situation, when it comes to idols I think it's kinda okay. I mean they did know where they were getting into and their parents agreed to this. I kinda understand them doing the surgeries just so they can follow their dreams. And as long as they don't get addicted, it's okay with me"
exo,3bitrt,A_dead_Teemo,2,Tue Jun 30 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wish there weren't so much pressure on them to do it to begin with."
exo,3bitrt,HurricaneBeifong,4,Tue Jun 30 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"Well, judging from the photos of Kai, he probably did undergo double eyelid surgery, but, I dunno about the nose job part. Anyone disagree?"
exo,3bitrt,islimp,10,Mon Jun 29 16:33:09 2015 UTC,The tip of the nose was definitely reduced (and noses don't grow smaller over time) and I think the bridge of the nose was built up a bit. The good thing is that it doesn't look like a cookie cutter South Korean nose job and it suits his face.
exo,3bitrt,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Mon Jun 29 16:58:55 2015 UTC,I can't believe this is news LOL. At this point I'd be surprised if someone /didn't/ have PS

exo,3bitrt,perfectnamja,2,Mon Jun 29 22:07:54 2015 UTC,Getting your eyes and nose done are common in Kpop so I don't really see what the big deal is. Koreaboo being clickbaity as usual and netizens being overly picky as usual.
exo,3bitrt,soheechul,2,Tue Jun 30 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"Oh cmon basically everyone's had eye and nose surgery. Male idols usually don't get as much work done as girl groups. And idk why everyone's freaking out about this because it's pretty obvious and basically everyone knows that their oppas and unnies have done something to their face.   But honestly, as a Korean person I feel like plastic surgery is used to fit into that narrow mold of what is considered beautiful in Korea. And sometimes it leads to some pretty bad body dysmorphia (... Is that a word?) and it's not super healthy especially in the teenage girl population imo idk where I was going with this it turned into word vomit"
exo,3bitrt,oshuddup,3,Tue Jun 30 04:57:12 2015 UTC,I personally think D.O and Lay are the only guys without any surgery in the group. Xiumin had his nose done.

exo,3bitrt,styleszz,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"In my honest opinion (even if I wasn't biased) I don't think any of them has had plastic surgery. I always figured it's mostly girl group idols and the occasional male idol like Kwanghee, but I don't think anyone in exo has gone through with it. These are just terrible pictures of bad angles, before growing up/going through puberty, losing weight, etc. Physical development can still continue til early adulthood (bone structure, sehun's shoulders, etc.) And even if I'm completely wrong, then oh well. Of course, this is just another case of koreaboo being clickbait-y as usual.. These sort of websites care more about the number of hit$ rather than delivering quality news."

exo,3bitc7,HurricaneBeifong,4,Tue Jun 30 20:57:40 2015 UTC,"I spent an irresponsible amount of money to order the rest of Exodus for my alternating set but I don't even CARE. I love that kpoptown sends you a pic of all your stuff in a box before they ship it out, makes it even more exciting.   I'm leaving for a trip to Las Vegas on Wednesday and I'm soooo ready for a vacation! Then when I get back, ear piercing!"

I just got home and I can't wait to turn on my computer after having dinner screams  I was really struggling day 3 without seeing their faces. It was real pain. At least I was all day just listening to their voices. But for real, I was trying to watch YouTube behind my mum's back even if it was everything super blurry xD I have to catch up to a lot of things sigh I'm prepared to stay home and watch stuff for one week straight. NO REGRETS. And I GOT HOME AND MY LOVE ME RIGHT ALBUM IS HERE AND THE POSTER IS SO HUGE IM DYING AND FANGIRLING AND I WANT TO KISS THE PAPER SO MUCH THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL I CANT   God I have so much things to say... Not commenting for a week is hard. Trust me. AND LATELY BAEK IS LIKE BEING SUCH A PUPPY I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. my list changes every week. Its like I wake up one day and I'm like ""today I love Kyungsoo so much he's so squishy I want to cuddle his face"". And then next day ""wow baekhyun looks incredible awesome how didn't I notice before?"". Next day ""chanyeol stop WITH THAT VOICE"". And it keeps going on. Well I think I said enough. I'm going to go listen to the album on my car while crying blurry tears of happiness."
exo,3bitc7,HurricaneBeifong,3,Mon Jun 29 19:04:26 2015 UTC,Glad you're feeling better!!  I recently found a new favorite pic of Baekhyun which is just...not fair. He's not fair.

exo,3bitc7,DinoDomi,2,Mon Jun 29 19:49:14 2015 UTC,omg that gif should be illegal
exo,3bitc7,HurricaneBeifong,2,Mon Jun 29 20:57:14 2015 UTC,I KNOW ITS SO CUTE AND EXCITED I HAD TO USE IT!
exo,3bitc7,ifweburn,3,Mon Jun 29 22:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'm doing last-minute prep for my new collection launch (it's kpop themed and I'm SO EXCITED) but my smaller scale broke so I'm behind schedule, womp womp. Buuuuut if I have a successful launch I plan on buying myself an EXO-related treat. Haven't decided if it'll be the repackage album/poster or Chanyeol paper toy.  I got the urge to (finally) try my hand at fanfic but I have no idea what to write.  I'm obsessed with BTS's Sick. The choreo! The beat! IT'S JUST SO GREAT."
exo,3bitc7,BECKSTERRRR,3,Mon Jun 29 19:53:29 2015 UTC,"If your collection has any Exo-related items, I'll personally buy you your treat. Want!   Also, I almost cried on my lunch break because I couldn't get the dance practice video for that song to load on my phone so I could re-watch it. So good!"
exo,3bitc7,ifweburn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it started out with me having like nine EXO related shadows but I tried to calm my tits. So now there's an El Dorado shadow and a Thunder scent. And this month's GWP is a sample of Love Me Right shadow because I couldn't leave it out. But I know not everyone is into EXO so I incorporated some other favorites.   I watched the dance version and had a fit. WHY IS IT SO GOOD."
exo,3bitc7,BECKSTERRRR,2,Mon Jun 29 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm actually relieved, I would have been too sad to only buy nine. </3   Can't wait! Need things!"
exo,3bitc7,ifweburn,2,Mon Jun 29 22:20:17 2015 UTC,I'll be sure to let y'all know when things are on sale. It'll be up on July 1st and I'm so pumped to finally share. Probably the most excited I've been with a collection release so far.
exo,3bitc7,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Mon Jun 29 22:32:08 2015 UTC,You should hurry though. Last time I checked Kpoptown had only few paper toys left and I haven't seen any other place that sells them online.
exo,3bitc7,ifweburn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"Oh no really? Dammit! Well if it sells out, I won't be crushed. Less incentive to buy more than one that way."
exo,3bitc7,asdfjklmthrowaway,2,Mon Jun 29 21:37:21 2015 UTC,I just checked.  Only one of sehun/lay left.
exo,3bitc7,ifweburn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"Crud. I really gotta move quick with these things, apparently!"
exo,3bitc7,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Mon Jun 29 22:02:55 2015 UTC,Can we all just take a moment and bask in the glory that is this fan shopped photo of Yixing...

Also there's this leavers day at school, it's optional but my mum is really forcing me to go but I may be able to make her feel bad for me which may change her mind so i'm hoping for that.  Oh god and I forgot there's prom this week, which i'm not going, but seeing everyone else's pictures and what not may make me feel like crap so hopefully EXO can help me through it. I'm considering watching Chanyeol's dating alone again, he ruins my life but I love it at the same time.  And some strange reason i'm really motivated to watch and get deep into anime and I can't wait to start :3  Also congrats to the giveaway winners. I absolutely love how active this sub is and how much fangirling is acceptable because the the kpop sub I always feel embarrassed. I love you all!!!"

exo,3bitc7,HurricaneBeifong,3,Tue Jun 30 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, the kiss, sure, but I think the real essence of Chanyeol is in getting so embarrassed you turn into an airplane for a second."

It was just so cheesy, but it made my little fangirl heart swing, and that's really all that matters.   And about the anime, I really recommend FullMetal Alchemist and its spinoff (?)

exo,3bitc7,lexxxluthorrr,2,Tue Jun 30 05:16:34 2015 UTC,Had he not blocked you I would have suggested sending a video of you furiously chopping up a cucumber.

exo,3bitc7,birdieee,2,Tue Jun 30 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"It seems like some members are getting a chance to rest now since news has been a bit slow lately. Hopefully Chanyeol can rest now that he's back from Brunei and hopefully D.O and lay can find some rest outside of their individual activities too.  On another hand, with my recent new obsession with BTS (dope is so DOPE), I've finally reached noona territory.. damnit V and jungkook."

exo,3bhnub,islimp,4,Mon Jun 29 09:00:52 2015 UTC,There's still a chance that the 20M views video will be it :)
exo,3bhnub,sprittany,6,Mon Jun 29 09:06:11 2015 UTC,Aw all I can think about is that Tao filmed for this and I'll never get to see it ><
exo,3bhnub,AvadaK_Green,3,Mon Jun 29 12:45:32 2015 UTC,Welp... There's my daily dose of crying over Tao.
exo,3bhnub,A_dead_Teemo,3,Tue Jun 30 12:56:46 2015 UTC,"This is freaking adorable! I love Tender Love and I'm so happy we got this small ""MV"", it was totally unexpected but much much appreciated!  As for the dance practice, it's probably going to be the 20mil gift since after that, there isn't anything better they can give. It makes sense that they left it for last and I hope this will motivate people to watch the LMR MV more!  Oh and btw, how old is this? It seems like it was filmed as ot12 but they cut Kris, Luhan and Tao out. That's kinda low SM but since it's cute I'm not gonna complain too much"
exo,3bhnub,Titaneon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:15:36 2015 UTC,"Judging from Chanyeol's hair (and other members' hair) and the little logo in the video it seems to be OT12 yeah. I'm also curious how the clips of Kris, Luhan and Tao are!"
exo,3bhnub,asdfjklmthrowaway,3,Mon Jun 29 09:53:05 2015 UTC,"I think it was probably in between Wolf and Growl.  Yeol's hair is still quite short in the front but Sehun's no longer a parrot...  Ok, it's so sad I can deduce this."
exo,3bhnub,A_dead_Teemo,3,Mon Jun 29 20:41:23 2015 UTC,To be honest it wouldn't be a surprise if the ot12 video gets leaked at some point in the future. We have seen it happen before
exo,3bhnub,Titaneon,2,Mon Jun 29 11:36:47 2015 UTC,Oh really? What got leaked?
exo,3bhnub,A_dead_Teemo,2,Mon Jun 29 12:17:22 2015 UTC,"Idk about anything EXO related but Girls Generation ""Catch Me If You Can"" original MV with Jessica was leaked a week or so ago and they are also under SM so who knows what might happen.  To be clear, I'm just speculating here and we may never see the original one so don't take my words for granted"
exo,3bhnub,Titaneon,2,Mon Jun 29 12:38:21 2015 UTC,Ohh right yeah I think there was a comparsion video of the two MV's. i wonder if SM would try to find out who leaked it.

Well this is a throwback. sobs a little  I honestly thought that there was going to be a dance practice video since we haven't gotten an actual one since growl. But I mean this was cute too I guess :P xiumin ya little cutie

Second, SM please, this is SO adorable but it's honestly a cop-out haha.    Third, XiuHan is real because Minseok only used the U on the cake & held up YO which we should all know is Luhan's thing.    Fourth & finally, to quote myself from about 2 weeks ago, ""If the 20M view video is anything other than a dance version then SM is a cocktease lol."" Although at this rate, it won't be a Dance Ver. MV but rather just a dance practice."
exo,3bhnub,HurricaneBeifong,2,Mon Jun 29 12:01:01 2015 UTC,Preach it.   Xiu's Yo part killed me. I'm surprised you didn't 'gush' just how squishy Soo looks. His hair is fab btw.   All I wanna add is someone contact that SNSD fan that leaked the OT9 MV. We have work for her.

Loosely translated:   Sina Entertainment report - Recently, Luhan was witnessed riding a car to a private hospital. After getting off, he was quickly accompanied by his staff into the hospital. Sina reporter followed them into the hospital and saw the staff go through the registration while Luhan waited at a corridor. Even though he wore a mask, you could still see him bending over from time to time holding his abdomen, looking to be in pain. After a few minutes, he headed into the emergency department for treatment. Three hours later, Luhan left the emergency room and the hospital with his staff. He looked like he was sufficiently recovered. As he was leaving, he took out his phone and was seen texting.  After returning home, Luhan's career has taken off, breaking Guinness World record (I think they're referring to number of repost from his weibo) in the process. According to sources, Luhan has been filming recent and the cause of his illness is unknown. Sina reporter asked the hospital regarding the Luhan's condition and illness, but the hospital did not respond (No shit, invasion of privacy hello)."

He's that one Ravenclaw who broke into the restricted section of the library on his first day and has read every single book on it. Filch avoids him on purpose. Snape doesn't even look at him. He has a black cat that chases Mrs. Norris away.

Snape doesn't even look at him. He has a black cat that chases Mrs. Norris away.    lmao I can perfectly picture it. if Hogwarts hv a diciplinary committee that is separate from Prefect body, he'd undoubtedly be a part of it just for the sake of controlling rowdy Gryffindors coughBaekyeolcough"

Luhan is a hat stall b/w Gryff and Puff to me (I remember him saying loyalty is his strongest point in one of the old interview)."
