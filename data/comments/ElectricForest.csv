ElectricForest,3e0sos,ChiefMcHeath,6,Tue Jul 21 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"My only comment: Bassnectar speaks to an inclusiveness under an umbrella, not a sense that you've been chosen to be under it."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,itsmetimes2,5,Tue Jul 21 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"I love Bassnectar, I really do.   But I agree with the guys statement and the fact that they didn't even acknowledge the other bands, and in fact, wasted a whole day they could have been out doing things.  For what? So they can get shoved and pushed against the rail to the point of suffocation?  I feel bad for the representation Lorin's ""fans"" are giving him. The question remains though, what can be done about it? Sure, people can bitch, but others are just going to bitch back. They don't care. Sad sad."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,diosdetruenos,6,Tue Jul 21 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"Saw this on my Facebook and came to see if anybody here saw anything about it either. There were also bassheads camped on the rail at EF this year, but I don't know that they were rude? I just can't believe people would give up a whole day of a festival to occupy space in an area they don't really want to be."

ElectricForest,3e0sos,rudeboi710,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:45 2015 UTC,I was up there all day and I wouldnt say the rude ones came until cheese..But I did find it really really disrespectful for them to be sleeping and sitting down for Seun Kuti and Edward Sharpe. You just dont do that in the front row..
ElectricForest,3e0sos,tth3o,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:35 2015 UTC,"People do this all the time for all kinds of artists. Sure, there's a lot of Bassnectar attire in this photo just sitting around, but it's not 80 people... and it's not reflective of an entire fanbase. It's just a group of young assholes. Whether they realize it or not.  It's not just a Bassnectar problem."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,funk_your_face,0,Tue Jul 21 15:04:39 2015 UTC,Any examples?
ElectricForest,3e0sos,tth3o,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"examples of people waiting around for their favorite artist? no i don't, but it's common knowledge.  If you think Bassnectar fans are the only ones that do this you're extremely naive. Festivals have the power to clear the crowd after every show, it's their responsibility to make sure people act appropriately. If the festival allows it then shame on them, and whether it's regulated or not the people that do this are still assholes."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,funk_your_face,0,Tue Jul 21 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"I've been to hundreds of shows and festivals and I've never seen people sitting in front of the stage with their backs turned to the artist, taking naps, etc.  Unless you can give me one specific example I'm going to assume you're full of shit."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,tth3o,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"full of shit? lol I've been to many shows as well, and anytime their is a Jam band playing right before a headlining EDM act this ALWAYS occurs in some form or another. People do this for Skrillex, Kaskade, Big G, you name it. It's everywhere.  It's an issue on festival etiquette, it's these specific individuals that are just being assholes, and it's the Festivals problem. If they are going to let people do that then people will do it. There's always going to be a group of people that take advantage.  Saying that only Bassnectars fans do this is, in your words, being ""full of shit"""
ElectricForest,3e0sos,KindCreations,7,Tue Jul 21 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Go outside of the jam/electronic scene. People will camp ALL DAY to see Taylor swift, Bieber, Beyonc√©, Kanye. And that's not even to see them performer, that's just to maybe get a glimpse of them. People idolize celebrities.   The behavior of these kids is not right. Don't disrespect other acts. I love bass front property, I've sat on the rail for hours on end at festivals just to be in front not even just for Lorin. I've done it at shows where he's not even on the bill. But if you want to own that spot you can't just sit there. You are obligated to party for the entire time. That's a daunting task. People feel entitled like 'this is my spot, I claim it,' well own it, bitch.  Also, it is the festivals job to combat this behavior. Most shows have security right there scanning the crowd. They can see when people are acting up and often they do something about it. You just gotta hire professionals, not some amateur guys who look tough but don't know a damn thing about running security."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,rudeboi710,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"I Could not agree more!! I dont mind someone who camps all day for a show, the cult like behavior really reminds me of metal fans and how crazy they act to ride the bar, speaking of different genres. If you wanna blow your whole day for one set go ahead, and hell, maybe the fest will bless you with a good main stage. But if you are going to be up there you have to at least fucking stand up. like you said, you are obligated to rage in that position. whatever the act, because youve gotta think, theres someone out there that wants to rage in the spot you are standing in whether it be The Werks, Cheese, or Bassnectar."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,Shitcraytho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"I think it may have something to do with the fact that it keeps happening in quantity with nectar shows, and is so much that it is talked about each time.  I'm nowhere near the front for nectar shows (or almost any show for that matter) so I don't see stuff like this very often. Usually the most aggression I see leading up to nectar shows is some unapologetic movements (like light shoving or not being polite about moving through the crowd)"

ElectricForest,3e0sos,somaganjika,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"I was excited at EF when my basshead friends wanted to go up front during String Cheese.  I prefer SCI's organic music over Lorin's bass.  It was great, although I did go much harder at Bassnectar.  Lorin's roots are in death metal and so are mine and it did get a little rowdy.  Some people get knocked around and if they do it with a grin it's game on. I couldn't imagine a basshead with malice.  EF had bassheads who respectfully denied entry to their front stage real estate.  I was up there and we were letting people in who truly wanted in the pit."
ElectricForest,3e0sos,KindCreations,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"That's how it should be. The pit is a rowdy place. If you aren't the type of person who enjoys getting bumped around and that high headbanging energy, then the pit isn't for you."

ElectricForest,3e0wk3,Dave2theGrave,2,Tue Jul 21 19:54:15 2015 UTC,I haven't seen any videos yet that show his face as clearly as that one from Euphoria. Lots of people on /r/bisco saying he looked pretty tore up
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,iFUBAR,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:52 2015 UTC,My roommate was taking pictures there and said he had to be carried on stage and fell over at one point
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,Flyflyersfly28,4,Tue Jul 21 18:03:32 2015 UTC,He was definitely fucked up and very blatantly snorting shit on stage

ElectricForest,3e0wk3,WubbaLubbaDubbDubb,3,Tue Jul 21 05:35:36 2015 UTC,Whether he was or wasn't is no business of mine. He still tore it up and I had an absolute blast getting caught up in all the Pretty Lights.
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,F1GUR3,4,Tue Jul 21 04:39:14 2015 UTC,"How is it not your business man common, you pay money to go see a professional tear the fucking stage down. It's our business wheb he can't even mix because he's so fucked on stage, I don't pay money to go see someone do drugs on stage (and yes I fucking watched this guy blow shit on stage) of what I'm assuming was dope and or K cause that's what I watched, him getting  steadily fucked up and fucking everything up. He's a professional and he should act like it, I'm down with having him party a bit on stage smoke your blunts but when it interferes with the music that's when I have a problem"
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,beepbeepgreenjeep420,6,Tue Jul 21 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"Because I don't know him or anything about his personal life or the shit he's dealing with. I'm sorry you had a shitty time at his set but my entire crew had a blast. Was my 8th time seeing Derek spin, was it the best set from a technical aspect? No. But we danced our asses off which is all I was looking to do.     I'm just so fucking sick of all of these gossipy little kids from PLF and BNF acting like they know every intimate detail of people they have never met. If the dude has problems, that's between himself, his family and his friends until he personally comes out and addresses it. Speculating about his alleged drug problem does nothing but perpetuate unsubstantiated nonsense."
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,F1GUR3,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"It's not speculation buddy it's pretty fucking blatant drug use. When people pay $300+ to watching him preform and he does that shit get the fuck outa here man. I get you and your crew had a good time and it was about being with friends and blah blah blah but you can't sit there and tell me he doesn't need help. I'm not going into intimate detail of his fucking personal life at all. His drug use is blatant on stage so he's bringing his personal life to a show. I'm talking from a musical standpoint that was a disaster, ""gossipy little kids"" that's a joke. Congrats you've seen him 8 times doesn't mean anything when you sit there and defend what he is doing on stage. I haven't once gone into his ""personal life"" with krystle and all that. I'm purely bringing up what he's doing on stage, which is getting way too fucked up and fuckin up his music which he has the potential to be one of the greatest in the world at this point and he's fucking it. You see Lorin get on stage and butcher shit like that? No because he's professional and he has the fucking ability to be right there with Lorin and his drug use is getting in the way and it's a fuckin shame and its a shame people are defending him when it comes to that the man needs help and if this continues i hate to say it but I don't think he'll be around in the festival circuit much longer"
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,beepbeepgreenjeep420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"Easy homie, I'm not attacking you and I'm not defending Derek for allegedly being fucked up. I'm saying I don't know him, you don't know him, and 99% of the people who are tearing him apart for a myriad of reasons that nobody can seem to agree upon don't fucking know him either. The dude is entitled to keep his personal life private and until he or his family comes out and says that D has a problem and needs help, it's not our place to subject the poor guy to some morbid version of TMZ for h3tti kids that is only backed factual by hearsay found on social media."
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,F1GUR3,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry dude, but it's not alleged. I was at that Euphoria set. He was honestly so spun it was scary. He couldn't even see straight to light a blunt."
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,JoshBobJovi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not attacking you, I'm trying to get my point across that he is blatantly fucked up on stage and it's obvious it's not even up for debate. That's the point I'm making its gotten to the point that his personal life is brought on stage with him. Yes I don't know much about the man but from the point of stage presence, it's clear that there's something going on up there that's interfering with his music.  It's ridiculous that you are saying we can't have an opinion on the matter when I'm sitting there paying money to see him. I'm sorry if I seem to be attacking you its just generally what people are saying about him and I just disagree completely. Needs to be a point where his fan base speaks up, his fans love him and hate seeing him like this.  At this point it's not ""TMZ"" gossip it's blatantly fucking up his live sets"
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,beepbeepgreenjeep420,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:02 2015 UTC,Agreed 100% ... I had a blast at his set.
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,OG_PANCAKE_HOUSE,5,Tue Jul 21 10:53:14 2015 UTC,its definitely our business when he keeps on fucking up over and over bc hes too fucked up  he definitely did not tear it up. the only thing he tore up that night was his nose
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,KillaBass,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I like to hear.  I've been going to PL sets for a long time and he has been off and on various substances throughout that time.  Always seems to put on a good set regardless of how fucked up he is.  Granted, he probably plays better when he isn't blasted, but who am I to really judge someone's drug use?"
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,bazookajt,3,Tue Jul 21 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"I was middle railing and looking at that man's face the whole set. It is all a bunch of rumors about the snorting shit on stage but not saying it didnt happen.  I enjoyed PL's set immensly and it was probably one of the top sets for me of the weekend.  Yes he did fuck up some transitions, but he also recovered after he fucked up by trying to beat match and get the crowd into it.  There was a ton of feels in that place that we brought the man to tears, this was my first PL show that I have seen him brought to tears from the crowd (thought it was a rumor when that stuff happened)  People are quick to hate because the guy has clearly had a rough time since the break up: he even said something along the lines over the mic ""shout out to the ones you once thought you loved"""
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,chris_cr33p,3,Tue Jul 21 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"His recovery was just completely cutting the music and just restarting the song. At one point he tried to mix 3 tracks on top of each other it sounded like ass. He was too fucked up on stage and we all know it, stop defending the man he needs help"
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,beepbeepgreenjeep420,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:28 2015 UTC,"where did I say that he doesn't need help and where am I defending him?  Also, if you arent expecting him to be so fucked up on stage that he barely functions are you a true PL fan? He has been that way for at least a year now. and compared to his big guava he fucking murdered it and was sober."
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,chris_cr33p,6,Tue Jul 21 17:37:07 2015 UTC,"Damn yo, ARE YOU A TRUE PL FAN BRO? You sound like a moron. I know DVS likes to party, I've met the man on multiple occasions. The fact you are okay with your favorite artist getting too fucked up to function and pull together a full set without messing up is sad. I love his music from the studio and listen to every the HOT shit that comes out, but no I'm not a fan of him live. I'm not gonna sit here and give money to some guy getting to fucked up to function. It's just watching a drug addict fall apart onstage and I deal with that enough in life between some of my friends to watching it at festivals, I dont go to a show to watch it onstage. That is why I'm not some DIE HARD PL FAN OVER HERE, cause I dont support what I've seen multiple times from him."
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,beepbeepgreenjeep420,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"read somewhere that someone posted that his fan base needs to stop enabling him, to make it ok that he can barely function. you pretty much defined it right there and i couldnt agree more"
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,tanrisgnar07,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly his fanbase is trying to defend what is happening on stage because they are protective of DVS, so they defend him by saying dont go into his personal life, but his personal life has been brought to the stage. I understand but there needs to be a point when people stop sitting here telling eachother how its okay for this to happen."

You arent speaking truths your speaking bullshit, just like the ""i bet hes double fucked up with the hot shit"" just sounds so stupid, being onstage fucked up and being in the studio are two complete opposite things. I dont get why you even would bring that up. He was a mess onstage and thats all im saying, and from a music stand point it was a shitshow and if you cant agree with that I'm sorry you a deaf."
ElectricForest,3e0wk3,beepbeepgreenjeep420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"not saying that he should be that fucked up, but if you are expecting him not to be then you will get a rude awakening"

He was a shitshow, bumping shit on stage, trying to mix songs and just massively fucking up and would go on to just completely cut the song happened 5 times. Not to mention his bass was turned out for 5 minutes. He was massively fucked on stage and it was so obvious, really hurt to see. Been jamming to PL since 2007 and it was hard to watch."

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,JonesinForAHosin,2,Tue Jul 21 10:44:25 2015 UTC,1st time seeing bassnectar. It fit my forest perfectly. I was going HAM and having a great night :)
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,TripAndFly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:28 2015 UTC,I'm glad you enjoyed it! It just wasn't what I was looking for in that moment. It seems to be a very divisive set for most people
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,JonesinForAHosin,6,Tue Jul 21 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"I was actually surprised by String Cheese. Now I've seen the 15+ times, but that was some of the most adventurous jamming I've heard from them since I've been seeing them, way more type 2 kinda stuff (if you're into the Phish lingo). It reminded me of '99-'01 Cheese, and I can't stop listening to the boards from that weekend. Sit ins were on point too. Still haven't decided about the dubstep Terrapin, I drift between loving it and being indifferent towards it.   I was also surprised by Electron, I knew they were all top notch musicians, but I caught their late night VIP set and it might have been the best set I saw the whole time. Closest thing to Sammy-era Disco Biscuits I've ever heard, I was smiling for hours afterwords!  I was working for most of the festival, so I was so appreciative to be able to see any music at all that I'm not sure that anything could have disappointed me!"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,ElDoctor,3,Mon Jul 20 20:43:38 2015 UTC,Cheese was amazing. But what does type 2 mean?
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,JonesinForAHosin,4,Mon Jul 20 22:01:12 2015 UTC,A Type 1 jam stays within the confines of the original song (think guitar solo) -- a type 2 jam breaks the format and explores new space. (Different key/tempo/signature/feel) but still its technically the same song and sometimes they bring it back. Hope that helps
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,derpaperd,3,Mon Jul 20 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"These jam bands that have been around for a long time tend to evolve into different styles of improvisation and jamming as well as what some view as high points throughout their career. This can be especially obvious if they ever go on hiatus. To use the most famous example of phish, they have what their phans call the phish 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 ""eras"". So what they're saying is that they felt Forest Cheese delved into some of their older styles of jamming (before their hiatus) correct me if I'm wrong Doctor"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,kcovelo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:46:27 2015 UTC,You're close! See my other reply
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,ElDoctor,4,Tue Jul 21 00:57:22 2015 UTC,Fair haha. Mine was more of a blanket statement about types and eras. But you are spot on sir. You a fellow phan?
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,kcovelo,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:59 2015 UTC,Tour starts tomorrow.  Get ready!
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,kcovelo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:43 2015 UTC,Heeeeeeere phishy phishy phishy
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,ElDoctor,2,Tue Jul 21 05:07:34 2015 UTC,"So Type 1 jamming is improv based around a single chord progression or theme, and Type 2 jamming is improvising the chord progressions, rhythms, and the whole structure of the music. In the past I've found Cheese jams to be more branching off on the melody/chords of the song, but his year at Forest I noticed that they would often just go way off from the song they started on in a brand new direction, and it was great!"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,stinkybirdfarts,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:28 2015 UTC,i downloaded the electron set.. they do 2006 era biscuits perfect. so good.
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,fuckingname,6,Tue Jul 21 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"Bassnectar let me  down, but I was so far away from the stage I don't think It would have been fun no matter who was playing.  I left that and easily walked up to the front of Green Velvet right before cvs started.  Those were some funky sets.  Easilty my favorite."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,rhinoceroast,6,Mon Jul 20 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"Surprised:  jackLNDN  Saw his first set and was blown away so I had to see his other two scheduled sets.  As far as house music goes no one came close to his sets all weekend.  I've been all about the deep house since.  Letdown:  Carnage  I've seen Carnage live 4 times now since 2012 and this was by far one of the laziest, unoriginal sets by him."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,rhinoceroast,4,Mon Jul 20 22:28:21 2015 UTC,jackLNDN was awesome.  I honestly spent a good 3 hours everyday at the forest stage chasing those groovy deep house vibes

Eden (not a fan of their new style)"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,anqvu,5,Mon Jul 20 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Surprise: Vibe Street was straight filthy, I caught his Forest opening set and it was wild, he dropped a No Diablo Umphreys remix that was insane, good way to start the Forest. LetDown: Gonna also go with Snails most because the set was trappy as all hell for no reason, if that was your first Snails set I am sorry, I left Scamp literally saying ""that was one of the best sets ive ever seen"" walking away from the Vibe Tent, 10 min into Snails at Forest, I knew we werent getting the filth and I was upset."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,whatarewedrinking,7,Mon Jul 20 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"Let Down: Big Gigantic. That is not how you close a festival, what a huge disappointment. Both gimmicky and painful.    Surprised: Slow Magic. I was already excited to see him but his live show blew me away. I couldn't stop dancing!"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,iFUBAR,3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:52 2015 UTC,Are you a fan of big gigantic/ have you seen them before? What did you not like about them?
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,jellybeanofDOOM,7,Mon Jul 20 22:18:17 2015 UTC,"It was the exact same set they always play. When you're closing out a festival, you don't play a cookie cutter set. I should have gone to Oakenfold."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,JonesinForAHosin,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Oakenfold was awesome, I slightly regret leaving to go see big g (the crowd there was just too massive!) but I'm pretty sure I stopped at goldfish along the way which made it worthwhile too."

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,djturn2,5,Tue Jul 21 10:46:46 2015 UTC,"I am a Big G fan. I didn't like the talking/yelling in between every song, the ""GET YOUR FUCKIN HANDS UPPPP!!"", and I felt like a lot of the songs they played were kind of poor choices, i.e. Uptown Funk."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,djturn2,15,Mon Jul 20 22:20:50 2015 UTC,This will get downvoted to the point that it's hidden but we left Bassnectar after 30 minutes. I wasn't entertained in the slightest. I am obviously in the minority and nobody cares if I was entertained but he was my second most anticipated act and I actually left during it. I wouldn't have paid $20 to go see that at our local venue. Still a huge fan overall though.
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,zodiacmusik,6,Mon Jul 20 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"and I totally understand it's all in taste. I heard people talk about how dissapointed they were with Skrillex and honestly, he was my #1 most anticipated and BY FAR my favorite set of the weekend. A lot of people have their complaints but I fucking loved it (I've seen him 4 times and EF was my favorite)."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,Syaoran07,4,Mon Jul 20 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Ya I left skrillex after 3 songs to go see lotus. Best decision I made all weekend, Lotus killed it. Was excited for skrill but wasn't feeling his set"

Skrillex - This is probably owed to having been shut out on two previous Skrillex shows I had tickets to see due to unforeseen circumstances, but his set lit me up.  Odessa - Like I said, sober on Thursday night, but they put it down. Never even listened to a live show of theirs, but I really enjoyed it.  Snails - HOLY SHIT.  Everyone Orchestra: As I described it on Twitter: ""a real treat.""  Let Downs: Flume - Whole crew ended up leaving 20-30 minutes in. I agree with /u/JonesinForAHosin in that his music vibes more with me when I'm chilling with some headphones.  Gramatik/Big Gigantic - This might be due to just being plain worn out by the end of the weekend, but I wasn't into it. The times I've seen Big G in a smaller venue have been more enjoyable for me.  Mr. Carmack - Meeeehhhh."

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,KindCreations,3,Mon Jul 20 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"His first 3 songs were at like half BPM, I have no idea what that was about. Sounded really weird."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,Humkangout,3,Mon Jul 20 19:05:33 2015 UTC,It's not supposed to flow. It's supposed to be heavy and all over the place. Like getting smacked in the face on a sailboat during a massive storm. Then you projectile vomit all over yourself.
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,docklsd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"When he played recently in Knoxville he did use a few ""tricks"" to get to a new song without actually transitioning. He still killed it though."

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,PleasureCakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:06 2015 UTC,I was also surprised by my Craigslist hookup. She was actually attractive and was down to try the wheelbarrow.
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,JonesinForAHosin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:05 2015 UTC,Surprised: Gramatik omg. Amazing.  Let down? Have to say Skrillex. I was really looking forward to his set but it felt kinda meh :(
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,hashtronaut15,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"Flume and Bassnectar were my let downs. I couldn't get into Flume at all for some reason but I love his music. I think it's more meant for at home listening in my case. And I wish Bassnectar would've brought it so much harder, I did not enjoy that set too much"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,JonesinForAHosin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"Spot on, flume played his slower songs for the 1st half of his set, not what he's done in the past.    N same with basicnectar, just bluuuh"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,nom4d_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"I left like half an hour into Flume and went to Carl Cox instead. I was like ""Damn, I should've just went to Carl Cox.""

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,atreyu_0844,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"surprised: Odesza and Flume. I was expecting good shows form both of them but they blew my expectations. Also 12th Planet, KOAN Sound, Dabin, BTSM (left early for Gramatik) and Goldfish all were great too.  Let Down: Bassnectar. Ive seen him 3 times and this was my least favorite. I just felt like his mixing was kindof off and the vibes of the crowd were off as well, i didn't feel the usual Forest love at his set. I was really hoping to get down and ""go hard"". Just my opinion don't hate me lol. He's still in my top 5 artists though. I was also disappointed with Skrillex, it was a very typical set and it seems like he has been playing the same set for awhile now."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,ihavenowisdom,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"Surprised: Made in Heights, Bassnectar (I know, I know, but it was my first time seeing him, and just, wow)  Let Down: Flume (The previous 2 times I'd seen him were in crowds of less than 300 ppl, so I guess that spoiled me)"
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,drugsrgay,4,Mon Jul 20 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to agree with you on Flume.  The entire set just felt off.  He wasn't playing to the crowd well, some of the music seemed overly complicated/abstract, and the way he came out after a 15-20 minute delay was lackluster at best."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,hashtronaut15,6,Mon Jul 20 18:38:13 2015 UTC,It literally felt like he had taken an iPod with his songs and was just playing them one after the other. Felt like there was no DJing or anything. Biggest let down of the weekend for me by far
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,ihavenowisdom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"That's how Flume sets have always been in my experience.  Seen him twice before forest and just saw him again in Paris last week and it was the same, I'm probably just going to ditch my friends next time instead of staying with the group like I've done twice now."
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,hashtronaut15,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:19 2015 UTC,Same for ditching but when it comes to odesza...to much future trance
ElectricForest,3dyxzr,atreyu_0844,4,Mon Jul 20 23:17:18 2015 UTC,It makes 0 sense to me to how someone didn't enjoy odeszas forest set being that it was absolutely indescribably amazing but to each his own

Cheese really drew me in this year, when last year I wasn't feeling it. There's more, I'm sure.       Let downs?

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,kpmoran95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:16:22 2015 UTC,"Surprised by: The secret show in Goodlife with Skrillex. I skipped him earlier in the evening because I knew he was going to do the same shit I have seen before. I was then pleasantly surprised to hear him put on something completely different that felt more like being in your local dive bar with a bunch of DJs screwing around. Biggest Let Down: Alison Wonderland. I had high hopes to see some interesting live stuff from her, but she was playing a pre-made playlist from what I could tell. When she walked away from her equipment to talk-blast the crowd, I did the same and moved on to a different show."

The crowd was massive and the vibe was just off. First Ttime seeing Bassnectar and I guess the hype train got me too excited. I think anything following that Cheese set would be a letdown.

ElectricForest,3dyxzr,TripAndFly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Surprised by Carnage.   We left Skrillex's shitty set and were so disappointed we ever even left Tripolee.  We were super amped to see skrilly throw down and it were super unimpressed.  I think my whole group just looked at each other and grabbed our shit at once and went back.  Carnage tore things up and NO ONE was there. Was great to have the room to dance.  Other disappointments.   Bassnectar.  Great set and all, and I don't mean to sound like a spoiled brat.... but I've seen him a good 15 times now.  This time, I did not see Bassnectar.  I saw TOTEMNECTAR.  So, thanks everyone with a totem, and for the 600000 people that continually pushed past me after we stood in a spot for an hour through String Cheese to get a good spot for Nectar.... hope you ""found your friends"" ;)  Hope no one got a black eye from me actually trying to dance.   I'll be spending my cash on my nectar 2.5 hour long specialty sets.   Def a let down after how Red Rocks pumped me up.  edit to add, probs because we had a not great spot.  sound was shit, couldn't see anything.  I bet people up front had a blast besides lack of air and room to dance."
