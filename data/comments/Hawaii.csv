Apparently what was said is that my grandma couldn't get her car into gear. So she jumped out of the car to flag down her son. (My uncle, the boys father). As she stood out side the car, [REDACTED] decided to jump into the drivers seat, started the car and apparently put it into gear. My grandma instead of moving out of the way decided to try to stop the car from rolling by holding the door, but fell. ... Did he know what the out come would have been? Or was he just trying to help our grandma cause he knew she was having car problems? I don't know!!! No body knows except for [the boy]. All I know is my family is grieving...to watch two strong men (my dad and brother) break and be so vulnerable. Just breaks my heart n angers me so much!   Sad story all around.

Or the police officer who got a DUI, and then was caught masturbating in public areas where children were present, and instead of going to jail like everyone else would go, he goes to California for sobriety treatment, only to get arrested again for public intoxication.     Maui is a small island, where it is difficult to be anonymous, yet we still have plenty of illegal drugs, weekend chicken fights, all kinds of theft issues.

First would be a shot of the post office with the mountains in the background with the kaaawa po sign legible early evening during 'magic hour'. Since you have a drone the second shot would be a panoramic of mountains and sea from a few hundred feet up above lihimauna st. Third would be a drone pano shot as you enter kaaawa from kuuloa direction. A bonus would be a shot of large waterfalls after heavy rains, again from lihimauna st looking mauka. You have to time it just right with lighting after a heavy rain. Would gladly pay for one of those shots that I can blow up to 18x24 and have framed."

As for the waterfall yeah that's more of a December thing. But kaaawa early evening is always pretty no matter from where. I see so many Kailua and Kaneohe magic hour shots but never kaaawa. I was thinking w a drone you can capture the whole town at once.

Hawaii,3dt1rd,_olopops_,0,Sun Jul 19 04:29:13 2015 UTC,Sweet pic.  I spent a lot of time in the Kailua / Lanikai area and how I do miss those sunrises...and sunsets too.

Hawaii,3ds4n9,Kerid01,4,Sat Jul 18 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"Almost all the locations you can drive and view for free. Just go to camp Erdman, (others camp) and down the road is Mokuleia (crash site). Then go to Judd trail for all the other spots."

Hawaii,3ds4n9,Eode11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"I work at kualoa ranch, one of the places where they filmed lost. I'll tell you that kos is the only outside tour company allowed to come into our land for these kinds of tours (that I know of/have seen) .   I've never been on a tour with them, but have heard nothing but good things about them."

Hawaii,3dro4g,mytrollyguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:06:30 2015 UTC,All the trucks are yellow?
Hawaii,3dro4g,Lonetrek,2,Sat Jul 18 23:55:09 2015 UTC,Yup. iirc the only red HFD truck is an inactive 'classic' engine with the soft/removable top. Saw it today as a matter of fact on H1 going east by ewa
Hawaii,3dro4g,hellochase,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:30:38 2015 UTC,Thick white smoke blowing straight down Kapiolani at about 8.30am. Hope everyone got out OK.
