weekendgunnit,3e2mof,weekendbot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:48 2015 UTC,doesnt that send you a notification? Why you no shitbot flair?
weekendgunnit,3e2mof,umich2005,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"actually it does not send anymore since RU added the shitbot commands.   the phrasing is now a relic of a simpler time. perhaps if he sees this when he has time he can update it to say ""awaiting mod confirmation"" or something and when one of us sees it we can summon shitbot.   we did away with the notification because I was getting a shit-ton of them and it was annoying me. think about how annoying modmail was when whatshisdick started the redditgunstatenetwork thing. coincidentally the notifications and manual flair was the reason the 14yr old got banned the first time."
weekendgunnit,3e2mof,weekendbot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:35 2015 UTC,no flair set due to lack of target username
weekendgunnit,3e2mof,FlyingPeacock,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"So, what ended up actually happening? Did you do the charge back, or did they refund? Is it pitchfork time already?"
weekendgunnit,3e2mof,FlyingPeacock,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"Im waiting on them to say yes or no to my request of a partial refund. They have offered to re-do the slide and cerakote the 2 barrels for free, but I was never interested in coating the barrels to begin with. They saw the posts on reddit. They want to maintain their reputation, and I don't blame them. But I can't bring myself to drop any more gun stuff off there. I lost sleep over this shit last night.  I'm preparing all the shit to take to the bank for a chargeback in the full amount if I don't hear from them by 4:00pm today"
weekendgunnit,3e2mof,Bluekestral,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry man. Best of luck with the bank. My advice would be when you take your stuff to the bank, show them the gun, and make sure to sweep everyone in the bank so they know it's a serious issue.   But in all seriousness, I hope the refund works out one way or another."
