triangle,3du8up,raugturi,5,Sun Jul 19 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Durham to RTP isn't bad at all, especially if you're OK with a toll. I drive from the northern part of Durham to the middle of RTP every day in <20 minutes. It's a little slower coming home sometimes. If you skip the 147 toll it adds maybe 5 minutes each way, depending on where you're going.  Raleigh to RTP sucks, everything from around 55/Davis Drive east is backed up all the damn time. 540 might be alright, I don't know. If it is then North Raleigh wouldn't be too bad.  Chapel Hill is a bit farther away, but my co-worker drives it every day and says it isn't too bad. I guess 54 can get backed up and slow things down but he has ways around it.  Apex used to be pretty good since it's straight down 55, but it's gotten more popular and may be slower.  Cary I hate, but that's just personal preference. It's a suburb for rich people that's just one big strip mall interspersed with overpriced houses that don't have yards. It is convenient for driving to RTP though, so far as I know.  And last there's Morrisville, which basically is in RTP. Mostly apartments though, since there's less land available for sprawling.  The downside of all of them is that you can't really depend on public transit at all to get anywhere that isn't local. I've tried it and it just sucks. The bus systems connect to each other in reasonable ways. But by the time you take a bus to your local station, a connection to the other city, and a local bus there to your destination it takes forever. And the service in RTP is very hit or miss. My current job there's a shuttle that stops right at my parking lot. My last one required at 1.5 mile walk that crossed the interstate entrance ramps and made me fear for my life.  The cities are also different, so you may want to factor in what kind of place you want to live in. Chapel Hill/Carrboro is for hippies, Durham is for wannabe Portlanders who gentrify and don't mind the higher crime rate, Cary/Apex is for yuppies, North Raleigh is for yuppies who want more space for sprawling than Cary/Apex will allow, Raleigh is for young Republicans.

That's actually really helpful information, and I would welcome any responses that counter your generalizations, but it definitely gives me a very broad sense of the greater Triangle area.  Regarding crime in Durham, are there extremely safe areas of the city or do you generally accept the possibility of a break-in or hold-up when you decide to move there? I've been mugged before at loaded gun point (which was shot in the air to scare me shitless after I was pistol whipped and kicked to the ground), so I would like to avoid crime in general."

Although the ongoing gentrification blurs the lines and pushes things around if you live right inside downtown.  I live sort of in between some shitty areas and a decent neighborhood and also got robbed a few years ago. Three armed men came into my house and held us at gun/knife point until we managed to escape. According to my next door neighbor who has lived here 30 years that's the first thing like that that's ever happened in this neighborhood though.  If you go just a few miles west there are little neighborhoods with houses that go for over $300-$750k. Go a few miles south and east of downtown and you'll find abandon drug houses you could buy for a dollar.  If you go to some of the online crime maps it should look more clear, but places like Trinity Park, Northgate Park, Trinity Heights, over near Duke's campus, Old North Durham, most of those are pretty safe. Near downtown, a bit east of it (like Albright area) and Braggtown are probably the least safe.  I live just outside of Northgate, but right along a busy road and the interstate. And basically only got picked for the robbery because we were awake so far as I can tell. They seemed intent on making sure someone was up, I assume to ensure no one surprised them with a gun."

Raleigh, I find, is a lot more consistent as far as good/bad areas.  As a lady-creature, I'll run on my own around Raleigh but won't in Durham.  I think in the next 10-15 years, Durham is going to be a really amazing, cleaned up city.  A better, classier version of itself.  All that being said--if you're into a more adult night life (shows, beer, wine, theater) then Durham is your jam.  Raleigh tends more towards club type things, it seems.  Both have a great culture.

I count on a 30-45 minute commute every day.  It's not terrible and I've only been in one catastrophic accident!  Seriously though, it's not that bad.  A lot of the guys I work with, tho, live in apartment complexes w/in walking distance of work and I'll admit to jealousy.  Lots of jealousy."

Thank you so much for the recommendation :)   We had fresh rolls, cashew veggies & tofu, ""evil jungle noodles"" with tofu, and sticky rice with coconut custard - all of which were delicious and well priced. Spice level was spot on, and you can choose between regular spicy, very spicy, and ""make you cry"" spicy. The sauce on the cashew tofu had a really interesting flavor that I've never had with Thai before but was aaaaamazing! It was definitely a Thai flavor and not at all similar to Chinese style cashew dishes. The veggies were all fresh and crisp with the perfect texture, and the tofu was cooked nicely as well.   It doesn't look like much from the outside but the decor inside is really cute and quirky. The staff was super sweet and everything came out very quickly... I'd say less than 10 minutes? AND they had nigori sake! I have to admit that it doesn't quite compare to Taste of Thai in GSO but they set an incredibly high bar. I would definitely recommend Sawasdee and since it's right next to EdMcKay's, it will likely become a regular spot of ours.   I also really appreciated that they had a whole section of vegetarian dishes (12 or so) on their menu, with several other options where you could simply swap meat for tofu. They even remind you on the menu to ask for no egg if you're vegan.   TL;DR - Sawasdee was DELICIOUS and I would definitely recommend them to friends & family - especially for vegans/vegetarians!"

triangle,3dpbr5,likewut,0,Mon Jul 20 07:10:26 2015 UTC,I mean is there any benefit to testing speed with direct connection(wired) to router rather than over wifi?
triangle,3dpbr5,dogsinbathtub,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:00 2015 UTC,wifi will have a hard time doing 100mbps unless you have the latest shit.  Even N900 is lucky to actually do 100mbps.
triangle,3dpbr5,iends,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about this. Are you getting a hard cap at 100 Mbps? Because the modem is advertised as being able to handle up to 343 Mbps.  Also, mind sharing the general part of the triangle you're in? And when did your new speeds kick in?"
triangle,3dpbr5,dogsinbathtub,2,Sat Jul 18 06:19:30 2015 UTC,Unfortunately its only rated at 100 on their list of modems. So im guessing its capped. They only support a handfull of modems at 200+ which is pretty funny...
triangle,3dpbr5,Jazzy_Josh,3,Sat Jul 18 07:12:01 2015 UTC,Not capped per say. They just spread the load across more channels.
triangle,3dpbr5,DougEubanks,2,Sat Jul 18 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"TWC caps the 6141 at 100 because it only uses 8 download channels and that affects bandwidth available to neighbors. Despite the modem being capable of faster speeds, TWC will only give the higher speed if it can spread it across more channels (e.g. the 6183).   I have ultimate, just picked up a 6183 (previously used 6141). Now I get 230/20 rather than 100/10. Also it appears my iPhone 5S won't download faster than 80 Mbps and my iPad around 150."

I talked to 4 different people, and couldn't get it back to my original price, nor could I drop the phone and get just internet at $65, which was advertised on their site for new customers.

The last few years of it in AVL, I was given the distinct feeling by people involved that AC Entertainment was looking to expand the lineups to include larger & more popular acts (but who might not use Moog devices often, or at all), and the Moog foundation was looking to go more the direction of a SXSW style event where the showcase would really be the daytime conferences and sessions, with the music in the evenings not being the only major focal point."

Google the modem and TWC in the same key phrase before purchasing.  Always look for things like ""signal drops, intermittent interruption, etc.""  According to a level 3 TWC tech support guy, some of the vendors i.e. Zoom on that list are only there because they filed a lawsuit against TWC to force them on the list.  Consequently, TWC ""officially"" supports them, but ""unofficially"" doesn't test them and won't do anything to help you troubleshoot them."

triangle,3d76k9,davidoffbeat,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"That's not how bandwidth and data usage works at all.  This title sucks fat donkey balls. It's misleading, hate-mongering bullshit.  Or, perhaps it's just ignorance/technical illiteracy and I shouldn't be so harsh on OP.  Either way, the title inaccurately portrays the situation.  You use as much data as you use.  Period. Speeds don't (directly) impact that at all. That's what the 1TB limit is in reference to.  Your bandwidth is how quickly you can download or upload said data.  If you have 50Mbps download speeds with a 1TB data cap, it's the same amount of data.  It just comes down slower than if you have 200mbps down.  It's not a perfect analogy but it's like a car's time in a quarter mile.  The two cars will cover the exact same distance, but at different rates. A Honda accord may go a quarter mile in in 15.8 seconds while a Aventador may go a quarter mile in 10.5 seconds.  Both went the exact same distance though.  If you drive 1,000 miles a month, that's not going to inherently change just because you get a faster car.  It's just that each trip to work, the grocery store, etc. is going to be faster or simply take less time (if you're limited by the car's ability rather than speed limits).  But instead of trips to work or stores, it's visits to websites, videos loading, downloading, etc. that will take less time with faster download speeds.  1TB/mo. is plenty for most people at this point. Just like most people put roughly 12-15k miles on their car each year. 1TB/mo. will cover most people just fine.  Let's look at an actual use case.  Let's say I download/stream 4 tv shows a week and I download 2 movies/week.  A 720p hour long tv show is about 1.5GB. A two hour movie may be up to 4GB with decent compression.  So 4 x 1.5 = 6GB  2 x 4 = 8GB  That's 14GB/week total.  Let's say another 6GB of random internet pictures and videos to bring it to 20GB/week.  That's 80GB per month (using a 4 week month).  That leaves 920GB before I hit my 1TB limit.  I.e., I will have used a whopping 8% of my data limit.  For those of you who want to calculate your own usage, Netflix HD is about 3GB per hour.  Standard definition is about 1GB per hour.  So if you watch 4 hours of HD Netflix EVERY day, that's still just 360GB per month (30 x 12GB).  About 36% of your cap."
triangle,3d76k9,sin-eater82,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:04:07 2015 UTC,"Sure if YOU watch 4 hours of netflix every day it's no big deal...what about when you have kids who watch a couple hours a day each, and a husband/wife who watches some, etc.  Plus unless it's changed the usage rate for 1080p streaming is more like 4.7gb/hr....and more people might be shifting to 4k in the next 3 years (ATT wants you to sign up for 36 months)   Streaming in 1080p on Netflix takes up 4.7GB/hour. So a regular one-hour episode of something debiting less than 5GB from your allotment is no big deal. However, with 4K, you've got quadruple the pixel count, so you're burning through 18.8GB/hour.

Berkeley findings:   Lane-splitting is safe if done in traffic moving at 50 mph or less, and if motorcyclists do not exceed the speed of other vehicles by more than 15 mph 69 percent of lane-splitting motorcyclists were exceeding the traffic speed by 15 mph or less speed differentials up to 15 mph were not associated with changes in the frequency of injury Compared to riders who were not splitting lanes, lane-splitting motorcyclists were markedly less likely to suffer head injury (9 percent vs. 17 percent), torso injury (19 percent vs. 29 percent) or fatal injury (1.2 percent vs. 3 percent) Lane-splitting riders were significantly less likely to be rear-ended than non-lane-splitting riders (2.6 percent vs. 4.6 percent) Lane-splitting motorcyclists were more likely to be wearing a full-face helmet than other motorcyclists (81 percent vs. 67 percent) Compared to other motorcyclists, lane-splitting riders were more often riding on weekdays and during commuting hours, were using better helmets and were traveling at slower speeds; Lane-splitting riders were less likely to have been using alcohol."
triangle,3d6hxf,fenderfreek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just read the wikipedia page and it seemed like a solid conclusion was not met in many cases.   Lane-splitting riders were less likely to have been using alcohol.   This finding is strange to me though. If lane-splitters in their study were less likely to be drunk driving, won't that skew the data to make it seem like it is more safe? I have a hard time believing that if lane-splitting were to be legal that people would not do so if they were drunk. It is an interesting finding, and I wonder why that is. Usually people get more daring after drinking."
triangle,3d6hxf,Leggilo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:23 2015 UTC,I would guess that most of the lane splitting accidents occur during rush hours (ie commuting times) while most drunk driving accidents occur when there is substantially less traffic after dark.
triangle,3d6hxf,Calamity_Jesus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"It's because lane-splitting isn't for just blasting between cars whenever you feel like it.

triangle,3d6hxf,theinfamousj,6,Tue Jul 14 02:36:19 2015 UTC,The bus is keeping to its schedule as best it can. This rule isn't there to make bus riding better than car commuting - there are plenty of other reasons for this - but to keep the busses on schedule as best as possible.  You have no idea what its route is. It may have gotten off at the exit and then done several side streets to drop people off only to double back to the Amtrak station. I have no idea either. The point is that people on the bus were getting home in a timely manner and the people at the bus stops were being picked up in a timely manner.

There's a lot of times where you wouldn't pass them later. Plus, the act keeps them in a more constant motion which is better for the engine, brakes, etc. than stop and go which probably cost less for maintenance."

For starters: I understand that to people who may have come from a rural area in the South, this is truly the ""exciting big city"", and is comparatively progressive, interesting, and full of great things. But what I've personally got to compare it with is truly progressive areas (the Pacific Northwest, the SF Bay Area), and way more interesting cities like Charleston, Boston, Denver, or even Austin. To me, this area is just one big wasteland of shitty corporate campuses, eerily identical crappily built subdivisions filled with the Southern version of Stepford wives, and a couple of tiny downtown areas that are all but dead. I've lived all over the world, and have also traveled a lot for work, and I literally cannot think of anywhere I've ever been or lived that I like less than this area, unless you count a few places I've only driven through. This place has all the traffic hassles, insane housing prices, and other annoyances of a place that contains a real city with real things to do and real interest, yet it doesn't have any of the good things."

Cost of living is getting a little high here, though.   Overall an okay balance if you're looking to escape other tech centric areas that are now stupidly expensive (bay area, sea tac). I wasn't surprised to see Austin and Denver on your list, but I was surprised that  included Boston.    I understand what you are saying about culture and things to do, but for the COL in the NE, you could get much more bang for your buck in other, newer, areas of the country. I've found opportunities in the NE to be dead ends and each city to be a total poverty trap. Compare that to an area like SEATAC and there is no competition. Really, I think the magic of the entire NE corridor is dead, which is why people are jumping ship to other areas of the country."
triangle,3d0hdv,stinkycheesefart,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:04:41 2015 UTC,"The thing about COL as a compelling reason to live in a place is this: it really only matters if a) you're talking about one of the truly most insanely expensive places in the country (e.g. SF, or really pretty much the whole Bay Area at this point), b) you're in an extremely limited-income situation and that's never likely to change (e.g. a person who is permanently, severely disabled, or also perhaps someone who works in a minimum wage career field and doesn't see that changing at any point), or c) you insist on the biggest McMansion money can buy. In the case of a lot of the people who are moving to NC, the last of these three reasons seems to be what compels them. But why?   If my husband and I were to move back to, say, Seattle, and planned to live there forever, we'd end up in a small, modest house like most people in that area have. If we stayed here, yes, we could buy one of those shitty 3k square foot McMansions. But to me, having a giant house doesn't even come close to being worth what it really ""costs"": the opportunity cost of great career advancement possibilities, the cost of boredom from lack of cultural amenities and lack of interesting people to socialize with, the cost of dealing with exceptionally backwater and subpar systems of health care and education, the health cost of living in a car-centric area with pretty much zero opportunity for outdoor exercise (yes, I know people love to soil themselves with amazement over the fact that there are a couple of ""greenways"" that run for a block or two at a time, but that's nothing compared to any real city) and the cost of living in a place where politics are pretty much stuck in the antebellum era.  I used to live in a tiny apartment in Silicon Valley that was so shoddily built that the room shook when my upstairs neighbors walked around. It cost an insane amount. I'd move back there in a heartbeat if I could, because low-cost giant houses aren't worth everything else in my life being awful."

Why in the world are so many LEOs so afraid of dogs, and the people they serve? There was never any great increase in police maulings. There was never any great increase in Ranger maulings.   If the average service tech, door-to-door salesman and postal worker can deal with dogs every single day without shooting them, why can't rangers and cops?

You have to 'jump' a chain that blocks the old road, and carry your equipment down the old road until you hit the water.  Don't expect to catch anything but catfish.  Also, you can park at the end of tharrington rd, and it's a much shorter walk to go fishing. The home owners at the time didn't really like us parking at the end of the road, but there's no law against it(public street), and if you have your fishing license there's nothing they can do about it.

Both require training that you can get at community college with a semester of evening classes (that will cost you about $400). I don't know anything about the job market for NAs, but as an EMT-Basic, you'll probably need to spend some time volunteering before you'll be considered for a part-time/full-time job (it'll take two years to reach the 1000 hour mark if you're a volunteer working the minimum required shifts).

triangle,3cmpw2,soc_jones,2,Thu Jul 9 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"It only has a chance if you take it in and work on socializing it -- very few rescues have the ability to socialize feral or semi-feral kittens, and they pretty much all have waiting lists this time of year. No one but animal control can just come ""collect it."" I'd call around and see if you can get on a rescue's waiting list with the understanding that you would keep the kitten with you until it can be taken in.  And look on your own for a home for it in the meantime -- kittens are relatively easy to find homes for, and you will likely be able to find an adopter for it before a rescue will have space. Use craigslist, facebook, family, friends, neighbors, coworkers, church members, any people you regularly interact with. And if you give it to a stranger, charge a small adoption fee -- even $10 can be enough to stop an opportunist from picking up a kitten just for the sake of abusing it.  Whatever you do, DON'T just let this cat remain outdoors without getting it fixed. If you do, you'll only end up with more and more and more cats. They can have 2-3 litters a year, with up to 8 kittens per litter, and they start having litters as early as 6 months old.  Letting it stay outside un-altered would be worse than letting Animal Control take it and euthanize it.  Look into AnimalKind's $20 Fix program as a way of getting it fixed for $20 or less."

In case this helps at all with your decision, I was raised Reform and am definitely extremely liberal (religiously and otherwise) and felt very comfortable there.  One big thing to watch out for: don't get fooled by the ""synagogue"" in Cary that is actually one of those creepy ""Jews for Jesus"" type of churches that calls themselves a synagogue.  As for food: since I'm a vegetarian and also not a big restaurant person, I asked my meat-loving, restaurant-aficionado husband. He said that if you've got time for one meal in the area and you don't abstain from pork, then he'd recommend The Pit, which is a very ""local barbecue"" kind of place and is really well-loved.

Tagging the marker may have been stupid, but placing it there in 2014 was at best insensitive and rather odd.   Maplewood Cemetery was created in 1872, and honors some of the most prominent founders of Durham such as members of the Washington Duke family. It is a historic place, that is mainly about Durham residents. These days, it is bounded on two sides by poor minority housing that is rapidly being gentrified by a diverse group of people who will probably eventually drive property values up to the point of driving out many of the poor people.  Choosing to put up a monument honoring Orange county confederate soldiers in Durham's most historic cemetery in 2014 is just odd. There are plenty of places in Hillsborough where that would have been more appropriate. And, there are plenty of people of all persuasions who might take some offense to the idea that it went into Maplewood.  The surprising thing isn't that it was tagged, but rather that people that put it there don't see what an obvious insult it is to the community. Why was it relevant to that community?

We have a SB6141 and that should be able to get 300+ down. They're saying up to 100?!   The maximum speed of the SB6141 is achieved by bonding multiple channels together.  The SB6141 has 8 downstream channels and 4 upstream channels.  Each of those channels have a theoretical maximum downstream bandwidth of 42.875Mbps resulting in a theoretical maximum downstream speed of 343Mbps.  Time Warner is obviously not going to the maximum likely due to things like line noise so they're limiting it to 12.5Mbps per channel.  This would explain why they're saying the SB6121 only has a maximum of 50Mbps down because it only has 4 downstream channels.

I'm thinking that google will probably piggyback onto ATT's fiber when they get to this area. Supposedly they've done that in other cities. I'm not sure, though. It wouldn't really make much sense for there to be two independent fiber lines run in the same area.  And then I'm sure that ATT will be able to offer service on google's lines in return.

I know someone who uses the CRX regularly and says it's great. If it's like the DRX buses though, the wifi may be hit or miss.

triangle,3b6srn,iamthati,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"I rode the CRX for a while and I'd highly recommend it. My commute was the opposite of yours (I went Raleigh to Chapel Hill in the AM) so I can't really comment on specifics for traffic patterns/or how crowded the bus will be for your trips.   I had a great experience with it; pretty reliable, friendly drivers, and a comfortable ride.   Every now and then really bad traffic and/or an accident on I-40 could put the busses behind schedule and make your normal trip a bit longer, but on the plus side there is a huge difference between driving an hour in stop and go traffic vs. riding on a bus.  One other thing to think about is if you ever need to get home in the middle of the day. Typically it's just easier to drive if you know that you have to travel during non-peak hours. If you can't or get caught off-guard (I.e. random snow/ice events in the triangle), you can catch a but to the regional transit center, transfer, and then catch another bus to your destination. At best this takes about twice as long as the CRX trip. In a real pinch, I think that TTA also has an emergency pickup program (although I don't recall the specifics of it and what is required to enroll in it)  The wi-fi was ok, they've been making an effort to improve it, so I don't know the current state of it.   Hope that helps!"

I think somebody once told me ""There are two kinds of people here: The ones who have found a roach or two in their house, and the ones who haven't found them yet.""  1 or 2 a day is more than most people see but you shouldn't panic. They can't quite survive in the cool, dry climate inside and die after a day or so. I think they come in when it gets too hot outside even for them (they like dark and humid.)  First you should definitely call your apartment complex's exterminator and see if they can spot where they're coming from. Next you should seal all the cracks and openings you can find. If there's crawlspace access, that would be the ideal location to place roach poison. Get the ones they take it to their colony which kills them all (borax I think?)  Good luck!"

Over the last few months, our team has been drawing up blueprints for our new fiber network in the Triangle. But that was just the start.  We're doing some heavy lifting – literally – to bring Google Fiber to communities throughout the Triangle. There are crews working on the streets with boom trucks, tunnel boring machines, and rolls of cables as we form the foundation of our network.  Want to find out when it’ll be ready in your neighborhood? Enter your address now, and we’ll let you know when you can sign-up for Google Fiber.  Entering your address on our website allows us to send you future emails specifically tailored to your fiberhood so you don't miss out on Fiber updates.  In the meantime, here’s a look at what we’re up to:  Fiber Construction Crew The bright orange conduit covers our fiber to protect it from the elements as we lay it underground. We’ll be installing enough fiber in the Triangle to run from here to London and back.  Fiber Construction Crew Conduit needs to be sealed so that dirt, water, stones, and the occasional hungry squirrel don't get into the fiber. Here we’re inserting a plug to seal the conduit before we place it underground.  There’s a lot to do, but we’re working hard to make sure we get it right. If you haven’t already, you can follow us on Google+, Facebook, or Twitter to hear more about what’s next.  See you around town, The Google Fiber team"""

Pedestrians love sharing the road with parked cars, cyclists and moving traffic!  And there's the sidewalks that just magically end in the middle of a street… Or when it snows and they clear the streets by dumping the snow into the sidewalks.

triangle,3au3hc,pm_me_your_kindwords,2,Tue Jun 23 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"Source: My wife is an area dentist.  Your best bet for cheap care in the area is the UNC dental school. They offer three tiers of care. 1) Students with faculty supervision. 2) Grad students with faculty supervision. 3) Faculty. As you move up the tiers it gets more and more expensive. Student care is significantly cheaper than private practice and that may be all you need. If you need a specialist you'll more than likely want to see one of the grad students. You would only go to the faculty practice if you wanted to pay the same price as private practice.   The problem with UNC is that it's a lottery system, so it could take months and years to get in. Your second option is public health. http://www.piedmonthealth.org/locations/carrboro-community-health-center/ has dental services and is in downtown Carrboro. Generally public health charge based on income, so you'll need a pay stub or w2 to establish the actual cost of procedures to you.   Every dentist is going to have an initial screening and take X-rays to treatment plan. It's the standard of care and you should be concerned if a dentist doesn't require these."

The AMC at Southpoint is cookie cutter but clean. Northgate Stadium 10 is serviceable if a bit careworn and neglected. Carmike Wynnsong 15 is old but actually kinda worth it because it is cheap.

Maybe I'm biased, because I went to Durham Public Schools for middle and high school, but I never got the feeling that my friends in Chapel Hill were better educated than I was. The Chapel Hill high schools are ""A"" schools. Jordan High School, where I went in Durham, is a ""B"" school. But my friends and I took all the AP classes we wanted, got high SAT scores, and went to UNC or Duke, depending on preference.

In university, many of their peers went to elite boarding schools and didn't have that perspective (I mention this only to show a stark  contrast).

Yes, Durham schools do rank poorly on Great Schools and in the NC Report Card system. However, I do not think that either of those data sources are entirely reliable and, based upon my wife and my research, we feel that our child can absolutely thrive and do well in Durham schools.  The issue with Great Schools and the NC Report Card system is that both lean heavily on standardized test results and do a very, very bad job of adjusting for socio-economic status. Children from poor families consistently underperform those from affluent families on standardized tests. Simply put, there are more poor people in Durham, thus there are more children from poor families, thus there are lower standardized test scores, thus Durham schools rank worse in these systems. But let's think about what this system really predicts here. Does a system that is set up like this predict how good a school is, or does it predict how likely it is that poor children attend a school?  I would encourage you and your wife to do a bit more research. Look at a school like EK Powe as an example. The Great Schools rating is a 3 but it has a 5 star review from parents and my wife and I have read (on Great Schools and elsewhere) that parents love the school, are very involved, and feel that their children get a very good education.  For my wife and I, we also love the fact that being in a Durham school will give our daughter an opportunity to meet, befriend, and work with children from the full spectrum of socio-economic backgrounds. The world is not comprised only of affluent white families and my wife and I feel that our daughter will benefit tremendously from being exposed to many different children from varied backgrounds.  At the end of the day, I think this is a very personal decision and certainly not something you and your wife should take lightly. That said, I do think you should understand the flaws inherent in most (if not all) of the popular school ranking systems. So far, my wife and I love Durham and we believe that our daughter will have just as much opportunity, if not more, to succeed here in Durham than she would in any surrounding area.  Best of luck to you!"

triangle,3aiv1x,malthuss,18,Sat Jun 20 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"If you look at the top line test scores, yes, the Durham schools fare poorly in comparison with Chapel Hill or Cary schools.  However, if you dig into the numbers you can see that the top line scores are very deceptive.  When you click through to the individual school's report, it tells you the scores broken down by the various student demographics.  Essentially all schools have around ~90% of the white kids pass while <50% of the minority kids pass.  Likewise,>80% of the middle class and above kids pass the test in every school and <50% of the kids on free and reduced price lunch pass.  The difference between Durham and Chapel Hill schools isn't that Chapel Hill passes a lot more white, middle class kids, Chapel Hill just has a lot more white middle class kids.    Chapel Hill's top line score = (90% pass rate for white and asian kids * 60-70% white and asian population) + (50% pass rate for black and hispanic kids * 30% black and hispanic population) = 80% pass rate.  while Durham top line score = (90% pass rate for white and asian kids * 30% white and asian population) + (50% pass rate for hispanic and black kids * 70% black and hispanic population) = 50% pass rate.  Chapel Hill's test scores for white kids are within a point of or two of most Durham schools' test scores and it is the same for most other groups.  Since it is unlikely your kid will switch ethnicity or socioeconomic status based on where you choose to live.  You will probably have to decide whether you can deal with a very different and cultural diverse environment."

The one thing I can immediately agree on is the vagueness in wording in that section. There is too much ambiguity for me to want to support that part of the bill, let alone any bill with wording like that. I think it is an extremely poor way to avoid real concise laws, ""let the courts decide"".   With that said, I drive down a stretch of 751 from holly springs to chapel hill pretty regularly. For anyone who knows this road you know the conditions. For those who don't know let me inform you, this road is an incredibly popular bike riding road. The American tobacco trail has an entrance here, bass and Jordan lakes are here, and there are relatively few cars that travel most of this road regularly. The problem is this, the speed limit is 55mph, there isn't a stretch longer than a 1/4 mile that doesn't have some type of blind curve, and bikers that I've seen will ride 3-4 deep across the road. This road should not be bike friendly and making bike lanes on this road would be an absolute waste of money due to the volume of traffic.   North Carolina is filled with roads like this that bikers love to ride on.  I do not have a problem with bikers riding safely, but having heard the arguments from some of my friends who bike, social media, and bikers on reddit, I do believe that there is a sense of entitlement that is endangering people's lives. These are not the same roads as other places across the country. There are city's and towns who are working hard on making biking more accessible, see downtown Durham for a good one, but the arguments I hear aren't for cities anymore. The argument I keep hearing is for every road bikers like to ride on to be 100% biker friendly. This I cannot and will not support.   I wold love to see cities where there are more than enough places to share the road, but not highways, not roads that can barely support the vehicle traffic flow at the moment. I would prefer bike green ways that run in tandem with bike lanes. This would allow diversion around congested exits and other potentially dangerous roads. I have heard negative response to this though as cars and bikes ""need to share and be mindful of each other"".   I do not know of a good solution, the law is vague and the argument asks too much, and I would love to hear a good realistic solution if anyone has one. Are there good examples of other areas, similar to NC with infrastructure, that have found good solutions?"
triangle,3aa8b2,sin-eater82,7,Thu Jun 18 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate to hear that cyclists are riding 3-4 across there.  They definitely shouldn't be in my opinion.  Especially on a road that is already sketchy for cyclists.  There is no law in N.C. that addresses that, but it's just a dick move to block cars from passing safely.  But that is a situation where they shouldn't be doing x.  That one thing is not enough, in my opinion, to write it off altogether. Just like drivers shouldn't be doing 65 in a 55 and should be staying in their lane. We don't prevent cars from driving on the road because a few people are dicks.  As for ""entitlement"", well, cyclists are just as entitled to use N.C. roads as motorists are where it's legal (illegal to ride a bike on interstates, beltlines, and some highways)."
triangle,3aa8b2,scherlock79,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"If the road is really that bad, then riding 3 to 4 across is actually the safest thing for all users of the road.  On a blind curve, you are less visible the further you are to the inside of the curve, by riding 4 across, they are taking the whole lane so they will be visible from further away giving motorists more time to take corrective action safely.  Usually when cyclists do this, the outside cyclists fall back to give space for vehicles to move around them.  If they aren't, then they aren't sharing the road.  Usually a little beep will get their attention and they will give move to give cars room to pass."

We're clearly not talking about commuters but people riding for exercise, leisure, or sport.  If you need to do that on more than very short sections, it's not a safe road to ride on and you simply shouldn't ride on it despite the legal right to do so as far as I'm concerned.

If you didn't take the whole lane around blind corners the cars (and RVs) would try to pass you. Getting passed in a blind corner is about as dangerous as it gets. If the BRP isn't a worthy leisure ride, I don't know what is.   As a car driver, I don't pass a cyclist unless I can completely pass them in the other lane. Anything less is too risky for everyone.  If they're taking up the whole lane in straight section I can pass them 3 wide just as easily as I can when there is one guy riding the white line. I don't understand why people get upset about cyclists riding wide.. squeezing by shouldn't be an option regardless.    As a cyclist these days, I refuse to ride in the lane. I had enough scares from rushed drivers on mountain roads (being as sensitive as possible to traffic times & routes and allowing passing: pulling off and stopping if cars could not get around, etc) to know that I have no interest in putting my life into the hands of people who have no perspective on the value of a few seconds of time vs someone' life."

E.g., this bill most likely wouldn't be worded this way there.  Mostly, I ride in the right third of the lane (not right third of the road). On most roads, that gives plenty of room for a car to pass with decent space between them and me without going too far into an oncoming lane.  If I'm going through a tight turn, I'll go further out to be seen if necessary.  I'm not saying that what you're saying is not the safest approach.  I agree that it most likely is actually.  I'm saying that using that to excuse/justify/whatever riding 3-4 across on a shitty road with 55mph traffic and blind turns is asinine.  Just don't ride on that road unless it's necessary for commuting purposes.  My argument is not about what is safest.

It essentially bans conversion of vehicular lanes into bike lanes. So on a narrow road this isn't an option to begin with.  Looking at this particular legislation, it's useful to know that DOT engineers already do thorough reviews of all of the projects it would impact. And local municipalities must also approve such projects.  And by the way, the type of projects it impacts are normally ""free"" (restriping has to be done routinely due to resurfacing, and that's when these reconfigurations would occur).  The law basically takes a tool off the table. No matter what else you might think about cycling infrastructure and safety laws, I hope you will agree that taking this ability away from cities who want it (and noting it's already subject to approval by the DOT even in cases where cities request it) won't improve anything for anybody."

A lot of roads were ovetbuilt about 50 years ago when cities looked very different. Engineers can review traffic levels to determine that the extra lanes are going to waste.  The DOT already does studies to ensure that reconfiguration won't harm throughput. You don't need politicians second guessing the engineers on how roads should work.

Most of the state doesn't come close to having the transportation options your used to or the policy you're advocating. The Triangle is very unusual when you compare the cycling/mass transit options residents have to those options available in Charlotte, Asheville, etc.  I used to live near the Tobacco Trail, but now I'm about 4 hours away. Now that I'm gone, I can tell you definitively that the Triangle is unusually bike friendly. Your statement seems to me to be a completely reasonable one, but based on the data (here and here) North Carolina is obviously way behind where we should be in terms of bicycle and pedestrian safety. People are needlessly dying on NC roadways. Sometimes from their own recklessness and sometimes from inadequate infrastructure or careless drivers. While I understand your concerns, I think it's important to note how different the rest of the state is from the Triangle.  Something I will disagree with you about (when talking about 751):   ...making bike lanes on this road would be an absolute waste of money due to the volume of traffic.

I won't argue that at all.   The only thing I have issue with is the cost of all of this potential infrastructure. There are roads that get closed when it drizzles too hard because the infrastructure isn't where it should be. I personally think that the fiscally reasonable solution is to upgrade both roads and bike lanes in tandem with current projects. What I mean is, if we need to update, expand, repair a road, we should at the same time consider bike lanes for that road. What it sounds like the argument from biker's point of view is that we should do bike lanes now and screw the roads. I know this is not the real point but in argument this is how it sounds. If I were a politician hearing this point I would be against it as well.   I don't know what can be done about the current gap in compromise or communication from bicycle advocates and the legislature, but there can't be any change without compromise it seems.  Just as a side note your last argument ""After all, from my perspective, banning bike lanes to fight traffic congestion is like banning fire hydrants to fight fires."" isn't the same. I understand where you are coming from, but try and think of a middle ground comparison when making your point to strengthen your argument.

I am an avid cyclist (guess that's probably obvious by now), and I've never heard anything like that from cycling advocate, cyclist, etc. Although, if you read that on the internet, well, everything's got the volume turned up here, so I wouldn't put much stock in it. Is it just a miscommunication issue or are you just misunderstanding people? That seems to be a pretty fanatical stance to take, and I wonder if anyone would every seriously take it. Most cyclists also drive cars.  As for my comment ""...from my perspective, banning bike lanes to fight traffic congestion is like banning fire hydrants to fight fires"", the point I am trying to make is that by embracing multimodal transit (biking, walking, bus, rail, and car) cities can reduce the burden on their infrastructure. Maximizing on multiple types of transit will reduce traffic congestion. This means that things like bike lanes are a part of the solution to traffic congestion much like water is a solution for fire. It is much much more economical to make room for a bike than a car. Having more cyclists and fewer cars uses less roadway. It costs less. It uses less energy. In every way it is a reduction in the demand on infrastructure, materials, goods, etc. So, no, it's not over the top. What would make sense to reduce congestion would be fewer cars. The way to do that is give people an option other than driving.  Also, to be clear, not advocating a bike lane on this particular highway, but I did want to point out that if you have an issue with traffic, bike lanes, sidewalks, bus lines, carpooling, ridesharing, etc. would all be part of the solution."

Realistically I think on a 2-lane state road if the speed limit is over 45 bikes become a hazard. Maybe that can be taken into consideration.

I think I should be paying to maintain them.”  But he may be in the minority among North Carolina drivers of Leafs, Teslas and other plug-in cars that run entirely on electricity. Among a few dozen who commented last spring when legislators were debating the fee, many cited the environmental benefits of cars that produce zero tailpipe emissions.  They warned that the new fee will discourage more drivers from getting rid of their gas-guzzling, exhaust-belching cars.  “I still don’t feel like it’s a great idea, because it sends the wrong message,” Sarah Broome of Durham, 48, who also drives a Leaf, said Friday. “It reflects poorly on our air-pollution problems. I think it’s encouraging people to stay away from electric cars and hybrids.”  The House blocked a similar proposal from the Senate last year to charge a $50 fee for hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius and Chevy Volt, which run on a combination of electricity and gas or diesel fuel. Only 1,600 electric cars are registered statewide, but their numbers are growing.  Many electric car owners have benefited from federal tax credits that reduced the purchase price by as much as $7,500. That’s only fair, said Leaf owner Jules Coco, 62, of Cary. He opposes the new electric car fee.  “These things are very good for the environment,” Coco said. “I’m not contributing to the (cost of) the concrete roadbed, but I’m not contributing to the pollution, either.”  Fuel tax collections are declining because North Carolinians are driving less, their cars are getting more miles out of every gallon, and some drivers are switching to cars that burn no fuel at all.  DMV began adding the new fee for electric cars to its bills for registration renewal fees that were due this month. Projected collections from the fee – $160,000 this year – won’t do much to fill the widening gap between the state’s transportation needs and the revenue collections to pay for them, which is expected to reach $60 billion over the next 30 years.  Legislators and DOT officials will be airing ideas this year for generating more transportation money. But nobody is speaking out with specific new ideas, yet.  “Since they use the road, it seems equitable to have electric cars make some contribution to the DOT fund,” said Sen. Neal Hunt of Raleigh. “Whether we’ll go farther than that, I’m not sure. But we absolutely need to find a way, ultimately, to get some additional revenues.”   Mmmmmm, the downvotes are so convincing."

Let's get one thing straight these are public roads we have a right here.  Just because you are in a position to kill us with the least harm to yourself doesn't entitle you to say ""get off these streets""    If there is a curve I will take the center of the lane, so you can see me.  If there is a left turn, I will take the center of the lane and signal so you don't pass me as I take the lane. Otherwise I will ride on the side so you can pass.  It's hilarious you're calling me asinine when you're saying.   Bikers make me slow down in the road. It's dangerous I might hit them in my car They should stay off public streets  Therefore, I don't support bike lanes to keep them out of my lane of traffic.   THATS ASININE."

It's so bad that I don't even drive down it any longer."
triangle,3aa8b2,Calamity_Jesus,0,Fri Jun 19 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"If you feel that you can't avoid someone in the road doing 10mph, you are the problem. Don't go faster than you can see & stop. That's like rule #1 for driving and rules #1-6 for towing.  Public roads are not closed courses. People, animals and other hazards could be stopped on them, or even coming in your direction. It's the driver's responsibility to keep their speed within the limits of their braking ability. 55mph is a maximum, not a suggested speed.   Glad to hear that you aren't endangering anyone on that road anymore."

Cyclist are a specific hazard, especially when they are riding 3-4 wide on a country road with blind turns, in the fog with no visible lights. Reflectors are not effective in the fog.   You can be passive aggressive as much as you want, I've done my part by identifying the unique hazards on this road and avoiding it.  Too bad the cyclist  that put themselves in danger on this road aren't that intelligent.   I respect that cyclists have a right to be on the road and I go out of the way to give them space.  I even give them an entire lane when I pass, instead of sharing the lane with them.    The fact that I was able to stop and avoid an accident is proof that ""I'm not the problem"". Your attack on me is misplaced."

I haven't been but I'm planning on going once or twice this year around Falls. The State also owns several Dove fields around the area.  In terms of shooting ranges, Eagle1 and PDHSC in North Raleigh and Garner, respectively, are pay-by-the-hour indoor pistol ranges. North Raleigh Guns is working on an indoor range near the airport, but it isn't open yet.  Wake County operates an indoor 100yd rifle and pistol range in Holly Springs, but the hours are terrible, and there's a class you have to attend before you can shoot that's only available sometimes. I've also heard from more than one person that the RSOs are often patronizing and unpleasant.  Frontline Defense in Warrenton is open to the public on weekends and Range 37 in Lillington is open to the public for outdoor rifle. Kidd's Place in Holly Springs has an outdoor pistol range, but is mostly for clay sports. Ditto Drake's Landing in Fuquay (no pistols, there, though).

If you're a novice who is new to guns, then having someone look after you and give you pointers might be kind of nice. But if you're an experienced shooter, having someone looking over your shoulder saying ""have you tried controlling your breathing?"" could be pretty obnoxious and uncomfortable.  I belong to a private range that doesn't have RSOs; the first guy there is the ""range officer,"" meaning that they call the range hot and cold. When he leaves the next guy is the ""range officer.""

triangle,39z0u0,BabyCheezits,2,Tue Jun 16 01:11:34 2015 UTC,He's got his work cut out then since he's using no hands and 1 wheel.
triangle,39z0u0,EzDuz_it,0,Tue Jun 16 02:54:29 2015 UTC,That's the point.
triangle,39z0u0,Grilled_Chicken,3,Tue Jun 16 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"Why does he have to sound so angry? And what the hell was that background music/sound effects? My god.  I think it's cool that he's doing this and all, but damn man, lighten up."
triangle,39z0u0,ReigninLikeA_MoFo,6,Tue Jun 16 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"Was that video a joke? Like holy shit, that was unwatchable.  Still, 50 miles is gonna be insane."
triangle,39z0u0,Crownlol,2,Tue Jun 16 02:26:37 2015 UTC,No. That was someone's attempt at making a Vice style video
triangle,39z0u0,DRIZZLEDUNKS,2,Tue Jun 16 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"50 miles at all tomorrow is impressive. A 50 mile no hands wheelie is insanely impressive. Kudos!   It does occur to me that if he is in the shape to do that, (and I believe he is), then he actually has an advantage for tomorrow over conventional cyclists trying to peddle a half century in this heat. No-hands has such body balance that he isn't generating a lot of body heat pumping and peddling, and probably needs a fraction of the fluids. Still, I wish for his sake he'd wait until Fall, as that has to be insanely tough on even the most fit body. Best wishes! Hope there is YouTube."
triangle,39z0u0,Independent,4,Mon Jun 15 23:29:46 2015 UTC,Did you watch the video? That dude is definitely in solid shape haha.

Yeah, all those road cyclists training for century rides lack balance.. and they're going to waste all that energy pumping and peddling from that terribly efficient aero position.. and they certainly aren't in good shape with those spindly arms and small pectorals and giant thighs and calves. Fuckin' amateurs."

triangle,3a00c2,Independent,3,Tue Jun 16 10:44:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Yeah I was looking at that, but there were a few links that didn't work, so I wasn't sure how up to date it was.  Anything not listed on there that'd be cool to check out?"
triangle,3a00c2,Mobiu5,5,Tue Jun 16 10:54:29 2015 UTC,"Check out The Pit for good barbecue and then head nextdoor to Boxcar. Boxcar is a barcade, with a bunch of arcade games and a full bar to serve you. Also check out North Hills mall on Thursday evening for the beach music festival."
triangle,3a00c2,generalfalderal,2,Tue Jun 16 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"And right across the street from Boxcar is a great beer shop- they have bottles and draft - called Tasty Beverage. You can get a bunch of local beer there.   There's also lots of breweries around, between Raleigh and Durham. Crank Arm is right near the Pit/Tasty/Boxcar and they have great beer. Also worth going to Fullsteam in Durham, Big Boss in Raleigh,  and Raleigh Brewing Co."
triangle,3a00c2,generalfalderal,2,Tue Jun 16 17:08:50 2015 UTC,I'm at Fullsteam right now.  Sampled a few brews here.  The Fortunella is goddam fantastic.  Highly recommended.
triangle,3a00c2,UncannyGodot,2,Tue Jun 16 23:49:20 2015 UTC,haven't had that one! what was it? glad you enjoyed it!
