speedrun,3e2rbo,pjcreddit,5,Tue Jul 21 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"That's a wall bug. It's where you get stuck in the wall to break your falling velocity, therefore not taking fall damage."
speedrun,3e2rbo,Ecorin,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: I didn't mean to wall bug even if it looked like it. My intention was to drop down and suffer the fall damage which I would reduce with a couple of hit points by lowering my fps to 5. Instead I wall bugged with 5 fps which is VERY unlikely (might not be true as I, if I remember correctly, fumbled with the key presses and might actually have first lowered fps, increased fps, gotten stuck and then lowered it again within a split second).  Later I got a shitty grenade boost but it actually turned out to be perfect as I survived the fall (with 1 hp left) and unintentionally skipped the wall bug strat.   I suppose it was my subconscious's intention to add Maxam strats to a run lacking of Maxam strats OpieOP."

If you're wanting to get into watching speedruns though, speedrunslive.com has a list of streamers who are streaming speedruns going at all times. Also Summer Games Done Quick 2015 is happening this weekend going until next weekend, streamed here Speedrunning takes a lot more skill to do than just a normal playthrough of a game you enjoy. It causes you to think outside the box to find other, faster ways of completing a game you're set out to beat as quickly as possible.  Speedrunning now has become one of the most popular forms of challenge runs there is. My theory as to why is with speedrunning a game, you're (usually) not limiting your play-style of a game by taking away something to add a challenge, like a shield only run in Dark Souls would do for instance, and that doesn't appeal to everyone. Instead it's just simply get from the beginning of the game to the end of the game as fast as you can, with whatever means necessary to do so. That seems more appealing to a lot of people, as it became more of a test of player skill, whereas other challenge runs are a test of endurance usually."

Personally I'm average at most with my first playthroughs. I've always enjoyed playing same games a lot, grinding them to become good, it just used to be multiplayers. Works the same for singles, and to me singleplayers are really just meant for speedrunning. I barely ever play through a game if I don't consider there to be a chance I might speedrun it."

How many times have we had OoT runners say the WR is near perfect and unbeatable, then new glitch is found that shaves time off of it?  Or just completely blows it out of the water.

speedrun,3e06yf,Half_The_Battle,2,Tue Jul 21 06:34:47 2015 UTC,"I think, at an extreme level, there could be a case of exactly correct inputs.  You could theoretically make a very simple game that had a perfect solution.    For example, I have a game that has nothing but a timer counting down five seconds.  After the timers gone, a button appears, and you press it and win.  You could theoretically press this button on the first available frame, and (considering the imaginary code is so simple that there is never going to be a 'skip' found), you've perfected the game.  Now, that's not much of a game right there, but I think this could be applied to more complex games as well (The first Mario comes to mind, although this is a great leap in complexity and there are bound to be plenty of games less complex than this).  As long as there is a perfect series of inputs that will result in the fastest behaviour, there are no random variables that can influence it in any way (or they all roll perfectly in your favour), and there are no flaws in the coding to allow strange skips, you've perfected the game by completing it this way.  The hardest contingency to deal with is the ""no flaws in the coding to allow strange skips"".  That's what makes me think currently ""perfected"" games may not be perfected after all.  However, on the flip side, some games might be so simple or have such basic mechanics that a skip is literally impossible based on the coding."
