And if you get a yeast infection, you must let it overcome your vagina, instead of using medicine to kill such emotive, sweet creatures.  (If you're a man, just wait. After you've eaten enough soy, your penis will invert itself and become a vagina. That's why you almost never see male vegans.)  2) Lysol is not vegan, because it kills precious microorganisms that a) feel pain, b) have families that will miss them, and c) give us our only source of B12. Clean your counters with your tongue for maximum B12, to stave off the inevitable neurological ill-effects of veganism for just a bit longer.  3) Laptops are not vegan because humans are animals; poorly paid and treated animals in sweatshops making your vile blood-electronics.  True vegans only use library computers, and live under library benches and eat out of the garbage cans outside, keeping half-eaten hamburgers out of Mother Earth's landfills and not letting the cows die in vain. Freeganism is best veganism.  4) The best vegan test is to pinch your upper arm. If you can pinch any amount of muscle, you are not vegan enough to have completely wasted away into a shriveled husk from lack of nutrients. Vegan harder.  5) Duh, that's why he knew what it's like to be a creep and weirdo. Vegans are the most oppressed group in history.  6) A vegan is just a few letters short of 'Avenger,' which we will be, when our vegan powers kick in, and we can eliminate all omniscum.  7) If you must ask, you're not.

Sometimes you'll hear your veganism cry itself to sleep but you can't get yourself to swallow your bitterness and reach over to soothe it because deep down you know that you are the cause of each others miseries and you both deserve to feel this way.

I started by only eating two pounds of bacon for breakfast on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and any day where I really want it. On other days I started subbing in six egg omelettes instead. Now I'm down to Fridays and Saturdays and days when I feel like I'll die if I don't eat some delicious bacon. I also buy soy milk. Not that I drink it or anything (I prefer 2% tbh), but I buy it just to let the world know that vegan products are great! Same with tofu. There's a lot of tofu in my fridge (I actually eat it sometimes, though, but I marinate it in grease from my Bacon Fridays and Saturdays because how else could you expect me to eat tofu??) Anyway this post inspired me to start eating steak only on special occasions (like, is it a nice temperate sunny day out? What! Fire up the grill, it's a special day!). I've really loved every step of my vegan journey.

vegancirclejerk,3aina5,oregonducks2922,-11,Sun Jun 21 08:18:42 2015 UTC,Provide screenshots and proof where I did anything your saying I did
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,HonorYourBeetus,4,Sun Jun 21 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3abcgg/rcoontown_on_sc_shooting_have_mind_bleach_handy/csb8cm4  If you are trying to insinuate that you dont hate fat people, why did you spend a fair amount of your time on a sub dedicated to hating and harassing fat people. Above, I have linked you calling it your sub."
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,oregonducks2922,-11,Mon Jun 22 01:52:48 2015 UTC,Actually the sub got banned I didn't delete them. Any other theories?
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,HonorYourBeetus,9,Sun Jun 21 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should take a break from Reddit for awhile, huh?"
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,butseriouslyfolkss,-15,Sun Jun 21 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"you are all pathetic, all of you. fat or skinny you are all just walking, typing human garbage."
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,15hunna,7,Sun Jun 21 19:22:51 2015 UTC,k.
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,butseriouslyfolkss,-12,Sun Jun 21 19:45:13 2015 UTC,So replying back to reddit and basically using the reply button as intended has different meaning for you.
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,HonorYourBeetus,-7,Sun Jun 21 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"When you're stuffing your gaping maw with cheetos between every keystroke, replying takes a lot longer, they're obviously not used to normal speeds."

vegancirclejerk,3aina5,shitlordin,-2,Sun Jun 21 19:44:32 2015 UTC,said the one making fun of a stranger on the internet
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,15hunna,-12,Mon Jun 22 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah see this is ridiculous. What is the point of this exactly? To shame me? Sorry hon, I was respectful of both of you and this was the response. Guess I'm just the mature one here."
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,HonorYourBeetus,21,Sun Jun 21 22:29:57 2015 UTC,There is something so delicious about a FPHer getting outraged when someone makes a joke about them online.  Would it have been easier to take if /u/PumpkinMomna had accompanied the post with a picture taken of you at a restaurant?   Would that be the kind of maturity you'd respect?
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,janewashington,-17,Mon Jun 22 17:24:45 2015 UTC,Right. Because that is the same level of respect I have given you throughout this ridiculous exchange. You don't seem like a person I can take seriously so I won't continue to answer to you.
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,HonorYourBeetus,10,Mon Jun 22 18:06:58 2015 UTC,People who hate other people they don't even know because of any physical characteristic can fuck right off.

I've never persistently harassed a user like you just did, I just commented on photos like everyone else on reddit. Seems like you don't know what makes a cunt. Take a look in the mirror some time and you'll see what one really is. You're a bully and you know it, even after asking to be left alone you just slithered in there with one more poke. Just admit it and save everyone the time and effort you pathetic little piece of shit."
vegancirclejerk,3aina5,PitchforkTheFatty,5,Sun Jun 21 08:16:37 2015 UTC,"Will you sign my copy  In reality you calling calling others fatty is bullying. You were part of a sub that bullied others to very extreme ends, and just looking at your horrible username, you were endorsing such horrid behaviour. Are you sure your not a cunt and a bully?"

I'll take Wilson's place.  For starters, I will taste better if worst comes to worst.  And second, I have an actual face instead of what appears to be a bloody handprint so I will be easier to identify with if I am forced to interlude on behalf of a piggy friend.  Also, like any good vegan, I will talk a good game to your face but whatever I want behind your back"
vegancirclejerk,3ahme8,comfortablytrev,6,Sat Jun 20 07:43:57 2015 UTC,"An actual face. Is that like a bloody handprint in 3D?   How do you know you taste better than butyl rubber and synthetic leather? 'Cause I'm sick of coconuts and Wilson's starting to tempt me. And if you're tastier than him, I might lose my V-badge.

vegancirclejerk,3afv1m,comfortablytrev,4,Fri Jun 19 20:16:54 2015 UTC,The pope PMed me and admitted that he was telling millions of Catholics to vote brigade by downvoting non-Christian content. Here is 10 hours of our conversation as proof. The mods of /r/vegancirclejerk need to ban the pope.

vegancirclejerk,3ada1q,PumpkinMomma,8,Fri Jun 19 12:16:29 2015 UTC,I got you...  You are not better than everyone and instead only better than certain lower forms of squashes. I have therefore contacted the admins to have you banned for this deceptive behavior as well as all of your pumpkin children who use this and other subs (/r/vegetarian) as a platform for your squash based bullying.

vegancirclejerk,3ac6ei,Orc_,14,Thu Jun 18 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"Why do you want to provide people with false information? Every major health and dietetics organization in the world has agreed conclusively that veganism is perfectly healthy for people at all stages of life:   American Dietetic Association  It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.   Dietitians of Canada   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.   The British National Health Service   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.   The British Nutrition Foundation   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.    The Dietitians Association of Australia   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.   The United States Department of Agriculture   Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.    The National Health and Medical Research Council   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.   The Mayo Clinic   A well-planned vegetarian diet (see context) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.    The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada   Vegetarian diets (see context) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits."

Stirring up a vegan vs. vegetarian argument, of course. Finally, after maybe 6-8 months, he admitted to being a troll and lying about his whole reddit ""persona"" (also about pretending to be another user who claimed to be suicidal and then suddenly ""disappeared"" from reddit). All these accounts are now deleted. It's pretty obvious he has created a bunch of new accounts since then. Recently, he was visiting the irc chat and casually discussing how he was going to shoot his cows in the head later that day, the value of his cows in meat per pound, and how he was raising/shooting rabbits to feed his dogs. When he was banned from the irc chat, he decided to resume trolling /r/vegan with a vengeance.

Hence, a DNA test is required to determine who your ancestors were at a suitably remote but arbitrary time period, for the sake of expediency USDA recommends 10,000 years. To forego the DNA test would be to assume that all of humanity lived the same lifestyle and shared the same diet in a proto-mythical pre-historical past, which is so simple-minded as to border on idiocy.       Given the abundance of detailed historical records we have of pre-historic humanity, once we know who your ancestors were it becomes trivial to determine what your optimal diet should be, regardless of individual lifestyle, body composition, or medical history.    According to the USDA's Dietary Guidelines, if your ancestors dined on mammoth stew on December 18th, 7,985 BC, you should make sure to recreate their meal as closely as possible on the same date in 2015.

vegancirclejerk,39uxg4,palapiku,7,Mon Jun 15 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"Some effective activism tips in light of this new research:   Stop leafleting social events like festivals, concerts, fairs, conventions, etc. You'll only find dirty friend-havers there. Instead, go to places where high-minded, conscious introverts go to contemplate things like the meaning of life, solutions to world hunger, advanced physics, etc. Do you know a mother? Go leaflet her basement! Other viable places include caves, the undersides of rocks, 4chan's /r9k/, Henry Thoreau's house, etc, etc. Do not approach any introverts yourself. Introverts are sensitive, delicate creatures that might combust if you try to interact with them socially when they aren't ready for it. Treat them like the delicate, sensitive, highly intelligent and contemplative flowers they are. You know the risks. Wait for them, and then avert your eyes and silently deposit a leaflet no less than 5 feet away from them without making any eye contact. Back away slowly and then run away at a fast clip to get out of their 30 foot ""personal space"" zone ASAP. Did someone approach you or your table to inquire about veganism? Disengage immediately; they're obviously a dirty friend-haver and will forever remain carnist scum no matter what you say. They're too busy partying with other plebians to seriously consider veganism. Use this simple quiz to ferret out dirty friend-havers. If all else fails, cover your eyes with the Introvert Shawl and think about important philosophical matters."

vegancirclejerk,39g5op,kentuckyfriedchocobo,5,Thu Jun 11 14:31:09 2015 UTC,So I've been eating my neighbors compost pile for the last two months. I've saved almost 100% of my grocery bill as all I need to buy is nooch and salsa to sprinkle on top of it for that added kick.  This is my neighbors compost pile. As you can see it's full of everything I need. This method saves me time as well because I don't need to cut vegetables.   I was only caught once by his wife. She tried to shoo me away by spraying me with a garden hose but now I only go at night and gather what I need for the next day.

Most of today's modern vegan black arts practitioners bring a container of beet juice to replace the blood of their enemies whenever rituals require its consumption. Similarly, Tofurkey makes a pretty realistic simulated human heart out of tofu (personally I prefer the Field Roast version, but its harder to find).

vegancirclejerk,3972pw,woodwife,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:50:02 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of vore :      Short for ""voraphilia"" or ""vorarephilia"": a fetish in which one fantasizes about being eaten alive or eating another creature alive (sometimes known as phagophilia). The most common type of vore is ""soft vore"", being swallowed or swallowing whole with no bloodshed. There is also the less common ""hard vore"" which involves the tearing and chewing of flesh. Other types of vore include macrophilia and microphilia, in which one character involved in the vore is larger or smaller than normal.  Many might associate vore with cannibalism; however, most voraphiles do not favor cannibalism. Vore is an imaginary fetish; that is, it is impossible to perform in real life in the way most fantasize, unlike most cannibalism.  Also included with vore is sometimes the ""furry"" community: people who are interested in usually anthromorphic animals (humanized creatures). With animals as characters in vore fantasies, predation is natural and therefore somewhat more realistic.

vegancirclejerk,38zx6i,ruhicuziam,11,Mon Jun 8 06:37:59 2015 UTC,"uj/ No, it's a little reductio ad absurdum about Vegan parents who ""want"" their kids to try meat.  You can't simultaneously believe that meat is ethically impermissible but also want your child to try it.  Vegan parents will sometimes say this ridiculous crap so people won't accuse them of being extremist or brainwashing their kids but it weakens their position to meaninglessness.  After all, how bad can animals really have it if you want your kid to try meat?  Why should anyone take veganism or vegans seriously if they want their kids to do exactly what we're saying is terrible and inexcusable just because ""it's an experience?"""

Would you call yourself a extremist?   No, I would call myself a person who strives for consistency between my ideals and my behavior.  Edit: fixed a false dichotomy"
vegancirclejerk,38zx6i,palapiku,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:41:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to answer. Do you mind telling me if you were raised vegan?  Is being vegan about meat being ""unhealthy"" for the human species? Or is it all about the well being of the animal? A little of both? Is there something else I'm not seeing about being vegan as in why one is vegan?"
vegancirclejerk,38zx6i,trysten,7,Mon Jun 8 08:17:55 2015 UTC,"No problem.   Do you mind telling me if you were raised vegan?   I wasn't.  I dabbled in ""regular"" vegetarianism for a few years but once I started reading the arguments and looking up farming practices etc I made the decision and went vegan overnight at 26.  That was only 6 months ago.   Is being vegan about meat being ""unhealthy"" for the human species? Or is it all about the well being of the animal? A little of both?   We're all different.  A few people do it strictly for health but honestly most people do it for the animals and think of the health thing as a really nice benefit.    EDIT:  A week or two after I cut dairy out I realized I must be lactose intolerant.  Went from having diarrhea almost daily to NEVER.  (sorry if tmi)    Actually, many people start for health reasons, then, once they haven't eaten animal products for a while they start thinking about it without the added burden of trying to justify eating meat and then boom, they become ""ethical vegans.""   Is there something else I'm not seeing about being vegan as in why one is vegan?   Probably.  For instance, in addition to ""health vegans"", some people are vegan primarily for environmental reasons.  The ecological damage caused by large scale animal ""intensive farming"" (AKA factory farms) is astronomical.    Some people say: ""I only eat free-range, grass-fed, organic animals"".  Well ok, if you only eat about 1 or 2 small servings of meat per month, then that is sustainable;  otherwise it's just non-scalable elitism.  And of course that completely disregards the ""is this justified?"" question.  Once you go for a long while without eating meat, eggs, and dairy and you realize you're still alive, and you don't feel sickly, and you don't even really crave meat any more, and then you look at how much suffering and misery and environmental damage is caused by animal industry you kinda have to stop yourself from ripping your hair out that other people don't get it.    Personally I can't believe it took me this long."

Some vegetarians survive on nothing except cheese, and the great part of cheese is that there's nothing that's at all disgusting about cheese.  Sure, okay, it comes out of cows.  But that's not too gross.  And of course it's an excretion produced inside the cow's body, from cells in the mammary glands and it's designed for calves, but that's not gross.  And it's not always pure - also not gross, not one bit.  Now eggs, those are disgusting"

I wash this all down with a half gallon of heavy cream mixed with a half bottle of chocolate syrup.   If you want a good dessert I can give you one also.   Notice that this meal is low in carbs.

vegancirclejerk,37m0ij,autowikibot,1 point,Thu May 28 17:56:46 2015 UTC,"Kopi Luwak:       Kopi luwak (Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈkopi ˈlu.aʔ]), or civet coffee, refers to the seeds of coffee berries once they have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus).  The name is also used for marketing brewed coffee made from the beans.  Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection and digestion. Selection occurs if the civets choose to eat coffee berries containing better beans. Digestive mechanisms may improve the flavor profile of the coffee beans that have been eaten. The civet eats the berries for the beans' fleshy pulp, then in the digestive tract, fermentation occurs. The civet's Protease enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids.  Passing through a civet's intestines the beans are then defecated with other fecal matter and collected.  The traditional method of collecting feces from wild civets has given way to intensive farming methods in which civets in battery cage systems are force fed the coffee beans. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets due to ""horrific conditions"" including isolation, poor diet, small cages and a high mortality rate.   A 2013 BBC investigation of intensive civet farming in Sumatra found conditions of animal cruelty.  Intensive farming is also criticised by traditional farmers because the civets do not select what they eat, so the beans are of poor quality compared to beans collected from the wild.  According to an officer from the TRAFFIC conservation programme, the trade in civets to make kopi luwak may constitute a significant threat to wild civet populations.

The current line up consists of guitarists Danny Marino and Pascal (Paco) Jobin, bassist Chris Kells, drummer Simon Mckay, and vocalist Vicky Psarakis, who joined in March 2014 following the departure of vocalist and founding member Alissa White-Gluz. Both Psarakis and White-Gluz use growled and clean vocals. Originally known as The Tempest, the band adopted their current moniker upon their signing to Century Media in 2007. To date, The Agonist has released four studio albums; the latest, Eye of Providence, was released in February 2015. Touring extensively since their first album, they have shared the stage with bands such as Arsonists Get All the Girls, Epica, The Faceless, Chelsea Grin, Kamelot, Visions of Atlantis, and many more.

Do all your meals consist of 90% plant based food and 10% animal stuff or do you eat nine vegan meals and then one that consists entirely of animal products?

vegancirclejerk,37d02o,BaronMuenchhausen,5,Tue May 26 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"All good questions!!  I am very careful to maintain my 90% ratio, so every meal has 10% meat or other animal products.  Having some rice krispies?  Well I'll sprinkle some parmesan on there.  Time for a piece of toast?  Not without a few little pieces of fried spare-ribs on top.  Just yesterday I had an apple with a slice of bacon stapled on it - it was deliciously precisely 90% vegan."
vegancirclejerk,37d02o,BaronMuenchhausen,8,Tue May 26 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, 90% is the sweet spot.

I tried going 90% vegan once myself, but i slipped back to regular old vegandom a few weeks down the line. I just lack the dedication, you know? But i really think its cool what you people are doing. I might go 90% vegan again at one point in the future, but right now i just feel like I'm not ready for a step like that. You have to consider so much stuff and I'm really buisy right now and so on..."

vegancirclejerk,36nbyi,mochipoebean,15,Wed May 20 17:16:26 2015 UTC,"I can empathize, for years I've slaved away in the tyranny that is human existence just trying to make my masters a little richer. But now I've found fulfillment in the Effective Dairyism movement.   The quick summation is I pay people to treat me like a diary cow and let me spend some time imagining frolicking in pastures. Sometimes they even milk me but that is really expensive.   My life was awful but by directly pretending to be a cow my whole life has flourished. Any existence is worth living if you're imagining being cattle."
vegancirclejerk,36nbyi,Agricola86,12,Wed May 20 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Wow this is exactly what I wanted. I always wanted to be reincarnated as a dairy cow, but I figured why not try to be a dairy cow right now? Great advice"

vegancirclejerk,36nbyi,vavavoo,7,Wed May 20 20:27:56 2015 UTC,True that. But through the miracle of modern technology we can at least try to replicate the experience for them mechanically.

vegancirclejerk,36nbyi,wearsmanyhats,7,Wed May 20 22:52:02 2015 UTC,"So true! I spend so much money on rent in my little apartment, when I could be living for free in a cage! My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner."

vegancirclejerk,36nr1l,anachronic,1 point,Thu May 21 04:17:32 2015 UTC,Um... why didn't you just make soup out of him and feed him to your dogs?
vegancirclejerk,36nr1l,knitknitterknit,2,Thu May 21 19:04:39 2015 UTC,I don't have any dogs.
