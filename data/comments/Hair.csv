Hair,3e5wn8,ihatethish4ir,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"Alright I'm by no means a hair expert in the slightest, but I do have a pending solution.   My hair is nowhere near as curly as yours naturally, it is straight/wavy but very thin and poofy. It's very annoying and tedious to shape, but possibly. I also want a similar style to the images you've provided.   What I do is that after I take a shower, use a comb to brush my  hair back. (of course, dry it as much as possible. Leave it a little damp.)   Make it as sleek and straight as you can with the comb, then just slip a cap on.   Put the cap on backwards and make sure that it slightly tugs at your hairline. Leave it on for a few hours. After you take it off, your hair should be straight, or straighter."
Hair,3e5int,burner112233,2,Wed Jul 22 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"My hair is naturally very poofy and stringy. I was so tired of using heat to make it manageable so I looked up and tried a bunch of no heat curling methods and finally found one that worked. When I get out of the shower I part my hair down the middle and split each side into 3 sections (6 total) and twist them away from my face. I have a LOT of hair so depending on the thickness of yours you may be ok with less sections. I continue doing this periodically while I watch tv or do homework. My hair takes a few hours to air dry but I usually shower by 5pm and by 7:30pm I shake the waves out, spray a bit of beach spray (I really like the UNITE brand), and sleep on them. In the morning my hair has really nice, natural looking waves. If that doesn't work I'd recommend checking out YouTube because there are tons of no heat methods that have worked for other people. This just happens to be the only one that's worked for me!"
Hair,3e5int,enemvee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"If your hair is willing to hold on to Bobby pins, get some pins and sit in front of a mirror. You can pull back the front by twisting and pinning or just pinning it back flat. If you want an up do, just pull or twist some piece up and pin. It won't always look the same, but you can create some cute looks with pins."

Hair,3e3ich,kchap188,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:18 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Roommate rocked the scene hair for better parts of 3 years. Every morning head flat iron for about 20-25 mins.

Hair,3e3ich,kchap188,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"Flat iron your bangs and sides. Straighten but still leave a little curl in the back, tease and hair spray. If youre looking for the long haired scene swoop then just flat iron the whole thing and train your hair to brush over your face by combing it like that constantly.  When you go to the hairstylist make sure they razor/layer your hair. This helps keep it straight and shaped properly."
Hair,3e3ich,dwolfy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:10 2015 UTC,thx for the tips guys
Hair,3e3ich,ayechrissy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:53 2015 UTC,Definitely make sure you watch some youtube videos or something if this is your first time using a flat iron.  I knew too many men who start using it and do too much hair at once not doing by layer/only iron straight away from the face instead of curving with the face--resulting in the hair sticking straight out and looking very burnt/obvious.

If you would like to change, I would also go for different lengths in the front, not sure how to describe it but just to have a kind of neglig√© look since your hair is straight and would work with different layers. I hope this helps!"
Hair,3e3mpo,liquidlanguor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"I've never used color removers but did use a stripper and it destroys your hair. They're basically the same thing. You can break up the color by doing a soapcap. Basically mixing bleach+peroxide+shampoo and lather your hair as you would usually.   It doesn't damage your hair as actually bleaching it, but it is drying. You look like youre a level 6-7 ash dark blonde/lt brown. You can find a color that best matches and go from there. Your hair is already pretty light, but the soapcap will help break that color up."
Hair,3e3mpo,satan_titz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"I am NOT a professional. I would use a color remover like Color B4 or similar, to get some of that RV out. See what it looks like after that. Be very diligent with the instructions, if used incorrectly the color will come back. You will need 20 Vol or even more likely 30, hard to tell with pictures. My process would be: remover, protein filler, color filler, dye, maybe tone with 10 vol. When picking between two shades of dye like light brown/dark blond, choose the lighter. And because you'll have the color filler, another layer on top will make it appear darker as well. Easy to deposit color, not easy to remove it. Choose a dye that is beige or green/blue based, since you want to neutralize the red tones. If you want to add an ash intensifier, that would help to keep it ashy-neutral and not pulling too warm."

Hair,3e1ala,MaxLemon,3,Tue Jul 21 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"Please, someone, tell me if I should embark on this with a limited budget.   You shouldn't. If done improperly, you can damage your hair, and even if you go to a professional, it'll probably cost more than 100 dollars. A friend of mine recently dyed is hair blonde as a cuttery after receiving a cut. His hair length was between 3/4 and 1 inch and the cost w/o the cut was around $150 bucks. You also want to keep in mind that you'll probably be going back to a cuttery every month or two to keep up w/ your new style. Since the cost of this varies, I highly recommend doing some research with your place to find out exactly what this will run you during your visits.   But I am going to be job hunting and looking for work full time once I am done university next April. I need to look sharp.   Since that's about 9 months away, just set aside money anyways until you can pay for professional, non-shitty work. A balayage is perfectly acceptable as a hair style, so if you lose an interview or something like that, chances are that it will be because of something unrelated to your hair. Also, since the start of your job search will begin in 9 months, I think you'd have plenty of time to change it up, grow it out, cut it back, or do whatever you'd like before then."

Hair,3e1ala,pinkpeony,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna get balayage, you don't really need to get your new growth done.  Balayage is great because it grows out nicely and if it's done right, you can probably get by with only getting the color done once a year, and maybe go in every couple of months to get a glaze (which isn't that expensive, at my salon it ranges from $20-$40) to refresh the color. I say go for it!"

It's not an inexpensive procedure by the pros. It takes a lot of processing time, as well as experience. I also think that going that blonde from virgin medium brown hair should not be done in one sitting. Perhaps consider a gentler transition to get to that point."

Hair,3e1ala,lessonsinnj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"Depending on how dark your own natural colour is, it may be possible to use dye and not bleach! However, cost wise it won't make much of a difference, and the dye won't lift your colour as bright as bleach and may also fade out a bit more! Then you may have the financial problem of not being happy and having to get it redone! You could go into a salon and ask them to do a strand test for you and see how well the dye takes?"

I have three inches of natural roots and I can't wait until I can stop messing with my hair. I hate the time and money that goes into coloring and maintaining hair color, and the insecurity that I feel when it doesn't look great. Also, don't forget you will also have to switch your products and maybe your routine, depending on how your hair reacts to the process. I hate that I need to buy $30 conditioner for brassy blond, rather than normal stuff. Do you style your hair daily, or is always thrown up in a bun? If you aren't going to curl/style/wear it down, I think it tends to look sloppy and overgrown."

My hair is naturally curly. What is it you want to know? I don't straighten it every day, most of the time I leave it slightly wavy as it goes when I dry it, or sometimes I'll straighten just the ends to neaten it."
Hair,3dvebk,rampaiige,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:01 2015 UTC,"I have wavy/curly hair and I did the a-line bob thing for a while and am now transitioning into growing mine out. I would suggest starting small and working up to a shorter length if you're worried about that. When I first got the cut, it was just at my shoulders and I was in love with it! I decided to go shorter a month or so later but my stylist took it a little too short and it was closer to chin length. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either, but it only took a month or so until it grew back to a more flattering length. My other suggestion would be to speak up about how you want the layering to be, as that could make or break the haircut for you. If you're wanting to play up natural texture, layers can be good but too many layers make my hair look poofy. I'm not sure what your hair type is, but I can straighten or curl my hair and it looks great either way. I'd suggest investing in a curling wand if you don't have one already, because using that really helped me dress up my hair. If you have any other questions please let me know! I'd be happy to answer them!"
Hair,3dvebk,bullwinkle394,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:19 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your response! It is very helpful. My hair is a medium length (couple inches below my shoulders) and I was thinking of getting it cut just above my shoulders in the front with the angled back. I have frizzy-curly hair but when it's cut short it looses a lot of the frizz. It's also very easy to flat iron/curl. Does the cut look alright with a rounder face? Also does it grow out nicely or does it have to be cut to one length and grown out from there?
Hair,3dvebk,bullwinkle394,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like we have a very similar face shape and hair texture! My face is rounder and I found the cut to be very flattering and I had a lot of compliments when my hair was first done. I felt like it grew out ok... I'm in the process of growing it out now (it's a couple inches past my shoulders now) and I'm having my stylist gradually trim the front to match the length of the back, but I personally don't mind the longer version of the a-line shape I have going on. I think it all comes down to a matter of personal preference, and there's a lot more variables to this cut than I think most people realize when they first decide they want to do it.  I'm replying on my phone but if you'd like me to find and upload some pictures of my hair when I'm able to get on my laptop tomorrow I'd be happy to do so!"

Hair,3dthe5,mermaidfart08,3,Sun Jul 19 08:15:40 2015 UTC,"I think if you are scared, doing a dip dye color on the bottom of your hair would be a nice introduction to hair color and would look good on you. Personally I think your hair and skin tone would be better flattered by a blonde dip dye look than by all over blonde highlights.   I think dip dye is good for someone who is nervous about color because it's really not a huge commitment - since you can cut it out of your hair if you really hate it and it can't be fixed. Even though I know you said you love having long hair, if something does go wrong with hair dye, at least it is way easier to fix it if it's just the bottom of your hair than if your ENTIRE head is a weird color. I just went through an experience where a burgundy color I dyed my whole head with looked way too purple to be socially acceptable and I was seriously thinking of getting a wig if I couldn't fix it (although it looks like things are ok now, thank the heavens!)   That being said, my experience is that if you are conservative in what you do (better to under-bleach than over-bleach for example) then your odds of having a terrible outcome are much lower. It's also much easier to fix mistakes by covering up a light color with dark dye than vice versa."
Hair,3dthe5,seeminglylegit,2,Sun Jul 19 12:05:21 2015 UTC,"I think balayage would be SO pretty on your hair!! Balayage highlights/ombre would really make it feel new but not necessarily be too much. Kind of a foot in the door to give some dimension. However, before you get any color, DO YOUR RESEARCH!! There are some fantastic hairdressers who can cut really well and do oldschool highlights really well but don't know how to do newer techniques as well! Good luck in your hair journey from a hairdresser!"
Hair,3dthe5,jenalbritton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice!  I'll look into balayage!  I was considering going into my local Ulta and asking a hairdresser there.  Thanks again! =)

Hair,3dsy4r,twistedlysweet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:50:13 2015 UTC,"Greasy as in like not having washed it for a few days? I've never heard of this happening before, as bleach tends to dry hair out.   My suggestion would be to switch shampoos and conditioners, use conditioner specifically on the ends and not the scalp. Blonde hair tends to look greasier than dark hair as well so it could be that you're just not use to it?   If all else fails, invest in some dry shampoo."

Hair,3dr75y,Heatherzilla,2,Sun Jul 19 11:46:05 2015 UTC,How long ago did you dye it? It might fade to something more natural given a few washes. I'd give that a try before dyeing over it at least.
Hair,3dr75y,snugglemybutt,2,Sun Jul 19 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"Please stop using garnier, or any store brand box dye for that matter.

Hair,3dra6c,Owloo_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"Henna can't lighten hair, so your roots are never going to be as bright as the length. Your roots definitely look light enough to me to show henna colour though. What brand of henna are you using, and how are you using it?   If you want your roots to be as bright as the length, you will need to bleach them. If the henna you're using is pure henna, you can bleach and dye over it just fine. If you're not sure, definitely strand test. Some brands of henna have metallic salts added to boost the colour, and the metallic salts do not play nicely with bleach or dye."
Hair,3dra6c,Heatherzilla,0,Sun Jul 19 05:36:35 2015 UTC,Henna can't lift the dark root area. You also can't use regular hair color over henna. I think you will have to bleach it out.

Second, I think it's very weird that your stylist informs you about that after doing your hair. That is obviously something she should have said before. Most stylists I know won't bleach your hair if it's too damaged/if they don't think they'll be able to give you the result you want. Sounds more like she thought she could do it, and they afterwards tried to cover up her mistake. Of course, stylists make mistakes too, but it's the not owning up to it that sucks."

Hair,3domnn,tittysword,5,Sat Jul 18 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"Fact: Virgin hair is easier to tint. Color treated hair needs to be handled differently.

Hair,3domnn,Raviepooh,3,Sat Jul 18 08:16:03 2015 UTC,"The stylist simply didn't know how to do what you asked for. She was saving face by blaming you, but her approach was entirely wrong for the balayage ombr√© you asked for. She should have been honest and said she doesn't have experience doing that kind of color and recommended someone who does. There's absolutely no reason to put a lighter blonde color on your roots when your pictures were clearly brunette. She may just be one of those hairdressers who doesn't stay updated on her techniques and trends. Next time just do some research and find another stylist who you know has done the kind of color you want, good luck! In the mean time deep conditioner!!!"
Hair,3domnn,StaceyOats,5,Sat Jul 18 11:11:42 2015 UTC,I think you should demand your money back. They didn't get anywhere close to what you originally wanted.

Hair,3dp24v,BitchyInPink,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:50 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience with Color Fix, but from a small google search it seems to be another sulphur color remover? I have a lot of experience with those, and they're very gentle on the condition of your hair. After use my hair has always felt extremely clean and maybe a little bit dry, but not damaged. So technically you can bleach right away, though I would give it a few days just to let some oils build up.  However, the problem with these removers is that the color can come back afterwards if the color molecules aren't rinsed out properly. The remover works by shrinking the color molecules so that they can be rinsed from your hair, but if you don't rinse well/long enough they stay in your hair and contact with developer can make your hair darken again. As a test you can dip a strand of hair in some developer and see if it darkens. If it does, you need to rinse more. Some hair types seem very prone to re-darkening."

Hair,3dp24v,applesangria,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think color Fix would work, because it's a different type of dye. They're designed for permanent dye, unless I'm mistaken. Like u/graveyardgirl said, unless you follow the instructions exactly, the dye could remain in your hair.  I had great success removing dark brown semi permanent dye from light blond hair. I did Epsom salt soaks in warm water, and hot oil treatments with coconut and olive oil. YMMV but even though the Epsom salt was drying, the oil treatments helped a lot. Coconut oil can penetrate into the hair shaft and help pull out color molecules."
Hair,3dpb3x,Rittie2012,3,Sat Jul 18 03:44:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, go to a salon. If you do it at home and just slap a red over your blonde, it will look very flat and peach toned because of the level of lightness.   It needs to be filled first, and a custom blend made. By the time you buy all the colour you'd need from Sally's to blend to get that, you'd be at $40 anyways. Why not pay the extra $40 to have a professional do it at that point?"
Hair,3dpb3x,jorahlindsay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that you should go to a salon, because box reds are in general pretty shitty and don't work well on most bases. On a very light base the red will be either way too weak or way too neon, and either way it'll be flat as most box dyes are. Go to a salon and get a result you'll love, and then keep the color bright at home with semi-permanent direct dyes (Manic Panic, La Riche Directions etc.)."
Hair,3dpb3x,graveyardgirl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:34:01 2015 UTC,"OKAY. I was as blonde as you very recently and couldn't afford the hairdresser I wanted. So I said either her or no one at all. I did it myself! What you first need to do is a ""filler"" color. I chose to color my hair a dirty blonde, dark blonde color close to my natural hair color.  It was ugly. Haha! I haven't seen my natural color in so long, I hated it. I left it alone for a day. For that, I did use a stupid box of Revlon. I HATE box dyes, but I couldn't get to Sally's. (Your best bet would be to try and ask people at Sally's what you need. You will not need a high developer. A 10 or 20 volume should suffice. The higher volumes would be for lifting. You aren't lifting, you are depositing!) At Sally's, they have a protein filler. You need that. After you dye your hair with the dark blonde color of your choice, you'll need a protein filler. Follow the instructions. Some say to rinse and some say to leave it in and use it as a base for your dye. Choose your red color. I personally absolutely love ion. This time, like I said, I didn't get to Sally's. I used a box of Feria for my red. It was a darker color. That has since faded. To spruce it up and brighten it to what I wanted originally, I picked up some Splat in Crimson obsession and went over it. (I actually just did it tonight!) Now it's pretty close to what I'd wanted, and close to your picture of the red you want. If you really wanna do all this work yourself, this is what I've done. Now.. Sally's has wonderful products you should definitely use. There are also stain remover wipes (you may need them) and definitely get the black gloves. Mixing bowls and brushes for dying are a must. Sally's does not carry boxed colors like you are asking about. You would have to mix your own dyes. The bowls have lines and measuring is a bit easy, as it is a 1:1 ratio. If you do it yourself and succeed, please update! I hope I helped some."

Hair,3dn7ib,BitchyInPink,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"To get a sky blue, your hair has to be pretty much white first because any yellow tones left in the hair will make it look green. The soap wash (or shampoo cocktail, as I've always heard it called) probably won't lift the red enough to get that blue on."

Hair,3dn7ib,jorahlindsay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"Bleaching to a pale yellow, and then toning with something like a 10 level violet would get you pretty white, but that amount of bleach is going to be really damaging to your hair.   Bleaching over bleach is impossible to do without breakage, even with things like Olaplex and what not."

I'm also saying this as someone who has had (and has) multiple pastels. I started with virgin hair and I still never got light enough for baby blue without massive damage."
Hair,3dn7ib,snugglemybutt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:06:53 2015 UTC,"You should get the color done before your cut so if there's any damage from lightning your hair you can get those ends cut off. So if I understand, you just need to lift the pink out so you can go blue and your hair was previously lightened to make it pink? If this is the case try a soap wash first, by this I mean mix up powdered lightener (aka bleach), add 20 or 30 vol peroxide (I'm guessing you'll have this already), mix together then add a squirt of shampoo, mix. Shampoo your hair, leave the shampoo in, but squeeze out extra water then work the bleach mix in. Cover with a plastic hat/bag and wait 10 minutes, check every 10 minutes until you reach desired lightness or until one hour has passed. Shampoo (might need to do this twice) and condition as usual."

Hair,3dl5lj,HickuptheHedgie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"I've had it twice. I got it for the first time last October, I just got it touched up. This salon used Liscio hair straightening.   The long and short of it is: Expect damage. Maybe a little, maybe a lot. My hair was less damaged when I heat-styled my hair, but this is more convenient.   After the touch up today, I've taken a long look at the damage and decided to grow it out and not re-straighten it. Getting it touched up is really, really risky, even if they know what they're doing. If the hair overlaps, it'll break. So I'm waiting on the next few weeks to see if they did it right, it's a scary wait."

Hair,3dl5lj,Totallycoral,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:49 2015 UTC,"I've been doing it twice a year for 9 years now. Absolutely changed my life for the better. My hair was a constant source of daily frustration before. If you seriously prefer the straight look for yourself, this is an amazing thing. You can also always curl it if you feel like it and it will never frizz on you no matter what you do. I don't even have a straightening iron anymore, I just blow dry and it takes wayyy less time and hassle and stays. DO absolutely make certain you go to someone who really knows what they are doing and has a minimum of 5 years experience, 10 is better, especially every time after the first. It can certainly be screwed up and cause serious damage if done incorrectly, but if you really do your research and find someone that knows how to do it really well it's a godsend."
Hair,3dkx2y,BigBeefyyy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on your hair type. I have extremely thick, fine hair. My stylist thins mine out a lot more aggressively than she would anyone else. It takes a lot of weight off and makes my ends appear less ""poofy"", if that makes sense. She only thins it underneath so I don't get a ton of fly-aways (I do still get some on particularly humid days, though).  For me, it's necessary, otherwise I would have so much hair to deal with, and I truly am not exaggerating. This saves me money because I have to use less product, and my hair dries much more quickly."
Hair,3dkx2y,rvtjess,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:59:54 2015 UTC,My hair is also extremely thick and i also have a lot of hair. So for me would it help me style easier
Hair,3dkx2y,CheezIt624,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:03:16 2015 UTC,It's critical for my hair to be thinned.  Stylists are always amazed at how much they have to take out to make it look good.  So thinning is a great thing to do if your hair/cut requires it.
Hair,3dkavq,OvaryQuiver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:24:17 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it's not too late to help! I'm assuming you used a permanent color. Wella Color Remover Kit or Color Fix will help. They're available at Sally's. Drugstore options are Color Oops and Color B4. With all of these strippers, it's very important to follow the directions explicitly. Very helpful to have a friend help out. Because your hair is already chemically processed and prelightened and has been exposed to developer of varying levels, it will NOT go back to your natural shade. What it will do is remove the layer of pigment that was most recently deposited. Don't be surprised if its brassy or orange in tone, that's because of the developer.   Generally you can color correct immediately after. I would do a protein treatment, and then either tone or color depending on how far away you are from your desired shade. If it's light enough but just the wrong tone, then you can simply tone. I would probably stick with a semi permanent or just toner for now, because you're on a time constraint and are trying to change colors also.  I think you unfortunately got some half baked advice from the Sally's employee. On pre-lightened hair, you first need to use a protein filler to close up the cuticle. Should be near the color aisle. It will help the color take more evenly and be true to shade. Then you would likely want to choose a shade that's 1-2 shades lighter than your desired shade, because lighter hair will soak up the dye and it appears darker.   Edit: pictures are always a good idea if you're comfortable with that- makes troubleshooting easier!"
Hair,3dkavq,applesangria,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:41:48 2015 UTC,So basically she gave me the opposite advice! I think I'm going to go back and pick up the Color Fix. I tried some home remedies in the mean time (20 volume + dish soap and shampoo+baking soda) and I can tell MAYBE a 1/2 shade difference near the roots. Thanks for all of your great advice. I solemnly swear I'm not listening to Sally's employees anymore.
Hair,3dkavq,applesangria,2,Fri Jul 17 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"Some Sally employees are great! I think it all just depends on luck of the draw :)  Home remedies tend to do more harm than good, to be honest. It's so hard to not try them, I know! I'm the same way.   Edit: also wanted to add that in some cases, it's better to use 30 vol and color to lift 2 shades. Since you've only had one application and under a time crunch (you'd have to do it at least once if not more to get to the right level), color remover will likely work well. Also, there are color protein fillers and neutral protein fillers- neutral is fine. A protein treatment like Aphogee 2 step and a deep conditioning treatment afterwards are a must!   Good luck!"

Hair,3dk7iq,needsmorezazz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"My advice? Don't use splat hair dye.  That stuff is a killer, it takes forever to get out and it leaves gross dye on your scalp. I had the same issue with their purple dye too, actually. I could get out box black dye before that damn purple.  It's worth looking into different hair dye products. Definitely. Punky colour is good, cheap, smells amazing and has a lot more color choices than splat dye. Ion color brilliant has some good dyes (look into their lines of ""brights"").  Those are the two brands I've used the most and had the most success with. However there are people who swear by manic panic, special effects and pravana hair dye.   Shameless plug for r/fancyfollicles for more advice."
Hair,3dk7iq,ceremonialsloth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"Any colorist will tell you that with red and black there is no such thing as semi permanent. Sure the red will fade but it's almost impossible to get it out entirely, especially if you're dying blonde hair. Maybe try something temporary like a spray in color that washes out easily before you do something you might regret later."

Hair,3djfvy,asherkpax,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"I would run away from Sun In! I say this having used it multiple times with poor results (and I have natural blond hair that actually highlights easily and beautifully). I've done every DIY hair lightening method on the books :) On darker hair, the results will likely be brassy or orange in tone. The effects are completely unpredictable and uncontrollable. Products like hair color and developer are designed to be minimally damaging to hair, whereas SunIn is such a low end product that the manufacturers really don't care if its damaging.  It also won't ever come out- the peroxide acts like bleach, so once that pigment is gone, you can't get it back. The streaks will have to be dyed over or grown out if you get sick of it. Of course, it could also turn out completely awesome and adorable :) but if you don't have a ton of confidence and/or experience in doing your own hair color, I wouldn't mess with it.  If you're looking for something different, what about starting with semi permanent colors? I mainly use toners and permanent color so I don't know too much about it, but it's definitely less of a commitment.   Alternatively, I can recommend a more subtle way of lightening hair. It's still lightening so there will be damage, but less. I've used it on my hair and my sister's hair with good results. Using honey and distilled water optimizes the peroxide that naturally occurs in honey, and when applied to hair can lighten gradually. There's a ton of info on longhair community forums.

Hair,3diqd2,nutellaShowers,2,Thu Jul 16 16:26:20 2015 UTC,It would be quite the process. I highly recommend a consultation with several stylists. Feel out which one is the most knowledgeable try not to cheap out otherwise your hair can become quite damaged.   The process could take anywhere from 6-1.5 years. Prepare to loose some length in the process to ensure your hair is healthy. A good salon usually charges a 100 dollars an hour and books the until appointment for 5-8 hours.   It's worth it in the end!

Hair,3dg88i,ComiendoBizcocho,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's synthetic hair, so you can't heat it, curl it, or dye it. From a Stylist POV, no. Plus some times synthetic hair is so shiny it won't blend nicely in your own hair, you'll just see the fake hair stand out. If you go to a hair supply store they sell lower price real hair halos. I bought one for around 115, compared to whats on the market of 250+, and i cut a few inches off with a razor and you would never tell it wasn't my hair. If you take care of it it can last you 1 year plus."

Hair,3dfktj,dianamo11,2,Wed Jul 15 23:15:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree on the length. I donate it every 2 years and its so much better when its long. What color though. I was thinking like an ombre  being lighter at the bottom but would a reverse one look better? I think ombre would work best for college cause I wouldn't have to worry about roots
Hair,3dfktj,EachUltimate,3,Wed Jul 15 23:40:46 2015 UTC,Is the picture your natural color? Regardless I definitely recommend ombre with your natural hair at the top and whatever color you feel (I'd prefer light on you but do what you want!) on the bottom. I'm in college and this hairstyle has saved my tons of money.  Your hair is also really pretty the way it is so don't feel like you have to do anything unless you really want to!
Hair,3dfktj,EachUltimate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:01:00 2015 UTC,Aw thanks! And yes thats my natural hair color! I've never dyed it before and the most drastic thing I've done is donate it so I kinda feel like doing something new for college...But I think I'll definitely look into an ombre or baylage
Hair,3dfktj,dianamo11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:53:07 2015 UTC,I think that's definitely the best way to go! It grows out so much better if you can't afford new color often.

Hair,3dh4lg,marylozeth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:54:23 2015 UTC,"I have been sugaring for years, but I create it at home. There are many recipes and tutorials on youtube and such, but here is what I do: 2 cups sugar 1/4 cup water 14 lemon/lime juice or vinegar (provides acid component) Mix together, place on medium heat stove, mix continuously. Eventually the concoction will begin to boil, and become very bubbly and rise. Keep stirring. When the bubbles start to change from a white/clear color to a yellow/gold/honey color, take a spoonful of the mixture and run it under cold water. If the mixture becomes pliable, and does not stick to your skin, the wax is probably ready. You have the option of turning the heat down after boiling for a few minutes and waiting for the color, but I usually just remove the mixture from the stove as soon as the cold water test gives good results.  The whole process takes 10, maybe 15 minutes. However, getting the hang of making this is a pain in the ass. The first time I ever did it I made it perfectly, and then failed miserably the next 5 times. Getting this recipe down is so much about COLOR. If you use brown sugar, color will be different. But here is the color that my substance turns. http://imgur.com/a/tBG9K  Pour this into a heat safe bowl or container. LET IT COOL. After you have, you could probably use it while its at room temperature, but I heat mine up in the microwave for just a little bit (20 secs).  TO THE PROS OF SUGAR WAXING: 1.Water soluble. 2. Applying wax AGAINST hair growth and removing it IN THE DIRECTION of hair growth; you're getting the entire hair follicle. 3. Hurts less. Arguable because everyone is different, but I never considered normal waxing to be all that painful either. After a couple years of using this wax (Brazilian bikini waxes and armpits), it barely hurts at all. Ok, the armpits still smart, but waxing the (now less coarse) hair on the mons pubis feels like practically nothing, and I am not joking. Plucking my eyebrows hurts more than waxing my mons pubis. So basically, if it hurts at first, it will definitely get better.  4. Cheap, cheap, cheap! Water, sugar, choice of acid. All you need. $5.  The link provided in this post seems to be urging people to go to a salon and pay for someone to use sugar wax on you. But I am 22, and years ago when I started waxing, I ignored everyone's advice and DID NOT go to a salon for a Brazilian bikini wax, but I made sugar wax and did it myself. I understand the appeal of having it done professionally, if you don't feel like you know what you're doing, or you're scared. But I never understood why EVERYWHERE I looked for advice on doing your own Brazilian, everyone acted as if it was brain surgery that you had to go to the salon for. Ridiculous. It's making candy, and pulling some hair out. ANYONE can do this. I did this when I was 16. I repeat, ANYONE can do this. It's so easy! Which leads to the biggest pro of sugar waxing (imo): convenience.  I hope this encourages some people to try it. It's really been amazing to me."

Hair,3ddcql,ShellyBalt,9,Wed Jul 15 11:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a hairdresser. You're hair only grows a 1/2 inch per month. If you take biotin or prenatal pills your hair will seem to grow faster. But putting oil on your hair doesn't tell your follicle to grow. In reality it may prevent split ends, or your hair from breaking.  For instance I have damaged hair, and everyday I do my hair I see pieces broken off on my shirt. My hair doesn't lengthen, but still grows, it just breaks off and you don't see it grow. Now I have stopped styling my hair, but just put in extensions where its not a bulky, and my hair has grown an inch without breaking off."
Hair,3ddcql,Seaburry,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is just impossible.
Hair,3ddcql,H-ly,3,Wed Jul 15 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how fast your hair grows naturally. When I did a variation of this I noticed my hair definitely grew more in the week that I did it, but not 3-4 inches. I believe ~1 inch in a week is what most people generally get when doing this. Most people don't bother to leave the oil in for so long though and there's usually more of a focus on massaging your scalp.  Edit: It's not the oil that makes your hair grow, it's the scalp stimulation. I never bothered with oil when I did it - what the blog describes is a variation of the inversion method. My hair naturally grows 1 inch per month and the massaging definitely increased this."

Hair,3ddcql,cyberchibii,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:11:37 2015 UTC,(I've edited my original comment but) it's mainly the scalp massage rather than the oil that helps your hair grow - it's meant to stimulate your hair follicles by increasing blood flow.

Hair,3d84qf,kirbyferreal,3,Tue Jul 14 14:03:17 2015 UTC,Best option is to use a chelating (deep cleansing) shampoo or even regular liquid dish detergent to try to remove some of the dark colour. Make sure to use a good conditioner afterwards to put some moisture back in your hair.   If this does not work please see a stylist. Try to find one who carries olaplex that way they can remove the black colour with the least damage possible   Hope that helps

Hair,3d6l5h,_____caffeine_____,4,Tue Jul 14 02:03:46 2015 UTC,"Okay! Don't worry about the length for now, but ask for TEXTURE! Have your stylist go in with a texturizing razor (or two, depending on how much weight she has to take out. I've dulled a blade in one sitting before), and just take out a shit ton of weight, get some layers going in there. it'll add so much body and take that weight out of the bottom of your hair. I used to have to do the same when my hair was a bit shorter.  Other than that, find a cool style that you like. if you want to keep the bangs, keep the bangs - just have her sculpt out some of that texture for you so you can manage and style it more effectively. That's my most important advice. And don't be afraid! And don't let your stylist be afraid either! A lot of stylists are reluctant to remove texture because they're worried the person will freak out at the sight of a texturizing razor, but sometimes you just need that shit. Go to someone who will do it for you correctly :)"

If you go to a stylist they should use olaplex in the process to help protect integrity of the hair. The pic you gave looks like it was bleached then toned with that copper color not just bleach.
Hair,3d7gwc,hippityhoppityhopp,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:37 2015 UTC,"Try washing every other day instead of daily and spend extra time rinsing. See if that helps. If not you can use a bristled brush and brush your scalp before the shooto loosen up dead skin then shampoo.

But the flacks still sometimes come back and on the third day after washing the scalp always itches. And the natural shampoo doesn't make my hair really shiny so I'm still searching for a better solution. As H-ly already mentioned oil is a good idea. If it gets really bad I usually massage some oil in my scalp, leave it in overnight and then wash it out. That takes care of the itching and flacks for some days."

Hair,3d80dn,Yaboyshane,2,Tue Jul 14 05:53:10 2015 UTC,You could buy relaxers at a beauty shop that will loosen the curls to make them more wavy. Or you could get it chemically straightened at a salon. I've never tried either but I've heard they work. Good luck!
Hair,3d80dn,nyancatbagels,2,Tue Jul 14 07:13:42 2015 UTC,"You want a heat straightening also known as Japenese Relaxer. Do Not attempt this at home !!!!!there is a fine line between straighten and lovely and melted and washing away in the shower! So it will take a long time, plan 4-5 hours (your hair looks thick!) and it will be expensive (depending on where you live, I'm in San Francisco so it's around $200- $400 here). Find someone who has experience! It will be permanent! So it will be straight when you wake up, straight when it's wet out of the shower, air dry straight (or almost straight, for stick straight you might need to blow dry it, but it will be lightly wavy not curly), your hair will still grow out as it always has so in 3-4 months your new growth (roots) will be curly.for a while it's ok, since the length of your hair will help pull it straight but eventually it will be anoying so you'll have to touch it up (or grow it out).. If you want curls after this process you'll have to add them with a curling iron."

Hair,3d6a5u,zombiej,2,Mon Jul 13 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a hair dresser. DO NOT do anything the person under me recommended. You do not have to bleach your hair ""WHITE"" to achieve that goal. A level 7/8 at the most. I think if you try to do this yourself, you will spend more money on getting it fixed at the salon. If you are gung ho, on DIY. The only products of course I recommend would be professional so you might have a hard time getting your hands on. Do not buy Ion color from Sallys, some of their colors have metallic dyes in the color which will cost you major money to remover in the future to remove. Wella is okay. I use redken and pravana. I can't give exact information I dont have my swatch book in front of me, but look for a 7GC or 6RR even mix the two. If your hair is colored, you will need to lighten it. Do Not use 40 Vol. find a blue based bleach, equal ratios of bleach to developer, I'd use 30 if your hair is say medium/dark brown, on the midlegnths , then 20 on your ends, and at the last moment use 30 on your roots to catch up. They will pull fast on virgin hair. wrap that in suran rap or a plastic bag. and watch carefully. Dont panic and rinse, you;ll have to start all over again. PM me if you have any other questions or if you need help."
Hair,3d6a5u,Seaburry,0,Wed Jul 15 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well without a picture of you to start from it's difficult to say.  You say your hair is pretty dark so if you want to go lighter to that shade of red then yes, you will need to bleach and probably tone it to white then dye.  If it's your first time dying I'd say go to a professional with the picture and see what they can do for you.  Bleaching hair is a nasty process that can go wrong quickly.  Plus they can work out what dyes would be a good investment for you.  If you really want to DIY then I'd suggest getting Manic Panic's Bleaching kits, Either 30 or 40 and a jar of the toner to make it white.  As for the color, I've only used Manic Panic's coloring and it's only temporary, lasting a few weeks and fading pretty quick.  But from what I hear most boxes in supermarkets and such have a bit of hair sample that will show you the color it dyes.  That brings me to safety, first and foremost I'm going to reiterate the idea to let a professional do this for you.  But, if you feel like you are up to the task, Manic Panic's bleach kit comes with gloves and a cap.  I'm also going to suggest some kind of respirator or dust mask because you have to mix the bleach powder and developer and that stuff is very very bad to breathe in.  Also, some kind of eye protection, goggles of some nature.  If you get this stuff in your eyes you can go blind.  So don't do that~.  Lastly wear some kind of clothes that you wont mind ruining.  No matter how careful I was a spot of bleach or dye inevitably dripped onto my clothes.  Also, work in a room that is well ventilated.  Hope that helps"

Hair,3d1o5q,123leggoo,4,Sun Jul 12 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"Olaplex recommends that if you wouldn't bleach a clients hair without Olaplex, you shouldn't bleach it with Olaplex either. If you're worried your hair will fall out if you bleach again, I'd think twice about it. Olaplex is great, but your hair can still break."
Hair,3d1o5q,graveyardgirl,4,Mon Jul 13 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"If you're at a level 6, you have around 4-6 more levels to go in order to be silvery or platinum. Even with the use of Olaplex, you can and will experience breakage if your hair is damaged from previous lightening and you aren't careful not to overlap in those areas, which it sounds like you'll have to do to achieve your end goal. What I recommend before you lighten your hair again is ordering the take home product that Olaplex offers called Olaplex #3.  This should be used once a week (and not more frequently as this too can cause damage if not used correctly) in between lightening sessions. I recommend doing this for 4 weeks or until you see improvement in the health of your hair before going lighter.  You could also try to give your hair a rest from heat styling until the next lightening.  Once you're ready for that step, the kit you ordered should include 2 products: Olaplex #1 and Olaplex #2.  Step one will be added to your lightener, you'll first mix your bleach normally and then mix in the amount of Olaplex specified for your process. (1/8th of an ounce for bleaching without foils and 1/4th of an ounce for bleaching with the use of foils).  The bottle comes with an easy measuring spout of sorts. Apply the lightener and process, then rinse really thoroughly to remove all of the bleach while working your fingers through the hair but don't shampoo.  If you get to a level 9+, go ahead and tone with a violet based toner, I prefer redken 9v + redken clear  1:1 + equal parts developer. Watch as it tones and scrape some toner off with your finger nail to expose the hair beneath the product to see if yellow remains before rinsing. If you don't get to a level 9 but make it to an 8 you'll want to tone with violet and likely a touch of blue (9t from redken) to cut any orange remaining.   After you tone you can rinse thoroughly and at this point you may shampoo but it's optional and can strip the toner a bit. Towel dry your hair and spread Olaplex #2 from roots to ends, let sit for 10 minutes and rinse, condition, rinse and you're finished. Good luck and use your best judgement, Olaplex is s great tool for pushing boundaries in healthy hair without damaging it but it isn't a miracle worker for already damaged hair, unfortunately."
Hair,3d1o5q,jzimlich,2,Mon Jul 13 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"Just an fyi, the kit that she got doesn't have the easy measuring spout... it's just three small tubes of #1, #2, & #3 (#1 is 0.5 oz, the other two are 1oz). I work where it's sold. When I used it to highlight my cousin's hair after stripping out her old color, the tube of #1 was just enough for a partial highlight with medium drop sections. For bleaching her whole head... I highly doubt one of those kits will be enough #1.   And fyi to the OP: I wouldn't trust an olaplex kit from any place where it's not sold through a licensed distributor. The tubes in the one time use kit are not sealed very well and could have been tampered with. Unfortunately, licensed distributors can only sell Olaplex to licensed stylists and salons."

Hair,3d1o5q,Shuriesicle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all your replies, they were very helpful. After using some regular conditioner, my hair seems alright, though I really don't know how to guage damage. Other than the bleaching I've never really done anything that would damage it, other than washing with hot water sometimes. Never heat irons, blow dryers, or harsh products. Is there a way to tell if hair is still bleachable? I'm going to stay away from bleaching it for awhile regardless.  That said, would Olaplex as a standalone treatment help at all? What does it do, if anything? Concerning whether there would be enough product, I have very short (albeit thick) hair. I purchased the kit from beautydrama. Not sure if one kit would be enough."
Hair,3d1o5q,gewwwww,3,Mon Jul 13 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"The #3 would be a great weekly treatment. And insider tip: #2 and #3 are the same product, just packaged differently. So you can use both the #2 and #3 you got in the one time use kit before you decide to purchase #3 alone (it's retailed separately from #1 & #2 when sold to stylists) or purchase another one time use kit if you decide to bleach again, because you'll need more than 0.5 oz of #1 most likely. FYI: #2 & #3 reform the bonds that were broken in the lightening process, as well as hydrate the hair and help maintain it's health.  Best way to see if hair can be bleached again is an elasticity test. Basically, if your hair doesn't bounce back to it's original length, I would lay off the bleaching for awhile.   But honestly... I would highly advise seeing a professional. You've done a lot to your hair and you're one step closer to melting your hair off. None of us here can really tell you if you can bleach your hair again because we cannot see & feel your hair. A professional will be able to either get your hair light enough to where you want it, or will be honest with you about what your hair currently can achieve. I would look for highly reputable color specialists and make sure the salon uses olaplex; if you do end up bleaching your hair again it's definitely going to need it."

Hair,3d1yjh,Drawn-And-QuARTered,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:37:01 2015 UTC,fade it out using a few washes of dandruff shampoo and rest it for a few days after. dandruff shampoo strips the shit out of colour and once it's a light blue/green then pink will cover it so long as the dye is vibrant and not diluted. if you're going for a pastel pink then use a colour strip and toner as opposed to washing it. :)

Hair,3d1mt8,Pariguayo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"There are several causes of hair loss and I've been through the frustrating process of finding out what those are. The first thing your girlfriend should do is go to a doctor and get blood tests for thyroid hormones, and other hormones like prolactin, and vitamin deficiencies. Abnormal levels of any of those things can cause hair loss.  Alternatively it could be female pattern baldness, this is the main problem I have and there isn't a whole lot you can do but there are some treatments for this, notably mynoxidil which is usually used to treat male pattern baldness.  Has your girlfriend started taking (or stopped taking) any hormonal birth control? Sudden changes in hormones can cause hair loss also. It should sort itself over time while the hormones balance themselves out.  The best thing you can do though is be supportive. Despite hair loss not being that bad medically, it can ruin self esteem very easily.  I don't know what country you're in but trichologists can help but they tend to be expensive, so ordinary dermatologists can be better choice.  I've found personally that one 200mg ferrous sulphate tablet a day has improved my problem, my doctor prescribed that to me originally to see if it helped. Seeing a doctor first really is the best thing; I waited 2 years to see one and I ruined my self esteem in that period, so tell her not to wait.  Edit:  While she figures out what the problem is, changing hairstyle may improve how she feels. I cut my hair short and changed my parting to hide where I was thinning, and to make it feel less rubbish while I was shedding hair."
Hair,3d1mt8,EdanE33,3,Sun Jul 12 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"This may be more suitable in r/relationships, but how do I bring this up without ruining her self esteem in the process? Does it honestly look like its a problem? I would like a second opinion. She will always be beautiful to me but I don't want her to ever feel unsexy or anything like that.  She has been on birth control since October. Could this be the cause?"
Hair,3d1mt8,toasty_feet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, she probably already knows.   You could bring it up in terms of concern for her health - as already said, there could be an underlying issue such as hormonal imbalance or nutrient deficit.   It really is up to her to pursue treatment though. There are a lot of options for any cause of hair loss. The first step to working out the issue is like the above poster said; a blood test. If all that checks out, the next step is to see a dermatologist for a biopsy. Scalp biopsy - whilst unpleasant - is not painful, and its the most accurate method of diagnosing hair los causes."
Hair,3d1mt8,EdanE33,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"I agree to this... women do notice these things.  It could easily be the birth control, in which case it will eventually solve itself.  A scalp biopsy may not be necessary; I had hair pulled from the front and back of my head to determine in what part of the cycle my hair was in to help tell what the issue is.  I can't tell properly from the photos but it looks as though she may already have hair regrowth; it comes out as soft baby-like hair."
Hair,3cyl7a,crunchyhair,16,Sat Jul 11 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"It looks ok, I don't think you need to cut it. If you dye it dark (with a demi-permanent) it will look nicer and shinier and hide the damage better."

Hair,3cyl7a,DevolocaRaptor,4,Sun Jul 12 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"All things considered it isn't actually bad!  I have seen a lot more damaged hair!  Treatments can help but they wont restore the health to pre coloured conditions,  get a trim every once and a while coupled with moisturizing masques.  (In my opinion you may like moisturizing more than protein treatments, moisture will help with that ""dry"" feeling and add more shine, but protein gives strength and prevents breakage.)  Don't worry too much about it!  You are your own worst critic!  (This is basically non advice.  Sorry)"
Hair,3cyl7a,DevolocaRaptor,4,Sun Jul 12 03:42:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's alright. I really do probably find it worse than it is.

Hair,3cyl7a,steamed_merits,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"And in terms of taking length off, I'm pretty sure your hair would feel substantially better if you take even just two inches off.  Its hardly anything, grows back in 4 months (half an inch grows a month) and it will get the ends looking clean again, since it seems like you prefer a structured blunt cut more than the texture you have now!  It is always a bit nerve wracking dying hair, and still wanting to maintain the integrity of your hair, and I'm sorry you are anxious about the condition its in,  but I hope you have better experiences in the future!"
Hair,3cyl7a,Sprinklemeds,3,Sun Jul 12 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"Also, protein treatments will help with the strength. You can buy keratin infused products at sallys, or keratin products at Ulta.   If you are on a tight budget, you can simply make an egg mask once or twice a week for a few weeks to see if it helps. Best of luck to you!"
Hair,3cyl7a,Sprinklemeds,2,Sun Jul 12 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you should cut it and afterwards use more hair oil. My recommendation is this  I had the same problem and hair oil helps a lot if you use it almost every time you style your hair. Especially if you use the straightener.  Edit: Apply the hair oil on your tips."
Hair,3cyl7a,iheartzombiecats,2,Sat Jul 11 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"I do coconut oil treatments every week and for styling, if I'm having an awful hair day, I use L'Oreal Paris's Total Repair 5 Extraordinary Oil. It makes a difference, but not by much. How much do you recommend cutting off?"
Hair,3cyl7a,menticide_,2,Sat Jul 11 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"That depends if you want to grow long hair or a new style. If you want to keep it similar or to grow it longer, the minimum would be around 10 mm (about half an inch). If not you are free like a bird to try new bob or short hairstyles ( this looks neat, for example :D).  Edit: I just read your comment. Mia Wallace's hair would look nice on you! But I wouldn't recommend dying your hair full black, maybe a hint of brown. But that's just my opinion, what matters is for you to feel beautiful!"
Hair,3cyl7a,Ender_Targaryen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"I've dyed my hair a lot over the past two years: I've gone black, strawberry blonde, copper, dark red, sable brown, and then to this awful ombr√©. Each time I went to a salon, and I don't remember exactly what they did to my hair.  My hair is very flat, limp, and thin. It doesn't hold a curl or style very well, but there's a slight natural wave to it. I wash my hair every day with Tresemme shampoo, and follow up with Tresemme sulfate-free conditioner. I've tried no-poo for a week or so, but it just resulted in a lot of grease. My scalp gets greasy very easily, but my split ends are dehydrated. Not to mention because of the damage my hair has been falling out in clumps whenever I shower.  I'm not sure what my best course of action is, but I know I'll probably have to end up cutting it. I had a pixie cut once which was awful for my face shape, I looked like an ugly boy. It took two years of growing out to get it to this length and I hate that I have to go and ruin my progress. I think the shortest I could go while remaining comfortable is a half inch or so below chin length.  I don't have much of a style, I try to keep it minimalistic. I would like something sleek and structured but something kind of edgy would be nice. I really like Mia Wallace's hair. I do know that after this hangup I'm going to dye the whole thing sable brown. Having an ombr√© is just not worth having my hair so damaged."
Hair,3cyl7a,Billli123,5,Sat Jul 11 23:36:08 2015 UTC,"If your hair is falling out in clumps then you don't have damage.   Damaged hair breaks and snaps and you can feel it doing that.  Your hair doesn't look very damaged and a way to test actual damage to your hair is to get a nice amount (at least 20 strands in a lock) wet, like soaked, hold it firmly in your fingers and pull on the ends.  Some stretch to your hair is normal, this is elasticity, everyone has it to some degree.  If it stretches a lot and doesn't return to it's normal shape then you've got damage.  It'll feel spongy and look badly crinkled. Another fun thing, sulfate free conditioner is kind of silly.  The sulfates that everyone is avoiding right now are the ones in shampoo.  They are the detergent and foaming agents that clean the hair and scalp.  Find a moisture line for your shampoo and conditioner.  Another big thing to look at is how you put your conditioner into your hair.  It shouldn't be placed on your scalp (since you mentioned you get very greasy) instead it should be worked into just the ends of your hair only.  Get a good trim and leave it alone for a while.  Sometimes less is more.  You can't fix damage, you can only cover it, and sometimes it takes saying NO to color for a few months."

Hair,3cz32y,texassunshine1006,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"I can't vouch for what they have said, as i haven't heard it,, nor have i seen or touched your hair but i can offer my advice.  I'm a hairdresser and i may have dealt with this situation before, if what i am assuming happened happened.  Story time!  So Had a girl in, shoulder length blonde fine, uncoloured hair, but her hair was like straw.  By straw i mean it was stiff, almost crispy.  She used a lot of protein masks, which are great and necessary for some people, but she didn't need them.  If you hair had too much protein, (ie: too much strength) it can feel just as brittle as if your hair was really damaged.  If a hair is too strong to bend and move, it can snap and break.   Anyways, i got her to stop her protein treatments, and i switched her to heavily hydrating treatments.  We did a professional salon treatment there and the effect was pretty immediate after adding moisture that her hair was actually able to bend and move instead of stay stiff, her hair has grown a lot since then, which before hand would just continue snapping off.    Anyways, i don't mean to sound preachy, I'm Just giving you my advice as a professional from my own experience.  I find moisture will not ever make your hair brittle, it will only maybe make your hair flat or lose volume while its in (because its generally pretty heavy on your hair to carry around extra moisture!). Protein on the other hand you have to kind of diagnose more to find a good balance.  Anyways,  sorry for rambling on, and like I said take everything i say with a grain of salt, because i haven't seen or touched your hair.  That just seems like a likely thing that may have happened to you. (Unless you bleached it and it snapped off, then it broke because it was damaged and needs protein AND moisture, but i digress)  Also don't tie your hair up really tight if your hair is brittle, the elastic can cause creases in the hairs and snap them if it is too tight an your hair is too stiff.  Use a scrunchy or a soft cloth like band."

It depends a bit on your hair type though, and make sure its one hundred percent dry before taking it out or the curls will slack fast.  I have friends who just walk around with it up like that for a day or two while it dries, it looks pretty retro."

Hair,3cxsrh,aarontherobot,4,Sat Jul 11 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"To get lavender hair you need to bleach the hair to an almost white color first. Even on hair that is in great condition, this is dangerous and going to cause damage and breakage. It sounds like your hair has been through too many color processes to safely get a pastel color. I wouldn't advise it."
Hair,3cxsrh,Raviepooh,2,Sat Jul 11 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"Have you been doing your own color?  How long is your hair?  When you went blonde was it with color or lightener?   Honestly,  going pastel is HARD,  even on healthy virgin hair. To get to the level of blonde you need, it would likely take at least 2 sessions of careful lightening, and even then, you're likely to see breakage and ""spaghetti"" hair.   You're better off just not doing it,  unless you are willing to go really short to minimize visible damage."
Hair,3cxsrh,graveyardgirl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"I've had pastel purple hair a few times! You need basically a white base to achieve a lavender color, as any brassiness will cause it to look green or muddy. Tone your hair first.   If your hair is dark blonde or lighter, you should be able to get to white in one round of bleach. When I had white hair I started out with dark brown hair and I did it in two rounds with a couple of weeks in between. My hair was pretty damaged afterwards and it only became more damaged over the next few months. I ended up cutting it pretty short in December, and it's only now starting to get longer again (though it is healthy!). Cutting it really sucked, because I like longer hair. Having platinum hair and experimenting with purple hair was fun, but honestly it wasn't worth the damage. I wouldn't do it again."

You're hair may not be in bad condition as i cna read, but if you want to do it carefully, go to a salon and get a heavy highlight, and then come back in a 2 weeks and do it again, but let them know your end goes is pastel. Ask for olaplex, it will keep your hair in good shape. I personally had already really damaged hair, and went through with it, a lot of my hair got lost in the process. its not super short, but i kept it pastel for a 2 weeks or so, and dyed it back brown.

Hair,3cv20i,sirwarlord,6,Sat Jul 11 12:32:28 2015 UTC,"How about adding lighter reds and maybe some blended thin blonde highlights? It would add dimension and look good. If you did a cut, do something that frames your cute face! If you do anything, give an update! I'd love to see. I do, however, like your natural hair but thought I'd give you different feedback than the others have."

Hair,3cv20i,_simplymaggiee_,2,Sat Jul 11 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"Chestnut brown is a nice colour if you're looking to dye it all! Or any form of natural blonde. I wouldn't suggest anything too dark if you're pale though. Also, if you want to keep some of the red, doing an ombre effect would look amazing especially at that length. Or if you want to go with something even more crazy, go half red/half black. I've had a soft spot for my ginger hair recently but I was in desperate need for a change so I split my hair right down the center with those two colours (I can show you an example if you want). I've never had so many people compliment my hair before, and I thought I'd regret it!     Example: [x] [x]     Ignore the people patronizing you to keep the red, I get that all the damn time too but I've rocked a spectrum of colours regardless...and it will always grow back!"

Ive had blonde streaks and done a darker colour underneath my hair but just sick of looking at the red! How did your red grow back, did it change colour at all?"

Hair,3cv20i,Mellenoire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"I think a honey blonde would work well, or maybe a slightly deeper red. Depending on your work/uni/school it might even be fun to consider a non-natural colour like a lilac or mauve.   I would not go to a dark brown or black though, it won't suit your overall complexion and will be very difficult to lift back up to a lighter colour without severe damage."
Hair,3cv20i,MidWestJoke,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:37:45 2015 UTC,"Do an ombre from your natural red to a blond/strawberry blond. It'll look really cute! This way you can keep some of your natural color (which everyone seems to love, as do I) but still change it up.  If you're not worried about your natural color I'd say go for a blond, like caramel or dirty blond.  You could also dye the bottom half of your hair (as in put half of your hair into a pony and dye the remainder) to a darker brown (milk chocolate)."
Hair,3cv20i,DevolocaRaptor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:26:29 2015 UTC,"Add dome light strawberry blondish sun kissed pieces here and there.  Not really much at the root, just around the front and some ends keeping it subtle and staying with a copper or rose tone.  Keeping it sun kissed and not too dramatic will mean you wont have to do a lot of maintenance and it should grow out pretty seamlessly.  You have great natural hair though, but I love a strawberry blonde."

Hair,3cv4pm,DevolocaRaptor,4,Sat Jul 11 04:01:12 2015 UTC,"It will probably do that. If you cut off the length, there wont be as much weight loosening the curls, and they will actually get tighter.  So it may be fro-ey,  if you do want to go shorter maybe go gradually.  You can always cut more off, it takes a while to grow it back out!"

Hair,3cv4pm,WookieRubbersmith,2,Sat Jul 11 01:55:07 2015 UTC,I agree with the votes to pixie--especially the recommendation to go super short on the sides and long-ish on top. A friend of mine (who also has super curly hair) has this cut and it looks BAD ASS.  Here are some samples  of the kind of cut I'm imagining:  very styled  softer  edgier
Hair,3cv4pm,treebeardismyfather,2,Sat Jul 11 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"Just want to point out that I have short hair like your friend's but op's hair is curlier than in those pictures (those girls have bigger curls) so there's a good chance her hair will be more afro-y if she cuts it that short. Not that that would necessarily be bad, it's just def something to note."

Hair,3ct5cd,boredguitarist,3,Fri Jul 10 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"There's a hair trend lately where the hair on the crown is longer than the hair on the sides, and it looks nice on most men. http://discover10.com/35-best-short-haircuts-for-men-in-2015/  If you want classic with a modern accent, go with the first picture (high maintenance). Second favors the the modern trend more heavily (high maintenance). Third and fifth are nice in-betweens (low maintenance).

Hair,3ctsmh,angiejens,3,Fri Jul 10 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"There are several different brands of hair extensions, the two I deal with are Hair Dreams and Great Lengths. Both are bonded in using heat, the HD has a nylon bond, GL is a keratin bond. The nylon bond is more durable and lasts longer. Wear time for both is 4-6 months depending on how fast your hair grows, and how well you maintain them. Application time and price depends on the stylist putting them in. They are generally ordered by the bundle depending on how much hair you have (length and volume), and how much length you want. There are also Quikkies, which are stuck together with your hair sandwiched in between, while these will last 2-3 months I would not recommend them for long term wear, as they are harder to hide than the bonded extensions.  All of these can be washed, dried, curled, etc as long as you don't apply a hot tool straight to the bond. I'm typing this on mobile, so I may not have answered everything, but if you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll try my best to answer!"

Hair,3cuu0j,UnflinchingCube,3,Sat Jul 11 04:00:01 2015 UTC,"If your hair grows pretty quick, you could just cut the sides and back a bit shorter than they already are, and then just try and keep the patch covered when you don't want it to be noticable, be it with the longer hair on top, a hat, a headscarf, etc.   Within a few weeks your scalp won't be showing through and the patch will be far less noticable. Pretty soon, especially if you cut down the sides more without shaving them all the way, things will be back to normal. :)  That's what I would do since you really don't want to shave it.   Oh, and please don't glue hair to your scalp :( If anything, comb the long hair over, and secure it with bobby pins if you can. Then hairspray it so it stays. Extra firm hold."

I'm not a hairdresser, but I've played around a lot with color from Sally's. If you know anyone with their license, they could even pick you up some professional level color at one of the suppliers. Another thing you might try would be a purple conditioner, as well, to see how your hair color changes that way.  Hopefully someone with more training and experience will respond, but good luck!!"

Hair,3cpy08,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"I think quite light blonde would look great as well, but it depends how your planning on attaining it.  The hair colour you did months ago is still in your hair so you have to take that extra pigment into consideration. If you try to go platinum with a box colour, you will pretty much 100 percent get yellow roots, and orange ends, because box colour just isn't designed to lift that much, so you will have to bleach it.  With your length hair, damage shouldn't be a huge issue because it is short anyways, so don't worry, but if you do decide to go blonde i would recommend seeing a professional, and know that it may take a couple visits to get that light (but since your hair is short it is much easier/less work/less time/less money) to attain a lighter colour!).  Take a look on Instagram for hairstylists near you and go to someone who does stuff you like, if that interests you.  If you want to do it yourself, you should stay darker.  I really love a dark red violet on short hair like this as well, and since you will be staying dark, it shouldn't come out any surprise colours.  Red violet might sound scary but its super pretty and, for being violet, is actually really natural looking. (For purple, i suppose)"

Products containing alcohol can also be pretty bad for the quality of them. I've got way too much experience with extensions, and it is pretty hard to take care of them and have them stay top quality.  Does it say anything about not being able to use heat on it? That is usually a dead give away that it's not human hair. Other than that, you should be able to tell from the look and feel of it."
Hair,3cqou9,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"It said something about using only a low heat setting.  So, if the 100% human hair extensions are ""made in China"", are there really that many people in China who grow their hair really long and then sell it for extensions?"
Hair,3cqou9,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"Again, that is actually good advice if you want to ensure the quality of the hair. Chinese hair isn't abnormal in the extensions world, but it is generally considered a low quality option because it's naturally shed ""dead"" hair instead of donated hair.  After looking around a little bit, it would seem that this is real hair, but it doesn't have a lot of good reviews and it seems the quality is pretty bad and not remy. A lot of people are saying it tangles very easily and sheds, and that you do not get a lot of hair in the pack. I haven't tried these extensions myself, but after looking at some reviews and forums this is definitely not something I would spend money on or put on my head."

Hair,3coull,SunflowerInKashmir,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"If your hair is too damaged from bleach/dye/etc. the best option is to cut it, as damage will continue to travel up the hair strand. As you probably know, hair damage can't be erased. If you want to grow out your hair, it's actually best to start off by cutting off as much damaged hair as possible so that you can start fresh.  That said, with the proper care it can at least feel and look a litte better. Protein treatments are great for bleached hair - I really recommend Joico K-PAK Deep Penetrating Reconstructor, this stuff is magic.   Moisture is also important, as a protein overload can cause breakage. Joico K-PAK Intense Hydrator is probably the best hydrating treatment I've ever tried (I buy this stuff in 1000ml bottles!), but there's lots of other ones out there if Joico is too expensive.   Lastly, I'd recommend coconut oil. Get some pure coconut oil and slather it on your hair and just leave it for as long as you can. This is a great treatment for all types of hair, but especially damaged because coconut oil can actually penetrate the hair shaft instead of just coat it. Pure coconut oil should be solid in the jar, but you can scoop some out and just warm it up in your hands and it'll melt right away. I actually use this on my hair while I bleach it and it really protects the hair from getting too dry."

Hair,3cocb6,emnemnem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"Honey can actually lighten hair! Though naturally is kind of the wrong term, as you're essentially doing the same thing as you would with bleach, just in a lower dose (thus it isn't as effective). Also keep in mind that when you lighten your hair you are taking pigment out, but not putting any pigment in. Your hair will be brassy if you lighten it, unless you tone it or dye over it afterwards. It might not turn out the color you want."
Hair,3cocb6,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:54:26 2015 UTC,Fun fact!  Bleach used for lightening hair is a combination of ammonia (or similarly acting substitute) and hydrogen peroxide!  So it totally makes sense her acne medicine did so.  Citrus can lighten hair over time but the results are really really subtle.
Hair,3cnl74,blindSniper123,2,Thu Jul 9 08:17:25 2015 UTC,"Looks fine, IMO. I started putting mine back when it got about that length, it takes a lot of....er, ""training"".  I used pomade consistently and wore beanies/hats with my hair slicked back underneath. I think it ended up taking about a month or two to naturally flow backwards."
Hair,3cnl74,PaynusInTheAnus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thank you for the reply! Would you recommend using the pomade to slick it back and then putting on a hat? Or should I use the hat without pomade and just use it to keep it slicked back?
Hair,3cnl74,PaynusInTheAnus,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"I usually used one or the other. I would put the hat on after a shower, so my hair would dry that way. (Be warned, this'll look really weird when you take your hat off)  The pomade would likely be something to use in the later stage, as it doesn't hold all that firmly.  I would look elsewhere on the 'net too, since this was really all I tried, and there are probably better options."
Hair,3cnl74,SocraticSwagger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:15 2015 UTC,"Can you pull it off? In my experience, the people who have known you will think your hair looks weird long. But to new people, it will look glorious.   Tips for keeping it off your face? Paynus is about right the hats. I used to get out of the shower, don a beanie, and wear it for about 30 minutes. Hair lost all volume, but it stayed out of my face. Take off the beanie, shake it out, brush with hands backwards. Your hair is like rope; it has memory.  It's worth mentioning though, that your hair is really pretty short. I'm not ragging on you, just saying the beanie trick won't work really well for you at this length.  As to will a cut solve your problem? No. Perseverance and time will take care of it.  What can you do in the mean time? Got2B has a fibre gum that worked well for me at your length. Use barely any. Hand brush it to the side and call it quits. There is about a year and a half time between your cut and what you want; get used to looking mediocre at best.  Look into hair care. I get cuts less often than normal because I take good care of my hair.  When your hair is longer (when you can put your bangs in your mouth) look into Stretch-Combs. They're about a buck a piece and look less goofy than a super high bun (folded ponytail). I also used an elastic head band and bobby pin to achieve a similar result without the grooves.  Backwards cap is your friend. Find one you like, a lot.  Oh, and for about 2 months, the hair will naturally get caught under your eyelids. Be ready, because then it will naturally go in your eyes, and I mean onto the surface. It blows. Persevere."
Hair,3cnbyl,rayebies,2,Thu Jul 9 06:15:53 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. The hair you would usually be losing when you shower every day / every other day has just accumulated and all shed at once, most likely."
Hair,3cm589,makkkarana,2,Wed Jul 8 23:56:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to dye your hair a bright vibrant colour you have to bleach it, as you probably know from dyeing it blue before. Are you trying to dye over the faded blue dye or are you re-bleaching your hair and then dyeing it??   My advice, after having dyed my hair several different colours for years, would be don't re-bleach it except for your roots/virgin hair, if you do it could break off.  If you want to go green just dye over the faded blue. But to directly answer your question - if you use semi-permanent dye like Splat it will definitely take to bleached hair."

Is there any process to prolong color?"
Hair,3clyuv,90Days_Lex,2,Wed Jul 8 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"I actually wear a mix of dark brown & black cherry, which I find helps the color stay in longer. I re-dye every 5 weeks but because it is one dark color I have no problem doing it on my own at home. I don't know what the cut is called, but if you take those pictures in any normal stylist will know what you're talking about.   I just think that any darker color would complement your skintone better, and the red gives it a bit of personality instead of flat dark brown, but the darker you go the less upkeep you require and IMO you'd look a lot better in a darker color, with or without the red in. :) Less frequent shampooing helps, too, if you can avoid daily."

It wouldn't bond to your hair and just wash down the drain. You need an ammonia based color that will open your cuticle and deposit color.

If it's too dark it won't show up, if it's too light it'll be more vibrant than what you're aiming for. Manic Panic will stick to pre-lightened hair if the dye is darker and more pigmented.

Average re touch time is 2-4 months in which you get a white/close to white weave of color mixed in with your natural.$60-$90/session. Get a consultation and ask what the procedure involves. Ask what strength developer they would use and if they say 20vol thats good and healthy for lifting fine hair but it takes a little longer than stronger developer @ 30-40vol which lifts aggressively/quickly and is over kill on fine hair meaning the stylist just wants to spend as little time on you to get more bookings in a day and doesn't care about health of the hair.   Typically its a 2hr. booking and a 5min toner may be used after the foils are shampooed out to make the blond ash and close the cuticle. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cd/a6/36/cda63666da0bd65a3bf0e4cb9bb653c1.jpg"
Hair,3ci4hr,vividamnesia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:52:33 2015 UTC,I have fine hair and it is a dark brown almost black. I wanted a light brown/blond ombre so look like a natural blond. Kind of like how lots of blonds have a sandy colour at the top. I ended up with a brassy clay brown on the top...supposed to be sandy blond brown...and then the ideal blond i wanted on the bottom. According to the hairdresser it was what i asked for however i showed her multiple pictures of exactly what i wanted and its like she ignored it completley and did what she wanted.  The blond did damage my hair as expected. It has been 2 months and itnis just starting to almost be back to normal frizziness (curly hair) I do love the blond on me and when i get enough money again i will be going elsewhere. With such a big change i urge you to make sure your stylist knows exactly what you want and what your goal is.

You have to get the original Moroccan brand none of the knock offs. Its teal with a orangish M like this:http://beautyreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/D217.jpg There are some copy cats mimicking their brand so make sure you get it from a pro place look around/ask for deals for both poo/condt together. Say your a first time user thats been recommended to try it. It lathers good for cleansing and the poo leaves hair smoother than most plus the condt is great for tangles comb hair when wet with condt in it

Hair,3cd3ve,H-ly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:18:47 2015 UTC,i would never recommend permanent hair color on ends. the pigment is way too dense and it can be very drying. have your mom look for a demi-permanent option for next time and shell get the color and shine without going too dark. :) but for now wash with head and shoulders or clarifying shampoo a couple times to get a layer or two out. (follow with deep conditioner it can be drying) but with her color history she may need to see a stylist at this point to fix it. :/
Hair,3cd3ve,chromacrowns,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:32:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. I was thinking we use a color remover and then just dye it all with a semi permanent copper. Then in a week or so bleach her roots and use permanent copper on them?

Hair,3cc9ls,BigBeefyyy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"I'm a girl with a pixie, so I hope I can help! I have really thick hair as well and my hairdresser usually thins it out as she is cutting it. She just uses those scissors with the teeth. She doesn't thin it too much, so it isn't noticeable until you run your hands through it. When it comes to styling, it definitely helps! My hair holds product better, and when my hair grows out it doesn't stick straight out. It tends to lay a little flatter. So far in between haircuts there's only one thing that annoys me about having had it thinned. When I pull the top of my hair back, there's flyaway hairs. The ones that bother me the most are the ones around my hairline that are too short to go with the rest of my hair so they just dangle in front of my forehead. However, nothing a little product won't fix! I hope I helped and good luck!"

Hair,3cc9ls,vividamnesia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:38:26 2015 UTC,Thinning/bulk removal/detailing is most commonly done with a notched blade shear that cuts so much out and leaves so much in. A competent stylist will know hoe to use these tools by using them a ways down from the root lightening near the ends of the hair to not have vast irregularities in lengths. A knowledgeable stylist will use their regular shears and hand place texture by slide cutting and feeling/seeing how the hair reacts to it for longer hair/growing length clients. You should experience no hassle/noticeable problems throughout  your hairs various stages

Hair,3cb17a,vividamnesia,2,Tue Jul 7 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"I've tried this before. I had very long hair and my hair is very straight. I cut about 10 cm. It looked fine, like I had it layered. I personally wasn't amazed but I did what I set out to do (make it shorter and more layered) and others had told me it looked nice. So.. I think it's an easy low risk haircut! Just simple layered hair. Just make sure you brush your hair out very well (so your ponytail is even and tight on all sides) and only cut the hair when it's still damp."
Hair,3cb17a,sailorjoop,2,Mon Jul 6 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you just need to get the routine for curly hair and not worry about cutting it as curly hair grows slow and shrinks up alot when managed right. I have curly hair and am a stylist of 20 years. Cut back shampooing it drys already dry curls out causing frizz. wet down and condition instead. Use tepid h20 when washing hair to cut frizz. Towel blot never rub hair dry it causes frizz. Never brush/comb when dry only in the shower with conditioner in it do you comb through it EVER, Find the right leave in product for your hair like a curl cream with some weight to it just scrunch it through  damp hair thoroughly  head upside down after washing/towel blotting and air dry. Get conditioner and shampoo for chemically/color treated hair, these are formulated with more moisturising properties for dry hair great for curls.If you do cut it get a friend to just take it to desired length evenly cut for longer styles or get them to cut it about chin length all around when damp and combed straight. Chin length with curl enhancing tips above will give you a style half that length when curly and dry. You can also use a little conditioner mixed with hand lotion to make your own curl cream product. So as long as you towel blot, do not brush/comb after towel blotting to keep curls as curls, and scrunch in a little leave in you will have a much happie hair time. Embrace/enhance your natural hair type!"

Hair,3cbj0u,ithinkiswallowedabee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:59:15 2015 UTC,I don't have any gray yet haha I know it'll be a long process but my hair grows pretty fast and I'm willing to cut it when it gets to my shoulders so that will cut a lot of time off. So demi does pretty much the same thing semi does but lasts a bit longer? As long as it fades instead of permanently dying my hair I'd be willing to use that instead.
Hair,3cbj0u,amckinzie2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"Even semi will change your natural hair. Yes, it will fade, but it won't completely wash out like a temporary would. I would say since you're just starting, go with a demi, and then as it grows out switch to semi. Cutting your hair once it gets to your shoulders will definitely help. I would even suggest that once you cut it, you might want to foil in some highlights. And make sure during this whole process you're getting regular trims."
Hair,3cbj0u,vividamnesia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"Even if it does change my hair color it'll help me a whole lot more I think. I just don't want jet black anymore so even of I can do this and go red or something, I'd like it a whole lot more. Thank you though :) I think I'll start with the demi first and see what happens from there. I trim my hair regularly as is so I'll for sure keep up with that :)"

Hair,3c7ovm,vividamnesia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:03:37 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've always been a fan of dark red but my natural color is a golden brown/dirty blonde so maybe I'll do that again
Hair,3c7ovm,s1h4d0w,3,Mon Jul 6 15:13:43 2015 UTC,Something slightly longer than your chin but above your shoulders would look cute. Adding a few layers should perk up your curls too!
Hair,3c8jeq,dustiferb,9,Sun Jul 5 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad haircut, they're just being twats.   You should maybe push it back a bit using hair wax, I recommend any of the basic-line VO5 products. :)"
Hair,3c8jeq,Death-Cab,3,Mon Jul 6 00:53:19 2015 UTC,Mohawk with designs shaved on the sides. That should shut your friends up.  Check out a few barber shops and find a barber who has photos of him doing graphic hair.  Find someone who is experienced in hair graphics.  I promise that no one will describe your hair as boring if you get this done.

Hair,3c8jeq,Nick10flow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:01:24 2015 UTC,i think you should get it cut shorter on the sides and back and leave the top on the longer side so you can push it back with some product that gives your hair texture. make sure to go back every 4-6 weeks to keep it up
Hair,3c9c9t,treeapple21,3,Mon Jul 6 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"Go a light brown/dark blonde, If you go from such a rich dark colour (and have never coloured before)  going too light too fast can be a bit of a shock, and you may not like it as much ‚Ä¶if you gradually go lighter or even just not as bright, guarenteed you'll like it more.  Level 8 blonde i'd suggest with an ash reflect."

Hair,3c93tk,roninjedi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:23:38 2015 UTC,I have been told that i look better with a beard but it just feels so scraggly and dosen't look like it grows up high enough on my cheeks. Also it seems kind of thinnish to me but idk. As for my hair on my head its just been a long time since i was able to get a hair cut and was looking for any ideas about a cut that might look good for my head. And yeah i know thinner frames but how thin? Pics of suggestions would be nice.
Hair,3c93tk,Lucasaur,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:23:50 2015 UTC,Long hair actually suits you. I'd suggest growing out bangs with a slight sweep. Grow out the sides and don't tuck it behind your ear. Or Getting a buzz is always refreshing gives you a new outlook on your facial structure and it could deff work with the beard Thinner frames is a no go. More like smaller frames more suited for the size of your head will do you a lot of justice. Your glasses are too big for your face.

Hair,3c7ome,mcjunk32,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"Less maintenance as you don't need to get it cut all the time as with short hair. Depends on how much you let it grow in between cuts/detailings but not as frequent as 2-3"" long hair with shorter back and sides.  Hair grows on average 1/2""/month so you could probably get away with seasonal cuts every 3-4 months to remove bulk and trim up a "" or two."
Hair,3c7ome,vividamnesia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"you're right. I have to cut a cut ever 4-6 week right now, so the coast builds up.  What about day to day maintenance though?"
Hair,3c7ome,vividamnesia,2,Sun Jul 5 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"Just reset by wetting it down if funny in the morning. If you shower a lot don't shampoo it alot this can dry it out with length involved. You just rinse it under the h20 and let naturally dry after toweling off excess h20.  It also depends on if your hair is straight,wavy,curly. Waves and curls usually need a little leave in conditioner or just a small amount of normal conditioner left in it to smooth waves and curls. These hair types usually are drier by nature and require more of a moisture conditioner, again skip out shampoos they always strip natural oils from the hair making it drier.  Wet in morning let naturally dry/ don't over wash and if dry use moisture conditioner after shampooing or just use conditioner  and skip every 3rd shampoo or so."

Hair,3c401j,Dreadnought44,2,Sat Jul 4 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"My sides are completely unmanageable if I don't keep them very short and I look like a mushroom. With hair as fuzzy as mine, it has to be either quite short (<2 inches) or quite long (past shoulders). Anywhere in between, it's stiff enough and curly enough that gravity can't pull it downward; it just sticks straight outward in every direction. Basically, an afro. I try something new probably once a year, but right now I'm keeping the sides very short, about an inch long, and the top longer, 2-3 inches. The sides are always the hardest part. Then I just push it back with a styling cream after every shower."

Hair,3c401j,starrow20,2,Sun Jul 5 01:52:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much time you're willing to put into your hair. I don't have experience with men's curly hairstyles, but I do have curly hair myself. I'd say go into a salon and get someone who has experience cutting curly hair. Bring in some 'hair inspiration' but know that all curly hair is different so your hair might respond differently. The best thing you can do is finding the right products. I personally have used the garnier fructose styling gel line for the past four years which really helps in keeping curly hair manageable. Pomades also work well.   In terms of a haircut, I've always found that men with curly hair who let their hair grow out a bit look good, but if it becomes really frizzy, it might be best to just get a short enough haircut that it's not visible that your hair is curly. Something like this maybe? http://pureprovender.com/feel-sexy-with-short-curly-hair-2014/hairstyle-for-wavy-hair-men/  (I'm aware though that a lot of professional styling went into that picture...)"

Hair history: About 8 years ago, I cut my hair to a wavy bob, dyed (for the first time) red: red  Mind you I am like 18-19 in this pic  After that I dyed it a chocolate color and had it in a slightly longer bob with bangs. I am considering going darker again. I think it looks most natural with my dark eyebrows and lashes.  Here is the first time I dyed it brown (you can still see the red): brunette  And later after multiple dyes (a cooler brown vs. red sheen)  http://imgur.com/pkW0GOJ  I then stripped it and my natural color grow out - haven't dyed since. I'd like to stick to some sort of natural coloring like brown henna.  I have very thick, coarse and brittle hair that can't handle processing well.   For the past 1.5 years, I have had this haircut (my favorite haircut I've ever had):  https://theoutlineblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/newhm7.jpg  Now my bangs are grown out out of laziness.  I am thinking of keeping the above cut, just cutting the length to a little above the collar bones.

Hair,3bww7u,floodthesun,15,Fri Jul 3 18:38:58 2015 UTC,Stylist here. I think it would look great on you! I would suggest instead of a pomade using some sort of shaping/molding cream. Pomade usually encourages the wet look. Thick hair is the best kind of hair for pixies! I say go for it and post afters. :)

Hair,3bww7u,HairyTexan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:12:34 2015 UTC,Was the picture enough for your stylist to off? I'm worried that I don't have a picture for the front or back.

Hair,3bww7u,RainingRabbits,6,Thu Jul 2 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"It won't be as heavy when its all chopped off so that should help a bit, but most pixie cutters use a pomade product to make sure that they get the most out of their cut and are able to make it look exactly like they want. The trick is to use just enough for styling and not so much that it looks oily. Very delicate balance. I think you should do the cut though! I think it would look great on you!"

Also being such an objective thing even if you could possibly explain it to a hairstylist no guarantee they would understand or even be able to do it. You want weight taken out and texture. Just find a competent hair stylist. Good luck on your journey.

Hair,3by9r4,vividamnesia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""inverted layer thing"" but whenever someone asks me to reduce weight, I use thinning shears. The top is clipped up like you said, and the underneath part is thinned out. When done correctly this greatly reduces the weight without changing the appearance of the hair. So you could try asking the stylist to ""thin out"" your hair... Really, the best thing to do is to find a stylist that you like, and stick with them."
Hair,3by9r4,vividamnesia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"This might have been what she did, but I may not have been paying too much attention. I do remember a lady using these on me, and while it did reduce the weight, it wasn't exactly what I had described. She didn't make me look awful, so no complaints here!   Oh! and one more thing I remember about the haircut that I originally wanted. The next lady to cut my hair mentioned how when she pulled my hair up to my crown to cut it, the ends were cut in the shape of a 'softened' v. Does that sound like a common thing?

Hair,3bxb08,lovesmasher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:36:02 2015 UTC,Go to a dermatologist. All other answers are speculation and can make the problem worse.
Hair,3bxb08,vividamnesia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:07:16 2015 UTC,Work a little coconut oil/olive oil into scalp after hot shower b4 bed and sleep with it over night. If not too oily leave it in if not shampoo out next day. Vinegar is acidic and safe but I don't know if it will help any. Cut back on the shampoo and rinse well and condition only the next 4 times. You could be having a reaction to your shampoo or products.  Head and shoulders id formulated to only work as long as you use it when you stop the dandruff comes back. Salon grade dandruff shampoo makes it get worse first to purge it from your system then it gets cured
Hair,3bxb08,Seaburry,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:19:58 2015 UTC,"Stylist here. i'd suggest doing the vinegar. only do it once, use apple cider vinegar. it wont kill your hair, it'll help neutralize the ph on your scalp. But I suggest that only because if you have dandruff that will kill bacteria causing it. Dandruff and dry scalp are two totally different things. If you dont want to shell out some cash for a salon product there is usually a drug store brand TGel, I've seen that work on people. I'd suggest too maybe going to a dermatologist, to look at your skin if its getting that burning sensation for a long time, it could be a underlying cause, or just a imbalance of hormones in your body. It could also be psoriasis. so the Tgel stuff works good for that, but it takes a few times using it to see results."
Hair,3bxb08,Edg94,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"I'm just a little bit hesitant just in case it's not dandruff. I have extremely dry skin everywhere on my body, so I guess it's not that much of a stretch to assume that my scalp is dry as well. I will try to do a vinegar rinse though, just to see if it would help. Should I dilute it first or use it as is?"
Hair,3bxb08,Edg94,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"Its either just Dandruff, Psoriasis, or Seborrhoeic dermatitis.  I have psoriasis and what you have sounds just like it. I was able to deter it for the most part by changing diet, hair products, and drinking at least 5 glasses of water a day.  Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, I used to have a snow machine of a scalp back in middle school. It was extremely dry and dense stuff (my stylist stated I have the most hair shes ever seen on a guy). I can get flakes anywhere on my head where there is hair (eyebrows, facial hair, scalp, back of ears, etc.) If I go out into the sun it burns like crazy, same for when doing cardio. Now I'm 20 and my hair is for the most part tame, and my flakes are usually non-existent. During the changing of season however, I tend to have lots of breakouts.  I would recommend making sure you change to a shampoo that is sulfate free, and that you shampoo less often if you do so everyday. (I do so every 3 days). Make sure to use a deep conditioner(also sulfate free) daily, and something to leave-in such as coconut oil to keep your hair and scalp constantly moisturized. After a few months you'll notice your hair will be naturally less dry, and easier to deal with.  As for the diet part, I used to be overweight, and had a poor selection of foods with pretty much no veggies. Soon as I lost all the weight and changed what I ate, my condition got way better. Drinking a lot of water would show a significant difference in a short period of time. When I started drinking at least 4 glasses a day I started to see it calm down within a week.  I would still recommend seeing a dermatologist to know concretely what it is that you have. If they state you have psoriasis or another inflammatory skin disorder they are going to want to prescribe you something like Ketoconazole. The stuff is ok but I highly recommend you attempt for 6 months to alleviate the condition with more natural methods before completely relying on such a topical cream. It is not exactly the best stuff for the body. (If you don't like that itching feeling Head and Shoulders gave you, you will hate this.)"
Hair,3bxb08,iamthelefthandofgod,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, the flakes have been getting worse lately and it might just be due to my changing diet. While I haven't been actively restricting my calories, I realize now I've cut down mostly on my fats. Do you think the lack of fats could be a part of the issue?   As for washing my hair, I usually do it about once a week (I find that the burning/itching feeling goes away after the second or third day, so this helps), and twice a week when I straighten my hair. I'm wary of washing it even less frequently, but I will try using an oil. Thanks for answering my question. :)"
Hair,3bxb08,Edg94,2,Fri Jul 3 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I don't see how fat could do that alone, when you change your diet, it would affect your bodily systems. If you really went and dropped stuff such as carbs cold turkey, it may be rough on the body and may cause some imbalance but I've never heard of fats specifically inducing flakes. Most of the stuff I've seen has been that anything that tends to create a inflammatory response would induce more flakes on the skin.  Stuff that includes sugar, refined grains, animal fats, to much dairy(unless low fat), msg, heavily processed foods(you know high fructose corn syrup laced into forzen foods, fruit loops, etc.) Its more about balancing your diet than anything else, at least thats what it was for me."

Hair,3bxfv0,LiquidConfidence,2,Thu Jul 2 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"Go to a salon to get it done. I'm a stylist and im not trying to get you to spend more money. It's literally if you go to sallys or the drug store, any way you try yourself, most likely your hair will just turn bright orange. Keep in mind too, the more drastic the color change, the more noticable you'll see it so a lot of upkeep getting your roots redone every 3-4 weeks for men. You can shave your head to the shortest gaurd, and its still dyeable, but if you keep your hair short, most likely you will end up cutting off the money you spent to have it colored, so get it cut when you get it colored, let it grow and keep it in a good cycle."

Hair,3bxfv0,vividamnesia,2,Fri Jul 3 06:49:30 2015 UTC,"In salon we use ammonia based color/bleach. The darker your hair the harder it is to get it past the copper/yellow stage and if you want blondish I suggest salon help as our chemicals are stronger than DIY dyes and you will probably not get the color you want DIY.  A dark blond/light brown DIY would be good in a lv.7-6N or NA. The smaller the # on the box the darker the target color will be.

Hair,3bwonx,Orangefriday,3,Thu Jul 2 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind too, Red is the hardest color to maintain in your hair. You will need a lot of upkeep. You'll see it fade within a the first few weeks. But, tell your stylist if you decide to do the red, to ""double dip"". Basically we would fill your hair, to replace pigment, do a seperate process to put in color. but to ensure it stays nicely and a little longer, you can add a gloss the within the same tones, to seal in that color.  I do hair by the way."

Hair,3bwonx,PenelopeWins,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:28:25 2015 UTC,To ease into a red- I suggest starting with a rich copper before making the dark red plunge. Think Emma Stone/Christina Hendricks/Bryce Dallas Howard color. Copper also sets your hair up with a good base before you go red- allowing the red to look dense rather than faded and tinted.

Hair,3bvugl,oratorioo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly the person who cut it, cut it too short causing it to stick up. so keep that in mind when getting your hair cut again. Depending on the length you can always use a clay or pomade and just push it in the direction it swirls. but unfortunately, you might just have to deal with it for a week or so until it grows out and lays back down."

Hair,3bvr26,Tommofifa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:28:42 2015 UTC,"Hi I have been told i have very thick hair and straight hair ? if that means anything to you, i have posted a few links;  Im fed up of my hair growing outwards and ruining any style i had to my hair cut. I usually have a 4 on the sides faded into slightly longer on the top so i can dry wax it across however this goes out of the window as it grows as its just a bog brush. I have tried having a 4 on the sides and the top and then leaving it longer on the front to achieve the look and this has worked a bit better.  Are there any other options/styles i could go for as i just dont know what to ask for or how to instruct the barbers."
Hair,3bvr26,DevolocaRaptor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:30:39 2015 UTC,"I think you should go shorter on the sides, then tapering up to the top.  I like to start with a 0 or 1 guard on the perimeter, and then basically have the cut on the side taper to longer.  Its pretty important to do it in a way that creates a vertical sillouhette instead of a round one, so it varies person to person.   Its kind of hard to elucidate with out diagrams or pictures what i mean.  http://imgur.com/8IeWMNa  This length I am a big fan of for the sides.  It is shorter than you have now so it gets rid of the puff.  The tricky part is finding a barber/stylist who can basically sculpt your hair to have a clean/not round looking profile.  For the top, the product, switching it up might help.  I like a clay like product, they have a matte finish and don't look oily or waxy,  so it basically just looks like you're not wearing product.  Sorry for not being able to explain well.  If i could draw a diagram i would."

Hair,3brhqs,tegs,3,Wed Jul 1 15:44:56 2015 UTC,Please don't cut your hair the way that /u/trashytripod mentioned.  It is the most common hairstyle younger guys have today.  I live outside of Nashville and it's like every guy between the age of 18 and 35 decided overnight to get that haircut.  The texture and weight of your hair is really nice and I think a Chris Evans hairstyle would look good on you.  You'd just need to cut it a little bit shorter then style it up and back with some hair wax or extra hold mousse.

Hair,3brw08,141516,5,Wed Jul 1 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"Could be the cut like others have said, could also be the length. If your hair is just long enough to hit your shoulders or an inch or so past your shoulders, it tends to 'flip' like that until it gets a little longer."
Hair,3brw08,hilaryrose,5,Wed Jul 1 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"For me, I found that the side that flipped up was the side i had facing the pillow when I slept and that it was following the curve of the pillow. I guess for that I would recommend showering in the morning and straightening it quickly after that, rather than showering at night"
Hair,3brw08,MostlyHarmlessXO,3,Wed Jul 1 18:58:21 2015 UTC,Pics would help. I have a similar problem and I found out it was mostly the cut for me. The ends would be stop at my shoulders and that causes the flip.
Hair,3brw08,ed077,3,Wed Jul 1 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"if you have your styist cut shorter pieces underneath the sections that flip, it will make weight to the pieces to concave. so no more flips."
Hair,3brw08,Seaburry,2,Wed Jul 1 20:19:26 2015 UTC,My hair does this on one side super annoying. I just use a straightener on them curving them in slightly as I do. Gets rid of the stupid flip.

The pro lines like fudge products will have the bees wax rendered a specific way and the ""filler"" will be other compounds that render the bees wax useable and add the benefits the product gives. All pro lines have a fleet of chemists @ home base and your not going to get filler in any of the products scent yes but all the ingredients have a purpose.

Most Pro lines don't know they are selling their product and when they find out they freak and get it pulled off the shelves. Some pro products can cause ill effect if used on the wrong hair type and most pro stuff says guaranteed when sold by a professional to cover illegal selling damages caused.

From your pic, hard to tell without physically seeing you, but you look like you have a diamond, oval face.  but also with those head shapes, i know for women, most haircuts look good. Also, you face seems kinda long, you could rock decent length then always opting for a shaved side. I'd suggest find a modern barber shop that can give you an amazing cut, and more detailed cut because they specifically work on men."

Hair,3bsf0z,bitter_green_icing,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a hairstylist, and usually I've only seen when you highlight the hair, it usually causes less curl, lightener has the same ph as a relaxer, so I've seen curl lost. I also know that depending how light your hair was, it might be in shock because you regimented your hair, but shouldn't effect your curl too much, but i don't know what your stylist used either, but thats my knowledge of what i've seen happen to clients hair."
Hair,3bsf0z,Seaburry,2,Wed Jul 1 20:22:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I would have expected. Less curl with the highlight, which is why I'm so surprised about the opposite. My salon is Aveda and it took two hours and multiple stages to get rid of all the blond and make it brown, could it be that there is just more color on the hair, weighing it down?"
Hair,3bsf0z,Seaburry,2,Wed Jul 1 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"I mean not necessarily. The multiple processes just replaces your pigment, but nothing like weighing the hair down, we're talking like insignificant amounts that stay after we shampoo your hair. I've worked in an average salon before and have seen their color so weird things. If you want your curl back, deep condition, don't brush, air dry. Don't use harsh sulfate shampoos. Deva curl is an amazing brand that does the ""No-poo"" but I have wavy hair and used it for a month straight and I ended up with luscious banana curls.  Basically just try everything to recondition your hair and don't use tons of product cause that tends to weigh down hair."
Hair,3bsf0z,stek9,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe it seemed curlier than normal with highlights because of the cuticle being lifted giving it a sort of frizzier appearance in some areas. Lightening hair too much, however, will damage the structural integrity and cause you to lose the curl, which could be what happened with the single process all over."
Hair,3bsf0z,stek9,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"It would make more sense if it happened gradually, but this was sudden. Like the next day. Monday I was blond and curly, Tuesday I'm brunette and wavy. It's very strange."

Hair,3bsbby,mileshart,2,Wed Jul 1 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a long bob with long layers and feathering in the front, they are easier to manage with your glasses than a fringe! Colour wise keep your current blonde on the mid-length to ends and use a medium brown on the roots smudging down around 2-3 inches, and paint random fine sections similar to highlight size underneath and through the feathering! If you can get the brand at your local salon recommend Wella Color Touch 6/71 4% developer on dry hair not wet 20 mins! Good luck"

Hair,3bthnk,dianamo11,2,Thu Jul 2 00:41:39 2015 UTC,You can get a darker blue and mix it with a black from the same line. Manic panic is really good for mixing as is special effects. Just do a little black at a time to make sure it doesn't turn out too black.

Hair,3bpahd,homefries33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:40:37 2015 UTC,It depends on how dark your roots are. A box dye will generally only give you 2 levels of lift as they have 20vol. developer standard. Too bad theres no pic of your hair. If your roots are a lv.4 and target color is a lv.6 no prob just do the roots first and drag it through the rest after roots are processed about 15 mins after mixing and applying to roots.  Red/Copper filler would be tricky for you to do without having it grab to coppery. The caramel has both a bit of copper/warmth and the yellow gold missing pigments from the bleached hair so long as your not putting an ash color on it you are fine to not use a filler Im guessing your target caramel color is a lv.6/7.... The # on the box. the smaller the # the darker your color. I need to know what your roots are if you are no darker that a lv.4 you should be fine. Most people are a lv.4-6 Naturally.
Hair,3bpahd,vividamnesia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:44:35 2015 UTC,"My roots would be a level 4 and the blonde looks like an 8.   When I am dying the brown and blonde hair separately, should I be worried about an overlap line around my head? And do I use two different box colours?  Edit: what if I only dye the bleach blonde back to a 4? What dye do I use?"
Hair,3bpahd,vividamnesia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"No it will be ok if there's a little overlap try to keep it @ a minimum though. NO same box of color we want to get it on the blond hair a good 10mins after mixing it up to avoid the unneeded lifting process as the hair is already light enough and requires deposit only color.  If you want to go back to a lv.4 from bleached hair you must use a filler color first or the color will washout quicker and be a muddy color due to the missing pigments in the bleached hair.   We are missing our gold and copper pigments in bleached hair so do the blond hair with a filler color in a lv.7Gc(Gold/Copper)Make sure its Gold Copper as the first value is the stronger pigment so Gc=More gold less copper. Again let the color sit a good 7mins after mixing to bypass the lifting process as the cuticle is already open on bleached hair then slop it through the hair quickly work through time the 20 mins or whatever the box says for processing time typically its 30mins total. Shampoo out, completely dry the hair first then apply target color lv.4. Being dark it will be formulated with 10vol developer not 20vol like lighter colors so we can put it on right after mixing as theres no lifting stage to bypass this time."
Hair,3bpahd,vividamnesia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:50:14 2015 UTC,Oh yea almost forgot....you wont be able to go from a lv.4-lv.8 with anything you get from a drug store thats 4 lvs. of lift and box dye is standard 20vol so up to 2 lvs.of lift will be met. From 4-8 I would use bleach + 25vol(1/2 20vol+1/2 30vol) to match up the lighter blond hair. Then tone
Hair,3bo3xi,CLWsucks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"You actually did pretty much what would have been done in the salon.  The only thing different was probably the application of the bleach (roots are always last) and the types of products used.  Way to go!  Hair isn't that hard once you have a good handle on  what processes need to be done to accomplish the end results. Here's a lovely tip for bleaching too, coat your hair in oil before you bleach.  It'll help protect from some damage.  Once again way to go!!!"
Hair,3bo3xi,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:56:33 2015 UTC,I knew that I was supposed to do the roots last but I tried to get an ombre once and my ends wouldn't lift at all (this was when I had virgin hair) so I assumed that my roots would need some extra time to get the right amount of lift.... Nope!  And thanks! :D

Hair,3bpuiu,rayraysayshi,2,Wed Jul 1 04:38:41 2015 UTC,"stylist here. depending on your end result you want. Lift your hair to the palest yellow. then all you need to do is use a toner. If you have a sallys, I think its their wella t-18 or t-20. leave that on there for 5-15 min depending on how ashy you want to be. In order to get that gray color it needs to be almost white to get that hue. I dont use anything from Sallys, but brands like Kenra have a toner SV, which is awesome  1 part sv to 2 parts 9 vol. for 5 min. longer if you want legit gray. Joico had titanium direct dye, which gives a cool silver look. Just depends. If I saw a pic of the clor you want to achieve I could probably tell you."
Hair,3bpuiu,Seaburry,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I have been asking everyone to no avail. A couple questions though;    what do you mean by toner SV? 2 parts 9 vol.?   Sorry, I don't know the lingo.  Here is the color I am going for. (I can't find a good male pic)  Here is its current state. and here  Thanks Seaburry:D"
Hair,3bpuiu,Seaburry,2,Fri Jul 3 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"Oh your not to far off.  1. Kenra has toners called rapid toners. SV is silver violet.  2. Instead of equal ratios, you need to use one part toner, like say 1 ounce, to 2 ounces of 9 developer. Developer goes from 5-40.  Their toners are meant to stay on for 5 min, but if you leave it on for say 10, it will be super silver.    With the color of your hair now, i'd say you have to lift it a little more to almost pale blonde. You need to get out almost all pigment, I'd suggest using lightener, with 20 vol, and wrap it with plastic wrap to stay moist, and leave it on for roughly 30-45 min. then tone.   Also, if you don't have access to professional colors, you can buy them on amazon but they are way more expensive. hope that helps a little.   but if the toner freaks you out. you can use silver vivids by pravana. direct dye, may come out a little darker but will fade, or Joico has color intensity in Titanium, and kenra also has a permant dye, 8sm, which you can mix with say 30 devolper, and just throw that on your hair now, and should give you a more muted gray."
Hair,3bpuiu,BansheeJam,2,Fri Jul 3 02:39:42 2015 UTC,grab the little purple pouch from sallys called ardell red gold corrector and add it right into the dye/bleach you use. and don't use wella color charm cooling violet. i did and it looked really silver but lasted for two days http://imgur.com/9ecZODM

Hair,3bnls2,tryingnottobefat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend going to a professional stylist. There's a lot of variation in tones, and no matter what, you're going to see a big difference throughout your hair. A pro can formulate for the different tones, and you won't end up with any unwanted surprises.   Side note, was this for Wella trendvision? Its absolutely gorgeous!"

I got an Ion intense neutral in light brown that came out a lot darker than I thought, but it did cover really really well, you'd never know that I had so many colours in my hair!  It was for Goldwell ColourZoom, we didn't get to finals though, which is why I was allowed to colour my hair."

Hair,3bnd9b,Vamp1r3P1x13,2,Tue Jun 30 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"My parents use this method. They keep that luster in their hair with raw coconut oil. You have to use RAW coconut oil though. That refined stuff will make your hair greasy. When you get it, it should be in a jar of some sort. Don't scoop the hardened oil from the jar. You won't be able to distribute the oil evenly. Put the jar in a bowl of hot water and use the oil that the heat turns to liquid. You can also microwave a scoop of it if you're in a hurry. Just make sure you distribute it evenly from root to tip, and let it sit like conditioner. Rinse thoroughly. And don't leave the oil in a wet place (like your shower) or it will grow mold. Hope this helped!"

Hair,3bm62w,cgonzalez94,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:16:30 2015 UTC,Same. Coconut oil isn't great for fine hair. By the time you get it out of your hair you've stripped your hair. Sunflower oil is a thin oil that I like in my hair. Also avocado and algae masks.

Hair,3bl113,BiteThePilloww,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:13:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If your looking for products after your cut, find a good matte wax with hold. I use woody's hair products on most of my men clients. They have a sculpting clay/wax that is blue that you cant even tell anything is in your hair, but gives it that hold. Also. this picture of the guy he has had his hair blow dried. find a round brush and a cheap dryer and dont be afraid to do your hair. A lot a men do. but dry your hair opposite you want it to go, load up and emulsify that product in your hands and go at it.   edit 1: also ask your stylist about doing your hair and ask for tips. they are more likely to communicate better than send you on your way."

I hear you're supposed to get it cut every other month or so to trim split ends so it doesn't travel up the hair shaft and ruin your progress. You could see how your hair is looking and if it looks good, let it grow to the point where you can trim the split ends yourself.

Hair,3bi1j4,jamillawv,4,Mon Jun 29 11:48:23 2015 UTC,"Its because most box colors have a really high volume developer. your roots are virgin hair and your natural color will lift. Color cannot lift and previous color. Even though you cut your hair often, the color you previously put in, never actually leaves unless its cut off. which you would have to cut off all the hair up top the new growth.  id suggest going to a professional and not using box color, or even learning a little bit about the different types of developer before just throwing 40 volume developer on your hair.  source: I have a cosmetology license."
Hair,3bi1j4,goaheadbackup,3,Mon Jun 29 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I've only box dyed my hair once.  I've been to the salon every time since then.  I have never been able to get my hair to dye all over, evenly at a salon.  Even my very very first time of ever dying my hair.  Because of that, I box dyed it the next time and got glorious results.  *edit to say that the box dye was done 5+ years ago and was only done once.  The first time I ever dyed my hair was in a salon and still didn't dye evenly  It took a lot of convincing to go back to a salon.  By that time, my hair had grown all the way out to my natural color.  I still can't get a salon all over dye.  (and I've been to several over the past 15 years).  I'm just perplexed."
Hair,3bi1j4,goaheadbackup,3,Mon Jun 29 15:58:13 2015 UTC,you could also try just coloring the new growth and not all of your hair. I like to think of using the color crayon analogy. take 3 or 4 crayons and color over the same spot a few times. it never looks as good as the first color you used. adding color over color over color just changes the outcome. but coloring over the fresh growth you may get better results.
Hair,3bi1j4,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:52:17 2015 UTC,I highly recommend getting a new hairstylist or doing more local research. Your hair is an investment to get great results you have to find a senior to master hairstylist at a nice salon with good reviews.   The problem that I am seeing here is inexperience. An educated and experienced hairstylist would have known to lift out the previous cosmetic color to the appropriate level and redeposit the more vibrant color. It's honestly super basic. Please don't sum up a whole career because of few bad stylists.    Technically you are on grounds for a redo appointment  if it has been less then a week. I recommend calling back and asking for someone with more experience to do your redo or ask that someone will more experience help the previous stylist with formulating. It should have been a color correction to begin with. This is something the stylist should have been able to educate you about.
Hair,3bi1j4,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:22:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for your response!  It's so odd because it seemed like all the color from the previous dye was gone (I had even cut my hair super short early last year)...that's why I turned to reddit.  I knew someone would have some sort of answer to help me with my next appointment!  I was beginning to think it was just my hair..since my first ever hair dye was done in a salon and still didn't take very well except in my roots!  Crazy hair haha
Hair,3bi1j4,Tat2beck,2,Tue Jun 30 01:07:01 2015 UTC,Ya for sure hair is very complicated just because of the chemicals involved in the process. Once the hair has cosmetic color on it it won't ever go vibrant until the cosmetic color is removed.   Good luck on your hair journey. For what it's worth that color would be super cool to have.
Hair,3bi1j4,DANICUNT,3,Tue Jun 30 03:22:06 2015 UTC,It would also be good to let the salon you go to know that you have box color on your hair.  That color needs to be broken up and the cuticle tamed be ready applying your salon color.  Box color always affects the outcome of salon color.
Hair,3bi1j4,Tat2beck,2,Mon Jun 29 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"Check.  I did tell them.  One suggested ""stripping"" my hair?    *edit to say that this was YEARS (5+) ago when I did the box dye.    One suggested bleaching my hair, but I said no.  I've just now grown my hair out to down past my bra strap and I'm not about to cut it, again.  I'll have to suck it up and just let this recent dye grow all the way out (and show my white hair I just found!)  Going forward, is there any brand/type of dye in the salons that is better than others?"
Hair,3bi1j4,Tat2beck,-2,Mon Jun 29 16:31:24 2015 UTC,The previous color HAS to be lifted out first.  The hairstylist is not a magician. You have unrealistic expectations and that is exactly why your hair didn't turn out for you. The stylist did her best based on your requests. I still think she should have said no and just matched the color on your ends instead.  I highly recommend going back to the salon instead of risking damaging it at home or even making the color worse.    Try a Davines  salon in the future. They have the lowest ammonia content on the market and are very naturally based.   Edit: info  Good luck. :]
Hair,3bi1j4,vividamnesia,2,Mon Jun 29 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Stripping is almost as damaging as bleaching.  In my salon we do what is called a ""soap cap""  which is low volume lightener mixed with shampoo, it breaks up the color just enough to apply new color without a line of demarcation.  I would recommend either Matrix Color Louis or Paul Mitchell the Color because both are very moisturizing.  However, if you have an allergy to beeswax skip the Paul Mitchell color.  You can call around and see who uses what.  You can also try a protein filler for your hair and a deep conditioning masque before you do color that way your hair is extra healthy going in."
Hair,3bi1j4,Tat2beck,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!  I wonder if my keratin treatments are doing anything to the color?  Would you (or anyone) have an answer to that?  Usually, I color the same day as my treatment (recommended by my stylist)"
Hair,3bjuw9,dragonseeker13,2,Mon Jun 29 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can  give is go see a professional. There is no comparison when it comes to salon vs home color. In the salon your hair always turns out better, more even, and healthier. The best part is if it doesn't turn out they have to fix it for free and have all products available there to do so.   Also at a salon they have a product called Olaplex.  This is a must in modern hair lifting. After a bleach and tone the hair feels barely damaged. The product maintains the bonds in your hair to keep the integrity despite the bleaching process.  This is not something you can just buy because it cots 300 dollars at the suppliers (Canadien).   I went from a lvl 6 with blonde highlights to a lvl 10. It took two lifting processes and I didn't even have to cut my hair for 5 weeks.  Afterwards I had punky colors put in and I've been purple for 8 weeks now. It's the best. You'll love it.   After the stylist has lifted you blonde you can either have it toned  there and apply your own semi perm at home (once again the stylist can do a way better job) or have it applied at the salon. Bring your own semi perm incase it's not something commonly stocked.   I recommend pravana for best vibrant and long lasting results. I also really love punky colors.  These can be found at most Shoppers Drug Marts.  Stay away from manic panic. It doesn't lift out of the hair properly and it can even go green.    I live for these colors in my professional career. I love doing them. I would recommend booking consultations until you find someone like me who is passionate about bright colors and don't cheap out!   Proof: https://instagram.com/danicaszcz/"

Hair,3bjuw9,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:42:52 2015 UTC,Then you should wait till then. If you damage your hair too much it won't take the color properly in the future.  Keep in mind stylist spend 3-4 years to become licensed in color. Someone without the education can really do some damage.   Good luck.

Hair,3bjuw9,LumpyOneEye,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:51:53 2015 UTC,The wedding is not until next year. Just trying to save up for it.
Hair,3bjuw9,LumpyOneEye,2,Mon Jun 29 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the box purples aren't the best route, in my opinion. I try to stick with Manic Panic, Directions, Pravana or Ion colors. Here's Manic Panic's color selections. As you can see, they have a crap ton of purple shades. If you want a dark purple, then you should strand test your choice of purple shade on your natural hair, to gauge how much/if you want to lighten your hair. Then, if you have never bleached your hair before, you should go to a salon and ask for them to help you. I find the best way to do it is to go in for a color and take the dye you bought with you. The dye they use at salons won't last as long and may not be the color you had in mind.   If you are dead set against going to a salon, then I can tell you my process, but it might not help very much. I have blondish hair to start with, and usually go for lighter and pastel shades. I go to my local beauty supply store (Sally's) and buy the packets of powder bleach (how many depends on your hair thickness and length). I think its called quick silver, or something like that. Then I get a bottle of developer. I usually use level 20, but I hear some people only use 10, and some regularly use 30. Be super careful if you use 30. (Tip: Sally's also sales packets that reduce burning and itching with bleach. They are worth it.) While you're there, also get some toner. I usually use Manic Panic's Virgin Snow, because you don't have to mix it with anything.   Go home. Follow the instructions on the bleach to bleach your hair. (You can also do bleach baths if you prefer, but like I said, my hair is light so I don't know if they are strong enough for darker hair.) You may not get light enough with the first go. Give it at least a week, preferably two before another round. Use good conditioner and conditioning treatments to keep your hair happy. The lighter your hair is, the truer the dye will be to the shade it is in the jar/on the swatch example. The toner should be used after you lighten to remove yellow tones from the hair, which should keep the purple from going red or blue on you.   I have this really bad habit of putting my color on right after I bleach and tone. It never takes to my roots if I do it that same night. I suggest having enough dye to do it twice (which is also good if it comes out splotchy too), or do it over a weekend to give your hair some rest.   I hope I answered your questions and didn't come across as too bad of a know it all. :) Good luck with the purple! Its such a fun color."
Hair,3bjpht,Shuriesicle,3,Mon Jun 29 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"The tone you get from your hairdresser will mostly be up to the stylist and how light they can get your hair.

Hair,3bj5sa,RageBonerr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:34:51 2015 UTC,She's gotta do some research online but also visit a salon that caters to natural hair. She's gotta learn what level her curls are and possibly cut her hair very short to get rid of any hair that's been relaxed. My aunt went natural and did that. She's very very happy with her natural hair but it IS work to maintain and keep looking nice. Black hair is naturally dry so she'll have to keep up with moisturizing it. Have her research your area for hair salons that cater to natural black hair and make an appointment. Hopefully they're good.

Hair,3bga5m,mayaleeb3,3,Mon Jun 29 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"You can do a French or Dutch braid into a ponytail. In a French braid, the braid is under it, leaving the top smooth. A Dutch braid has the braid on top so it looks like you laid a braid on your head. There are also a ton of different ways to do buns! You can put it high or low or even have multiple. When my hair was long, I would do 3 small buns really low in the back and clip a flower on one side of them."
Hair,3bfnhl,SocraticSwagger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"Less damage.

Hair,3bfnhl,stek9,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"It might be more damaging since many sections of her hair will be bleached more than once using gradual highlights. Hair doesn't repair itself, so the damage at the end of that year will be the same or more than the damage from doing it at once. She's just delaying the damage and also the results that she wants."
Hair,3bfnhl,vividamnesia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:52:15 2015 UTC,If hair has been colored dark for a while and seems on the porous side going blond gradually is a good way to do it.The hair gets a rest in between bleachings plus we re-touch roots of prior hi-lites and add new hilites every time so bleach is not getting on all the same spots continuously.  I always alternate a full head of foils every 1.5-2months with the t-zone every 1.5-2months roots only. I have a girl with platnium and lo-lites now for 8 years doing her hair this way and never has a problem happened.
Hair,3bfnhl,jerpod,0,Sun Jul 5 13:10:21 2015 UTC,"Doing it over time is definitely better for the hair! Doing it all at once is way mroe damaging than doing it over the course of a year. Giving time between each sessionw gives the hair time to heal. Using treatments like Orchid Oil (from Redavid) and Coconut Oil Treatment (also Redavid.. highly reccomend... from BC Canada) helps to repair damaged hair between sessions. Using other treatment products besides those work as well, I just really like that combination.

I have one at home, a lower model than what I have for work, and it's lasted me about four years now. It's the only brand I've ever had that didn't crap out almost immediately so I stand by it."

Hair,3bew2v,blytheyohannes,8,Sun Jun 28 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"It's your normal skin cells sloughing, just like everywhere on your body, and it gets trapped against your scalp cause your hair holds it there. It'unless it's coming off in big flakes or making your hair look dirty, it's normal. Use your nails to massage and exfoliate your scalp as you shampoo and that should mitigate the buildup between washings, which should be every 2-4 days."

Hair,3bgjnz,toolfan955,4,Mon Jun 29 01:02:38 2015 UTC,Ditch the straight across bangs because it doesn't compliment your face and sort of emulates a bowl cut. Go shorter with the bangs and style them so the hair doesn't fall straight and flat on your forehead.

Hair,3bd4pb,FakeGirlfriend,7,Sun Jun 28 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"I would definitely consider growing your bangs out and parting somewhat to one side. You have fine hair, and you're contributing a lot of potential body to your bangs that are kinda so-so. (I have a similar problem with straight bangs.)  Maybe a bang cut around your chin line would be best.  You also have some natural wave to your hair. Consider putting a thickening mousse in your hair after it dries and using a strong aerosol hair spray with argon oil to hold it. Your hair will do its natural thing and overall look like its full if body. A good brand I'm a huge fan of is Rusk. I normally buy my product from Amazon."
Hair,3bd4pb,KellyisGhost,3,Sun Jun 28 04:33:59 2015 UTC,Grow bangs + hair out and part it to the side.  A red color would like nice on you but brown also looks great.
Hair,3bd4pb,fangirl101,2,Sun Jun 28 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"You have a square face so you want to soften the lines, focus on adding volume to the roots when you blowdry/style it. Avoid straight blunt lines...like your bangs it mimics the face shape and makes it look more square. Try and pick styles that have a rounded shape with less angles.   A bob would work. Also grow out your bangs and side sweep.   Oh and believe it or not but a square face shape is actually pretty nice. You can rock a lot of different hair styles and a bunch of other good things."
Hair,3bclus,mrkrule,3,Sat Jun 27 23:07:55 2015 UTC,"Don't go to bed with your hair down. Unless it's so short that it doesn't tangle at all, like bob length, just put it in a very loose twist or bun. Take it down in the AM and not only will your hair be tangle free but it will be smooth with a very subtle wave/curl to it.   Eta: mane n tail makes some of the worst hair products I've ever found in any store. I'd literally rather wash my hair with bar soap than ever use mane n tail again. They basically strip the oil from your hair (in a drying way not a cleaning way) and have chemicals involved that make your hair really rough feeling under the guise of ""volumizing."" What that ends up meaning is that your hair is so rough that it sticks to itself, almost like teasing. Worst 2 weeks of my hair life were when I used that fucking brand of shampoo and conditioner.   For detangler just dilute some conditioner in water, and store in a spray bottle like what you can get at the drugstore for $1. Alternatively, dump out the mane n tail detangler and put your mix in it."

If it's high quality (or really, just not very bad, I use and LOVE Aussie or Dove shampoos and conditioners) condition thoroughly, rinse very well, and ta-da! You might also want to start washing every other or every third day. If you're afraid of oiliness put it in a braid or something, it won't get as oily as fast if it's up."

Hair,3b5l8x,Ginger0x,11,Fri Jun 26 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"Although it seems counterproductive, you need to ""train"" your hair to be less greasy by washing it less. Dry shampoo (I use Batiste once a week now) will be your best friend while you make the transition. You WILL have to deal with it while it makes the change, but I used to be the same, and washed my hair daily. Now I'm down to once a week (and can stretch it to 1.5 if I'm lazy). I'd start by washing every 2nd day and using dry shampoo between washes. Once you notice your hair is producing less oil, stretch it out another day. You WILL feel like it's taking forever, it took me about 6 months to fully transition my hair to the weekly wash, but I've been doing it this way for almost 2 years now, and it's honestly the best. The transition period is the hardest because you will have to deal with it being oily for a little while, I recommend updo's for the times it feels like an oily mess, but it will decrease the less you wash your hair :) Good luck!"
Hair,3b5l8x,mokomaster,3,Fri Jun 26 04:43:09 2015 UTC,"It seems counterproductive - because it is. There's no such thing as ""training your hair to be less greasy"". If you're using harsh products that dry out your scalp - your body is going to respond by producing excess sebum. However, there's more circumstances to the cause of excess sebum production.   A greasy scalp is the result of an excessive production of sebum with respect to the amount required for lubricating the skin. Excess grease may obstruct the pores and contribute to bad epidermis oxygenation with resultant weakening of the hair during its growth phase.   Greasy skin is generally a hereditary issue, but there are several other factors, such as diet, hormone levels and the use of unsuitable cosmetics products that can influence its manifestation. Also humidity and hot climates can stimulate sebaceous glands to produce excess sebum.   Other factors that may influence this phenomenon are infrequent shampoo-ing, obesity and certain skin disorders, such as acne, rosacea and psoriasis.  There are supplements and nourishing substances that can be useful in alleviating this inconvenience:  ‚Ä¢ the essential fatty acids extracted from primrose include linoleic acid which is important for any kind of skin problem;  ‚Ä¢ B vitamin complexes and pyridoxine (vitamin B6); since B group vitamins, and especially vitamin B6, are necessary for the protein metabolism that enables the healing and restoring process. Biotin comes highly recommended since a lack of it is directly linked to seborrhea.  ‚Ä¢ zinc is important in the healing process since it increases immune defense  ‚Ä¢ vitamin A is important since a lack of it is directly l inked to seborrhea: it is advisable to supplement it with beta-carotene and vitamin E.  I would recommend this treatment shampoo for immediate results - along with the above.  Edit: autocorrect"

Hair,3b5l8x,mokomaster,2,Fri Jun 26 11:40:41 2015 UTC,"Like /u/mokomaster, I used to be a daily shampooer and now only shampoo once a week. The whole training your scalp to produce less oil makes absolutely no sense to me. By that logic, my skin should be crazy oily because I take 2 showers a day. (It's not. It's absurdly dry as a result.) But it has been my experience that my hair just doesn't get oily unless I try to go much longer than a week between washes."
Hair,3b5l8x,genghiskhannie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:23:36 2015 UTC,"I think that would have more to do with the ingredients in your soap/body wash as opposed to the ingredients in haircare products. Don't quote me on it though! I also have dry skin (was oily when I lived in a tropical climate, dry as anything now that I live in a very dry climate). My scalp is about the only ""normal"" skin I have now!"
Hair,3b5l8x,mokomaster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:40:00 2015 UTC,Are you taking any supplements or vitamins?
Hair,3b5l8x,withmirrors,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:41:48 2015 UTC,Kms makeover spray is the best dry shampoo I've ever used. Been using it for years and  have tried many. I used to work at a hair salon. Seriously try it. Better than the rest.
Hair,3b67ya,derpyneff,2,Fri Jun 26 08:28:50 2015 UTC,Dandruff or dry scalp? Dandruff is large flakes that are waxy and thick and needs to be treated by a doctor. Dry scalp has smaller flakes and you should use moisturizing products. Try Paul Mitchell's scalp therapy. The tea tree line is great.
Hair,3b67ya,cuntahula,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:04:21 2015 UTC,What's your routine at the minute?
Hair,3b67ya,lolarent,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:23:43 2015 UTC,Well I just shower normaly every day
Hair,3b67ya,lolarent,2,Fri Jun 26 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was a bit vague. How often do you wash your hair? Do you use very hot water? Have you changed shampoo recently? Also, at 15, you're getting a whole bunch of new hormones and they're wreaking havoc so dandruff sometimes happens because of that. Have you tried a dandruff treatment, like Head and Shoulders?"
Hair,3b67ya,averria,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:49:41 2015 UTC,I was my hair about every 2 days yes I've tried head and shoulders  but so far no results

Hair,3b698w,lolarent,2,Fri Jun 26 10:45:51 2015 UTC,"I personally think it all depends on face shape, hair type, etc. If you could post a photo, it might help!"
Hair,3b698w,fauxphantom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:57:51 2015 UTC,"Ok so I understand what you're saying completely. There is a show called Community on Hulu and one of the main characters has spiky hair with a big forehead, but sometimes he rocks it. This is Joel McHale"
Hair,3b698w,havedogwilltravel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:00:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can still wear it up in the front, but keep the hair short. If the hair is long and sticking up, it will only elongate your forehead. Keeping it short will give you the style you want, but not accentuate your forehead. For example: this is probably a better idea than this. this is also a good option."
Hair,3b698w,havedogwilltravel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, looking at that guys forehead makes mine look small xD but I'll definitely take that advice!"
Hair,3b2og5,sonicgamingftw,19,Thu Jun 25 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"If you want to keep your hair on the long side, I think that a ""man bun"" would suit your face. You could also put some mousse or product in it to bring out your natural waves. Also, try a toning or purple shampoo to tone down the brassiness of your colored hair, it will help with the contrast of your roots.   If you're looking to go short, something like this could suit your face."
Hair,3b2og5,Readys,3,Thu Jun 25 15:27:22 2015 UTC,I went with that style of haircut that you showed me in the link and I liked it so much! thank you!  I was getting compliments from my friends all day of how good it looked on me  :3 .

Hair,3b2og5,magnoolia,4,Mon Jun 29 03:44:11 2015 UTC,"If you Google Image search ""men's haircut 2015"" there's a lot of variations on a short on the side, long on top haircut that is super flattering."
Hair,3b2og5,totally_jawsome,2,Thu Jun 25 14:47:25 2015 UTC,"OT, but is that hair color natural? Looks cool AF."
Hair,3b4mif,Desillusionary,2,Thu Jun 25 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"Having a natural wave or curl in your helps. But you'd be looking for a flexible pommade.  Like free.hold from Kevin Murphy or night.rider by Kevin Murphy,  but night rider is a bit stronger, I find there's not a lot of wiggle room - however you've styled it in 30 Seconds of using it is how it's going to stay. Put a little on the tips of your fingers and upper palm, finger comb your hair towards the direction you want it to be and tada!  Hopefully that helps!"
Hair,3b4mif,cosmo14583,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!! The free.hold seems really usefull, where can i buy it btw??"

Hair,3b5m0z,frombrianna2briemode,2,Fri Jun 26 04:02:48 2015 UTC,"So a dark violet red is the goal, right? If the color you want is darker or as dark as you're existing color, this should be easy. Paul Mitchell The Color is very low in ammonia. I use it on clients that have mild color allergies and they have no reaction. If you don't want to go to a professional (go to a professional), pick up a demi permanent color. Stay out of drug stores. Go to a beauty supply. The staff should be apply to help you select the appropriate formula. Box color is a crap shoot."
Hair,3b5m0z,genghiskhannie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:33:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh if i could afford a professional, trust me I would DEFINITELY go. Sadly, its not in my budget. But yes that is the color I'm thinking of! maybe more red than violet but yes! I will definitely look into going to either a Sally's or Ulta. Yea I usually use box color but since I was on a college budget it would be $3 hair colors (those were dark times) but it was mainly for making my hair all one color. At least the Garnier one was closer to $10 (not amazingly better but somewhat better).  However the strand of hair that I dyed didn't come out too bad, so if anything I may use that. Thanks for the help!"
Hair,3b5g4g,AmeliaPondPandorica,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"Couple hours?!! The longest I've used coconut oil on my hair was 40 minutes and it was also a pain in the ass to take off, my hair looked greasy for a day. Head & Shoulders did the trick for me, or any medicating dandruff shampoo would probably work. You can also try handsoap as well. I've used warm-hot water to get the oil off and that seemed to work along with the soap/shampoo. It WILL come off!"
Hair,3b5g4g,holyostrich,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:10:55 2015 UTC,Thank you!  This specific pin said that she slept with it overnight under a shower cap!
Hair,3b5g4g,snapwest,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:07:01 2015 UTC,"I found conditioner gets it out for me. I use it on my scalp mostly, so I always wash with conditioner the way I would shampoo before doing my shampoo/condition routine as normal."
Hair,3b5g4g,PackedSatisfaction,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:13:24 2015 UTC,"I sleep with it in once every couple weeks and I haven't had any issues getting it out. Did you use the oil when it was fully melted and watery or did you just use it when it was still waxy? I find it's easier to spread through your hair and remove when it's pure liquid. Also, I use a regular sulfate free shampoo/conditioner to remove it, but if I'm scrubbing it around and I think it needs some help I'll throw in a little of my boyfriend's head and shoulders shampoo which usually fixes it real quick. How thick is your daughters hair? That could be a factor too."
Hair,3b4p09,nollynoon2,6,Thu Jun 25 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"Of course. As long as you're going darker it'll be fine, but you can't dye it lighter. If you get tired of the black and want something else you'll need to bleach it."
Hair,3b4p09,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:06:20 2015 UTC,word.
Hair,3b4p09,genghiskhannie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:34:53 2015 UTC,Black tint is serious business. Yeah. It'll show up. Make sure it's what you really want because removing black is a freaking nightmare. Unless you don't really care about the condition of you hair and/or want to spent $300+ and several hours in a salon.

Hair,3b3kcd,cosmo14583,2,Fri Jun 26 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going to a salon and having it done right the first time is hella cheaper (and kinder on your hair) than the color correction you will inevitably pay for."
Hair,3b1e2p,blondegazer,5,Thu Jun 25 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"With me, because Ive only been working a year its $120 for a full head of highlights and $40 for a cut which makes $160 but my coworkers have steeper cut prices, between 60-75$ so I dont think $200 is that bad."
Hair,3b1e2p,jerpod,5,Thu Jun 25 05:24:24 2015 UTC,woah remind me to never have my hair done in the states... I live in England and am a hairdresser. most salons that would cost ¬£70 tops. (cut and blow/style is included in the colour price here).   when I lived and worked in london its more though.
Hair,3b1e2p,World_Of_Amie,2,Thu Jun 25 11:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where these people live, but where I live it is half that much."
Hair,3b1e2p,KellyisGhost,7,Thu Jun 25 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"Stylist here, working 5 years (senior level, not master stylist) full foil HL is $150, cut is $65. Im also in newport beach, Ca. The important thing is that she does what you want, and you are happy with the service. You can ask for a newer stylist, but think about what you would be compromising."
Hair,3b1e2p,renegadebetty,8,Thu Jun 25 05:44:59 2015 UTC,This is not pricey. It's moderate range for inner city. You honestly will probably get one of the best services. On average it's 70 dollars a cut and a full highlight is 130. I'd say they may even be under estimating. It could go up with product costs.   Keep in mind you're paying for the experience of the hairstylist not just the color itself.
Hair,3b1e2p,DANICUNT,6,Thu Jun 25 04:58:37 2015 UTC,Not to mention labour. It may take someone longer to do highlights depending on technique and how they chose to process (balayage would process slower than foiled)  =)
Hair,3b1e2p,jerpod,2,Thu Jun 25 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"That seems perfectly reasonable if you feel like it's worth it. Prices tend to go 120/40 (as said elsewhere) for upscale salons at a starting level, and for an intermediate that sounds perfectly fair. If it's in your price range, go for it. Hopefully you're extremely happy!"
Hair,3b1e2p,AtlasActual,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:02:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound unreasonable,  I went for a haircut last week and paid 45 plus tip. Highlights (full) are usually 140. So it's about right."
Hair,3b1e2p,nellymed85,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:11:30 2015 UTC,It's reasonable for full highlights.
Hair,3b1e2p,jareths_tight_pants,0,Fri Jun 26 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"Nope, you get what you pay for. Certain stylists are more expensive for a reason."

I got so fed up with my long hair (taking almost an hour to dry WITH a blow dryer). Now my hair takes 2 minutes to dry. Here are a few pics: Hair progression"
Hair,3b1ioh,hatfantastic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"I have thick wavy hair too. I just cut it from long to somewhere between my ear lobes and chin, and am really happy with it. Wash, air dry, add styling wax, done. No sweaty hair on the back of my neck, no tangles. I once had it as a chin length bob, but it only looked good straight, so I think shorter is more managable. I am so happy I cut it!"

Hair,3b1ioh,megmegmegan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"Go for it! You have great cheekbones and I think a shorter style would suit you nicely. If you are worried that you won't like it, go with about shoulder length so that you can still pull your hair back when you don't feel like doing it for the day, and you can decide from there if you want to go even shorter. Also, your hair is long enough that you should consider donating it to a charity (going up to shoulder length will definitely give you the 10+ inches that charities want). I hope you love the change!"

The stylist can control how straight you want it, and you'll have to use sulphate-free products, but that's about it! It is pretty costly though ($150-$300). However, many people think it's 100% worth it."
Hair,3b128r,perryfrance,2,Thu Jun 25 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"This. Keratin treatment is 100% worth it. Seriously changed my life. You've gotta fork out for the keratin/sulfate free shampoo though to extend the life of your treatment. Try it once, you'll be amazed :)"
Hair,3b128r,TheLeftEarOfVanGogh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was expecting the cost - I think it can be more in Australia, but I've got my mind set on it :)   I figured I'd ask what the best way to achieve it was because I don't want to pay tons of money to absolutely ruin my hair!   I'll look up Brazilian Blowouts and what the process is and then ask around different salons to talk me through the procedure to see the one that matches up :)   Thank you!"

Hair,3b128r,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:04:29 2015 UTC,"Brazilian blow outs are the way to go. They aren't permanent (this is a plus). They don't always remove all the curl (also a plus) but if the picture is a pretty close representation of your texture, a Brazilian should get it pretty straight. They also seem to do the least amount of damage."
Hair,3b128r,fishincarnate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"I've had both a Brazillian Blow-out and Liscio hair straightening.   Brazillian blowouts would be my preferred method, because it doesn't damage your hair as much and you can always go back to your natural texture, but since I spend so much time in chlorinated water I needed a permanent alternative.  Liscio isn't a bad option, it didn't damage my hair much (long, virgin hair), was roughly the same price, and my hair dries very quickly and pin straight. However, it takes out a lot of the volume at first, so there's that. Also your hair will start to look iffy when your roots grow out. Other than that I love it!"
Hair,3azv5y,Igotbewbs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"Bleaching your hair will pretty much always result in a brassy/warm color, because the underlying pigments in your hair are warm. This is why you need to use an ashy toner or dye afterwards to correct the color."
Hair,3azv5y,graveyardgirl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Hi there, what I usually do when I want to get rid of brassiness is I buy Wella Toner at Sally's and it usually brings the hair to the color I want. They have all kinds of blondes.  Hope that helps.   Founder at Tressmerize :: the only hair extensions for short hair ::  http://tressmerize.com"
Hair,3azv5y,tressmerize,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"Do you have a picture of what you want? Because depending on the level you desire you may have to bleach it again. Regardless, you're going to need to tone your hair. If you want something like this, that would be bleaching your hair to a pale, pale yellow (think the inside of a banana) and using a purple based toner. If you want something like this, you need a ash toner that has some blue/green to get rid of the orange/red (It's all about the color wheel).  For the icy blonde, I would highly recommend a professional. It's very difficult to bleach your own hair that high, evenly, without some major brassy spots, without destroying your hair. For the more sandy blonde, I would just go to Sally's and have them help you pick out a good ashy toner (usually demi permanent hair color). It would probably be a level 8/9 ash or ash/ash."
Hair,3azv5y,gewwwww,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:54:20 2015 UTC,I've had good results with purple shampoos. I think it was called Shimmering Lights. I have natural blond highlights in my hair that turn brassy. A few weeks of using that shampoo turns them a really light colored blond.   For whatever it's worth.
Hair,3aza48,pear11,2,Wed Jun 24 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"I used to dye my hair a lot, and I liked Color Oops because it had no bleach and wasn't as damaging.  But, a word of warning- it can't remove lightened pigment (for example if you lighten your hair and then use color-oops it won't magically make it darker) and after you use it, your hair is going to be a lot more porous.  So if you dye your hair after using color oops, a medium blonde will most likely come out as a medium brown."
Hair,3aza48,thereturnofspongefan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"It would be easier to give advice if I knew the circumstances of your problem, but in general a color remover without bleach in it is a pretty safe choice (like Colour B4 or Color Oops)."

Hair,3b0t0w,Iratasen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard sea salt spray can help create texture and wave. Maybe try gel and finger-scrunching to get the messy look? As a girl with thin, straight hair, scrunching just looks messy, but I bet it'll work with short hair like yours. Work in sections and finish with heat. Edit - and root spray for volume if you still need it after the scrunching. Good luck!"

The lavender peekaboos would probably look great on you and they're so in at the moment, it all depends, if you want to drastically change your hair color since you are already blonde and going red means totally changing the hair color, and if you want to go back to blonde later on it will be a process. Just, something to think about."

Hair,3azjz9,thereturnofspongefan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"Keep them.  You want a nice clean cut on the strand of hair to help prevent further splitting.  It's a hell-uv-a-lot cheaper than getting an inch cut off every 6-8 weeks, which would in my professional opinion, would be the better option.  Even blunt professional scissors can cause more damage than good."
Hair,3azjz9,kommandant33,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:55:58 2015 UTC,KEEP THEM! You aren't going to get a decent pair of shears much cheaper than that. I would gently suggest to my husband that I plan to get more frequent haircuts if I couldn't keep the good scissors :)

Hair,3auurr,BelindaBerry,8,Tue Jun 23 18:28:42 2015 UTC,Try and find a salon that uses olaplex too. It greatly reduces hair damage caused by bleaching. Also manic panic have a colour called blue steel its like a bluey silver but you can always add more blue to it.

As a professional stylist, please please please go to a salon to get it done completely for the first go around. We will keep as much integrity of the hair as possible.

Gah."
Hair,3ar5v5,HandTurkeyz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:18:13 2015 UTC,I use dry shampoo regularly but my hair is blonde. It's really important to not spray this too close to your hair and really just get it on the roots and brush through.  I spray it in then work it in to my roots with my fingers.  I give it a couple minutes to soak up the oil then I brush out my hair. I believe that they also make tinted dry shampoo for dark hair but I've never looked in to it.

I shower every day - normally because my second day waves don't look so hot if my hair doesn't get wet and I hit the gym every day. I wash with silicone free conditioners on those days. Make sure you really scrub your head when you are cowashing.  Start by washing every other day. Once your hair starts getting used to it and producing less grease, add in another day. It will take awhile to change your hair, but it's worth it. Everyone's hair is different too, I could go four days without showering and my hair wouldn't appear greasy, I wouldn't even need shampoo ever again if I didn't like to start my hair over 'fresh' every week.  Best advice I have, don't give up, take it slow, and you'll see results."

It makes my hair a lot more voluminous and it feels like it's actually breathing. Idk if that makes sense. I only do this once a week. Majority of the time, I spray on the Moroccan oil spray after treatment, it detangles my hair and leaves it feeling soft and shiny, which is what I want because I end up twisting into a high bun and wake up the next morning with nice tousled/wavy hair that's extremely shiny and ""healthy"" looking."
Hair,3ar5v5,lesdeuxcroissants,2,Tue Jun 23 10:00:40 2015 UTC,What exactly is 'co-wash'ing your hair?
Hair,3ar5v5,graveyardgirl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:16:13 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of different interpretations for it. Basically it's washing with only conditioner. Some people will choose to only wash their ends. While others will use it on their scalp and scrub away (this is method I use). I apply a deep conditioner to my dry ends (middle of the ear and down) and let that sit in for half an hour to an hour, then I either shampoo or condition the rest of my hair and scalp to wash off the deep treatment and anything else I've placed on it such as oils. I thoroughly and aggressively scrub with my fingertips. Sounds funny but it helps my hair not get oily the next day. I'm not sure the exact science behind it but I figure as long as I keep my scalp as conditioned (or giving it moisture without stripping away the natural oils such as a regular sulfate shampoo would) then I'd have less oily hair the rest of the week. My hair starts showing signs of it by the 4th or 5th day. Co-washing is suppose to be a long term thing though. It helps your hair adapt but you need to be persistent with it and not fall back into washing it with shampoo. There's huge communities online that talk about their journey with co washing. I've read on forums that ladies hated their hair by the 4th week of doing this routine because their hair ended up looking weighed down and greasy to the point where a ponytail or a bun could not hide the residue from seeping out. Lol, not very pleasant at times and its not for everyone. Also forgot to mention that this co wash helps the curly hair people because certain cones in conditioners weigh it down and will make your hair smoother and the curls will be easier to manage without the excessive frizz."
Hair,3ar5v5,audreyality,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"I had this problem a few years ago, and had extremely oily hair, that was a combination of curly, wavy, and thick.  I switched to the no-poo method, which is essentially replacing your shampoo with a baking soda and water mixture to create a paste, working it into the roots, and rinsing. Then to replace my conditioner, I used about 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, mixed with about 1 1/2 cups water, to rinse out the rest of the baking soda paste.   With that I used a deep conditioning treatment overnight once a week, and it regulated the amount of oil my scalp was producing, so now I just use the Dove brand of dry shampoo before I go to sleep at night, and wash my hair roughly every 4-5 days. But the trick really is to be patient. Good luck!"

Hair,3ar5v5,sigsigsignify,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:53:54 2015 UTC,"Once a week. It took about a month of adjustment for my hair not to look super oily after a day. A bit of baby powder, cocoa powder, or dry shampoo really helps."
Hair,3ar5v5,Heatherzilla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem. I started using a volumizing shampoo by it's a 10 and then skipping a wash and using a dry shampoo by KMS. Using these products are the only way I can get away with shampooing every other day, but it works even when I go to the gym."
Hair,3ar5v5,thereturnofspongefan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:00:26 2015 UTC,I washed my hair every day for years. Now I wash it every other day but it gets slightly oily around my hairline. So I put all my hair in a high bun and then just pull out the little bit of oily hair from my hairline and wash it with a tiny drop of shampoo. It sounds weird but it takes less than a minute and it leaves my hair feeling clean. I have tried several different brands of dry shampoo and none of them work as well as this for me.
Hair,3ar5v5,Namaste666,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"I was taught to shampoo mine daily, too. Now, I just shampoo my hair once a week. I wet it everytime I shower and condition every other day."
Hair,3ar5v5,Namaste666,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"I wash mine ~twice a week, using a sulfate free shampoo and cone free conditioner. I could probably get away with washing it once a week since it doesn't really get greasy until then, but by that point my curls are frizzy and tangled. I've also done a co-wash routine before, which gives me much nicer curls, but makes my scalp feel a bit gross after a few weeks. I don't bother with dry shampoo because I don't really need it. I will stick my hair up if it's starting to look meh.   I didn't really have a terrible adjustment period because I got into the habit of not washing my hair often when it was pretty short."
Hair,3asm5d,PunkRockEtiquette,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"If you've bleached your hair so light that there's very little warm pigments left, you need to fill it to replace the warm pigments that lie under darker hair colors. You don't need to do this with red hair, as that is essentially what already lies under brunette hair. You're good to go :)"
Hair,3ar9c9,Kiahni,2,Mon Jun 22 21:31:15 2015 UTC,"How long has it been since your last color? Did you switch to another brand in the last year or so? When you color, are you applying to roots only or shaft as well?"
Hair,3ar9c9,ashhole613,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:17:47 2015 UTC,I got my hair colored about a month ago but the problem has been going on for a few months now. I was using Pantene color safe I think and now I'm using Redkin.   Edit: all over not just roots.
Hair,3ar9c9,ashhole613,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:42:32 2015 UTC,"Ok. What I think is happening to your hair is due to damage from the color, but I have a few more questions.  Are you getting your hair done at a salon, or are you doing it at home? If at home, what are you using? Are you having your color lightened (I'm doubting this is the case?) or darkened? Are you using a permanent or semi-permanent color?"
Hair,3ar9c9,ashhole613,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:37:48 2015 UTC,Always at a salon. I'm going from a dirty blonde to red. No bleaching or anything. Permanent I believe.
Hair,3ar9c9,ashhole613,2,Tue Jun 23 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely leaning towards your issue being chemical damage. For the most part, it will be permanent until it grows out and is cut off.   Have you told your stylist about the issues that are developing with your hair? She may switch you to an alternate color brand or leave it on for less time, or maybe mix your color with conditioner.   If your hair is fine, you're more prone to damage from chemicals and heat. Even with a 5 or 10 volume developer that a stylist would use with a typical permanent color is going to lead to chemical damage with repeated overlapping of color. It's just re-frying already fried hair and worsening the problem.  I color my own hair the same - from an ashy blonde to a deep red - every 6-8 weeks with a permanent color. However, I only touch up the roots every time and pull through the length every other color to minimize damage. It still feels awful for a week or two afterwards, but semi-permanent color is just unappealing for reds as it fades out very quickly, so it's not as well liked (clients think you used poor quality products because their color fades in 3 or 4 weeks).   As for what you can try, I'll toss out what I do or what I recommend to friends:   Wash your hair less. Natural oil from your scalp is good for your hair, and shampoo strips out that natural oil. If you're oily scalped like me, a good dry shampoo is a godsend. This will also extend the life of your red color substantially (it's how I stretch full color jobs to 12-16 weeks).  Try co-washing only. Most people think its for curly girls only, but its good for most hair types.  Oil on your hair. Avoid heat. Like /u/kandyxp5 said, oils are great for your hair. Coconut oil is the current favorite for the people I know who use it (I'm more of a CHI Silk Infusion or Matrix Exquisite oil girl, myself). A little goes a VERY LONG WAY.  She's also very right about avoiding heated tools and good quality products, which you seem to do already.  Deep conditioners every 3rd or so time that you wash your hair. Sally's ION Reconstructor in the red and white packet is seriously the best stuff I've ever put on my hair. ApHogee makes incredible protein treatments as well. If you go this route, do not overdo it. Protein can make hair brittle if used too frequently, but it can also be a miracle for giving structure and strength back to your hair.  Don't brush your hair when wet. Use a wide tooth comb only. Damaged hair stretches and breaks very easily, so you want to avoid worsening the problem. You know you have damage when 1) hair clumps and doesn't easily separate when wet, 2) it stretches but doesn't bounce back to its length, 3) pull a strand taut and run your finger up the strand towards your scalp - it will be rough and ""grabby"" rather than smooth (meaning the cuticles are wide open from chemical damage).    I hope this is somewhat helpful. :-/ It can take many months and lots of patience to recover your hair, but it can totally be done! Feel free to PM me if you need or want to."
Hair,3ar9c9,Kandyxp5,2,Tue Jun 23 22:00:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to type all this out. I'll try and keep all this in mind. If I go with protein would you still recommend every 3rd wash or less frequent?
Hair,3ar9c9,Kandyxp5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely less frequent if you use a protein treatment. I didn't think to note that so I'm glad you caught it! No more than every two or three weeks for protein.   The best thing I've put on my hair as far as protein goes is ApHogee's 2 step treatment. I'll warn you in advance - it. smells. horrific. Seriously like roadkill. But when I let a cosmetology school friend do my hair and she burned it out with bleach (it literally melted my hair...chunks matted and stretched to the point that it disintegrated when she rinsed it out), it saved hair that hadn't already fallen out. It was still very damaged and brittle, but not so much that it broke out. I used it once a month along with weekly deep conditioner treatments and it became totally manageable within a few months. It's not expensive. If you use it, though, do let your stylist know. IIRC, you shouldn't use it two weeks before or after a color."
Hair,3ar9c9,Namaste666,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"I would deep cleanse--like shampoo your hair multiple times but with a shampoo that has no sodium in it (marketed as organic or for keratin treated hair)--then while you're hair is still damp, take a healthy glob of olive or coconut oil and let it soak in. If you can, leave it in for a couple of hours and allow to fully dry. Go for a walk or do whatever you can get away with when you look like a grease head. Then wash all it off and condition as usual. Repeat a few times a month if you can.   Most likely its age and lessening oil production in your scalp (unless you're under 25). If not, it may be your environment --have you been outside a lot more or swimming? --or its what you're eating. Try to ingest high good fat foods like avocado and fatty fish to give you're hair some nutrients. It won't help what is already grown out but it can help new growth.   To help your hair ""heal"" do not blow dry or hot iron for a while and make sure you're not using a harsh shampoo. I'm not a fan of ""no poo"" but it may work for you. Also don't add any product to you're hair that isn't natural (edit: or you wouldn't naturally think if putting on your hair!). Anything with dimethicone or alcohol  just chuck it, it's doing more harm than good."
Hair,3ar9c9,Namaste666,2,Tue Jun 23 05:05:17 2015 UTC,I'll try what you suggested and I'll take a look at some of my newer products. I'm currently using redkin shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. I'm only so 21 so I don't think it's an age thing.
Hair,3ar9c9,mokomaster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:40:59 2015 UTC,"Yes def not age! I used redkin for a long time and although I think it's nice I think it's a bit overrated. Right now I'm using ""frames I color lover"" shampoo you may like and the conditioner I used is called ""surface"" but honestly most salon quality organic shampoos/conditioners are great you just have to find the one that works best for you. (Tip: ask your hair stylist for samples to try out different products so you're not paying for bottles) That being said, using natural oils from your kitchen has been a true hair changer for me. I have thick hair however and can use a bunch, if you have thin or very straight hair you won't need much. Always try to add more moisture after a color too, when your hair is most vulnerable. Also massage your scalp when you wash it ...it can't hurt! Good luck!"
Hair,3ar5uw,thereturnofspongefan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:04:20 2015 UTC,I just would like to share I am a hairstylist and my scissors cost 900 dollars Canadian.  Made like Japanese Samarai  swords with folded metal  they are beautifully crafted.   Scissors that are purchased at the store will never compare. If the worry is dull blades are creating split ends I highly recommend a professional cut.  So what if too much is taken off? Hair grows just like split ends will continue splitting left not trimmed . You have at least another 40 years to grow that hair back.   Beyond that just be really specific on how much has to be taken off. If more is suggested just explain that you have trust issues and would rather come back sooner then get more trimmed off. Invest in a senior stylist at a high end salon and there will be less chance of disappointment.  Keep in mind all the split ends need to be removed to grow it back without more damage.   Afterwards continue with both moisture and protein conditioning systems.
Hair,3ar5uw,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I actually already scheduled a hair salon appointment, a few minutes after posting this.  I guess in the back of my mind I already knew...  Sine you are a hairstylist, would you know: does hair look THICKER or THINNER with layers?"
Hair,3ar5uw,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:35:22 2015 UTC,Depends how the hair is styled. Curled or round brushed the hair can be more full of body and volume with some more layering. When little to no styling happens in the daily routine longer layers are always better.    I always feel longer layers are always better. But this is technically the truth.
Hair,3apo7g,charmingdot,8,Mon Jun 22 14:15:58 2015 UTC,"I have the same issue and I've always assumed the hair higher on my head is safer because it moves less. When my hair is secured down by my neck, it moves about as I turn my head through the day. The hair gets pulled and bumped much more often than when it's high in my head where my scalp stays put and only a few small pieces fall out from the back."
Hair,3apo7g,jessimacar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"You could be right... I also wonder if it's the weight of my hair and it gets pulled down more by gravity if it's not very high on my head, but I think brushing against my neck and things is probably causing it."
Hair,3apo7g,ichosethis,3,Tue Jun 23 15:36:40 2015 UTC,I don't know the cause but I have found braiding then putting the braid into a bun helps me when my hair refuses to stay up otherwise.

If I were you, I would cut off all the bottom layers. They look too thin compared with the top/front, and go with something like this until you can grow it out more. Put in a smoothing serum while it's wet and curl clumps of it around your fingers as it air dries.   BTW. I just lopped off about a foot of hair yesterday."
Hair,3aqell,poxteeth,2,Mon Jun 22 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I think I will cut it, it seems like the best option now."

Hair,3aqell,tiabear,6,Tue Jun 23 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"Go back to the salon and tell her or the manager how unhappy you are. No hair dresser should take it upon themselves to give you a cut you didn't ask for and specifically said you didn't wan t. At the very least they owe you a free cut to fix it, this is acceptable at almost any salon. If you're not happy with the cut the hair dresser should feel obligated to fix it. Waiting a month to see if it grew on you is helpful too.  I'm sorry man, I've gotten terrible cuts in the past too and the nice thing is that it always grows back..."
Hair,3aqell,tiabear,3,Mon Jun 22 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"This might sound kind of damaging but if you straighten it and then make loose curls using a 1"" wand might hide the layers.   You could also continuously wear it in updos if it bothers you that much."
Hair,3aqell,Dahlia_Dee,2,Mon Jun 22 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"I am currently wearing it in updos. All the time. It's starting to annoy me just as much as the hair itself. Some layers are short so they fall out easily as well, I end up with hundreds of bobby pins in my hair haha.  The good part is that it's summer, and so hot in my office I need it tied up just to stay cool.   I have not attempted to curl it yet, to be honest. It might be worth the shot!"
Hair,3aqell,Dahlia_Dee,2,Mon Jun 22 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"Try it, just make sure you have a heat protectant. If you're not an every day hair washer, this might be your solution! Maybe curling your extensions and your regular hair the same way will hide the short layers"

Hair,3arofn,Yadda_yadda_yadda,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"Like they said, have someome help you. Bleach is so much different than hair coloring. It gets really dry (once it's on your head) and hard to work with, and then it can be difficult to see any spots you missed. When I tried to do it myself, I thought, well I can just feel the spots I missed. Nope. It's so much easier if you get someone to help!   With mixing, follow the directions. Mix until it's like a thick paste. The first time I bleached my hair, I followed the directions and things went well, aside from missing some vital spots. The third time, more recently, I thought I knew what I was doing, didn't measure exactly, and then put too much developer in it. It took longer to process, and I actually gave up and threw out the bleach halfway through because it was taking too long and I didn't want to damage my hair even more.   -Advice from someone who loves to experiment, but I'm no professional."

Most of the ones I have tried--ESPECIALLY that Moroccan oil treatment-- just weighed my fine hair down in a very unpleasant way. I know you asked for some science to back what works, and I don't have that.  I can, however, tell you that Organix renewing argan oil (just a dime sixe amount applied to damp or wet ends) and Aussie hair insurance (sprayed on everything from chin down) have really improved the health and strength of my hair. I just got my hair cut for the first time in two years (which was very, very bad of me) and my hair dresser was very impressed with how good my ends looked.

If you do buy one make sure you get a good quality one - human hair or very nice synthetic.  I really suggest not buying one online - it's amazing how different they can look in person.  I'm not sure about men's wigs, but there are decent ladies ones out there below $200 where I live.  Definitely worth looking around if it's an option for you.

Marines are more strict, Navy/Air Force less so.  Know your regs and be prepared to defend your choice. Many regs are vague and say something like ""a naturally occurring hair color."" Without seeming racist, someone may use the fact that your are Asian to argue that lighter colors ""aren't naturally occurring"" for you.  (I put blonde  highlights in my very dark hair and my leadership made me dye it back to my natural shade despite my argument with the regs.)   I'm not trying to be Debbie Downer, but beauty is a fine line in the military.  Many of us join at a time when our friends are experimenting with cuts, color, and cosmetics while we can only play with it on weekends (if we are lucky). As for your hair color, I'd go as natural as possible until you get out.  It's an easy (if not fun) way to save money."

My advice would be to first use a color remover without bleach (like Colour B4 or Color Oops). These are non-damaging and can give great results (I've used them countless times and never had a problem). After that you can bleach if your hair is still not light enough.  I'd recommend using a semi-permanent dye from a brand like Manic Panic or La Riche Directions for the red, as these are non-damaging and give very bright results."

You can repeat the process essentially as many times as you'd like, but because of all the rinsing you need to do it can be drying and it's best to give your hair a breather and some deep conditioning inbetween. As for how many times you need to do it, you're just gonna have to see how much it pulls out and judge from that. You might only need to do it once, in my experience it works pretty well on reds."

Do you think it will still work well? And do you know what deep conditioning treatment I could do in between these processes? Preferably using coconut oil, as I already have some and I hear it works very well."

I also have light/medium brown hair naturally and started out with a copper color."

Hair,3aj6tf,P_as_a_Variable,3,Sat Jun 20 18:38:44 2015 UTC,Try an Olaplex treatment. It's amazing for damaged hair.
Hair,3aj6tf,allaboutthecock,3,Sat Jun 20 21:26:47 2015 UTC,I second the olaplex. Most salons charge around $15 for applications and can be added to bleach or done on its own. It's a bond strengthener.
Hair,3aj6tf,sammylue,3,Sun Jun 21 16:52:19 2015 UTC,Agreed. You can do stand alone treatments in a salon or buy the retail to use at home. I'm a hairstylist and I've never seen anything like olaplex. It really is a game changer in the industry.

There is a shampoo, conditioner, and leave in treatment, much like Bosley and all the others. We've carried many different things in my salon for hair loss and we try them all ourselves to see what works and why doesn't. Bosley was pretty good, made a difference, but not a huge one. Awaken blows Bosley out of the water. All of my clients that use it have seems extreme results. Definitely look it up."

Hair,3acpqf,Zombiebelle,3,Fri Jun 19 01:15:32 2015 UTC,I usually try to ask what they would prefer. If I am doing a huge cut change (more that 5 inches off) I like to check it pin straight for any missed hairs or hairs that are out of place.
Hair,3acpqf,iheartzombiecats,2,Fri Jun 19 01:36:48 2015 UTC,I wonder the same thing.  I am a stylist and sometimes I wonder if I'm doing it wrong because I don't really curl the hair after I color it.  Like Zombiebelle I like to see it straightened or in it's natural form to see how the color actually reacts to their normal hair texture.  I think it's just to gussy it up sometimes?  I don't know.
Hair,3acpqf,woahthereareladies,3,Fri Jun 19 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"Please don't think you're doing it wrong. Everyone has their own way. As long as your client is happy with what you do and you are happy with what you do, that's what matters."

One of my favorite products is called straightener from enjoy. It doesn't straighten your hair, but really helps with frizz without making your hair crunchy. If you were my client, I would have you using a good shampoo and conditioner like enjoy luxury or redken frizz dismiss, Moroccan oil, and enjoy luxury. Along with a mask maybe once or twice a week. A smoothing treatment might help also. There's one out there called uberliss that is awesome. Way better than Brazilian blowout or keratin complex. Not a lot of people know about it so it may be harder to find a salon that does it, but they have a website and Instagram that may be able to point you in a direction. Hope this helps."

Hair,3af39n,TheCuriousWanderer,2,Fri Jun 19 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"Hair product is key, get a pomade. Put a quarter size amount in your hand and really rub them together to warm it all up. Then run your fingers through your hair, putting it all over. Really work it in, pushing it all different directions. Then when it feels evenly distributed direct it into the direction you want it to go. If you do this on wet hair, it will give you a softer look, the water in your hair diffuses the product a bit. If you start on dry hair, you will get more hold."

Hair,3ade9d,KurnelMustard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"First off, dreads take a while to fully dread and remain tightly compact. Your hair is going to be frizzy and have a lot of flyaways at first, there's no getting around that. My suggestion is to wear ""fake dreads"" for a while and see how your school reacts and to see if you like them. By fake dreads I mean backcombing your hair in small sections so it'll look dreaded. Here's a tutorial."
Hair,3ade9d,MyKindOfLullaby,0,Sat Jun 20 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"Dreadlocks are pretty wretched on white people, so I hope you're not white. And they look realllllllyyyy crappy for a long time at first (like for at least a year) if you have white hair. So if you're trying to get around having long hair, that is going to be the wrong way to do it. Because not only will your hair be long, but it'll be a rat's nest.   You could always claim to be Rastafarian? They are encouraged to leave their hair uncut. As are Sikh and Jews that follow Kabbala. If it's not for religious reasons, most people won't even hear it."
Hair,3ade9d,sailornibiru,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"That sounds like it could actually work, I mean, they'll probably call up my parents to find out if Im actually a rastafarian, but I guess it could work for a bit.   As for the other stuff, yeah Im white ;3 I think you may have misunderstood a bit? ""So if you're trying to get around having long hair, that is going to be the wrong way to do it"" Im trying to grow long hair! Not get around it! :D And yeah I know that they become a rats nest, but Ive only got one year left of school, one year of growing my hair, and from what I understand if I use the backbrush method, then it only takes a couple months to start looking like dreads? So I'd start the dreading at the start of the summer, and by the time I start university, they should look, somewhat normal?"
Hair,3ade9d,sailornibiru,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:40:30 2015 UTC,"I actually tried dreading my hair when I was 16. And I washed it with bar soap to really dry it out so it'd become super tangly, back-combed, and rolled the dress between my palms with a teeny tiny bit of bee's wax to hold them together. They are seriously high maintenance. And you have to tie them up when you sleep so they don't fall apart. And the roots are a nightmare to take care of by yourself. I'm Mexican, so my hair is actually a bit more coarse and it was still really a lot of upkeep. White hair doesn't naturally loc like black hair. So it really takes some dedication and looks like crap for a really long time. I gave up because it's really hard to get a job with nasty looking hair.   If you have short hair now, it'll take a really long time to get long dreads. Because when you back-comb your hair, you lose a lot of length. We're talking like a couple years of growing your hair out. I had hair a bit past my shoulders and when I put them in, my hair length was only about to my chin."
Hair,3adccf,Rustylane,2,Fri Jun 19 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"This is definitely not something I would recommend you do yourself. The easiest and cheapest thing would be to go get is lightened professional in a salon so the ombr√© is soft and has a nice grow out. Skip the blowdry and all that and it'll probably be cheaper. Professionals know how to work with lightener and will generally keep the integrity of your hair. Then you can go home and add color to it yourself and keep it up. Green is a hard color and turns muddy real quick. You can use purple shampoo or add a light purple over your hair when that happens to make it more teal again. I really, really recommend getting the lightening done professionally. I spend the majority of my time in the salon fixing botched colors to give my clients colors like this. It's a lot cheaper in the long run to just have a professional do the lightening first."

Hair,3ab8p5,GoldieLox9,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Ok number one, what kind of stylist is saying that a box color is better than what they have at the salon?!? Insane.   And she's washing you because she used bleach for your highlights... can't trust bleach to fully just rinse out on its own, like color. Gotta make sure there's no bleach lingering.   Some stylists shampoo after coloring, some don't. I like to make sure the hair is clean before coloring that way when I don't wash out color, their hair isn't dirty after getting fresh color. Looks terrible. And the myth of ""dirty hair is better before coloring"" is so 30 years ago, think about it. Why would we leave oil, build up, products, ect. on the hair when we are trying to penetrate through the hair as best we can to ensure color longevity and performance? Makes no sense why you would create any sort of barrier. Sure color now a days aren't formulated like they were 30 years ago, but take a chance?   As for doing highlights of any sort or of lifting at home, I honestly do not recommend it and have no tips. No one likes orange hair. Maybe find a more affordable stylist?"
Hair,3ab8p5,Namaste666,0,Thu Jun 18 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. In addition, if your hair is already blonde and you get any color on the blonde it WILL turn green. Not like a little tint, I'm talking fucking green. So you'll likely end up with orange roots and lime green blonde and then you'll pay wayyyy more to fix it. I've had to fix these situations a number of time and it's not worth it. When my clients are in your situation, I offer them options to make it cheaper and easier on them. Skip the blowdry. Maybe just get a crown weave a couple times then go back to a partial once in a while."
Hair,3ab8p5,Shuriesicle,0,Mon Jun 22 06:03:06 2015 UTC,"only problem is you can't foil your h air yourself the get that beautiful blonde. Box dye usually comes with a 20 or 30 volume developer....your stylist customizes how strong the bleach should be to your hair (darkness, undertone, target blonde). I've had clients go to box then come back and say help! Ask for a partial head instead of a full, that way the bits everyone sees will be taken care of. If she uses goldwell, ask about the 5 minute blonde - I've got a lot of my clients on this as a step to keep the longevity of their foils, it's around 30 bucks"
Hair,3ab8p5,cosmo14583,2,Fri Jun 19 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"What about if I go back to the box color I used a decade ago, the same shade and all? Presumably that wouldn't turn my hair green or anything, if I only do the roots  I know what you mean about doing half highlights, but I really need to stop spending this money from my savings. As much as I hate to go to my natural color I may need to. I was hoping there is an at home solution for easing from full blown salon locks to affordable (for me)."
Hair,3ab8p5,cosmo14583,3,Fri Jun 19 03:00:31 2015 UTC,"Ya you could go back to the box that's close to your natural or darker.

They look halfway decent (at best) the first day, then as soon as your hair starts growing back out it looks stupid as hell, especially when it's done in front of the bangs.

Hair,3a59dw,Define_It,0,Wed Jun 17 14:16:21 2015 UTC,"They look fine, it really depends on how well its done and what your natural hair line looks like. If it's done correctly it takes about a week for it to start to lose its edge, not for it to look like garbage but just for it to start noticeably growing back, and barbers who do linings charge less if you you just want it touched up and not a whole hair cut.    It's just incredibly impractical   Not for anyone who can afford to go to a barber 2 or 3 weeks and spend $5-$10 or you can even buy liners and learn how to do it your self. It's slightly more difficult than shaving.   any good barber   Literally anyone working in a black barber shop or anyone who knows how to cut black hair at all knows how to and does linings on a regular basis. It's something every single barber is suppose to learn how to do in school."

All it takes is a few millimeters of growth for it to start looking bad.   Literally anyone working in a black barber shop or anyone who knows how to cut black hair at all knows how to and does linings on a regular basis.   Yeah, typically on a black person's hair. This is an entirely different head of hair with different look and texture, and is part of the reason it looks bad here. So let me rephrase: any good barber can differentiate between hair types and know what techniques will work for some and not at all for others. This barber failed to do so."

Define bad, just because it doesn't look like you got it cut today doesn't make it look bad , again, unless it wasn't done well in the first place. You're suppose to taper, line, and then brush what hair you can over the line and cut again. A few mm of growth only fucks it up if you didn't taper it very low to being with or you skipped or only did the last step once.    Yeah, typically on a black person's hair   Yea because black people typically keep their hair low enough or want the temples tapered regardless for a lining to work. It's a matter of length way more than it is texture. Most hair styles/cuts that non-blacks wear usually simply don't make sense or look good with a lining. Under cuts are not one of those styles.   http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lUQSXBXFsAtFj1MJCSmuXg/o.jpg  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/32/ea/a7/32eaa799d204921115c9178d98a922b0.jpg  http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/34668759/451056782.0.jpg  The dude got an undercut, a lining works just fine.

Hair,3a1sv4,ggrose33,10,Tue Jun 16 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"If you go to a doctor you should have them test your thyroid. Mine is the main reason over 70% of my hair falling out --- make sure you ask for the following blood tests (which should be covered by your insurance, but make sure just in case): TSH test T4 tests T3 test Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test Antithyroid antibody test, also called the thyroid peroxidase antibody test (TPOab)  Also, other contributing factors to my hair loss as well as brittle nails and dry skin are certain deficiencies --- I have Vitamn D, B12, and iron deficiency  So make sure you ask your doctor for a Vitamin D, B12, and iron blood test as well.  And while you are at it, ask for a complete CBC blood panel. It can test your blood clotting time, the production of blood cells, and any blood cell abnormalities or possible infections in your body.  Since I have multiple health issues, I have to have these tests done every 3 months, but for a normal person, having these done annually is a great way to help prevent health issues from happening or getting worse....  I am not a doctor, but I definitely suggest you getting those tests listed above, done (any girl actually.) A lot of people don't know that Vitamin D deficiency can cause major problems down the line and a lot of people don't know they suffer from a lack of essential vitamins; because it's usually never brought up to doctors and some insurances only cover that kind of testing only once a year. Also, beware that a lot of insurances don't cover vitamins unless you have a very severe deficiency, and it will have to be written off by a doctor. Otherwise, you will have to pay out of pocket for vitamins.  Because of misdiagnoses and doctors writing me off, my problems have gotten horribly worse and has helped in making me disabled, so if you can, and its covered, please please please go get those blood tests done. You don't want to end up like me..... If anything, it will give you peace of mind that you checked."
Hair,3a1sv4,toasty_feet,2,Tue Jun 16 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"Hey thank you so much for your comment!! I had a blood panel done Oct'14, bc of my poor eating habits and always feeling weak. I know my vitamin D levels were normal, they tested for thyroid issues and that was clear too from what i recall, and I don't think I was anemic. I should double check the results.   I know you said you lost a signifcant amount of your hair, and I'm incredibly sorry. I've been in tears for two days, and I feel like the stress I feel now is going to perpetuate it. Do you know what kind of doctor I should visit?"
Hair,3a1sv4,Ocarinakidkatie,2,Wed Jun 17 00:32:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would try going to see another doctor for a second opinion just in case. An internal specialist could be good, but time restraints can hinder valid concerns being addressed. But for me, personally, I've always had more luck with physician assistants and ANP's (nurse practitioners.) They usually have more time to spend with you so that way you don't feel pressured to get every concern to them in the 10-15 minute time frame that doctors/specialists usually give you for your visit. They can do everything a normal physician does except surgical procedures, but are usually more friendly/personable and can spend more time with you. I would look for primary care provider reviews on google for your area. Also, ask a circle of friends, they can point you in the right direction of a doctor they've had good experiences with.   If you go back to the doctor again, make sure you take this list of blood work (posted above) and ask if you can have them done again.   Sometimes blood work comes out wrong, it's rare but it can happen, so double checking isn't a bad thing. Also, some doctors omit some of the very necessary thyroid testing on bloodwork <usually they pick one and no more than that> The thing is, there are different tests with varying sensitivities that other tests cannot pick up, so it's good to have ALL those thyroid tests done.   For the longest time (15 years) I was told I didn't have thyroid problems and didn't know there were several tests I could have had done <they kept doing one test over and over again> When I finally found a doctor that would listen to me (a ANP and a PA) they discovered not only did I have severe hypothyroidism (through those multiple tests listed above), but they discovered that I have 5 cysts on my thyroid all measuring 3 CM in diameter.   You are your own best self advocate. So if you think something is wrong, listen to your body and keep trying to find a doctor that will actually listen to you. Make sure you tell them all your concerns with your hair, including anything else that may be bothering you. Any fatigue, rashes, dry skin (just as examples.) Make a list of everything that may be a concern; including little things. Even if it might be stress, lack of sleep, lack of vitamins, or a thyroid problem, make sure you keep at it until you find a doctor that will listen to you and provide you with proper education and instruction in finding out what may be wrong. A good doctor will rule out what it isn't to find out what it is..... and tell them you had some blood work done back in October, but you aren't sure exactly what was and wasn't ordered. If you can, get a copy of those blood work results and take it with you on your next visit. A good PA', nurse, doctor, will go over those results with you and explain what they mean in detail so you can have a better understanding of what they mean.  If your current doctor doesn't do that, yah I would definitely go find another one. (which in your case it doesn't sound like current doctor isn't doing much for you.)  Thanks for your well wishes! I've kinda accepted my hair loss for the long run, not only that, its turning pure silver now (I'm only 38 and almost pure silver now. So near bald and pure silver, ugh what a combo right?) Yah, it can be really depressing, but I did find a way to receive some solace in feeling feminine/youthful again. I've bought 2 wigs. I never thought I ever would, but I did (you know all the taboo about wigs and how only old ladies wear them yada yada yada .....boy was I wrong about that/apparently there is like a whole wig culture) .....you know I bet there is even /r/wigs on here somewhere.... and you know what? They are a lot of fun. If you ever consider getting a wig, I suggest a synthetic, front lace wig, by Vivica Fox. Even though the models for the wigs are African American, they are not specific for African American women.... Caucasians, Asians, Indian (just noticed you said you are of Indian decent <duh>), w/e your race is; can definitely wear these wigs as well. You can style it, have a hairdresser trim it, wash it, put it up in a ponytail etc. They are very affordable too! (About $30-$60 a wig.) They can last anywhere from 6 months to a year! <Hell getting a hair cuts during the year cost more than the wigs.....>  I was really apprehensive wearing them out in public, but so far no one has noticed I've been wearing a wig at all, and I can play with styles and colors that I would have never thought I'd be able to wear. They are fairly easy to style and actually make me feel prettier....The dream of having straight hair from a wig came true lol. (I have super tight curls, so a straight hair wig is like a dream.) They have varying styles/lengths/colors of wigs. I also got one that looks like how my hair used to, so some old friends don't even have a clue my hair has fallen out because of this wig. Feel free to look up Vivica Fox wig review on youtube. The girls on there will tell you how to wear them and give you honest opinions on them. They may also suggest another wig line. I spent hours looking at the videos as they are quite mesmorizing."

Hair,39xbqe,APrinterNamedPrince,2,Mon Jun 15 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"THIS! I'd say even go with the 2"" barrel curling iron if your hair is truly that long. Once you take the hair out of the curling iron, gently pull on the end to loosen the curl even more."
Hair,39xbqe,MissVictoriaE,3,Mon Jun 15 18:43:00 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a wig in the photo.  Is  your hair naturally light? And what wave pattern does it form on its own? If you have curly hair you are likelier to be able to achieve this look. If your hair is straight, thick and heavily lightened you may have a harder time. I would recommend a roller set, you are likely to need hot curlers because wet-setting your hair would probably never work, if you have a lot of hair.  The problem with long hair is that gravity tends to pull on the wave pattern and straighten it out- particularly near the top. Try applying a light-weight, strong-hold product to towel dried hair (AKA the hair is still damp, but not soaking wet).  I like using the CHI Helmet Head hairspray. I apply it to towel dried hair, blow-dry, and then pin-curl my hair. However my hair is fine textured and above shoulder length. Goodluck."

Hair,39xbqe,Finchicus,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"If you're styling a wig check whether it is synthetic or human hair. It could even be a mixture of the two. You don't want to apply heat to a synthetic, non-heat-resistant wig. It could melt and ruin both wig and tools.  If your wig is heat resistant you may be able to pass a flat iron or curling iron over it and quickly roll and pin it into the shape you like. Let it cool in that shape. The longer you can keep it like that before you need to wear it, the better it will retain that shape."

Which is good news for you because you don't want to do anymore damage to your dyed hair.   Shower at night and towel dry your to damp. Squirt your hair with styling product and finger comb your hair. While its still damp, separate with hair along your part into two large sections and twist them up into two buns, Baby Spice/Princess Leia style. If you have super thick hair do it a little bit loose so it dries all the way through. Take out in the morning and hurray! Loose natural waves.   I have thick waste length hair and this is my go to.

Hair,39xbqe,audreyality,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:37:34 2015 UTC,Honestly it looks more like a natural wave pattern to me.  The easiest thing to try is twist sections of hair and loosely braid them to hold them in place.
Hair,39xbqe,khatfield79,9,Mon Jun 15 16:33:18 2015 UTC,Really? I think it looks like a wig.
Hair,39vpvv,kerwin152,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:43:54 2015 UTC,I know that you said that you couldn't get a good picture of it but one would really help. Without actually seeing it I would suggest getting a trim to make sure all the dead ends are gone and then try using a product that will help with the curls. I use something called R&B by Lush. My hair isn't curly but it is frizzy and R&B helps tame it to look like I actually did something to it.
Hair,39vpvv,austindawn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:10:08 2015 UTC,"here: http://i.imgur.com/HB0R7Hw.png  After washing it once its dry its even worse, since theres not even much curling, so its just a shapeless dome"
Hair,39vpvv,thrownormanaway,2,Mon Jun 15 14:16:48 2015 UTC,"Your solidly in the awkward stage. Tough it out. Your texture is actually good, not coarse, and when is longer you'll have full round curls I reckon. Just tough it out. Don't brush your hair dry. I've found brushing before a shower, and finger combing to get the loose hairs, so its not tangled when you wash and condition works great. Then gently towel dry and let it air dry. Resist the urge to finger comb it, you'll break up the curls."

Hair,39v3bc,kdcook2014,4,Mon Jun 15 01:17:40 2015 UTC,"She most likely needs to use more shampoo than most people and massage her scalp with it, then rinse it for much longer, while moving her hair around to rinse it thoroughly. This is probably more important than the shampoo itself."
Hair,39v3bc,H-ly,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"good advice! also, choose something PH balanced so the PH is right for your scalp and hair.     if you need more than that, you can add a few drops of tea tree oil into your palm with the shampoo. it's cheap at trader joe's here. know that tea tree oil is super thin, not the texture one would think oil is, so be careful to add just a few drops."

Hair,39v3bc,isleshocky,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend I Love Juicy at Lush, actually! Or Rehab. Both are heavy in citrus which will clarify the oil and dissolve the flakes. Rehab has olive oil in it too to help keep the hair moisturized (it won't leave her hair greasy).  Often, oily and dandruffy scalps are sensitive scalps and they're overreacting to something in the current shampoo."

Hair,39v7ki,haloola23,2,Mon Jun 15 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"If you don't want a bright colour I would say (and someone professional won't like this but I do it myself a lot) get a blonde box dye, not a bleach, you don't want to bleach, just to rough your hair up a little bit so that the colour will take better, and it will lighten a tiny little bit, then dry it and use a pink direct dye, for a colour like this I've always like Punky Colours ""Rose"", and plop that on all over. The longer you leave it the better it will soak in.   If you dont want to use the box dyes at all, wash with dish soap first to really get all the oils off your hair then dry it and dye it.   Any other questions let me know. Have fun!"
Hair,39v7ki,ImSortofAlive,2,Mon Jun 15 08:42:22 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest something like Manic Panic Fuschia Shock for the dye, it's pretty pigmented and will show up on dark bases. Another good one is La Riche Directions in Dark Tulip (though it leans a little purple), which I have used over brown hair myself with good results. If you put it over the color you have now it should be pretty vibrant in the sun, and subtle under most other lights - just like you want. :)"
Hair,39v7ki,graveyardgirl,2,Mon Jun 15 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"For the initial dye I would get professional help, I often go the beauty school in town and it usually costs about 20$. Red requires a lot of maintenance so be prepared for that. I recommend doing a gloss at home in between colours. Red has been the hardest colour to maintain for me, but it is also the hardest colour to get out of your hair so keep that in mind. Basically if you're a poor college student like myself, just remember that red requires A LOT of maintenance, like every 3-4 weeks not washing your hair everyday."

I've been putting coconut oil in my hair everyday since then and I'm going to get a trim soon because ends are damaged. My hair feels a bit rough at the ends, but I attribute that to just bleaching it and that I have split ends.

Hair,39vvop,ImSortofAlive,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sounds about normal. It definitely not RUINED. See how it feels after you get back from the salon, and if you have the funds you might want to pick up some good shampoo while you're there"

Hair,39uvzn,ambird138,2,Mon Jun 15 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, man. A toner will be a game changer for you. See, when you are bleaching the hair, you are battling the hair's natural remaining pigment which goes from red to red-orange all the way up to baby chick yellow, haha. You'll never get that white platinum look with just bleach, you have to neutralize that yellow that's left. That is where a toner becomes your new best friend. Get yourself to a beauty supply store asap, buy a bottle of Wella Color Charm T18 toner and 20 volume developer, and pick up some gloves and a color brush if you don't have those already. Mix one part toner to two parts developer and apply roots to tips. The box will tell you to process it for an obscene about of time, which you can do if you are okay if your hair goes a little lavender-y, but realistically about 10-20 minutes should do the trick.  It will make a huge difference. Promise!"
Hair,39uvzn,ambird138,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:42:29 2015 UTC,Can you reapply different toners? The store was out of T18 so I got 12A/frosty ash but now I'm too purple for my taste. Can I use another toner later on to fix this and get closer to an all-around platinum?
Hair,39tv67,aimeenew,2,Sun Jun 14 18:49:30 2015 UTC,Squeaky green and jumping juniper from LUSH are great.   It really depends on why you need a good clean though? Extra oil? Dirt? Buildup? The remedies will all be different.
Hair,39tv67,HappySmash,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:41:52 2015 UTC,Extra oil & build up :(
Hair,39tv67,HappySmash,2,Mon Jun 15 01:52:55 2015 UTC,"I'd defs go with jumping juniper then. It's a solid (use it like a bar of soap), and it lasts about 80 washes (approx 1 L of liquid shampoo).   Juniper oil will help clarify the scalp and dry up extra oils, while the lavender will help soothe any irritations and help balance your natural oil production over time.   It's worth a look!"
Hair,39uyhx,MrsLabRat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:32:06 2015 UTC,"Mine is classic (or maybe a little below), and I wear it up most of the time. I oil with pure argan oil or coconut oil after washing, when it's still damp, and I don't blow-dry. I wash it once a week or maybe once a fortnight if I'm feeling lazy, and don't get haircuts more often than six months. Aside from that, not much advice! Silica pills seem to help it grow faster, and definitely have an effect on my nails."
Hair,39uyhx,nitedula,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"This is kind of similar to what I do except at night I wear it down/braided and I've found that leave-in conditioner works a little better for me than oils. After making that switch, I've found <10 split ends in almost a year. I used to get them constantly. I don't use a dryer and only use elastic hair ties for the end of my braid(s) at night. I've found quite a bit less breakage after switching to just sticks, pins, or spin-pins. I'll also wash it 1-2x/week as that seems to work best for me as far as scalp oiliness etc."

Hair,39ubma,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:44:53 2015 UTC,Silver hair is incredibly difficult to achieve on the first lifting process even with slightly lighter ends. If the stylist promised silver the first go around you are entitled to a redo service. Most salons are super accommodating especially with a polite call back.   If the stylist didn't promise you silver I feel that you should still call and explain it wasn't the color you had imagined. Even mention the green isn't something your comfortable with and plans can be made. Just try to be understanding and patient. The stylist wants you to have silver hair it's just hard to say what your own hair wants to do.   Was this done in Alberta? ( really random question )
Hair,39ubma,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"The good thing is he is willing to redo it. But my main concern is just how damaging bleach and toner can do to my hair. Other than that, my hair still has a green tint as I said above, is it best to let the colour fade before redoing it? Also, I just bought some purple shampoo and conditioner. Just wondering if that helps or not. And nope, it was done in Vancouver."
Hair,39ubma,abszmak,2,Mon Jun 15 04:49:40 2015 UTC,If he uses olaplex  again there shouldn't be a problem. It doesn't matter how faded the green is before he does it because it's going to lift out.    I really wouldn't recommend violet shampoo and conditioner because the blue can increase the muddiness of the color. You need your hair relifted. Even if it fades it won't be a silver color until lifted to a pale yellow.
Hair,39ubma,DANICUNT,-1,Mon Jun 15 06:18:16 2015 UTC,"Your stylist seems to have derped. You should see if you can get them to fix it for free or a discount. The hair in the left image seems to have been lightened to a WHITE blonde (level 2 or 1) (not yellowish) and then toned over with silver ashyness and blnded with the brunette. Maybe you weren't clear with your stylist about what you wanted?  Also after you get it fixed DEFINITELY use ph balanced violet shampoo, gray colors are like lavender in that they want to go brassy soooo bad, dont let it.  Edit: I said level 1 or 2; I meant level 9 or 10."

Hair,39tuz0,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:50:35 2015 UTC,It depends if you do too much I feel you risk making your hair color look really feminine (unless this is the goal) something highlighted would look more masculine. Softly highlighted. If you do too much it's also a lot of maitenence.
Hair,39s0fc,Laurennicoleb,3,Sun Jun 14 04:47:47 2015 UTC,Depending on your hair texture will determine what tools you will use to style you hair to look like this. If you can blow dry your hair well by your self a round brush will work if you use a technique that will set a wave in your hair. If you are not the best with a blow dryer (which don't worry if your not) try using a curling wand. Start by putting mousse in your hair and then blow dry. Then use a heat protecting spray and curl your hair away from your face with the curling wand. When you are done spray a little dry shampoo all over to add texture. Feel free to ask me questions if you need some more pointers!
Hair,39s0fc,BlowDryStyles,4,Sun Jun 14 08:07:17 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're talking about styling and not the cut, I would go with blow drying it over a round brush, if you're hair is particularly flat use a dry shampoo over a mousse for volume, bumble and bumble makes one that works really well for this look.

Hair,39l2sc,ComiendoBizcocho,11,Fri Jun 12 14:04:19 2015 UTC,I think the brush with holes is mainly used during blow drying so that the air can pass through the brush.
Hair,39l2sc,PenelopeWins,5,Fri Jun 12 15:10:12 2015 UTC,The holes are vents to allow air to pass through for faster drying.

Hair,39l2sc,sudo_grep,3,Fri Jun 12 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"they are, but the brush with no holes is usually used once the hair is already dry like for the flip or bangs.  I use the one with holes when my hair is fresh out the shower wet, and the other to finish it."
Hair,39l2sc,baba_banana,2,Fri Jun 12 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"Each brush has its own purpose while blowdrying. The one on the left usually helps target and treat frizz, while the one on the right is used for smoothing already frizz-less hair. The base where the bristles come from is also made of different material. This can help with the type of blow dry that you're looking to accomplish. If you have fine hair or thin hair (or just not a lot of hair, but its not curly), I'd suggest the one on the right. Anything else, and the one on the left is for you."

Hair,39l2sc,baba_banana,2,Fri Jun 12 18:16:55 2015 UTC,Something else to add. The one on the left is a wood base it wont pull heat in. The one the right is metal for a reason. It is creates a sort of roller. The metal will heat up and hold onto it. If you want soft waves you can blow dry your hair. During that your brush will heat up. Leave your hair wound around the brush. Let is cool or use your cool shot button and it will create the wave.  That's why brush size will change the volume and style of your hair. In beauty school I was taught that your brush is essentially a curler.

Hair,39l2sc,ViralHEX,2,Fri Jun 12 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"The one with holes is used for blow drying, it helps the air circulate throughout the barrel so the hair dries quicker."
Hair,39l2sc,B00TYMASTER,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"The holes, while allowing air to pass through for a quicker blowdry time, add volume as the most important aspect. Air passes through so when you wrap the hair around the barrel, you create lift and volume at the root. The brush without the holes is used more for taming frizz, smoothing, and shaping hair's movement."

Hair,39n9ck,bullwinkle394,3,Fri Jun 12 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"I've grown out my hair from an A-line bob all the way to my hips. In the early stages, I was putting it up a lot. I didn't trim the front to be even with the back until it got a bit past my shoulders. I didn't feel like the difference in length was too obvious for me. I gradually trimmed the front bit by bit to let the back grow out. If you don't want to lose the front length, you could trim your monthly growth in the front to let the back catch up. Then you could trim all the length so the layers are gone. This is what I ended up doing."

Hair,39ho6d,Seabass182,9,Thu Jun 11 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"Barber here. If I were you, I would get some good quality product. If you're cool with less shine, I would recommend American Crew's Fiber. Rub say a bit the size of your pinky nail in your hands and then distribute in through your hair while it's damp, and blow dry it into the rest of your pomp. You could just push it over with your fingers while you blow dry it if you get good product. It should certainly hold it with the rest of your hairstyle, and give you good hold for the rest of your day, though you may be able to see that those pieces are shorter. Can't really tell by this picture, but it just might blend really well."
Hair,39ho6d,floodthesun,2,Fri Jun 12 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"So I went to the barber and asked for a touch up. He end up shearing the whole front of my pomp off. It wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't so far past my hairline. No matter how much product I use, it sticks up.  Is there anyway to fix this?"
Hair,39ho6d,Wylard,3,Thu Jun 11 19:56:57 2015 UTC,maybe use a flat brush and hit it with a blowdryer? Not real sure.

Hair,39ho6d,Enigmutt,2,Thu Jun 11 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"im not super familiar with brands, but what i usually use for really controlled pomps, is a high hold mousse (a very light amount) on just the part you want to pomp, and blow dry it on cold for a very short amount of time with a flat brush to shape it, then i use a medium hold high gloss pomade to finish. Idk just my 2c, i fucking love pomps"

Hair,39gw0k,Smurfiroth,4,Thu Jun 11 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion. I think your hair would look nice with a length of just below the shoulders. Your bangs seem thin, so you could probably afford to add some more hair to them to make them thicker, and maybe adding pieces on the sides to frame your face. Also I think an auburn colour would look nice with your skin tone.  .^"
Hair,39gw0k,Han-Burger,2,Thu Jun 11 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input! I was contemplating giving it an auburn color, just indecisive with the cut."
Hair,39gw0k,Battlestarfangirl,3,Thu Jun 11 17:59:55 2015 UTC,You kinda look like an anime character-this is a compliment!! But anyway I think a nice ash blonde would look pretty with your completion (but ashy/cool tones not warm tones) For the cut I am thinking a really shaggy cut with lots of layers-collarbone length

Hair,39gw0k,titanhermant,2,Thu Jun 11 19:36:59 2015 UTC,The only change I've ever put my hair through is dying it black and cutting it shoulder length. I have never once been without my bangs either.
Hair,39gw0k,atglite,2,Thu Jun 11 17:13:42 2015 UTC,Do you want to keep it long or cut it shorter?
Hair,39gw0k,sarahabea,2,Thu Jun 11 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"The shorter, the better. However if you have any ideas with it being long, I'm all ears."
Hair,39gw0k,sarahabea,3,Thu Jun 11 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say somewhere between your chin and shoulder would be a good length for you. Your face shape may make something like a pixie look off, although that could just be the camera angle. I'd cut it in steps though. Take it to shoulder, if it looks good there you're good, if you want to take it shorter you can. If you cut it too short and it looks weird for you it'll take a long time to grow it back out. Bangs may benefit from being a little shorter too"

Hair,39im7o,StarkRed26,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"Tea tree oil is a strong chemical, although natural can cause harm. It is drying to the skin, can cause burning if not properly diluted, and if you don't rinse throughly because oils are hard to get out it can leave your hair more oily. It sounds like maybe the shampoo isn't the right ratio, or maybe you just have a sensitivity. Look up the brand and see if there are customer reviews on it. I can use straight tea tree oil on my face though it says to dilute it and the worst effect I have is slight drying.   Edit : to answer your question about sls, I'm not familiar with the term but if you aren't having adverse effects from those brands you were using before but youre having issues now, I don't see why you shouldn't just use what works for you. Tea tree oil can be toxic to the body and can cause kidney and liver damage so it's not more or less safer imo."
Hair,39im7o,sammylue,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:20:48 2015 UTC,"Also, your skin can react if it's routine is changed. It's like if you wash your hair every day your whole life and then suddenly switch to only washing it twice a week, your hair will take a while to adjust to that. Switching up your product can have the same effect."
Hair,39im7o,jerpod,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"I just want to comment to say that Tea Tree is only toxic if you swallow, or otherwise ingest, it."
Hair,39im7o,HappySmash,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"Tea tree oil can be absorbed through the skin just like most other things can, therefore can still be toxic depending on the dilution ratio."
Hair,39im7o,sammylue,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"Tardy to the party but I thought I'd throw my 2cents in. I'll also add this disclaimer that while I'm not a trichologist, I've done my fair share of experimentation and research into hair/scalp care.  First and foremost, the whole ""SLS IS BAD"" thing is a myth. SLS has been safely used in cosmetics as a surfactant (thing that makes the product foam and lather) for over 80 years and there has been no studies that have legitimately linked SLS to things such as cancers or other diseases. Largely, the trend of hating on SLS began when the uprise of organic and ""all natural"" foods and products began, several years ago. SLS comes in many of our personal care products: soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, and the like. Additionally, there are a few forms of surfactant which are the most common: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laruel Ethel Sulfate (SLES), and Amonium Laurel Sulfate (ALS). SLS primarily serves to create bubbles, which helps lift oil, dirt, and other buildup from the scalp so it can be effectively washed away.  SLS free products are not necessarily bad-- but they're not necessarily good either. You'll notice how most of them will still lather, at least to some degree. This is because they have created new chemical compounds (other than SLS) to foam; chemical compounds which we do not know the effects of on our bodies in the long term.  The thing about Tea Tree oil is that, while it DOES have many good things going for it (anti-bacterial, anti-inflammitory, and astringent (dries up extra oils)), it can be incredibly irritating to the skin/scalp, especially if you're prone to having a somewhat more sensitive scalp, and especially if you're applying it frequently (washing your hair every day, for example). Likely the reason you're getting dandruff is because the tea tree is soaking up all your hair's natural oils and leaving none to protect the scalp. In response to this, your scalp is producing more oil than necessary (which accounts for the oiliness of your hair) in order to try and hydrate and protect itself again.  All that being said, the biggest ""issue"" with most shampoo and conditioner is the filler in it. There's usually a lot of extra stuff in there that's going to build up in the hair and on the scalp, prevent hydration from being able to sink in, and thus cause your hair to dry out over time. If you still want to go the All Natural route, I'd recommend taking a look at Lush's hair care-- it's made with pure essential oils, natural butters, and other good stuff such as free run eggs, lanolin, fresh squeezed citrus, and the like. There's no fillers in it at all, they pay fair trade wages for their ingredients, and they help fight animal testing. Plus, their products last a long time because they're very effective so you don't need to worry about going through it too quickly.  Sorry for the info dump, this is just something I'm really passionate about because there's A LOT of misinformation floating around :P  TL;DR: SLS isn't bad, but if you're still worried, go to LUSH"

My perm was done so well and not having to do anything to style my hair was incredibly wonderful! Perms ARE permanent (obviously) but they DO FADE (just fyi).   If you want a perm, just do it. Find someone who has done MANY perms and make sure they know your hair history. Make sure you discuss the type of curl you want, and ask them about the different sizes of perm rods and the types of perms (different chemicals are used for different types)  Personally, I miss my perm so much. Having it also helped me to leave my hair be and it seemed like not having to brush it so much aided in me growing my hair out :)  If you do get it done, I recommend getting some smoothing products for post shower, something like a hair serum or something.

Hair,39gclz,SherbetRocket,2,Sun Jun 14 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) The lady did a wonderful job. She was very aware of all of the bleaching/coloring I did in the past and I think that aided in her deciding what type of chemicals to use for my perm.  And oh my gosh, nooo. Don't worry about there being some sort of ""line."" The perm fades over time, and so as your hair grows.. the perm fades more and more. After a while it just starts to look semi-wavy! I seriously say just go for it! Totally worth it :) It's fun to have a different type of hair for a while.  One thing I always loved was that it made it easier for my hair to hold styles I did. Like, if I braided my hair when it was wet at night and took it out the next day it was perfectly wavy and beautiful and held ALL day with no hairspray. It was so awesome.    Make sure you do research and find someone who has done a LOT of perms though if you do it, to prevent mishaps..."
Hair,39gclz,rspring28,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"thanks for your advice, im so tempted now! i never knew it could look so natural. :) im glad it went so well for you!"
Hair,39gclz,SherbetRocket,2,Sun Jun 14 21:18:47 2015 UTC,No problem. No one really talks about perms because people think they're stupid. If you do it I hope it goes well!
Hair,39gclz,rspring28,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"Oh! It looks so good!! :) thanks for all the info and the photos, I think I am going to do it once i get some extra cash!"
Hair,39gclz,rspring28,2,Mon Jun 15 13:49:35 2015 UTC,Yeah no problem! I hope it turns out well :)
Hair,39gclz,perryfrance,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"Perms are PERManent! (Sorry for the terrible pun -- I couldn't help it). They chemically alter the wave pattern of your natural hair, so the only way to revert back to your natural texture is to actually cut off the permed sections.   If you want bigger curls, ask for a beach-wave perm. A stylist can accomplish this with styrofoam blocks or large rods. Perms are super underrated because people automatically think of afro 80s hair, but in reality they can be a great service to give you a different look -- it's all in the application!  Make sure you go to a stylist who actually knows how to do one :)"
Hair,39g62b,dreamer234,2,Thu Jun 11 14:33:46 2015 UTC,This lady is amazing. Her hair sounds to be about the same length as yours.
Hair,39g5fb,fishtankenthusiast,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:29:22 2015 UTC,I say just grow it out until you can't stand it haha. Try going for an ombre when you get a bit of your natural roots in.

Hair,39dnbe,veglt,2,Thu Jun 11 01:36:28 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem. I use hairspray to get the waves to stay. I specifically use this stuff. It is literally the most amazing hair spray I have ever used and is my saving grace. It only takes a few spritz (I use mousse too - this mousse also never crusts up my hair) and my waves stay all day and they don't get crusty, which is really quite amazing.  I mean, this is what works for me, but maybe you can try it too."
Hair,39dnbe,feedmewords,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem, and I've found a few solutions that may work for you, but they aren't perfect... After I shower, I put in my usual serums to smooth it out, and then towel dry, leaving it still damp. I then sprunch my hair with no products, just sprunch it up to my head and slowly lower and release it. Small sections. Repeat this as it dries. Another option that I use if I'm going to shower before bed is towel dry until only damp again, and then you ""plop"" it. It's hard to explain, but if you google something about plopping for curly hair, it should come up. Lastly, sea salt spray on my damp hair helps me enhance my waves. I use the Not Your Mothers brand and really like it."
Hair,39dg8h,inevergotaname,2,Thu Jun 11 00:50:03 2015 UTC,Unless you want a dark color you'll need to lighten your hair first. Most salons offer free consultations. It would be worth going that route first to figure out how much they'll charge since otherwise you'll have to buy all the different products. If you decide to do it yourself you'll probably lighten to a dark blonde then color after. Joyco and Pravana make good pigments in my opinion.
Hair,39dg8h,H-ly,2,Thu Jun 11 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"If you're not looking for a really light blue/purple a 20, or 30, volume bleach would probably suffice. Fry your hair way less too. And for future reference, probably best not to bleach over already bleached hair. I made that mistake and there is no going back from that, lol."

Hair,398zzw,MuckYoFama,3,Wed Jun 10 11:37:02 2015 UTC,Awesome! There's always a way. My dad was a hairstylist. He got all the ouches from my sister and I and didn't care. We were his experiments for the salon. Haha!

Hair,398zzw,snappleapples,3,Wed Jun 10 04:21:10 2015 UTC,I kinda regret not starting earlier and having them grow their hair from an earlier age. As a parent we learn on the run and its easy to miss an opportunity and suddenly realize time is against you.  I only really realized when I started trying to draw hair (on portraits) how many fascinating styles there are and how much I didn't know.

Hair,398zzw,InsertFunnyUsername6,2,Wed Jun 10 15:26:20 2015 UTC,I finally mastered pony tails and pigtails about a month ago after my poor daughter had to put up with squonky ponytails and non-matching pigtails at school whilst I was still trying to practice
Hair,398zzw,InsertFunnyUsername6,3,Thu Jun 11 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"Try a fishtail braid! They look a little intimidating at first, but are pretty easy once you practice a bit. They are also good for uneven cuts because they are supposed to be a little messy, not perfect like other braids.   An easy way to practice, without having to use your daughters, is to buy a bunch of yarn and tie it together. And then you can practice all sorts of braids!   Good luck!"
Hair,398zzw,InsertFunnyUsername6,2,Wed Jun 10 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"I made a purchase yesterday I never imagined I'd make and the guys will probably never let me live down... a head with 22"" length hair. Surprisingly cheaper than I would have thought.  I'll give a fishtail a go but my girls may not have the length yet."
Hair,398zzw,H-ly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:14:11 2015 UTC,You don't necessarily need length for it. Say they want to keep some hair down but some out of their face. You can do a half up half down with a fishtail. Of or just do it on one side higher up. Braids don't always need to use all the hair! I'll use them to keep the hair right by my face up.
Hair,398zzw,H-ly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:27:24 2015 UTC,Just watching a fishtail video now. I think I must have been thinking of another one (probably a waterfall) as a fishtail looks like it would work well with shorter hair after all.
Hair,398zzw,Pinky_Swear,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"Waterfalls can also be really good to get the hair out of my face. I have layered side bangs, and I'll use a waterfall to move them away."
Hair,398zzw,nabgi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:23:46 2015 UTC,Ain't managed a waterfall braid yet unfortunately. Keeps falling out. However I'm getting much better at headband braids like a dutch lace braid so practice is helping.
Hair,398zzw,billnyethewifiguy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:35:43 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Braids are the best :)
Hair,398zzw,nabgi,3,Fri Jun 12 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Part of your troubles I think is coming from where you're sectioning. For example, for a french braid look where you braid each side of the hair and leave the part down the middle, start with a small triangle at the front to begin your braid. As you take you sections that you're adding to the braid, take the pieces that are closer to the part by slicing downward from the part towards your braid, and when you add to the lower side, section horizontally instead of vertically so that you are parting from her front hair line back to your braid. Try to make each added piece about the same size/same amount of hair, to keep the braid consistent.  I'm going to disagree with what others have suggested, wet hair can make tighter braids, but it's less forgiving to beginners in my opinion. Instead, try mixing about a table spoon of conditioner in a spray bottle filled with water (or detangeling spray). Spray lightly, then comb or brush through right before you start to braid.   Another idea is going to the beauty school and asking for help. Often if they're slow, they'll have fun showing you some tricks, it's best to see thaws things in person. (Be aware that they will probably still have to charge you something).   Bobby pins are meant to be used by putting one in (open just a little so you don't try to put too much hair in, then put a second pin over the first to form an X and they are opposit so that one has ridges up and the other has ridges down.   As for equipment, a soft bristle brush is your best bet, my favorite is the Phillips light touch 6."
Hair,39a6nc,tittilating_tomatoes,5,Wed Jun 10 10:42:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, it looks beautiful and healthy. I wouldn't change it. Maybe some layers and side swept bangs though to switch it up a bit."

Hair,39a6nc,dani_bar,2,Wed Jun 10 19:27:33 2015 UTC,Is humidity a factor? What about side bangs? Do you ever curl it? I think your hair looks fabulous and I wouldn't do much to change it. I have a similar length though right now and in the summer it's a pain.
Hair,39a6nc,dani_bar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, such a pain! I have curled it before, but it hardly lasts an hour. That's why I usually just put it in two braids before bed instead."
Hair,39a6nc,ginger-zantedeschias,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"When I curl my hair with a straightener it lasts for days. I think side bangs might mix it up enough for you. I would even say straight across bangs, what's why I asked about humidity. I wouldn't do straight bangs in high humidity."
Hair,39bimc,Superhippie1000,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"I'm at the same point with you. Hair is same length and kinda wavy. Uh after my showers I use a comb and comb everything get any knots out and then use the finer side to comb it more. Then every few days I use this hemp oil stuff, few squirts of that and rub it on my hair. Then later after my hairs dry ill brush it a few times. Thats about it."
Hair,39bimc,flowfordayz13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"Wash it later rather than sooner. That oil is actually really good for your hair even though it may smell/look weird.  I have had long hair for most of my life and had some great results with washing using only conditioner the past 2-3 years. I had noticed that I lost more hair after washing and they didn't get uprooted but had snapped so I decided to try conditioner only. Washed my hair a couple of times with shampoo lately (it was hard but I just had to try) and it looks as if it has gotten stronger. (At least it's not snapping in half.)  Now; I'm an idiot who always wear my hair in a ponytail so it's not going to win a ""best hair"" award but braiding is a great alternative to the hair-destroying ponytail if you have to control your hair.  Edit: Might be good to mention that I'm a guy just in case."

Hair,397klu,jaybiebz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:19:16 2015 UTC,I've been really thinking about that. My mom has red hair and I got some of the complexion! Do you have any suggestions for how to part my hair toward the middle with a strong widows peak? Mine is super intense. Like so intense that my bio teacher freshman year used me as the example in front of a class of 200 of widows peaks being a dominant (or recessive? can't remember) trait. I was sitting in the 10th row back.......
Hair,397klu,jaybiebz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm well in that case maybe the side is better. Or have you considered straight across? That could be cute too! As for the color, http://imgur.com/8BYBxf7 maybe something like that or a tad darker? :-)"
Hair,397klu,jaybiebz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:22:23 2015 UTC,I've had straight across and loved them but I can only do them in the winter (which I'm really considering again this winter with this color) as I live in Alabama and the humidity makes bang maintenance impossible. I'm going to ask the stylist if she can show me how to part my hair properly more midline with my peak! I'm sure there's a way haha

Hair,3971si,ashhole613,3,Tue Jun 9 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"Any color-safe shampoo will work, but the real trick is to reduce how often you shampoo your hair and use a dry shampoo on your roots to extend the time in between washes. If you're curly, you can co-wash only which will definitely help.  I color my hair to 6R (red) every 8 weeks, and the color on the roots is all I touch up every time. By stretching out my shampoos, I can keep the red in my hair for 16-24 weeks at a time before it begins to fade."

Hair,38x0ok,TimeMakesYouBolder,3,Sun Jun 7 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, bring pictures of your goal color. I'd highly recommend asking for a consultation before your appointment so the stylist knows what you're looking for, your hair color history, and how much time to book out for you, and also so you have an accurate quote for price. (I have silver hair with blue tips and I've been a stylist for over 10 years.)You're going to need to be very blonde first, which may be quite difficult if you've been dying your hair for a long time. Color doesn't always just bleach out so you might not be able to be silver. Perhaps if your roots are long enough you can be silver there and do a color on the previously colored hair. Good luck!"
Hair,38x0ok,H-ly,3,Sun Jun 7 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"It seems silly but I hadn't thought of bringing a photo of my goal colour so thank you for pointing that out! I got it cut yesterday and she did a test piece for me, it managed to lift a lot of colour in just ten minutes using 6% peroxide. The roots were much much lighter than the rest of my hair. She did warn me I might have to be blonde first. Which isn't so bad since I'm blonde originally. I'll just have to be patient I guess which is difficult since I've wanted the colour for a long time but only just got the nerve. How often would you recommend having the roots done? Is there any special care you need to take with your hair as I've heard bleach can be quite damaging? Thanks for your help :)"
Hair,38x0ok,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:11:48 2015 UTC,Ask your stylist all of these questions at your consultation.  She will steer you in the right direction and suggest the proper products to use for after care.  She's the only one who can give you a 100% accurate answer since she is actually working on your hair.  Just a hint going silver you need to be a level 10 at the darkest or it'll turn just grey.
Hair,38x0ok,xsaraxnarax,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"Getting the roots done is based on how long you are willing to go without full coverage. And how fast your hair grows. If you're okay with darker roots for a bit then go a little longer. If you want to be completely blonde/silver all the time then go every 4/5weeks. It's more what you're comfortable with seeing and how much you're willing to spend with maintenance. If you keep up the roots every 4/5 weeks it is much easier to obtain the lightest blonde, as bleach processes fastest next to the scalp. Your stylist should also tell you what she would think is best to help maintain it. Redken has an amazing line called blonde idol. There is a custom toner for violet that will help maintain your silvery glow. You use the lightest tones at first and get more into the violets the closer you get to your next appointment. Because the toner(what creates the silver) will begin to fade."
Hair,38x0ok,AllyPent,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"Other than what everyone else has said on here I feel like I should mention that sometimes using a violet shampoo isn't enough, especially if your hair doesn't tend to hold colour/tends to get yellow/ whatever.  I usually end up toning my hair myself at home in between appointments to keep up the colour as it fades SO. FAST.  Wella colour charm in T050 works well for me, although I should note that it is a very blue-based silver, really more grey. T18 is very popular as well."
Hair,38xwu5,carriemybeloved,2,Sun Jun 7 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"Ends are drier and more porous.  It makes sense for longer hair to have lighter ends, but I don't know why they would be lighter when your hair was shorter.  Maybe something to do with dryness, water pH, how often you shampoo, etc?"

They all work best on damp hair, it can't be too wet or the hair wont dry and will never actually curl. It might take a few goes to find a curl you like, so don't be discouraged if it doesnt turn out well. They're usually very easy to do (if you can twist your hair or wrap it around something, you can do this). I think this would work well, it seems confortable enough to sleep in.  This is the page of all the other videos for heatless curls. I hope this helps :)"

I do that when I wash my hair at night when I'm too lazy to either dry it straight or let my natural curls dry nice... You can try it..you got nothing to lose.
Hair,38v74a,genghiskhannie,3,Sun Jun 7 11:48:39 2015 UTC,I've used foam rollers overnight on towel dried hair. Totally dry by morning. The size of the roller determines the size of the curl. BUT they were not fun to sleep in.

Hair,38v74a,alyssmill,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"As a kid my mum did it with rags. You take long strips of cotton (I'm pretty sure she ripped a sheet up) then take a small section of hair and use half a strip to twirl up the hair, then the rest till wrap around it, knotting at the bottom. Best done with wet hair. In the morning you unwrap it all and brush out the curls."

I have hair similar to yours and I started out not knowing anything about curling either but with a bit of practice it gets really easy :) Just divide your hair into three main sections top to bottom and curl one section at a time."
Hair,38vtb1,VBusyMomInNYC,6,Sun Jun 7 06:39:15 2015 UTC,"If you're in nyc, you can try calling arrojo studio to see if they can help. I've personally witness a full head of dreadlocks combed out while there.   On the other hand,  any salon that is going to take the time to do this is going to charge you premium. I'd get a heavy duty conditioner,  a comb,  soak the ever loving Crap out of her tangles and go ends to roots small section by section to detangle.  It can be done.  It will likely take hours.   How old is your daughter anyway?  If she's under the age of 10, you should probably still be helping her detangle after bathing. Thick hair like that can be hard to manage.   If you or she can't be bothered,  cut it short until she can maintain it on her own."
Hair,38vtb1,Raviepooh,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:33:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. She is 13 and is now very self-conscious about her hair. I'll try Arrojo. I know that this will cost a premium and an resigned to paying what I need to in order to rectify this.

Hair,38vtb1,mjoallie,2,Sun Jun 7 14:56:51 2015 UTC,Get a wet brush for her to use when you do get it untangled. And it might help while trying to get the tangles out. Just always start at the ends
Hair,38vtb1,gazork_chumble_spuzz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"My cousin did something similar when she was 13. She basically combed over the giant knot in her hair for about a year. We detangled as much as we could on top and in the middle, and cut out the large knot underneath. We left as much hair as possible, and her hair looked long and normal still, unless you looked underneath and saw where we chopped out the knot. I'm not saying you should do this, but it worked for us, and she didn't have to lose much hair."
Hair,38vtb1,EmiBoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"Oy vey. That's rough!  Ok...get it nice and sopping wet. Take some really rich conditioner, lots of it, and soak her head in it. Squish it into her hair so it gets down to the roots and in under the mats. Leave the conditioner in while you comb it out; it'll help the hair to slip. Start at the ends and go to the roots bit by bit, in sections. Once you have it all de-tangled, take her in for a trim...freshly-trimmed hair tangles so much less. She may need layers if there are a lot of split ends. Make sure you get on her case about keeping her hair combed. Do it for her after a shower or bath, and make it part of her morning routine - have her do it while you sit and supervise to make sure it gets done properly. Does she routinely use conditioner when she bathes? If not, she should...and leave-in conditioner as well. Dry hair seems to tangle more readily. I wonder if she will wind up with curly hair as an adult."
Hair,38vtb1,hufflepuffeveryday,-1,Sun Jun 7 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"I know it may not be the most popular option but I have known a number of parents that have found it less stressful for both them and their children to keep their hair in dreads until the kids are old enough to care for their hair on their own. No more horrible detangling sessions, easy to wash and maintain, and you can get it all combed out whenever she's ready for a new style (and the maintenance that goes with it) Might not be the solution you want but just an idea.   Otherwise I'd try a deep conditioner and really let it sit for a bit then start at the bottom and detangle small sections at a time. Good luck!"

Hair,38u37g,blackberrythorn,2,Sat Jun 6 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"any ""henna"" that is not 100% pure red henna, likely has metallic dyes in it. imagine how metal oxidises and gets kind of greenish and matte finish... this will happen as your hair is washed and out in the air. hair with metallic dyes when wet sometimes feels sort of crunchy and slimy at the same time... totally not good. if it turns a colour you didn't want, like too dark, you can't get it out. it has a chemical reaction with professional hair dye or bleach, and your hair will go up in green and black smoke.   from that pic, i'd recommend instead a nice haircut with long layers to show off your curls! if you want to try colour with not much upkeep or commitment, try balayage. balayage is when they paint little streaks just in the ends, including the underneath. google balayage and click ""images"" then try balayage red or balayage brown, or anything you can think of. there's a great product to do balayage with made by wella called ""magma"" try googling magma red or magma brown"

But definitely grow it out as long as you can before you go in for a cut. Longer hair makes it much easier to layer and style this way. When you're growing it out, it'll get an ""awkward stage"" where your hair looks kind of funky and you can't seem to do anything with it. Tough it out, it's very rewarding in the end. Resist that temptation to cut it for as long as possible!"

Hair,38qohn,katj813,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:21:39 2015 UTC,"I do love copper.    Use a GOOD color-safe sulfate-free shampoo.  Consider a leave-in conditioner with UV protection. And a hat. Find a reputable colorist. If you can't afford/are unwilling to get your color touched up every 6-8 weeks, you should probably get a color the same level of depth as your natural. (1 is black, 10 is pale blonde. If you're a level 6 brown, stay in the 5-7 range.)"
Hair,38qohn,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:18:49 2015 UTC,"This is advice I wish someone had given me because it was a nightmare getting my original color back when I got sick of the upkeep...before doing anything, have your stylist match your color and write it down for future reference.  Other tips...that color will fade quickly, I've had it. You'll want a sulfate free shampoo for color treated hair and you'll want to shampoo less frequently to make it last. If you don't like hair care, you might want to reconsider dying your hair. You might want to start using a leave in conditioner and such to keep your hair healthy after the dye job. Plus, keeping up with dying your roots can be a pain. Other than that...that hair color is gorgeous and you'll love it."

Hair,38qbmf,Casual_Betty,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"His hair is really processed with lightener, that helps to add texture to finer hair types, which it looks like you have. Try getting a haircut where the interior layering is shorter and more texturized, that will help with styling when using wax products. Maybe try using a clay based product, a little stickier but it'll give more activation and lift."

Hair,38olge,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"This is usually the case, though some really strong purple shampoos (I recommend the Fudge Clean Blonde, it's amazing and because it's very blue it can work well on darker blondes) can actually help tone darker blonde hair. The method used in the video, using semi-permanent dye and conditioner, should also work if you pick the right color. It's all about finding the color opposite your brassy tones.  A toner mixed with developer will always work better than a purple shampoo/conditioner, though."
Hair,38olge,graveyardgirl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:26:07 2015 UTC,Thanks. I saw the developer as well but hesitated since I don't really want to go any lighter. Any recommendations for a mild developer to help the blue set in better? I ended up on an aqua type blue. In my head that sounded kinda close to green which I hoped would offset the red.
Hair,38pjbg,nylxne19,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"okie dokie, well the image of yourself is not publicly available, so check your privacy settings on that.  and at a salon, theyll use semi or demi permanent colors, probably pravana brand. Itll cost a lot, probably around $150+ for the cut and color. To keep the color lasting use hot water on your hair as little as possible, and wash it with a sulfate free shampoo. Check the ingredients in your shampoo and i bet the 2nd or 3rd listed is sodium laureth sulfate which is a salt and makes the shampoo lather up. Your hair actually doesnt need this at all, and strips color hardcore. especially reds. Try an organic/natural shampoo instead, like burts bee's. But always check the ingredients first  Id call ahead to make sure they have the colors in stock, salons dont always keep these kind of colors available all the time. Or go in first for a consult, so the person doing your hair can get a rough idea of how much theyll need to lighten it first.  Its not good to use conditioner after you bleach and wash it out, this will close the hair cuticle and prevent dye from being fully absorbed. the dye will condition your hair a bit too.  The only way it can get super screwed up is if they dont lighten it enough or too much and totally damage your hair. But salons are usually pretty careful about bleaching."

Hair,38mjas,DalekDude98,0,Fri Jun 5 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"I should start by saying that you really ought to see a professional. Kitchen color is rarely a good idea. Especially when bleach is involved. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I've found tubes of cream lightener that I bought years ago that were still good. Powder bleach lasts forever. Developer, on the other hand, does degrade fairly quickly. (Remember to always put the cap back on securely!) Using old developer won't hurt you, it's just weaker. You shouldn't be doing this yourself shouldn't apply bleach more often than every 4 weeks and ONLY to regrowth. Overlapping could (and likely will) cause breakage. Whatever manic panic tint you choose you can apply whenever it starts to fade. That stuff is pretty harmless."

Hair,38mcub,genghiskhannie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:34:21 2015 UTC,"If it's only in the nape area, you kind of have to rely on feeling. If it feels like it still has product, it probably does.   A note on clarifying shampoos: if there's a lot of buildup, you'll need to do a clarifying treatment as well. But it sounds like it's only feeling dirty in some areas, and not others.

I think you should just be trimming the sides and letting the top grow out. You can probably transition from 2 to 3 pretty easily if you  just keep doing that. Just keep getting your sides trimmed like normal when you feel they are too long. I don't think you need to let everything grow and then go get it all shaped.   edit: maybe it's hard to imagine another color because it's short?

I also think you should let them shape your bangs but not shorten them too much. Then I would grow them out so they hit just below your cheekbone.   Examples of shape:  Example 1  Example 2  Example 3  All the colors shown above are pretty good too, but here are more examples that I think are closer:  Example 1  Example 2  Example 3  Good luck!"

Hair,38ecjt,2moreSalts,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:03:33 2015 UTC,I'm definitely going to go with that color and get them to fix up my bangs. I was thinking about also getting a subtle undercut sort of like Ellie Goulding's and/or a nape undercut but I want to get a second option on that lol  Edit: Examples https://instagram.com/p/3ebf5vEzh_/
Hair,38ecjt,2moreSalts,3,Wed Jun 3 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"I have a nape undercut too! lol  I personally think the nape undercut is better than the side one because if you decide you don't like it, it's super easy to grow back. Also, it makes you look badass when you have your hair up, but just a normal human being when you have your hair down.   One thing I would suggest - if you go with either undercuts just start off small. That nape undercut you listed is pretty high up on that girl, and that means sacrificing a LOT of hair. I have pretty thin hair so I started off small and worked my way up. It's like $15 - $20 to get your nape shaved and any old barber can do it so it's not some big undertaking.  Also, sometimes that line straight across for the nape undercut isn't always the nicest. I have mine kind of shaped in a V like this but not nearly as high up as that one. I'm also a big fan of this reverse V one. Also, if you do any undercut I would tell your stylist to use a level 1 attachement for shaving. This will make your hair the length of the first undercut I linked.   Finally, make sure that the stylist shapes the remaining hair so it's not all weird like that second undercut I linked. Everything should be trimmed down to level 1 and then they should be using a razor with no attachment on it to completely shave down any excess hair running down the sides of your neck."

Hair,38dq9c,Emeraldeyes246,4,Wed Jun 3 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"Assuming you used a permanent, lifting black color out of damaged hair is somewhat difficult. Rather than damage it further, I would strongly recommend you visit a professional to get the color safely removed. Home color strippers will do the job to an extent, but it will leave you with brassy tones that will need to be corrected before you color it further."
Hair,38dq9c,ashhole613,2,Wed Jun 3 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"Color stripper and tone it out with permanent color.  Good luck.  remember your color wheel.  Your hair will turn orange.  Blue counters Orange, Violet counters yellow and green counters red.  There will be damage done so stock up on those conditioning treatments and put the irons away until your hair recoups.  It's rather tricky to get black out even at a salon.  so good luck.  Best option would be to grow it out.  I always tell clients to be 100% positive because once you go black it's hard to go back."
Hair,38dq9c,iheartzombiecats,2,Wed Jun 3 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"I recommend using a color remover without bleach (like Color Oops or Colour B4). These are non-damaging, and work very well.

Hair,38dq9c,graveyardgirl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:07:08 2015 UTC,Go to a salon.  Don't try to go lighter (especially from black) at home... it will be a disaster most likely.  Good luck!
Hair,38dq9c,rspring28,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, doing it at home is not really the best idea. Black tint is particularly aggressive. Most colorists (not all) will immediately reach for the bleach (it's the fastest solution). So in the consultation, ask them for a non-bleach de-colorizer. These are not fast, usually smell like perm solution BUT cause little to no damage. And unlike bleach, these don't alter the natural color of hair, it can only remove artificial pigment. It has been explained to me (by a product rep, so who knows how accurate this explanation is, I don't think you even need a cosmetology license to become one) that they work by temporarily shrinking artificial pigment molecules so they can be washed away. When I do a decolorizer, I shampoo no less than 4 times because as soon as the neutralizer hits it the molecules expand back to normal size. So whatever wasn't removed causes the hair to redarken. And then you have to do it again. So, when you book your appointment, make sure to clear your day and plan to order in lunch."

Hair,38b034,BurnBrightNight,4,Wed Jun 3 01:26:44 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I think the hair in the picture is styled differently (long wavy layers) than your hair (curly subtle layers) and you have to factor that into the look of the color. I am a hairstylist with curly hair and believe correct color placement with the natural fall of the hair is key so these styles look right.  Honestly I've been disappointed with Balyage on my curly hair. I prefer dark on top and dramatic peek a boo highlight panels to achieve a similar look. This ensures the color doesn't get lost."

I called and explained what happened, they had me come in and the same girl fixed my hair for free. Just be polite about and they'll help you, but if you want someone else to fix it, you need to make that clear on your original call to the salon or they'll book you with the same person so no one else loses tip money."

Hair,38b8p1,port11,2,Wed Jun 3 02:26:12 2015 UTC,"It can depend on how you put it in a bun. Twist it into a bun with a pin/stick or two will do less damage than ponytail holders. You can also alternate height of bun, direction twisted, and try out twist free buns.  My experience working in kitchens had taught me that buns are best because there's less hair surface exposed to heat and other drying/damaging things.  I now wear buns regularly, even though I don't work in a kitchen, and I have waist length hair that is rather thin and fragile. For work, I twist it around and guide it into a bun then secure with a single U shaped pin. For day wear I tend to do a lazy wrap bun or a nautilus with a stick but I never feel like those are secure enough for work."

You use the opposite when toning. I'll try to post the link.  http://styles101.homestead.com/HairColorPicts/colorwheelnew.gif So say your hair is yellow from brass you should use a violet toner. I wouldn't use as much in the rest of your hair. But if you're not afraid of what may happen, give it a try. I've noticed that if I don't leave the toner in my hair long enough nothing will happen. But if I leave it in to long my hair will turn purply/silvery/blue in the lightest areas so just be careful. But that can happen with any toner or so I have heard."

It can also have horrible side effects if you put box color on and try to use lightener layer, it doesn't always happen though.  I'd have to say the worst is how it can behave when other chemicals are introduced especially perms."
Hair,38amh8,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:31:29 2015 UTC,Right. Okay. Thanks for a good answer. So would you trust the Ion dyes more; since they are a powder and you add the level of developer you want?
Hair,38amh8,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:55:26 2015 UTC,I can't say anything about powder color.  I've never used it.  Are you talking about the Ion color line from sally's?
Hair,38amh8,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:25:45 2015 UTC,Yup. I've done more research into that than most things in college haha.
Hair,38amh8,iheartzombiecats,2,Wed Jun 3 13:01:43 2015 UTC,"Renegadebetty gave an awesome answer.  Going lighter, especially if you're using box color should be done by your stylist, and be super honest with her with what exactly you've used.  My favorite thing about getting color and developer separately is being able to create a formula that shows different tones and hues that one color can't achieve alone."
Hair,38amh8,renegadebetty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh, okay. So how do you do that; create different tones? Mixing different powders or adding something else?"
Hair,38amh8,renegadebetty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"I know creams the best, not the powders.  Easiest way to describe it is in the form of toners.  Lets say I just lightened someone to a yellow level 10 and they want a super natural, not white or silver color blond.  I'd mix a 1/2part 10N and 1/2 part 10V to give them an lovely neutral blond color without any yellow.  You can go a bit further someone wants brown, but they want a rich mahogony color.  I mix an N and a V (violet) and R(red) to bring out different tones of each color.  Some folks like to be different shades of ginger but without being super ginger.  So you throw a 3parts CR and 1 part N to tone things down a bit.   I huge part of knowing color mixtures and how they work is by knowing your color wheel inside and out.  You can't mix blue and orange, yellow and purple, or green and red, but you can use those colors to counteract each other.  If someone turns green because of a green based ash color then they need to be toned with a red, and visa versa. EDIT:  I read though some of the other comments and before you decide to do your hair remember this one haircolor rule.  It's a big one.  Color does NOT lift color.  You can change a level or two of what you have by doing a soap cap, it's easy and it'll only get you maybe 1 level.  1.5 if you're lucky.  A soap cap is literally shocking your hair into giving up some of the pigment by using equal parts of high volume developer + a decent bleach + clarifying shampoo.  It's not meant to stay in your hair longer than 10 minutes and will help set to base to go a bit lighter."
Hair,38amh8,renegadebetty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:56:39 2015 UTC,It sounds like you are talking about powder lightener. Are you planning on going lighter with your hair?
Hair,38amh8,ronniejean1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:59:00 2015 UTC,There are both dyes and lighteners. I was toying with a few ideas; the ion powder lightener being one of them. Have you used it?
Hair,38amh8,jerpod,3,Wed Jun 3 13:02:44 2015 UTC,"I have used both types of ion color. The powder lightener is hard to apply evenly all over, and the formula gets thicker as it is exposed to air. That type of lightener is used primarily in foils, as it needs to stay saturated and warm to work properly.   If you have never colored your hair before, ie: there is no dye on it from roots to ends at all, ever.... then you can use a high-lift color to achieve a blond or light brown.   My advice to my clients who color at home: stick within a shade or two of your natural color.  And blonds should be handled by a pro.. there's too much of a chance for damage or uneven color."
Hair,38amh8,jerpod,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:47:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know there is a chance of damage anytime you colour your hair, especially at home, so I'm prepared for that.   What scares me from lightening at home is the uneven colour. I've coloured my hair a bunch before. Most recently a red/brown box dye. I really wanted to go lighter for the summer but definitely don't have the 60-150$ to spend at the salon. But I don't want it to turn out ugly so I am thinking I'll just end up keeping my hair this colour for now Idk.. Maybe that's a separate post.   Thanks for all the info! :)"
Hair,38amh8,RozTron,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about going to a school? I would see if there is a paul mitchell school nearby. They are SO good at making sure students are highly supervised especially during color services. I would ask for a natural balayage through the ends. That would break up your dark color, lighten gradually all over, and give you enough change to be happy with. You can also ask for upper level students, they're called ""phase 2"" students and are the ones about to graduate.  Or, if you're in southern california, come to me and I'll hook you up ;)"

In the hair industry there are constant requests to revaluate the goals that have been made and if the dress code matches. At times there are even personality changes that need to be made. People in a management spot know where to push people to start revealing their true potential.  At the time it can seem cruel and critical but in hindsight it is just helpful advice.   Feel free to message me. I can respond then. I have been in the hair industry  for 9 years.
Hair,38aquv,audiofem,2,Wed Jun 3 00:15:36 2015 UTC,Natural blonde? I would use something like Redken All Soft Heavy Cream or Nexxus Humectress. Not so natural blonde? Paul Mitchell Forever Blonde Conditioner.

Hair,3873sx,Coprosmo,2,Tue Jun 2 09:19:00 2015 UTC,"I love the crazy fro!   I don't have a cut suggestion, but a product one. Spend some extra money on better quality shampoo and conditioner. Try devachan or something like it. Get one without sulfates (it will be weird at first because they don't lather the same and you will feel like you need to use more - you don't). Get a good deep conditioner/leave in conditioner. Shower before bed and wrap your head in an old t shirt when you sleep. It will dry more slowly, encourage the curl, and reduce frizz."
Hair,3873sx,julsey414,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"Try showering in the morning or when you don't have anywhere to be for a while. Use conditioner if you don't already. Right after you get out of the shower,  don't rub a towel on your hair or brush it. Use a cotton tee shirt and squeeze your hair in it, don't rub. Add a quarter size amount of curl defining mouse through your hair.  Try not to break the curls with your fingers or comb through them. If you mess with it too much when it's wet,  it will get frizzy and the curls won't be defined. That's basically the key to no frizz! Do this, and I bet you'll have Jon Snow curls."

I would recommend coconut oil to get your hair  healthy almond oil for growth  etc. Im a south indian guy and my hair is think frizzy and  unruley but if you do a pre treatmebt before your shampoo and let it sit for at least an hour if not over night you will see positive result.

Hair,382ejw,_unknown_username,7,Mon Jun 1 10:49:21 2015 UTC,"Grey hair is no different than regular hair except that it has no pigment. The hair can turn grey at any point in its growth cycle. meaning you could have pigment in the hair at the bottom of the strand an no pigment at the same root. There is even a condition where the hair's pigment will ""turn on and off"" leaving an almost patchy or stripy strand.  If you didn't cut your hair, it would eventually start growing grey( assuming that's in your genetic makeup). Grey hair does not replace a pigmented hair in its follicle. The pigmented follicle does not die while a grey follicle comes to life. The follicle's signal to pigment a hair is ""switched off"" by genetic or stress-related factors."

I haven't seen that grey hair since. Do not pull out the grey hair. The direction you pull it in will be the direction it grows in.

A conditioner base dye wont lighten hair.  Just put a cooper red about a level 6 with 10vl on just your roots let it sit for 7-10 mins then pull through your ends for 3. it should help even things out. This happened to me before reds and coppers can be tough. The reason why the dye you got from the drug store didn't work is bc all drug store dye has 20vol developer in it no matter what. you what to darken your roots. The drug store dye wont deposit color on your roots bc its not 10vol.  I hope this helps. good luck!"

Most recently I have been using a red copper deepshine colour with 20 developer, and then a conditioner based orange dye as a top up to keep it a nice bright copper colour. This weekend it was time to do my roots. I had tried just putting the conditioner based orange dye on them but as that hair hadn't been lightened, it wasn't porous enough to take the colour. I had the brilliant idea to do a ten minute soap cap (bleach, 20 vol mixed with shampoo) to lighten just the roots and then apply the orange dye. That did not go well. BRIGHT orange roots. In desperation I went to my local superdrug (with a hat on) and bought a dark red dye that I thought would cover everything. Obviously it did not! I'm having trouble getting a picture that shows it too well, but my roots are still very very vibrant compared to the rest of my hair. Now what?  I really need to even out my hair and I need to do it over the next two days as I am going on a hen do at the end of the week and want to look pretty :(  I have the usual boots that I can go to, or I can make the trip to a sallys if there is something better there.

Going back to blonde can in some cases be impossible because black dye can stain your hair, especially if you've kept layering dye.  I'd suggest a color remover without bleach in it (like Colour B4 and Color Oops) to remove as much build up and dye as you can, and then see what you end up with. You might have more luck bleaching after that."

Stress can absolutely cause hair to fall out, which causes more stress. Sorry.  I talk about this product way too much, but it's saved me a thousand times: Emergenc√®e from Nexxus. It's the best thing I've ever found for restoring elasticity and reducing porosity.  Side note: natural isn't the opposite of chemical. Chemicals occur in nature, not just labs."
Hair,37wotv,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun May 31 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. Natural plants have so any chemicals like cardia glycosides, things that make animals infertile, e.t.c I'm just overly concerned about our biosolids and general water. Okay, I'll pick that up today and give my hair a nice deep treatment. I'll polish off my mane with some Argan oil ( I applied some to dry hair last night- will start doing it damp) Thanks so so much."
Hair,37wotv,Badass_undercover,3,Sun May 31 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"I had bad experiences with bad eating and chemical usage, and I gotta say vitamin supplements, good eating habits are key - it isn't short term but your hair will grow with a better ""quality"" As for now, I think keratin once a week and produce with Oijon/Argan oil do wonders! Good luck"
Hair,37wotv,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun May 31 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've been rectifying my diet, and I was using a biotin supplement for a bit- I just finished it. I'll go back on my one a day multi-vitamin. I have Argan oil ( 100% pure and organic) Though to be honest I've never had much luck with it. Do you apply it to damp or dry hair? As for keratin, I'm assuming it's not natural? Do you have some keratin products in mind? Thanks so much. I may try the argan oil tonight."
Hair,37wotv,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun May 31 01:31:45 2015 UTC,Oils distribute easier on towel dried hair. You can also add a couple drops to your conditioner. Also- keratin is natural. It's what your hair and nails are made out of.
Hair,37wotv,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun May 31 04:43:16 2015 UTC,"Will start adding the oil to damp hair, thanks guys. No wonder it wasn't really working. What can I find Keratin in? Sorry, I'm a complete noob."
Hair,37wotv,crp07,1 point,Sun May 31 15:10:13 2015 UTC,"Most reconstructing treatments contain keratin. I don't know if it's necessarily the most effective protein. Synthetic proteins work, too. I'm pretty sure K-pak from Joico is keratin based. Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Intensive Keratin Treatment is another really good one. I'm going to do some homework on henna and see if that isn't also a part of the problem. (If you try to remove henna with bleach, the hair literally starts smoking. Something about that is really unsettling.)"
Hair,37wotv,crp07,1 point,Sun May 31 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll look into those. I've seen the Joico around. I've head about henna causing smoking but have never experienced it. I've also done the henna recently- my hair has remained mostly unchanged since the henna- a bit softer, and a bit redder. I know that if henna is not pure and contains additives it can clash with hair dye/ bleach really badly."
Hair,37vu9o,captaincook27,13,Sat May 30 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"I used to have pastel purple hair! I started out with brown hair, about a level 4, and then bleached twice (with about four weeks between the two bleachings) to achieve this color. After that I started experimenting with different purples.  This was a very diluted Lavender by La Riche Directions. A great warm purple. Looked very pink in some lights.  This was a mix of diluted Lavender and Lilac by La Riche Directions. Lilac is basically a cool version of Lavender. This created a more neutral purple that I liked. It faded to this beautiful white/silvery color that I adored.  This was a (again) heavily diluted Violet by La Riche Directions. Violet is like a darker Lilac, very cool and super intense if you don't dilute it. Looked almost blue in some lights. Probably my favorite out of all the purples I've had, lasted a long time too.  Hope this was somewhat helpful/fun to look at. My best tip for going pastel is just to get a very light and even base, as close to white as you can, otherwise colors will get muddy. I also recommend to dilute pretty much any color you want to use for that true pastel. And I love La Riche Directions dyes!"
Hair,37vu9o,graveyardgirl,2,Sat May 30 23:15:00 2015 UTC,Those look great! What did you use to dilute and to what ratios?
Hair,37vu9o,lborgia,2,Sun May 31 10:29:03 2015 UTC,"Just white conditioner, enough to cover my hair, and I kept adding dye until the mix was about a shade darker than what I wanted."

Hair,37x9ky,tamtam12,2,Sun May 31 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't take much stock in the label ""organic"". Natural doesn't always equal healthy. (Arsenic and mercury occur in nature, do you want that in your shampoo?) I hate admitting this, but Neutrogena T/gel has worked amazingly well for me in the past. A lot of my clients swear by products with tea tree oil. (I can't use it. Irritates my skin.) What products are you currently using? Maybe you're having an allergic reaction."

Ive heard of multiple people saying it works. I will give tea tree oil a go first though. Thanks for your help."

Hair,37vfup,cumbuttons,4,Sat May 30 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like OP got an a-line bob, which is shorter in the back and gradually becoming longer toward the face. The definition of (according to wiki) is A bob cut or bob is a short haircut for women (and occasionally men) in which the hair is typically cut straight around the head at about jaw-level, often with a fringe (or ""bangs"") at the front. If you have to, call the salon and ask for a quick fix for her to adjust your A-line bob to a one length bob"
Hair,37vfup,kimqueso,1 point,Sat May 30 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"Yes the last one was definitely less drastic! It was longer at the front last time but yeah not as long. this one is just really inconvenient :( I think I'll do that, thanks!"
Hair,37vfup,lindzila,4,Sat May 30 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that look is ""in"" right now. Or maybe it's just me lol. Anyway, that's the kind of cut I have right now too (depending on how short yours is) and I find Riawna Capri (a hairstylist in LA)'s Instagram to be super inspiring, as she has a similar style too. You should try the ""flip"" style- it looks really good with bobs, especially if your hair isn't straight. Just stick your hand in and flip the hair from side to side occasionally. Super casual and easy."

Hair,37tnmz,kpatable,2,Sat May 30 08:11:02 2015 UTC,"I've done this before with clients. Paul Mitchell makes a demipermant tint marketed towards men to cover gray. It's seems to only take to gray and pre-lightened hair, so that would effectively maintain your lightened ends without screwing with your natural. (I'm sure other color lines have similar products.) There's no reason why you can't continue using the temporary tints mixed with conditioner the way you have been. I've also found that to be very effective. If it seems like it's not enough, just increase the color to conditioner ratio. (2 parts tint to 1 part conditioner, etc)"
Hair,37tnmz,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sat May 30 22:21:36 2015 UTC,So using the semi permanent color and conditioner will work to make it ashy/cool-toned as long as I have enough dye in the mix?
Hair,37tnmz,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun May 31 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"When you say you're using a ""blue and purple dye mix"", what exactly are you using? Are we talking about something like Manic Panic or Special FX? If that's what we're talking about, yes. That will be sufficient in keeping your hair ash. It is possible to overdo it and deposit too much pigment. But that's ok, it'll fade in a few shampoos."

Hair,37tnmz,genghiskhannie,1 point,Sun May 31 01:25:32 2015 UTC,Ooh I have basically the same question! My hair was bleached blonde for ages then last summer I colored over it with brown dye to return to my natural color. I've spent a year growing my hair out without coloring and the brown dye on the ends has turned reddish and brassy while my incoming hair is ashy brown. I don't want to color more but I want to even it out.

Hair,37tt90,AbraxoCIeaner,3,Sat May 30 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I can really assure you that hair this long is very cheap to maintain and very little time consuming. I have seen many women with this hair length and read their hair care routines, I also had very long hair myself so I hope I can describe things as best as I can. Such long hair cannot be washed on daily basis, but maximum once a week and usually shampoo should be used only on the scalp as it's the only part that produces oil that should be washed out, the rest of the hair is conditioned and washed with water. Drying time is the only thing that requires more time. Also it's very unlikely to see someone with similar hair wear it down too often as it's a little uncomfortable, so it will be often put into a bun or a similar style. It doesn't require too much care, a brush in the morning and one at night and you're ready to go. It's common to think very long hair care is expensive but trust me it really isn't! A short haircut requires a lot more care as you have to style it every day and get it trimmed by a professional at least once a month. I'm not saying short hair is bad, just showing off the pros of long hair :)"
Hair,37tt90,AbraxoCIeaner,1 point,Sun May 31 21:04:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for clarifying! I couldn't quite imagine how much money and time this Marianne Ernst woman had to invest to keep her hair looking the way it does at that length.

Cutting yout split ends regularly will help maintain the health of your hair and therefore make it easier to grow long healthy hair because your hair won't be so fragile and split constantly.

Hair,37qghn,tudor3x8,3,Fri May 29 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"I suggest you don't. Box dye is so bad for your hair, plus you might end up with your hair literally dissolving when going to get it colored at a salon. If you can't afford regular color services in a salon, opt for going to a cosmetology school for your service. Prices are cheaper, quality is the same, and you get to give a colorist/stylist in the making hands on experience (which is always supervised by a licensed educator)."
Hair,37qghn,frankiefantastic,1 point,Fri May 29 23:12:12 2015 UTC,I'm trying to find the answer for this and just looking through the sub; why is boxed dye so bad for hair?
Hair,37qghn,tlinny,2,Wed Jun 3 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"There's a few reasons and I'll try my best to not type an essay.   Box color is meant to be similar to a ""one size fits all"" pant or shirt, which as we all know doesn't actually do that. To try and do this, box color typically uses a higher developer and, at times, ammonia or other similar harsh chemicals to get the job done, which damages the hair because the cuticle is overly blown open. There also is no guarantee you will get your desired look, which brings me to my next point. Professional colorists take into consideration many factors when customizing color for a client. These include porosity of the hair, level, texture, and other factors. Because it is so personalized there is less of a chance of damage and unwanted results. If the results are unwanted, you can get it fixed, whereas with box color you don't have that guarantee. If you do use box color (or henna color, which is even worse) and go to a salon later down the road for color, there is a chance that the salon color will react negatively to the box color which can result in unwanted color and even cause hair to literally dissolve (this is more common with Feria and other metallic box dye as well as henna despite it's ""natural"" nature).   TL;DR: Don't use box color."

Hair,37kvej,pam8215,11,Thu May 28 11:04:27 2015 UTC,What kind of field are you trying to get in? I'm a hairstylist and my suggestion for a teacher would be different that my advice for someone in marketing which would be different than my suggestion for a doctor.
Hair,37kvej,laenooneal,1 point,Thu May 28 13:30:06 2015 UTC,Hi i am looking to get into the medical field as a receptionist
Hair,37kvej,laenooneal,2,Thu May 28 23:53:12 2015 UTC,"Then you should probably keep your hair professional looking and simple. Definitely do a more natural color. Maybe a medium golden brown. I would suggest cutting it a little shorter. I'm thinking just barely past your shoulders with some undercut layers. http://imgur.com/6Y37cIa kind of like this, especially since your hair likes to part down the middle. Clean and simple looking but you can definitely play with it and make it funkier when you feel the need."
Hair,37kvej,applemus,1 point,Fri May 29 00:40:29 2015 UTC,Wow that's nice thanks heaps i will try it
Hair,37kvej,lemchug,1 point,Fri May 29 00:46:28 2015 UTC,I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
Hair,37mkmn,phillyguy112,2,Thu May 28 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"For the style, it looks like you just have one of those hair types that doesn't lay smoothly. Especially if it's short. I used to style a guy's hair that was similar and we kept it short on the sides (#2 or 3) and blended to a longer length on top that was styled with a strong gel. I put the gel in dry hair after blow drying the hair down, so it didn't have that wet look. (Hard up from Sexy Hair) His bone structure around his temples stuck out and made it look puffy, so I would thin those areas with texturizing shears.  For the dry scalp and hair loss, I would get Nioxin since it will address both scalp issues and hair loss. Wash your hair twice if you use strong styling products, since they build up on the scalp and hair."
Hair,37mkmn,CatLickedMeOnShrooms,1 point,Thu May 28 22:38:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help. So what exactly would you recommend I do to make my hair lay smoothly I already get it short on the sides (#2) ?
Hair,37mkmn,CatLickedMeOnShrooms,2,Fri May 29 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"This is the look your hair will most easily style into with the texture you have. Grow out the top, leave the sides at a 2 and it will balance the sides that don't lay smooth.  http://i.imgur.com/wMCLFeC.jpg"
Hair,37mkmn,CatLickedMeOnShrooms,1 point,Fri May 29 02:16:54 2015 UTC,So the short and no maintenance style / way I get is just not suitable for the my hair texture and attributes?
Hair,37mkmn,CatLickedMeOnShrooms,2,Fri May 29 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. I have always wanted styles that I can't wear due to my hair type being curly and the best thing I did was embrace the curls and find styles that work with it. Good luck!"
Hair,37mkmn,ISAprofessional,1 point,Fri May 29 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton, can you do me a favor though and describe my hair? Like if I didn't have a picture and I was trying to describe it what would be the proper attributes to use such as fine/coarse/straight and other qualities  Thanks once again"
Hair,37n0ro,masteraddavarlden,3,Thu May 28 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"Whilst I can't see your photos, what you describe is similar to what I have... seborrheic dermatitis (SD), commonly known as dandruff.  I'd recommend you talk to a dermatologist for the final diagnosis.    Here's the thing with SD, it is your body's reaction to a yeast that occurs naturally.  The yeast feeds on oil and sugar.  The more oil and sugar you feed it, the more yeast you have, the more angry it gets.  Here is what works for me... Cut out the coconut oil. DO NOT USE IT.  It's great for normal scalps, but hell on SD. I used it for a week and my scalp went insane.  Wash your hair with medicated shampoo (Head and Shoulders - the plain works best) DAILY.  I tried the No-Poo (no shampoo) method, thinking my natural oils would moisturize my scalp.  HAHAHAHA! Cue the manic scratching and snow storm of flakes.  Use a couple different kinds of medicated shampoo (Selsun Blue, etc) and switch them out every few days.  Your skin has a finny way of working an immunity to medicines.  Switch it up so it doesn't do that.  Condition your hair.  Daily washing will dry out your hair.  The conditioner restores the moisture without adding oil.  I try anything that says for oily hair.    I get SD on my face, too, so I use Clearasil Oil control cleaner and an oil-free moisturizer on my face.  I also use a clay mask once or twice a week.  TL;DR 1.  NO COCONUT OIL. 2.  Use medicated shampoo daily. 3.  Switch up the medicated shampoos. 4.  Condition daily.  Good luck.  SD is a life-long condition.  You just have to manage it."
Hair,37n0ro,RowdyInDC,1 point,Thu May 28 23:42:33 2015 UTC,Thank you. Coconut oil have not done anything worse for me. I'll try switching shampoo more often and use it daily.
Hair,37n0ro,toasty_feet,1 point,Fri May 29 05:16:56 2015 UTC,Does it matter how much shampoo you use? If I am to use it everyday I should probably use alot less than what I do..
Hair,37n0ro,toasty_feet,2,Fri May 29 07:15:02 2015 UTC,"No, doesnt matter. But there's no point dumping a lot on your head if you only need a smallish amount to get a good lather.  Make sure you're giving your scalp a good rub with the pads of your fingers, concentrating on the areas with buildup. scratching at dandruff or buildup when your hair and skin is dry is a lot more damaging than removing it when it's soaking wet."
Hair,37n0ro,RowdyInDC,2,Fri May 29 07:51:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do that. So if you have a dry scalp + dandruff you cant remoisturise the scalp because the dandruff will get worse. But if you don't the scalp gets worse and will also leave alot of flakes. Man, having scalp like this is really a lose/lose situation. Thanks for the advice though :)"
Hair,37n0ro,toasty_feet,1 point,Fri May 29 10:28:48 2015 UTC,"If you think you have dry scalp on top of true dandruff, then you can use an aloe Vera spray to add back some moisture. I use a 99% pure aloe Vera 'after sun' spray. The less additives, the better. It really relieves itching as well."

Hair,37jhz5,oipased,3,Thu May 28 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"Head over to /r/curlyhair - they have so many tutorials, product recommendations and tricks that make curly hair dreams come true."
Hair,37jhz5,mdh13,3,Thu May 28 13:17:59 2015 UTC,"Don't wash your hair every day. I find tap water to really aggravate frizzy hair. Hair straightening is a good option along with a moisture sealer and protectant. Use solid ceramic plates. It could be that your straightener is changing the ionic charge of your hair getting you all frizzy. Real ceramic plates, not the coated kind.  Ah also here is a nice study on shaft damage and various hair drying methods.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/"
Hair,37jhz5,ISAprofessional,1 point,Thu May 28 15:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I try to not wash my hair every day but it gets so oily! I've been trying different brands of dry shampoo from the drugstore, but I have not yet found one that absorbs the oil enough. I use sulfate free shampoo. My straightener could be the culprit, as I haven't yet invested the money in a high quality full ceramic one."
Hair,37jhz5,Eggfish,2,Thu May 28 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"First, how often do you wash your hair? How harsh is your shampoo? I suggest either 1) using only conditioner, not shampoo 2) washing hair less often or 3) using a very mild shampoo. None of that sodium lauryl sulfate and similarly harsh ingredients. Maybe even try baby shampoo.  I have frizzy hair too, and it's better if I wash it less.  Otherwise, Chi Silk Infusion does wonders."
Hair,37jhz5,Eggfish,1 point,Thu May 28 08:32:44 2015 UTC,"I tried Chi Silk Infusion a few summers ago, and I didn't notice a significant difference in my hair. It could have been because I was using it with harsh shampoos and poor quality heat tools, though. I have since switched to sulfate free shampoo. Do you use a dry shampoo in between washings?"
Hair,37j5sm,dupilumab,3,Thu May 28 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"I use tea tree oil, coconut oil, argon oil, avoid hairspray at all cost, condition my hair before shampooing it, use sulfate free everything and it has helped. However, if it's even a tiny bit warm outside, my head sweats and it's all useless, back to itchy. I don't know if that helps."
Hair,37j5sm,Blugentoo2therevenge,1 point,Thu May 28 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"My head doesn't get itchy from sweat, just from how dry and flaky it is. I've never tried tea tree oil on my scalp but maybe I should. I have a tea tree oil facial product that I might try on my scalp, as its a runny essence and pretty gentle."
Hair,37j5sm,Blugentoo2therevenge,1 point,Thu May 28 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"I like to soak a cotton ball or cotton round and dab it onto my problem spots. But, yours could be different. I've also had good luck with a tea tree oil rosemary spray mix."
Hair,37j5sm,yellowsm42,2,Thu May 28 03:46:12 2015 UTC,Have you tried tea tree oil? I've never heard anything saying rubbing oil directly onto your scalp is damaging to the hair. Maybe to the color of dyed hair.
Hair,37j5sm,graveyardgirl,1 point,Thu May 28 01:23:20 2015 UTC,"I've heard that it makes your hair fall out easier, I've read it online and hair dressers have said it to me before. I don't know how true it is now, I'm just worried about it :("
Hair,37j5sm,Staceyw182,2,Thu May 28 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think rubbing oil on your scalp is a bad idea, and it shouldn't damage your hair. I used to be platinum blonde too, and when my scalp was itchy from bleaching I'd rub coconut oil on it. Coconut oil is great for your hair too, so as long as you're gentle when applying it it shouldn't damage your hair."
Hair,37j5sm,kerrigan_olivier,1 point,Thu May 28 01:29:28 2015 UTC,You just rub coconut oil right on your scalp? Or onto your hair follicles?
Hair,37j5sm,ISAprofessional,1 point,Thu May 28 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"I rub it into my scalp, maybe the night before I wash so it has time to soak in. Also use it all over my hair as a kind of hair mask too. Works great for me :)"

Hair,37jy94,mandanasty,1 point,Thu May 28 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else is saying, you'll need a white base with as little yellow as possible. Luckily your hair is already fairly light and because it is short getting to white will be a little easier. Bleach and then use a good toner to remove any brassy tones, then use a dye of your choice."

Now, what I want you to do with your freeze spray is follow this lovely gentlemans advice: https://youtu.be/0piwbTivpDg  If you want yours to be fluffy, avoid the tips, but see if this helps you :)"
Hair,37ia72,ImSortofAlive,1 point,Wed May 27 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will check that out. I am not as long as the longer example, not as short as the shorter. I'd say about 4-6 inches depending on where it is on my head. I was thinking the shorter HAS to be a hair product. Please let it be a hair product. Maybe just never shampooing my hair again and using dry shampoo and hair spray all the time please."
Hair,37ia72,ImSortofAlive,2,Wed May 27 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"Dry shampoo may help get that texture it your hair, I've never used it, so I completely forgot about it :'D.  the short one definitely has product in it, but to be honest I have no idea what kind... Try seeing if your local salon has a hair cement or something maybe? And there may also be some one there who could recommend the best way to get the style"
Hair,37ia72,dremonster0009,1 point,Wed May 27 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"I have fine thin hair too. I have a few general guidelines/suggestions that may help.  1. Avoid using conditioner, if you aren't already. 2. Use a brush, not a comb, for back combing. Example: http://cdn1.feelunique.com/img/products/47158/Kent_Back_Combing_Brush___PF16_1392813732.png 3. Use super sticky hairspray & spray roots before, during & after backcombing. 4. Pull sections of hair tight, and get those brush bristles right down into your scalp, as if you are scrubbing shower tiles! It needs to hurt a little!   HTH! Let us know!"

Those two are used a lot in cowashing so it's safe if it gets on your scalp.  Leave in conditioners often get overlooked but can be your best friend.

Hair,379t8p,winstonsmithluvsbb,4,Tue May 26 01:10:30 2015 UTC,Coconut oil is the bomb
Hair,379t8p,jen-iscool,3,Tue May 26 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"Coconut oil is awesome. I use it for a moisturizer on my face and hair. About twice a week on the nights before I know I'm washing my hair (I only wash about every third day), I'll put quit a bit of this on my hair and put it in a bun or shower cap and sleep on it. When I shower the next morning....awesome. You could also try mixing 1/8 cup of Castor Oil in with your shampoo and really give your head a scrub down. That helps a lot too.  Of course it all depends on what type of hair you have, etc. But I found that coconut and castor oil have done great things for my hair in conjunction with washing less."
Hair,379t8p,caddysonreinert,1 point,Tue May 26 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"It really is. I'm comfortable using it in my hair, but as for my skin, I've read it can be slightly comodegenic. My skin is pretty acne-prone and I'm afraid to aggravate it.  Is the castor oil to help clean it out better? I've used castor oil for my facial oil cleansing method and it can be drying due to its cleaning properties. I'd put coconut oil in my hair more but it's so hard to get out. Even with my baking soda no-poo method. I just read that egg wash helps clarify and wash it out, have you ever tried that? Sorry about all the questions, haha."
Hair,379t8p,Calypseau,3,Tue May 26 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"This method works for me to get the oil out: 1.  Apply oil all over your dry hair.  As much as you can stand. 2.  Let it sit for as long as you can - I usually put a shower cap on and toss a towel over my pillow and sleep with it like that.  3.  Massage in conditioner to your dry oil-covered hair for a few minutes - this helps the oil to emulsify. 4.  Rinse, shampoo, and condition as usual."

Hair,379t8p,caddysonreinert,1 point,Tue May 26 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, no problem.   I'm super acne prone and it happens to help me, but my little sister is acne prone, she tried coconut oil on her face one time and it did was more harm than good. So I think it's very much an individual thing.  If you're worried about having too much in your hair, I have a solution! Haha, I LOVE using sea salt in my shampoo. So I get sea salt, crush it up as small as possible and mix it in with my shampoo for that day. It's okay to have chunks, I just try to make it as fine as possible and you really work it into your scalp. It will help to clean oil, grease, product you thought was gone, and make your hair feel amazingly soft and shiny for several days (at least for me). You want to work it into a rich lather and really focus on your scalp and then condition as normal. As far as Castor Oil drying you up, I've always been under the impression that it should be one of the least ingredients in any mixture. It has been my understanding that mixing it with other stuff, in greater volume (like your shampoo) helps with that aspect of it.   I hope this helps! There's lots of fun ways to help your hair out. I know that consistency is key. I do the salt shampoo about once every 1.5-2 weeks and coconut oil about every other time I wash my hair and it's made a huge difference in the last few months."
Hair,379t8p,ImSortofAlive,1 point,Tue May 26 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"You know, I'd heard about sea salt but never considered doing it! That sounds awesome. I love experimenting with natural ingredients for hair care. What kind of hair do you have? I'm gonna try it any way but I'm just curious. My hair is long and dry on the ends, used to be oily but not as much since I started washing it less and no longer using shampoo (I cringe thinking about how I would wash it every single day with harsh shampoo and scrub it hard... ugh)"
Hair,379t8p,ImSortofAlive,2,Tue May 26 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"Haha ya, I can't believe I used to wash my hair so much...it takes so much more time and effort and in the end you're actually messing with your hair a lot more than you think.  My hair is pretty course and wavy. It's only a little below my chin right now-I'm working on the long and slow process of growing all the color out and recovering my natural hair color after dying for the last 7-8 years. I'm about halfway there and I feel like I've been in some deep and dark places of the internet looking for hair solutions. It's fun to try them out but even better then you find one that works for you!  As far as dry ends, I think unfortunately that the only way to really address that is get it trimmed off. I was in the same boat when I started this whole process and I just eventually accepted that I'm going to have to have short hair for awhile even though I'm not a huge fan of it on myself. But getting regular trims (every 6 week, about 1 inch) had done wonders for my hair. It grows strangely fast anyways so it's good to see it finally recovering. Sea Salt and coconut oil both help growing hair too, so that's an added bonus."
Hair,379t8p,ImSortofAlive,3,Tue May 26 02:29:32 2015 UTC,If my hair is exceptionally bad I use olive oil and wrap it up in cling wrap. Its a pain in the butt but it seems to help.

Hair,37aq6s,ultimate_bot,2,Tue May 26 06:06:26 2015 UTC,Please go to a professional. Bleach is not something to take lightly. If you do go to a professional see if a high lift color is an option for you. Ask for a strand test. That is when they test the color on a small amount of hair. If it lightens enough then go with that if not then bleach will have to be used.
Hair,37aq6s,cutandcolor4cash,1 point,Wed May 27 09:07:42 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not a professional, so take my advice with a grain of salt I unfortunately can't tell you exactly how damaging bleach is, but I can tell you that it often depends on the brand, how long it's left in the hair, and even the hair itself. You WILL need to keep touching up the roots as they grow out, as long as you want the silver. This can be done every few weeks. As for the damage, it can only damage what you're bleaching. It won't have any effect on new growth. It shouldn't, and in all likelihood won't, cause or contribute to balding. Just be sure not to apply bleach directly to the scalp. Regarding your question about your natural color, of course it's possible! You just need to bleach it to a pretty light blond first. The best advice I can really give is to go to a professional, but if you do choose to do it yourself, I hope I helped. Good luck!!"

Hair,37aa20,gblevand,1 point,Tue May 26 03:28:59 2015 UTC,The best thing to do is have your stylist pick threw and lighten the brassy highlights to the same shade as the other ones. If you put a toner on you risk turning your light highlight violet or greygreen and little effect on the brassy ones or you risk having to use a darker toner to cancel out the brassy highlight but will also darken your light highlights.
Hair,37aa0k,ElleDoublevee,2,Tue May 26 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"Your hair need moisture. First comb the conditioner through your hair in the shower and dont fully rinse out the conditioner. Once you get out of the shower use a t-shirt to dry your hair and don't re-comb your hair. Next spay with a leave-in-conditioner. Try ""it's a 10"" its amazing! next apply a good curling cream like mocrocconoil curl enhancing cream to the hair. This will add more moisture and help give your curls hold. try not to touch it while it dries. once its dry if you still have some frizz spay the leave-in-conditioner on your hand and lightly run it over your frizz. play around with products. Curls are hard to figure out. try this out and hopefully it will help."

My suggestion would be when your hair is almost dry, apply a dollop of mousse, blow dry using a round brush (there are tutorials online if you need to know), once dry, lightly tease the hair on top of the head and apply wax to the hair to keep it in place or even a light hold hairspray.

All soft is the best I found for my hair type, and I also recommend never combing or brushing your hair. EVER. I wash, then detangle with conditioner, using my palms to push the curls back into their natural form. I rinse conditioner without my using my hands, and use palms again with towel to remove moisture. Do not scrunch, just blot. I use goldwell's lagoom gel and palm the curls again focusing first on the ends, then lightly at the roots to smooth frizz. Air dry or use your car vents to speed up the process but don't touch it until it's dry. Once it's dry, I palm it again for a little more bounce, and to break up any crunchy spots. This gel does not flake or crunch very much if you use the right amount."

Hair,36zisw,Puggerfly,4,Sat May 23 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"agreed! the color looks good - and going colored dark to lighter sucks, probably one of the most damaging things you can do to your hair. do not attempt fixing it at home! you will probably end up with brassy damaged hair. better to let it fade a bit and color your regrowth with a lvl 5 if you want to be a shade lighter. there will be some contrast and having lighter roots looks more unnatural than darker roots but if you have a good colorist they should be able to make the transition relatively smooth. also do some fun styling! curl it, do a simple updo or a faux bob, have fun with it, try something new. different looks/hairstyles sometimes look better on dark hair vs light hair or vice versa because of how they catch and reflect light. products with shine are great for dark hair. light hair tends to quickly look greasy but dark hair absorbs light so you can def add more shine."

Thank you for the compliments everyone, it's definitely a big transition. It looks chocolatey and wonderful in direct sunlight. My gripe is that it looks black under everyday (florescent lighting at work, or warm home) lighting . I would love to stay dark, I just don't know how to get to the point where it looks actually brown under the fluorescent/standard house light."
Hair,36zisw,alizarincrimson7,1 point,Sat May 23 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"Lighting is a tricky thing. My bright orange hair would look light ash brown under fluorescents. Find someone who has the color you like in the lighting you want, and take a picture of their hair in daylight."
Hair,36zisw,pandgela,4,Sat May 23 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"i also came in to tell you it looks incredible! sometimes change takes a little while to get used to.   if you don't like it, go back to the salon and tell them you're not happy with the results. remember that your stylist tried to give you something you wanted! some of the responses in this thread are kind of mean - be firm and tell them you want it to be fixed but no need for demands and scenes.   good luck! :)"

Hair,36zisw,Antoinette_1,1 point,Sat May 23 13:43:55 2015 UTC,"Go to a professional salon and get a color remover done. They are non-damaging and if you only have one application of color on virgin hair it should come out no problem! :) But PLEASE get it done professionally. Trust me, it's a way better choice than doing it yourself, screwing up and having to go to a salon to get it fixed anyways."

Hair,36zisw,that_shortgirl,1 point,Sat May 23 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of with everyone here in that I think it looks nice on you, but honestly, your color will definitely lighten up in a couple of weeks and using color removers and clarifying shampoo is only going to do more damage than necessary. I would just wait a couple of weeks, and if you're still unhappy with it, then you could start considering other avenues. But especially because your hair was lighter before, that color will certainly come out a bit."
Hair,36zisw,alyssmill,1 point,Sat May 23 17:54:39 2015 UTC,honestly I think it looks great. I would give yourself a week or two to adjust to the color change before trying to remove it. I think the couple of weeks will have given you enough washes to lighten up the dye and you may find you really like it then!
Hair,36zisw,am2370,1 point,Sat May 23 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"The matrix colors that I once used in the salon tend to fade really quickly. If you just wait you'll probably find that it will become lighter. If you're desperate and also have a good conditioner, wash your hair with dishwashing Liquid. I know it sounds insane but it is a lot harsher than clarifying shampoo. It will dry your hair out so condition like crazy afterwards and even add a leave in treatment."

Hair,36zisw,parachutekitten,-3,Fri May 29 02:21:40 2015 UTC,Buy a box of color oops. You can buy it at most drug stores. If she didn't bleach it (why would she?) it'll take most if not all of it out. Then you can redye it. If you want no red at all you'll need to go for an ashy brown and not all dyes look alike on people so be prepared.
Hair,36zisw,mandanasty,1 point,Sat May 23 16:21:34 2015 UTC,How much damage will I be doing to my hair if I am taking out this permanent dye? I've read reviews on that product ranging from it really taking the color out to it frying the hair and ruining the texture.

Hair,36zor5,emachristina,4,Sat May 23 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like shit quality extensions, most likely Kanekelon, which wont dye with traditional dyes. For a full head of real hair you would be looking at 1000k.  Micro links have a reputation for ripping out your own hair, and thus making the problem even worse. Bonded will also cause a lot of damage to your hair. The best solution is track extensions that clip in, and moving them around the scalp from day to day, but they are uncomfortable and dont feel natural. Any kind of extension is going to have its drawbacks and not be natural, your scalp needs to breath, and attaching stuff to hair strands will compromise your hair. My colleagues all do it because they want quick money, they don't care about your hair quality.   Can i ask why you need to have immediate long hair? Take them out, get regular cuts, and it will grow. Or go to a nice salon and get a stylish cut! Also, don't use over the counter hair dye, it's designed to penetrate any type of hair, so it's going to damage what hair you have and not help you grow it out!"
Hair,36zor5,seius,1 point,Sat May 23 14:54:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply and how would you suggest I was a message to the lady who put them in saying I would like a refund?

Hair,36zor5,pandgela,3,Sat May 23 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"some hair for extensions is collected out of hairbrushes and so it's already dead and damaged from the women who it belonged to. high quality hair will come from women who grow it out and cut it, like women in india who do it for 'religious' purposes. when processed, high quality hair will be laid out so the follicles all face in the same direction so when you brush you hair you're not brushing against the grain on half of it and with the grain on the other. when the hair is processed it becomes soft, manageable and luxurious but you don't really know what you've purchased until the first time you wash your hair and the junk they've put into it comes out.  basically you've been scammed! you paid for quality hair and received cheap, subpar hair she probably bought on the internet for 50 dollars.   my hair dresser recently had two girls come in for the removal of really poorly done extensions where they basically had to leave with pixie cuts. she reported this other stylist to our local trades college and the better business bureau. i would definitely do the same because this woman is a fraud.  good luck!"

Hair,36xvqz,JayQue,2,Sat May 23 00:57:14 2015 UTC,Considered a perm? Curls make all that shit go away cause like no one cares where the curls sit - they always look hot and perms are not terrible on the hair anymore AND so much variety out there in the type of curls or waves you can get. Just a thought as your colour would look amazing with some curls as well as because you have that crazy kink to your hair it would take really well..AND they are super easy to look after - minimal heat - lots of conditioner and boom done! Like this ... http://imgur.com/Lh0T5Vw (you would lose the ends though and the length will curl up a bit for the first week then drop back down as it settles just FYI)  Or start to part completely down the side as it look like you have only done part of the part to sweep across in the shots which looks a little odd to me? Like this I mean - http://imgur.com/yHfIM19  Or side part angled bob cut maybe ? Takes some work to keep this looking perfect though (not me as don't like lots of hair time or heat - drives me nuts) but you're pretty and could pull it off really well. Like this http://imgur.com/vEXsaKZ  ( they like blend the bangs into side of the cut)  All of these options are good as you don't have to put your hair up (unless you want to learn to maybe?)  Or cut the bangs back in I guess ?  Just some ideas for you - keep us posted on what you decide :)
Hair,36xvqz,Moonstlm,2,Sat May 23 07:16:21 2015 UTC,"I had a perm in fourth grade and I am still not over the fact that instead of the loose curls I was promised I had these goldilocks-type ones forever. So I will forever have a thing against perms. Today I decided to part it completely down the whole side thanks to your suggestion... even though I guess in hindsight it seems obvious, the parting in the middle and sweeping it over it just a leftover habit from when I had the bangs and had to clip my hair to the side. Thank you for the compliment, that's really sweet of you! That haircut is interesting but like you said, it takes some work and I just hate that, blahhhh. I am also skeptical about getting side bangs because like all bangs, they need to be cut like, ridiculously often (the reason why I decided to grow out my bangs). When I do put my hair up, I usually just do a quick low side ponytail as it is the easiest for me. Whenever I try to do a regular one, I get a stupid bump at the top. No matter how much I brush it back and flat, it's never flat. Even with gel, etc. I remember this girl in highschool that in the middle of class just took her long hair and put it in a perfectly smooth ponytail in like ten seconds. I was just like, wtffffff. But I really only put it up when I'm doing something where it's super windy, or I'm cleaning, or things like that. So it is nice to have the option."

Also, I know you said you struggle with braiding, but I think a braid would suit you well so maybe watch some YouTube and see if you can give it a go. As for cut, I would say a bob.

Hair,36yp5f,ShesNotATreeDashy,2,Sat May 23 06:10:27 2015 UTC,Welcome to the wonderful world of hair dyeing! It's kinda like tattoos... once you start you want more! Your hair looks light enough that you can use Manic Panic without bleaching first and still get good results. And it's short so it's easy enough to change it up more often. Mine is long and dark.... pain in the ass to make colorful but I still do it! :) You could do a small streak of a bright color. Manic Panic does wash out eventually. The longer you leave it on in the beginning the longer it stays on later. Or you could do hair chalk. It washes out after one wash. Or go big and bleach it and then do multi colored streaks! Or all one crazy color! I love coloring my hair!

We don't have the best hair of animal kingdom. Most other animals (like those whom we use for natural brushes) have stronger hair than ours.  Overall, makeup brushes do retain damage over time. This is why it is stressed to be gentle with them. Avoiding vigorously rubbing them (like when drying with a towel after a deep clean, I prefer to press the water out and hang them upside down) will really help make the most of them. Adding conditioner or oil actually ruins them, it makes them more likely to shed and they will not apply product in the same way (I know there was a pin going around about using dish soap and olive oil, this is a horrible). I like using Johnson&Johnson 2-in-1 Baby shampoo with conditioner, it's my favorite, especially because I have sensitive skin, I have to be careful with what I use."

Hair,36ymuc,World_Of_Amie,0,Tue May 26 00:23:58 2015 UTC,Shampoo takes all the moisture out of your hair to clean it. Not all shampoos leave your hair rough the ones that do need a good conditioner with them.   Although if you use a high quality moisture shampoo you will not always need conditioner as long as its the right one for your hair type. If colour or treated hair I always recommend shampoo.

I know appointments may be hard to get with colorists in your area, however for the kind of change you are desiring, I would highly suggest seeking one out and not diy this...many things can go wrong, one of them being an undesired level 7-8 red orange.

Hair,36vkb4,alittlejstillz,16,Fri May 22 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"It seems like technique is the issue mostly. The most important thing about blowdrying is making sure you have the concentrator attatchment. Even if you use proper technique, you will never get as shiny and smooth without it, because the air flow is not being directed in one place. Without the concentrator the air will blow like a cone, spreading out fair, and not providing enough concentration to make sure you are only drying where and how you want.  rough dry your hair until it is not soaking wet. You want it to still be damp....but if you're roundbrushing sopping hair....you're wasting time and effort. After you rough dry your hair, you will need to section it into smaller parts that make it easier for you to handle a brush with.   I have a format that I like to use. I make a part that seperates the front from the back, using the ears as a guide. Front of ears->front behind ears->back. Then, make horizontal sections. Usually three in the back will do, and two in the front. The reason you do this is so that you do not take more hair than your brush will allow.  Brush type: Boar bristle is always best for this. Even synthetic boar bristle brush. A boar bristle is mainly used for smoothing and shine. A 'normal' round brush is normally used for creating curl and wave. For fine hair, blonde boar is best. It will adjust the tension for you. My favorite high end is Ibiza and a really good low end/mid range is the Olivia Garden brush.   A very important thing to note, is that you should be holding the concentrator in the same direction that your hair grows. If you point it from the bottom up, you are blowing against the hair shaft and creating frizz. Blow drying ""with"" the hair will smooth down the hair shaft and give you a smoother finish.  See how in this picture the blowdryer is directed down with the hair? This is the direction you want to aim for (although sometimes it is impossible to maintain on yourself, at least be concious of where the nozzle is directing air flow)  When you dry the hair you want to use a medium heat. Make several passes with medium heat with the round brush. (you don't have to spin the brush, just gently curve it as you pull your hair through. The round shape will direct the hair underneath for you mostly) After your hair feels dry, make a few passes with the cold setting. This helps to close the cuticle, and really give your hair a lot of shine and helps to set your style. Hot things swell, cold things condense. This happens with your hair shaft. When you dry it with hot air, the cuticle swells and creates frizz. When you finish it off with cool air, the cuticle lays down, and the frizz is gone :)  Also! Cool pro tip. The section at the very top of your head, if you blow dry it ""forward"" towards your face, you will get a lot of volume!   Good luck with your hair :) Hope I was any help Sorry for the length of this xD Blow drying is my specialty @-@"

Hair,36vkb4,laenooneal,3,Sun May 24 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"Try using a spray in leave-in conditioner, from roots to ends.   When blow drying, use tension with a round brush to get the frizz to smooth out.  Both of these together will get the result you want. Look up youtube vids for ways to blowdry, and practice. No one gets a perfect blowout on the first try :)  Source: DryBar stylist"

Hair,36vkb4,BeBeautyAshley,2,Fri May 22 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"The only thing that works for me is straightening with a good quality hair straightener. I've had some success with blow drying with a round brush, and using a small amount of hairspray or mousse to tame the frizzies. Some people say rubbing a dryer sheet through your hair helps (reduces static) but it doesn't work for me. Worth a shot though."

From your instagram pics, it looks like you've been training your hair to a side part (or maybe it's naturally like that?), and I bet it would look really cute with those short, wispy, side-swept bangs like she has here :  http://imgur.com/ODxWvWF It looks like your hair is pretty thick, so they may have to texturize and thin out the bangs to get that wispy look.

Hair,36v7h9,smarchles,3,Fri May 22 11:39:53 2015 UTC,"Hairstylist here! You have the right components you are just lacking consistency and intent.   Blow dry your hair as full as possible.  To prevent frizz keep your head right side up and point your blow dryer down the cuticle. Apply volumizer  at the roots (Volu  spray by Davines)  Elevate your hair at a 90 degree angle and blow dry the roots up. Point your blow dryer so it's still going along the cuticle.   Once your hair is completely dry use a one inch curling iron.  Feed the hair at your roots in first and slowly wrap it around. All sections should be curled away from your face towards the back. Leave the ""sausages"" to sit and cool for 5 min and then use your fingers to break it up. Backlace the roots and ends for a fuller look. Finish with hairpray to prevent the sausages from forming again. (Davines  Medium or Strong hold Spray)  I recommend watching a curling tutorial on YouTube. So many people don't know proper curling form  and the roots end up flat and the ends too curly. Another factor is only professional curling irons tend to hold and look good. Also keep in mind the woman in the photo could have thicker hair then you naturally."
Hair,36v7h9,DANICUNT,1 point,Fri May 22 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rundown - particularly on how to blowdry! Also I'll definitely look for curling technique youtube videos. Can I ask one other question - hair rollers (either heated or those velcro ones), are they more or less effective than using a curling iron? Or is it all sort of same same?"
Hair,36v7h9,DANICUNT,2,Sat May 23 01:20:36 2015 UTC,With rollers you will achieve a different look then this.  Probably closer to a  blow out. It would look good just different then the photo. :3

Hair,36tyh3,KatonaE,3,Fri May 22 02:32:59 2015 UTC,"You actually want to get your hair highlighted and then get treatments. If you get the treatment after dying your hair, it'll help reverse some of the damage done and help hold the color in. If you dye your hair after getting the treatment done, it can actually strip some of the treatment out. Make sure your salon knows to use sulfate free products on your hair, or it'll strip the keratin out faster too."
Hair,36rcsf,MissJess132,24,Thu May 21 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"Oh jesus, that is in no way an ombre.. it honestly looks like an old highlights job"
Hair,36rcsf,fauxphantom,12,Thu May 21 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"I always recommend going back to the original stylist. Just say that when you got it home it wasn't quite what you wanted. Any reputable stylist would rather have a happy client any day! If he catches any kind of attitude, then speak to a manager.  This could easily be mended by doing a gloss with a demi-permanent color close to your natural melted into a clear color on the ends! Best of luck!"
Hair,36rcsf,ambird138,3,Thu May 21 16:48:13 2015 UTC,Don't be afraid to complain if you aren't happy with what you got or if you didn't get what you asked for. You are paying (a lot) for something and most salons will happily try to fix it for you. I'd go back and discuss it with the stylist.
Hair,36rcsf,graveyardgirl,1 point,Thu May 21 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing just happened to me. Same base color,  same highlights, same price. Like you I liked it when it was styled in the salon but went home and immediately regretted it. Did you end up getting it fixed?"

They were more than happy to help me, free of charge. He ended up lightening the entire bottom to make it lighter, and darkened the entire crown of my head. (About a $180 process) He then styled it for me ($60) and refused a tip (which I wouldn't have given him anyway). Simply through their customer service I will be going back. I suggest going back to where you were to talk to the stylist / owner. Make sure you say you want a re-do service free of charge. Goodluck!"
Hair,36rcsf,disctwo,2,Sat Jun 20 23:24:09 2015 UTC,Thank you! You've inspired me to reach out to them. Hopefully they will fix it.
Hair,36rcsf,DANICUNT,-2,Sat Jun 20 23:27:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say you threw 220 out the window at all. This is clearly not what you wanted but that investment makes it possible for you to go call back and explain it's not what you wanted. Bring an exact picture.   You also have an incredible amount of hair. If I was your stylist I would have charged you 250 for a full ombre service without tip. Or explained properly that it takes a few appointments to get most of the ombres  you see online. It's not a color easily done overnight.   With these things in mind I suggest calling back and booking a redo service. Explain what you didn't want to see and keep in mind the best hair colors take time.
Hair,36sknu,Pulchirin,2,Thu May 21 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say continue with what you're doing, it sounds like a good routine. I do the same thing, shampoo every second/third day and then conditioner or just water on the days I don't shampoo. I still get the effects from not using shampoo every day.  Coconut oil is great as a treatment because it's one of the oils that can penetrate your hair. I'd leave it in for at least a couple of hours, though. Personally I use coconut oil as a daily leave in on my lengths, but my hair is very thick and this might not be great for thinner hair types that get greasy."
Hair,36sknu,graveyardgirl,2,Thu May 21 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  Oh, good. I was afraid that I was just going to have to live some days with day-old hair product, haha.  So I'll either just wash with water or water and conditioner, except for the occasional shampoo day. And then at night I'll leave in coconut oil, and then in the morning, maybe apply som argan oil during the day."
Hair,36sknu,lessonsinnj,1 point,Fri May 22 04:51:02 2015 UTC,"Avoid pretty much all hair products from Sally's, and read the ingredients on the ones you do buy.

I bought like 100 of them (they're about 20 inches long), twisted them together to get about 10-15 of these and then I wrap my slightly damp hair around them pretty much the way I want the final curl to be. So the hair isn't all bunched together at the top but goes down a past my chin (my hair when straight almost reaches the top of my breasts). Then I wrap both ends of the pipe cleaners around the middle part to make it stay where it belongs. I use about 10 of them for my entire head, the whole thing takes me about 10-15 minutes.

I had them in on my damp hair for about and hour and a half (until my hair dried) with no product and the curls lasted for days. You might be able to get the fatter, bubble tea straws to work for you too. Also you could do something similar with strips of paper towel. The cutegirlshairstyles channel on youtube has a video for that one."

They look kind of like this since I don't use just one pipe cleaner but quite a few for one strand of hair. The pipe cleaners twisted together are around half an inch in diameter I'd say. It might be more difficult making that work for hair that is as long as yours though, since pipe cleaners aren't usually that long."

Hair,36n1o6,Chocopups,1 point,Wed May 20 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like my hair. Hopefully this will work for you, but what I do is run my hairbrush under water for a second, then spray it with one or two sprays of the Its a Ten. Brush very gently starting from the ends and re-wet/re-spray as you move to a new section of hair. Depending on how long it takes you, your hair might be damp still by the time you're finished, and if it is you can use a hair dryer to style (for me, it takes less than 30 seconds to dry with the dryer when I'm doing this because your hair is only superficially damp). You can dry it straight or put it back into a bun style to let it dry if you're drying to get the curls back. Good luck!"
Hair,36n1o6,lookasunflower,1 point,Wed May 20 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"That first picture looks like it's been curled with heat and the second look more natural. Either way, it sounds like you need more moisture. Try using a leave in conditioner?"
Hair,36n1o6,fauxphantom,1 point,Wed May 20 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"Try using a hair mask once a week. I've bought several,  but I love taking an avacado half and filling the pit with honey. Mash it up and put it on dry hair. Let it set for 20 minutes and wash as usual.  If you have long hair than just double the amounts. My hair is so moisturized when I do this. I love it."
Hair,36n1o6,paroleviolator,1 point,Wed May 20 19:32:24 2015 UTC,What about using a curl control creme in your hair while it's wet? I use Here Come The Curls by Lee Stafford in mine and it's the only thing that keeps the frizz away for me. I squeeze it in while the hair is wet and then I braid it so that it curls overnight.

Hair,36l21e,watermelonandsoda,2,Wed May 20 04:19:48 2015 UTC,If you get your hair cut and ask for it styled (curled) they should most definitely accommodate you. There is usually an extra charge for that so be aware of that. Hair stylists can also just style your hair if you don't want it cut. Just explain what you want when you book your appointment. They could also suggest a hair product that will reduce frizz and damage due to the heat of the iron.

Those things are purely trade related and I would review the place if I were you.  Your review might save someone else the headache you're going through.

Hair,36gmtu,NickyNice,2,Tue May 19 06:13:05 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds counterintuitive, but your hair is probably greasy so fast because you wash it every day. Stripping the oil off your hair and scalp every day is known to send your oil glands into overdrive to compensate and keep up with being washed away all the time. Try to reduce your washings to every other day, then every third or fourth day. Your hair really will start to take longer to get greasy. Take my anecdotal personal experiences for reference: when I don't touch (therefore don't physically stimulate my scalp which increases oil production) or wash my hair too much, I really can go over a week without washing before it gets greasy. If I touch my hair through the day or touch my scalp, it's greasy that same day."

I have this stuff called pomade (I was thinking maybe that could contribute to the greasiness, but it got greasy fast before I even used that) I use to kinda keep it where it should be but I still probably run my hand through my hair more than 100 times a day because I am constantly convinced it is messed up. Lol I will try my best to break the habit and see if that helps. Thanks for your advice :))"
Hair,36gzam,zapatosestanbien,2,Tue May 19 09:08:11 2015 UTC,Henna dyes can have horrible results if you want to strip it out.  You CANNOT go in with just any color stripper or bleach.  I've heard of that stuff burning and smoking when bleach is put over it.  Do your research to find the right way to strip it just in case.
Hair,36gzam,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Tue May 19 18:27:24 2015 UTC,Why not use regular dye?
Hair,36gzam,mmomentomori,1 point,Tue May 19 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"Henna is pretty much permanent and dangerous to remove. Don't do it unless you're very sure it's what you want.  Trying to remove it will probably fry your hair, in some rare cases hair has been known to actually melt. Use a regular dye instead if you're unsure. Much easier to remove. It's not very damaging to dye your hair darker so you don't have much to worry about. Use a semi-permanent dye the first time, that way it'll fade if you don't like the color."

Hair,36dttx,muffstache88,2,Tue May 19 10:01:38 2015 UTC,"Copper red! Warning as stylist and a blonde who has gone red  you will have to get the color refreshed a few times, like three times. But I could totally see you with a shorter haircut and fiery copper hair. I would keep it pretty long on top so it can be more versatile. Check out Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansson's newer short style."
Hair,36g8gf,fortunecookie18,1 point,Tue May 19 03:40:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on what color you're trying to get to.  Color stripper is kind of a fool proof way of removing color and you're still going to turn that hot orange/yellow color as you would with bleach.  Bleach if it's not done correctly can leave you spotty, leaving behind some of the darker remnant of the old color on spots you may have missed in application. Biggest thing right now is to decide what color you're trying to get to then the rest of the process will become clear. A lightening shampoo won't do anything to your hair, they're made for blondes to remove color drabbing deposits."

Hair,36ew00,bulletproof_love,3,Mon May 18 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a stylist, but between you and me I think it's great to learn to do your hair yourself. I always did my own hair growing up (I've been to the salon like twice in my life) and it's a fun way to experiment.  Bleach can be tricky to work with if you're not super skilled, though. You run the risk of a splotchy result or frying your hair. It's very important to cover all your hair evenly, while at the same time working fast so that your hair doesn't sit too long.  Are you even sure you need to bleach? Your hair is far from the worst base for a vibrant purple. How light is your base under the blue/purple? If you're worried about the purple not being vibrant enough over the color you have now, you can use some bleach-free fading methods to make the colors lighter."
Hair,36ew00,graveyardgirl,1 point,Mon May 18 22:28:06 2015 UTC,thanks for the advice.  I would say the base is closer to an orange-y strawberry blond if anything.  I previously had it pink & purple ombre which turned it orange so the second ombre turned it this color.  if you want a picture I can provide one but I just assumed I would need to bleach since the couple of times my friend has done it she's bleached it first.
Hair,36ew00,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Mon May 18 22:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say bleach is a last resort, you do need to fade a lot of that green out, but the pink on the bottom isn't going to affect much.  I've tried a few of the non-bleaching methods for getting color out and the vitamin C one does kind of work for Semi perm hair color (which is the creative color you've got).  If you need to lighten anything it'll be your roots, but probably not until the next time you color your hair, and by the looks of it your hair is already very light naturally so there isn't any kind of need for strong bleach."

Hair,36e57n,Kelebro,1 point,Mon May 18 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"Some people find their hair quality improves a lot if they stop washing every day, but if what you're doing now works for you there's not really a reason to stop doing it. If you do find that your hair is very dry or gets greasy very fast, washing less often may change that."
Hair,36e57n,graveyardgirl,1 point,Mon May 18 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"It's not great for many people's hair because it strips the hair's natural oils, which dries it out. If your hair gets too dry or too greasy if you go more than a day without washing it, then I'd recommend finding a time when you won't need to look super presentable, like a long weekend, and just not washing your hair. Good luck :)"

Hair,36e57n,88_Persian_Cats,1 point,Mon May 18 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't get too dry, then I think you're fine washing it daily ;)"
Hair,36e57n,ICUNurseNessa,1 point,Mon May 18 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"I always believed that my hair was naturally oily. I noticed that if I went two or three days in between washes, it became less oily. Apparently hair produces more oil to try and replace the oil you are washing out. But, if you never notice that your hair is becoming dry or brittle, I do not see a problem with washing it daily."
Hair,36e57n,bitterbuddhist,1 point,Tue May 19 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"I think it totally depends.  My hair doesn't love to be washed every single day, but I am also a nurse so on days I work shifts back to back its a necessity for obvious reasons regardless.    I have a friend who is SUPER greasy.  She can shampoo in the AM and my 12 she looks like she hasn't washed her hair in 5 days."
Hair,36c6wa,williamthebastardd,2,Mon May 18 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I really like the wavy, voluminous and straight-out-of-the-beach (frizzy/dry?) effect. What kind of product should I be using to attain a similar effect? Would sea salt spray help with that effect? I have straight, dark hair (I'm Asian) and my hair length is around the same as Matt Corby's (in this video). The only hair products I have at home right now are: hair wax and hair spray  Here are some photos from the past few months and today with a pony tail and my fringe pulled back. The only thing I seem to be missing is a proper beard and curly-ish hair... asian problems haha.  Your feedback is highly appreciated! Thank you!"

Hair,36c6wa,jxjen,3,Mon May 18 14:04:35 2015 UTC,"Idk why this is downvoted. OP's hair looks thick and super straight.  Usually hair like this (Asian) doesn't take well to sprays/waxes/holds because the texture ends up becoming very unnatural looking(hard or waxy, clumpy), whereas the beachy look's texture is supposed to look like natural waves without product.  A perm makes the hairs natural texture curly without product, which is what OP is looking for...   Perms don't only apply to old ladies and the 70's with super tight curls. You can have any variation of tight to relaxed curls!"
Hair,36c6wa,jxjen,1 point,Tue May 19 02:00:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for your thoughtful reply! Not sure why your comment was downvoted either... I thought your comment was perfectly fine :)  I understand what you mean about the unnatural looking hair after applying product on straight asian hair! It's a pain.

I would add some lowlights, for depth,  and use a waving iron, maybe like this: http://www.sallybeauty.com/barrel-waver/SBS-255366,default,pd.html to add some volume, and texture.  I wouldn't worry too much though! I think you look super cute.  I cut my hair short 2 years ago, hated it at first, but I love it now.  You'll learn to love it, or grow it out, either way, it'll be great!"

Hair,36bt1c,ouijabore,1 point,Mon May 18 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"Some loose curls tousled a bit would work just as well as waves and are easy with a wand, I just suggested a specialty iron because I, myself am a lazy bum and that's easier :)  For straight hair, I would say it looks awesome now, but adding some volume to the crown with teasing would take it to the next level!  Adding texture, height, and depth will take away the thinness you're sensing here!"
Hair,36bt1c,bowie_in_space,1 point,Mon May 18 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"Highlights and/or lowlights will give the illusion of light and depth, ie will make it look thicker. I agree with some texture/waves! Nothing too structured, just tousled and relaxed. When you wear it straight try drying it upside down with some sort of mousse, rootboost, volumizer, etc. and tease it a bit. More height at the top will give the illusion of a longer, thinner face if you feel like your face looks too round"
Hair,36bt1c,Solsed,1 point,Mon May 18 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's cute, but if you think it's really unflattering I'd advise teasing it.

At sallys, buy the quick blue powder and 20 volume developer.  Before putting bleach in your hair coat it generously with an oil of your choice.  Process 20 minutes under a cap and give it a conditioning treatment.  Wash that out and apply the grey of your choice.  If you have any professional friends I'd say to ask them to get you Joico's Titanium semi permanent color.  Process with heat rinse with cold water.  I'm not sure what sallys has for semi colors, maybe someone else will share.  Oh and pravana...."

On the skin, it does similar things, and can and will create chemical burns as it eats through your skin, and it can cause permanent follicle damage.  - licensed cosmetology teacher & science nerd."
Hair,369sa8,tlmuah,1 point,Sun May 17 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm not being rude, but it won't destroy hair or skin if it is used properly (i.e. only leaving it on for a few minutes), though it certainly will if left on too long"
Hair,369sa8,88_Persian_Cats,1 point,Sun May 17 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"Properly, sure. I'm talking about the chemistry of how it works, and the effects when left on. People usually use it improperly (40vol on the scalp, burning sensations, breakage, relaxing their curls) it is actually safe to leave on hair for over an hour - if you know what you are doing. Definitely go see a professional."
Hair,369sa8,tlmuah,0,Mon May 18 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person.  You can't generalize like that.  There are bleaches designed for use super close or on the scalp for application and processing.  Most bleaches aren't made more on the scalp and will cause sensitivity and possible chemical burns even when it is used corrected.  Some folks have extremely sensitive skin, but still insist on using bleach on or near their scalp and end up with these burns.  And getting bleach on your skin does burn. EDIT: There are also different processing times depending on your starting hair level and the end result as well as strength of lightener.  Most bleaches process for approx 20 minutes and are safe to process for up to 90 minutes, so taking it off 'after a few minutes' isn't proper use.  There kind of is a reason there are licensed professionals."
Hair,369sa8,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Mon May 18 02:16:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not a professional, so whatever I say should be taken with a grain of salt, I suppose. All I meant was that bleach won't cause serious burns to everyone's scalp. I never said that he shouldn't go to a professional. I never said that bleach won't ever burn skin. I never said that everyone's hair and skin were the same. I never said that all bleaches should always be applied directly to the scalp. I also never asked for a lecture. I'm sorry that I'm not a barber/stylist who is familiar with every type of lightener under the sun. Thank you, and have a nice day."

Hair,36a9od,gayrudeboys,1 point,Sun May 17 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"Relaxer like the other person said.   If you don't want to do that, either buy a straightener or cut your hair shorter depending on how curly it is. Styling afterwards depends as well. I personally find blowdrying on a low heat setting + some putty works best, but you probably have to experiment and find out.  Shoutout to /r/curlyhair.  ETA: Go to a barber and show them that.

Hair,3688to,missaeiska,10,Sun May 17 03:06:16 2015 UTC,"Your hair and scalp are oily because you strip it every time you wash with a clarifying shampoo, that's your body trying to replace those important oils.

Make sure you're using a quality shampoo, preferably a professional line. Drugstore shampoos are mostly wax filler which will cause oil buildup. You can use a hair oil on your ends but stay away from the roots until your scalp balances back out."
Hair,368117,renegadebetty,6,Sun May 17 01:41:04 2015 UTC,"When you lightened the hair to add the teal color, the roots did not lift evenly or take the dye evenly. Or both. A retouch at this point is tricky, as you will end up with a 'band' of two toned roots... Possibly ending up with red roots again."
Hair,368117,renegadebetty,1 point,Sun May 17 07:09:26 2015 UTC,My hair used to be white bangs and black for the rest from all white and I just threw teal on over the faded dark brown and white hair. I didnt prepare my hair to dye.
Hair,368117,Solsed,2,Sun May 17 07:34:49 2015 UTC,"Ok that makes sense then.  Even though your bangs were white, the hair nearest your roots was affected differently by the bleach that lightened them. At light levels, this difference is very subtle and may be unnoticeable. Once you introduce a new pigment to the previously lightened hair, the changes become a bit more obvious.   I've seen some funky combinations come out of semi and Demi perm fashion colors before... Faded out fuchsia + violet = cobalt & deep sea blue. No clue how it happened.    It doesn't seem super noticeable tho, I'd throw another wash of teal over it, maybe go just a bit more deep blue\teal at just the roots to hide it?"

Also adding Vaseline into the places you don't want dyed (including on your skin) will help."
Hair,3661yo,Han-Burger,1 point,Sat May 16 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"Wrap the hair in foil as you dye. Then, place a shower cap over the foiled parts. That will keep the dye from spreading onto your shorter hair & scalp."

Hair,3628yy,nthensome,4,Fri May 15 14:12:04 2015 UTC,It depends on what your current hair colour is.  Darker hair may be harder. Lemon juice mixed with conditioner has given me subtle but noticeable results (I have auburn hair). Just make sure to rinse it out (:
Hair,3628yy,PointBlankShot,2,Fri May 15 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"If you're going to the pool or beach, get your hair wet then use lemon juice and let it dry in the sun. It dries kind of sticky so you will want to be able to either rinse or wash your hair afterwards. I also use the John Frieda Go Blonder (maybe called Go Lighter?) spray, which would be good to use if you don't want to have to deal with sticky lemon juice-y hair.  However, I'm already a dirty blonde that lightens a lot in the summer, so I can't speak if your hair is much darker than that."

Hair,3628yy,graveyardgirl,1 point,Sat May 16 09:45:48 2015 UTC,"Both John Freida and Lee Stafford make similar sprays that work the same way. Sprays like this will probably be the most effective thing if you want your hair to be lightened in the sun, but don't expect huge results (especially if you have darker hair) and it might just make your hair brassy rather than lighter. They can also dry your hair out if you use them too much."

Hair,360r92,mustachemouse,2,Fri May 15 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Toner might not help in this case. If you do tone it, it will not get lighter, it will just be a dark blonde/light brown. You can add the color right on top, or you can bleach it again. It may not be as vivid as you want if you just color over it, though. If you bleach it again, you don't have to leave it on as long as you did the first time since you just need to lighten it a little more. Since your natural color is fairly dark, a double process like that is the only way to get it really light blonde.  Or you could soap cap it. One ounce of bleach powder (or scoop; whatever the kit has you measure to mix with an ounce of developer), one ounce of developer, one ounce warm water, and a dash of shampoo. Mix the bleach before  adding the other two ingredients. This will lighten your hair while being more gentle than straight bleach. Good luck!"

My only complaint would be that it smells awful, but that's a small price to pay for what it does. It has always removed permanent dye for me without any damage. Once even from bright orange back to platinum blonde in one go.  I wish we could use this stuff in the salon, though I also get why we don't. Some people find that the color will just come back after a few days (re-oxidation), but I never had that problem."
Hair,35yrfn,thrownormanaway,1 point,Thu May 14 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Let it grow as much as possible between trims. You will need fewer trims when you hair does not break or get damaged by styling or how you wear it. Then, when you trim, it's two steps forward then one step back, not the other way round. Try to avoid heat styling, brushing (use a wide tooth comb gently on wet hair, finger comb otherwise.), washing often (2-3 days in between, maybe less), or putting it up in tight elastics.   Get it trimmed by a competent professional and explicitly tell them that you are interested in only the most subtle of trims and do not want any significant length taken off.   Carry on like this over several years and before you know it your hair will get long."

Hair,35xyom,joy_lo,3,Thu May 14 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"Also, pro tip, if you want the curls to last uber long: curl each strand and keep the curl rolled up with a pin/clip. Once the curls have completely cooled off, remove the pins.   Heat forms the curl, but cold fixates the curl. If you leave the curl hanging while it still hot, the heat combined with gravity tends to pull the curl straight back down :)"

Hair,35mfn6,NoxaVicis,5,Mon May 11 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"If you feel strongly enough about a hair cut to compare it to amputation,  do not jump into anything so drastic as an undercut.   Start small,  clean up the ends,  get some nice long layers and angles around the front,  and maybe even a nice long side swept fringe.  You have gorgeous hair,  btw."

Hair,35l7ym,-AceOfSpades-,7,Mon May 11 12:25:51 2015 UTC,"Dry shampoo! Or if you don't have that, I found that whenever I would put aerosol sunscreen on my face it would blow into my hair and that would oddly enough make it look washed as well.  Or you could tie a bandana headband and cover it up that way."
Hair,35l7ym,wolfinsocks,3,Mon May 11 13:17:49 2015 UTC,How light is your hair? A dry powder might work for you!

Take a tiny bit of shampoo and clean my scalp, I typically only worry about my scalp...If I try to was ALL of my hair I would waste so much water....Anyways I'll wash my scalp and rinse the shampoo out with a bottle of water. Then I'd use sea salt spray and brush it through one it dried, to take some of the oil out without making it sticky and gross from powder.  That, or just braid it."
Hair,35l7ym,Jes1oli,1 point,Mon May 11 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"try moroccanoil dry shampoo they make it for light or dark hair. Its awesome! Or sprinkle some baby powder on your roots, comb it through."

I've done all of these while camping. Also, hands off! The more you touch and play with your hair, the more oil you add and distribute."
Hair,35nbzh,GerudoSheikah,2,Mon May 11 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"Women think with shorter hair is makes it easier to deal with, but you actually have to style it more to make it look good. You need to get a good layered cut. Keep the length But make sure the layers aren't to short and put a little framing around your face. This will take some weight of your ends and add a nice shape. no need to under cut. Getting some good layers will give you a beautiful look. show your stylist this http://i.imgur.com/Tt89Edw.jpg good luck!!! I think this cut would look amazing on you."
Hair,35nbzh,Jes1oli,1 point,Tue May 12 05:07:13 2015 UTC,I actually really like that pic. I just need to be sure I can still pull it up. My baby likes to grab hair so it's in a ponytail pretty often.
Hair,35nbzh,BlowDryStyles,1 point,Tue May 12 11:01:00 2015 UTC,you would def be able to still pull it up. yes layers will give you volume but good volume it will lift your hair off your root and give it shape. Trust me i have been a stylist in NYC for many many years. The thought with invisible layers is a great idea as well.

I did it below the occipital bone (like your pic) and when my hair is down no one can tell it's there. Drying and styling is faster and I don't have a saggy ponytail. Plus my stylist puts in some sweet designs when I get it cleaned up (right now it's a heart but I've had lightning bolts, steps, scallops, etc).   Admittedly, I know growing it out is going to be a bitch but I'm having too much fun with it now to care. No ragrets."

Hair,35nbzh,timthemajestic,1 point,Tue May 12 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"A proper thinning or any variety of methods to remove bulk without sacrificing length would be a better option. I wouldn't layer it too much as that creates more volume. The only thing about the undercut is keeping it up. If you did, I would go with a longer version where it would be finger length (#6 guard), so that it doesn't get as awkward as it grows."

Hair,35k271,thestrugglest,14,Mon May 11 03:01:45 2015 UTC,"Pro here, No toner is going to fix this. Honest. I'm definitely not stuck up about DIY haircolor, I have advised many on how to do their own color.....but this needs a professionals skill. You have multiple different colors of blonde. It's going to have to be bleached in multiple sections with different formulas for each different color of blonde you have in there, just to get it to an even color. No toner is going to make this blonde...it's simply too dark. Blue and Purple based toners only affect very very light hair, so you might come out with platinum roots and the orange will be unaffected.  You need to call around hairstylists. You can find a good one at an affordable salon....but you need to really have a thorough talk through with anyone before you decide to let them touch this. Not everyone is gifted with color corrections. Do not let them touch your hair unless they are giving you a realistic idea of what it will turn out like, and they have a detailed game plan on how they are going to achieve it.  Someone inexperienced will fuck this correction up and your hair will break off. I know you feel like it's an emergency that needs fixed now, but your hair will thank you for being really picky with stylists. It will likely take a fairly long time in the salon to correct, and it will probably not be cheap......but spending that extra money now to get it done properly is going to SAVE you money in the long run."
Hair,35k271,renegadebetty,1 point,Mon May 11 13:21:14 2015 UTC,If I just dye black over it will that work? I'm trying to disguise myself which is why I'm going through all this trouble but I'm afraid the color won't hold
Hair,35k271,nymphetamine-x-girl,5,Mon May 11 17:44:03 2015 UTC,The black will not hold. Even to color over this tone you will need to see a pro... otherwise you will have spots that are patchy and you will still end up with mostly yellow gold hair.
Hair,35k271,bunnyjerk,2,Mon May 11 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"It would most definitely turn green. If you REALLY want it black, do a medium WARM brown first. Like a golden brown. The warmest brown you can find without being red. Process that. It likely won't be pretty. Then go over with the black hair color. But a fair warning: You shouldn't dye it back to blonde or even light brown until the black has completely grown out. Not with the damaged blonde underneath...Which at your length might mean 3-4 years.  I would DEFINITELY reccomend using something like Sebastian Cellophanes to add shine, make your hair appear healthier, and reduce frizz after so many processes. It goes on like a conditioning treatment, but really it's like a lightly tinted clear coat that protects your color. It will make the dark last longer, also."

That being said, if it doesn't work, it'll be even more of a nightmare."
Hair,35k271,QuietLotus,12,Mon May 11 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"Go. to. a. professional. Your hair is multiple tones of blonde, you need a professional consultation and they'll choose the right toner for you. Sure, it's more expensive but it'll be worth it, especially since you've already spent time and money that created in one giant mistake in the first place. And no, your purple shampoo is definitely not enough to tone your hair. You need the help of a professional stylist, no way around it."
Hair,35k271,bonjourdan,16,Mon May 11 08:10:45 2015 UTC,This is always my advise but it might just because I am terrified of this...go see a pro! Bleach can ruin your hair if you aren't careful and it looks like you have a lot so that would be a real shame!
Hair,35k271,corein,9,Mon May 11 03:14:50 2015 UTC,"You might have to get this professionally fixed. But you could try using a toner (purple) which will help pull the brassy gold color out into a cooler shade of blonde and help a little more with getting one consistent shade.   Don't forget to deep condition, bleach will ruin your hair!"
Hair,35k271,Lexifer__,2,Mon May 11 03:32:06 2015 UTC,I have some purple shampoo. If I drench my hair in that and let it sit for a while will that do the same thing a toner would?
Hair,35k271,_minouche,10,Mon May 11 03:40:17 2015 UTC,Purple toner won't do much for orange as it would yellow. Brass is best toned out with blue. See a professional before it gets worse!
Hair,35k271,Lexifer__,4,Mon May 11 06:43:50 2015 UTC,"Wella color charm in white lady or T18. It's an ash based toner.  It has always done absolute wonders for my hair when trying to lighten it and get it a nicer blonde color. If anything, it will do more than a purple shampoo and lighten the brass."
Hair,35k271,TheCheatCommando,5,Mon May 11 07:02:19 2015 UTC,"No. You'll need a toner, and you'll probably need to tone it a couple of times. If it isnt lifting the gold out by the second or third time toning it then I suggest going and getting a dirty blonde dye with ash tones in it to cover the gold and the ash will help neutralize the gold."
Hair,35k271,_minouche,0,Mon May 11 03:48:50 2015 UTC,I had the same problem as OP and I toned twice and it kept fading. So I bought a light ash brown and dyed it but it completely washed out after only a little over a week. Is there a good shampoo/conditioner or something I can use next time I dye it to keep the color longer?
Hair,35k271,TheCheatCommando,3,Mon May 11 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"Any dye will wash out pretty fast since you bleached it. Stains will stick (fantasy colors) since its a stain. You could try dying it the ash brown again and you might have a better chance this time (it always stayed in the second time i dyed it). Professionals would have put a filler in your hair before the dye and that would have helped the dye stick. Just get some shampoo they sell at a salon, ask the person at the front desk what they recommend and they should be able to help you!"
Hair,35k271,sweetdreamz101,1 point,Mon May 11 17:46:11 2015 UTC,Its not the shampoo and conditioner. Its the color... Go to a professional if you really want your hair to look good.

Even if it looked the same as your roots, the chemical chemistry is different, this is why your roots are a different color than the ends. Take your hair seriously.

Hair,35gj9p,hg57,1 point,Sun May 10 23:22:37 2015 UTC,Thank you:) I will do more research on the Deva Cut!
Hair,35gj9p,BlowDryStyles,1 point,Mon May 11 00:28:34 2015 UTC,It would work well for your hair for sure. Just see someone who knows how to cut curly hair.
Hair,35gj9p,Raviepooh,1 point,Tue May 12 06:46:07 2015 UTC,"First,  find a curly specialist.  Anyone trained in deva curl or ouidad will have the skills necessary to help tame your mane.  Keep in mind that the photo example has been styled quite a bit, so unless you're willing to style your hair,  on a day to day basis it's not going to look just like the photo.   Your hair most certainly needs layers to kick up the curls where they fall flat,  the longer the hair,  the less curly it will be."
Hair,35gj9p,Opulation,0,Tue May 12 12:05:25 2015 UTC,"Hey! I also have very curly hair, and I 100% know the struggles of the right cut, all the frizz, the hassle, especially when it's so long. My hair comes down to my lower back, but it STILL curls up close to my shoulders. If anything, THAT'S what gives you triangle hair.  I think to avoid the triangle cut, the best method is to do short layers. Shorter than generally what most hair stylists think is best, because most hair stylists actually have no clue what they're doing with curly hair. I generally try to go to primarily African American salons since they have the most experience, or there is the rare person you trust with the curls.  Anyways, I also have the same problem where the weight of my hair keeps it from curling at the root, and so you generally have a ton of weight on your neck and shoulders, and a lacking volume near the top of your hair. If you get layers that start fairly short (we're talking like 3, maybe 4 inches from your part), it should be exactly what you need to pull of that cut. Then layer the rest of your hair in a normal fashion. Just make sure to start with short ones up top.  I believe the idea behind it is with less weight pulling down on the top of your hair, you'll get the volume you need back near the root, and the curls shouldn't spin up too tight to ruin the look if you make sure to do about 4 inches down. You just get lighter feeling, and much more bouncy curly hair that way. Completely deletes the triangle. Hope this helps!"

Hair,35h1xw,mandycake,1 point,Mon May 11 07:06:40 2015 UTC,"I do buy shampoo and conditioner that says moist or damage repair or something on it. But I didn't know if there was a best brand or anything. And I order some Garnier stuff. I'll keep the names you mentioned in mind.   Also, with the heat protector, do I need to let it dry first or flat iron while still wet with the product"
Hair,35h3s0,7heDaniel,1 point,Sun May 10 08:09:42 2015 UTC,"I would suggest using a product that is lightweight so that your hair will keep it's blowdried texture or a soft-hold, brushable hairspray.  A wax is too heavy of a product to keep your style without feeling the effects of gravity."
Hair,35h3s0,Avoxel,1 point,Mon May 11 02:19:30 2015 UTC,A product that is lightweight   What would a typical lightweight product be?
Hair,35h3s0,Avoxel,1 point,Mon May 11 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"I like Uppercut Featherweight  You could also ask your hair stylist what they would suggest for your hair texture/thickness/cut  Edit: the Uppercut website says it's a wax, but in my opinion its more of a cream"
Hair,35h3s0,Avoxel,1 point,Tue May 12 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"Another thing to keep your hold all day without adding weight is blowdrying a lot.  My hair stays about 3 inches in the air all day and most of the hold and volume is created by the blow drying. The hair product is to add shine, control, and texture."
Hair,35h3s0,BlowDryStyles,1 point,Tue May 12 04:30:51 2015 UTC,"Make sure your hair is completely dry. If its not it can cause it to frizz and lose shape. If you have it for sure dry try using a dry shampoo to add texture and hold. I know this sounds weird bc you think of using dry shampoo on your roots for greasy hair, but it can also be used as a great textureizing spray. And it will give it hold but doesn't make it hard and heavy like most hairsprays. try Oribe texturizing spray. Or try using a product that you but in before you blow dry like a mousse. it helps add hold and volume. I really like moroccanoil's mousse. Hope this was helpful."
Hair,35ecxi,JealousJulia,5,Sat May 9 14:57:15 2015 UTC,Just color over them.  They're not platinum so you don't need to fill it.  Use a 10 volume developer with the color you want to achieve.  Those highlights will actually give your hair dimension in your brown.
Hair,35ecxi,iheartzombiecats,3,Sat May 9 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree that you would not need to fill the highlights. From the picture I would say her hair is porous with some damage and dryness (as is common with curly/bleached hair). Some of the highlights do look that pale yellow/white blonde so without filling, your color will slip right out.  So if you want best results, I would put that warmth back into the hair so your desired result can be achieved and last.   If you don't go to a stylist, please, please use semi permanent box color for the health of your hair. Good luck!"
Hair,35ecxi,immaturesince84,1 point,Sat May 9 21:24:23 2015 UTC,Hmm okay thank you for the second opinion.
Hair,35ecxi,frankiefantastic,1 point,Sun May 10 00:24:30 2015 UTC,I agree. I strongly suggest going to a stylist though. Box dye from the store is awful.
Hair,35ecxi,DANICUNT,1 point,Sun May 10 00:55:21 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  This is the proper way to do it. Especially the semi ( or demi) permanent so it doesn't make your natural hair pull red! If you don't fill they will just be blonde in 6-8 weeks again.   Just whatever you do please don't use a permanent. A professional should always be doing color corrections.
Hair,35ecxi,missv8nightmare,1 point,Sun May 10 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you! :)"
Hair,35ecxi,Avoxel,2,Sat May 9 19:12:10 2015 UTC,Get a Demi permanent color that has a neutral base. I assume you're going to Sally's for color (please don't get the box shit) and so I believe most demi permanents there can be used with a 10 vol developer. You need that neutral base the put all of the colors that bleaching took out of the hair. Without that the color won't stick well and will fade badly. Demi permanent colors are a favorite way for stylist to color correct hair. They are less damaging and deposit only.
Hair,35ecxi,ouijabore,1 point,Sat May 9 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"Because you're hair is damaged already from the bleach, I would use a glaze to cover it, which would help prevent more damage while still getting rid of the blonde."
Hair,35fz8m,monseeve,1 point,Sat May 9 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but generally your hair falling out has to do with your habits/lifestyle. Do you think you may possibly have malnutrition? If you're not consuming all of what your body needs, shedding enormous amounts of hair is one of the signs. I've actually had this happen to me.  Also, have you changed anything about your hair care routine besides washing? The right brush and comb/when to groom your hair (wet vs dry) can have a lot to do with it."
Hair,35fz8m,Opulation,1 point,Sun May 10 06:53:18 2015 UTC,"Is your IUD hormonal? If so, chances are you are experiencing telogen effluvium. This can cause increased hair shedding 1-3 months after a stressful event, or introducing a new medication like hormonal contraception. It can also occur when you stop using hormonal contraception. There isn't much that you can do besides wait, in a few months things should be back to normal. Try not to stress about it as this won't help either! If you are really concerned you can also see your GP and have a blood test to check your iron levels and thyroid to rule out other causes."
Hair,35e4ic,Anandahbee,5,Sat May 9 13:23:39 2015 UTC,"Just stop dying your hair, and wait.  The easiest way to get your hair back to it's actual natural color is to let it grow. If you've only got about an inch and a half of growth, let it grow for a few months and then chop off the colored bit. Voila, your hair is it's natural color."
Hair,35e4ic,typhoidgrievous,3,Sat May 9 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm not a hairdresser but I've been blonde then back to brown and now I'm back to white hair.  So I think that if you're gonna dye a darker color over blonde, you may have to use a filler so the blonde doesn't pick up any undertones. This girl dyed brown over my blonde and my hair turned patchy green because blonde hair is so light and porous it picked up the green in the brown dye and she didn't use filler. And you don't want to shave your hair again which would probably be easiest. But if you'll be cutting the old hair off as new hair grows, isn't that almost the same thing? Do you not want the shaved head look anymore? If this really isn't an option then I'd go to a stylist to have her color match you to your natural color when you get some roots so she can see. Or if you wanted to keep blonde on the bottom, you can have her ombre your roots in to the blonde when it's a bit longer.  Good luck! :)"
Hair,35e4ic,worshiptribute,2,Sat May 9 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"I think once your regrowth starts showing you should go see a colorist. They will be able to tint back your hair to your natural a lot easier than you can. You might think it's as easy as grabbing a box that looks close enough to your natural, but it might not be the case. You might have to fill it, or depending on what the blonde looks like you may need to add or cancel out any tones that don't match your natural. It might cost a bit more than a box of  dye but since you aren't planning on coloring again for a while it'll be worth it and your hair should grow in pretty nicely. With that said, if your hair is really light or damaged it might not hold the color you put on it for very long so be prepared to maybe do this process twice over the next month or two to really get it to stick."
Hair,35e4ic,Dilsecraycray,1 point,Sat May 9 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"Stylist here!  You can color back to as close to natural as possible and then not touch your hair.  You need about an inch worth of regrowth to match your natural color effectively.  It can be done and very easily too. You colored with a level 10 or 11, which if you're almost platinum you'll need a filler.  That is also super easy especially because you're not going very dark.  You can get away with using a rinse (fancifull) or a mousse to put some tint back in your hair before applying the color. The filler should be one level lighter than the color you want to achieve so it doesn't get too dark.  You put that on, don't rinse it out.  That is very important.  Don't rinse it out, you need that color.  Next you just put on the color you chose that's closest to your natural color, I suggest using a 1:1:2 ratio of a Neutral, Ash to add to your 10 volume developer.  ex: 1 ounce of N + 1 ounce of A + 2 ounces of 10 volume developer.  process to manufacturers directions and you're good. After that just don't color your hair anymore.  get regular trims until the colored part is all out.  You'll know what's still colored because it will fade a little bit over time, but it'll  be easier to grow it out."
Hair,35e4ic,iheartzombiecats,0,Sat May 9 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you sooo much! I was able to recolor today and was able to get it pretty close to my natural color, a dark blonde. I dint use a filler but I guess my hair didnt go light enough to cause a green tint, least not one that's noticeable to me. I wish i would have ready your message before now on that though. I literally ran into a target as soon as I could and dyed as I was getting ready for work hoping for the best. But it does look lots better. My manager almost couldn't tell if i died my hair (though he may just not be very observant.) I do have one question though: Since I was not able to use filler, if i do end up noticing a slight green tint, is there a way to counteract that at all? Maybe a little red toner? Or can filler be used after having already died per chance? But otherwise thank you for the advice on what to do to properly grow out my natural hair too! Its soooo appreciated! :)"
Hair,35e4ic,iheartzombiecats,2,Sun May 10 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"You can tone with a touch of a red toner, and you can whip one of those up super easy.  You can literally take a red semi permanent color and add a dab (maybe a little more just not too much) to conditioner and let that sit in your hair for a few minutes, or you could look for a slight red depositing shampoo.  Another fun thing  you can do is tone it out with a rinse.  It'll only be temporary but it's non-oxidative and it'll stain that green over, so no more damage. Not using a filler won't guarantee a green tint is going to show up.  It just means that the color might fade to a mousy lighter color than what you want it to look like quicker than the non-lightened part.  Lightening your hair significantly reduces the amount of melanin (which gives it pigment) in your hair.  The melanin needs to be replaced for the new color to hold fast and true, that's really all that means.  Think of a primer for wall paint.  Happy to hear your hair turned out well.  Now leave it alone and let it grow out!  :)"

Poor ability to uptake iron (I take strong iron tablets), sudden hormone events like coming off birth control or pregnancy and genetics. Thyroid issues can also lead to hair loss.  My suggestion is don't leave it so you get so worried it makes the hair loss worse. Go and see a doctor and get a blood test so they can tell you if something is up."

Fun fact, the last time I was there for a sick leave, she said I am way too pale and might have low iron levels, but I refused the blood test back then for whatever reason."
Hair,35do5s,BelindaBerry,1 point,Sat May 9 16:40:51 2015 UTC,"According to my dermatologist iron is taken up by the hair last and because us women lose iron once a month, that can exacerbate the problem. If your iron levels are too low already then that could easily be the cause."
Hair,35do5s,BelindaBerry,1 point,Sat May 9 23:45:33 2015 UTC,A multivitamin has very little amounts of everything which you would get just by eating a balanced diet. So they're not worth taking unless your diet is crappy.  Vitamins are sold as therapeutic doses so to overdose you would need to take a lot more than what's recommend on the packet.

Hair,35bx7g,Moonbane,11,Fri May 8 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"I would definitely try a side part. Maybe let it dry with it parted in the middle so that when you do part it to the side you have some volume. Or just blow dry it to a side part with a round brush to give it volume. It seems to be kinda flat on top, I'm thinking that might be bc you put conditioner on the top of your head? If so, you should only put conditioner at ear level and lower. You could also try adding slight waves with a flat iron. You can look on youtube how people curl their hair with a flat iron, it's pretty easy."
Hair,35bx7g,applemus,1 point,Fri May 8 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"I find that my thick hair tends to get frizzy on top if I don't use conditioner, but I also don't like to directly apply conditioner to the top of my head because I feel like my hair gets greasier quicker.  I have long, naturally dark hair with a twice-bleached ombre from just below my ears down. What I like to do is apply conditioner ear level and below as you said, leave it in while I shave my legs or whatever, but right before I wash it out I pile my hair on my head and just sort of wipe the residual conditioner from my ends over the top part and just leave it for half a minute or so. Seeing as I seldom use product in my hair (with the exception of argan oil on the ends) I feel like it kinda needs something. I find this makes the top of my hair much nicer, softer and less frizzy without being greasy or flat."
Hair,35bx7g,chimairacle,5,Sat May 9 14:55:08 2015 UTC,When I had long hair I had a blast with styling. Random braids put in randomly for texture or to pull my hair back. Half up/ half down. Ballet buns on the top my my head. If you put in a few layers it won't take the length but will give the cut a bit more depth and variety.
Hair,35bx7g,solongandthanks42,2,Sat May 9 02:15:39 2015 UTC,"I was thinking layers, too. A trim at least to clean up the ends. A braid overnight to create some waves would be fun."

It's called Gray Magic.  http://www.sallybeauty.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SA-Site/default/mProduct-Show?pid=SBS-240900 I've used it on myself and my sister's hair. It works really well.

Haircolor tends to come out one shade darker than the package says. 10 or 20 is the developer, if you are just darkening your hair I would say use 10 plus Ardell Gray Magic drops. I think you can get Wella at Sally, if you don't see it there try online   As for a gloss rinse I would recommend Adore or Jazzing in clear."

Hair,359zxl,Waccoz,2,Fri May 8 10:33:03 2015 UTC,"Eat a balanced diet, don't  pull you hair tight into pony tails, keep your scalp healthy and clean. There's no way to make it grow faster.  The ""supplements"" are bogus plecebo pills that are about as useful as the last diet trend and the old wives tails are just that.

Hair,359zxl,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Fri May 8 11:53:03 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/iheartzombiecats diet is essential and pony tails are so hard on your hair.   BUT in my work every day I have had a different experience. There is ways to slightly increase your hair growth.  It is so slight this is not something you will actively notice.   Massaging your scalp increases blood flow to the area and promotes growth.  I have seen body builders on supplements with amino acids chains with hair that grows almost twice as fast. I have been doing their hair for years and there was a noticeable  difference in hair growth. Testosterone supplements especially.    Prenatal vitamins will keep your body at such a healthy state it promotes insane hair growth.  My one client started doing this and her hair line started to grow back again. New hair growth everywhere.   Also drink 8 glasses of water a day. Your hair will be stronger and able to handle more. Anything that works to grow your nails will also have an effect on your hair.  These are not old wives tales. :/   Source: 8 year stylist.

Hair,358d9s,the_drama_llama,1 point,Fri May 8 01:37:09 2015 UTC,I've had great success with Nexxus ProMend mousse.  It gives some nice volume AND protects against split ends (I'm in love with the promend serum).  I just like my hair to have an undercurl and it doesn't hold it very well in the humidity.
Hair,358d9s,littlefoot123,2,Fri May 8 12:26:15 2015 UTC,My hair is exactly as you describe... Go buy this immediately: Chi infratexture hairspray. Spray Before you curl and after. It was a total game changer for me. It doesn't feel like hairspray and it actually holds! I also recommend curling with a flat iron. Curling iron curls just do not hold in my hair. The hairspray is a little pricey but it truly does work wonders.
Hair,358d9s,fauxphantom,2,Fri May 8 01:45:09 2015 UTC,Going to try this one out today!  Thanks!
Hair,358d9s,littlefoot123,1 point,Fri May 8 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"I think I'm the opposite, or it could have just been me. How are you curling with the flat iron so that it stays?"
Hair,358d9s,fauxphantom,1 point,Fri May 8 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"It took me a long time to master this skill. I just watched several YouTube videos and practiced a lot. I pretty much just take a section of hair, clamp the iron down towards the top of my head, rotate my wrist, and pull the wand down. Don't get discouraged if it comes out looking crazy initially, like I said, it took me a lot of practice to get it right!"
Hair,358d9s,littlefoot123,1 point,Fri May 8 16:39:53 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because I was pulling away from my head like a video I watched. It just looks like I straightened it with no curl whatsoever.

Hair,3598kk,nyancatbagels,1 point,Fri May 8 05:08:59 2015 UTC,Just melt it in the microwave and put it through your hair from root to tip (focusing on the ends) and then either put it in a towel or bun and leave it for at least an hour then shower and rinse it all out. There are tons of YouTube videos and other things online if you need any more information. I do this after I dye my hair and it works really well

Perhaps your don't get enough split ends cut off.

At the scalp there are a lot of bigger flakes, while lots of tiny particles are spread through the hair. If I slightly slap against the hair a rain of particles falls down."
Hair,355m0n,DANICUNT,1 point,Thu May 7 18:04:59 2015 UTC,Is your scalp red and enflamed?  Is it really tight feeling?   So far I can tell you that's not dandruff.  Treating it the way you have been (likes it's dandruff) has been causing it to only get worse.  You need a calming shampoo. Try some patchouli or jojoba oil in the mean time. Saturated your scalp in it and I believe you'll feel immediate relief. Leave it over night. Shampoo and condition your hair in the morning.   Repeat treatments and it will clear up.   Buy Calming Shampoo by Davines with their Vegatarian Miracle Cond. This will clear it up. Always does.   If it's psoriasis or exeima you might have to go see a doctor for topical cream. A red and enflamed scalp with open sores is psoriasis. Exeima is just intensely dry and flaky.
Hair,355m0n,DANICUNT,1 point,Thu May 7 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"its has been red, but only after scratching.  I live in europe, so we have different shampoo brands i belive. Im not sure do you mean i should wash my hair with shampoo every day? The oil thing sounds good and i really want to try it, but i think the washing with shampoo every day to clear out the oil residues but be kind of counterproductive.. Also would you recommend jojoba oil over oilve(which i already have at home) or coconut oil?"
Hair,355m0n,DANICUNT,1 point,Thu May 7 18:53:15 2015 UTC,Oh communication  error here. So don't shampoo every day. That is drying.  Do this like a treatment. So once a week apply the oils to your scalp and shampoo the next day. This is not something to do daily.   Do the treatments until your scalp is in better condition. Then you don't need to do it every week. More of a seasonal thing or when it acts up.    If it's red and that itchy I feel you have psoriasis or exeima. Have it checked out by a doctor in case you need medicated cream. I'm not doctor but I have literally seen thousands of scalps. Also in school we have to know the conditions of the scalp to pass.    Feel free to ask for more clarity if you need.  That brand is actually from Italy. So it is actually more common in Europe then anywhere else in the world. It's sulphate  and paraben  free which will help with any further irritation.
Hair,355m0n,TonyFromTheBlock,1 point,Fri May 8 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice dani!  Yesterday I applied some olive oil, just a little bit, to my scalp. Today its like the scalp is already much better, flakes have diminished alot. Now I just need to find some balance to keep my hair from being oily and also dry. I dont even want to wash it now, because of the fear of it going back to before!  Also I checked out the davine shampoo and cond. Actually thats a bit outside my budget. Do you think it would work if I just try to remove the oil with a cheaper sulfate and silicone free conditioner?"
Hair,355m0n,DANICUNT,1 point,Fri May 8 11:48:11 2015 UTC,That's a good sign that this can be healed with some nourishment.   In Canada we have a place called Winners. You can buy professional shampoo at a really reasonable price. Do you have a place like that in Europe?  Please just even get the lowest grade professional. Non professional has tones of salt and laundry soap which will bring back this problem.   Don't be afraid to wash it out!  Oil gets absorbed by your scalp and stays there despite being removed.   I want to tell you something about expensive shampoo. At the department store your average price is 7 dollars a bottle (canadain). This shampoo is diluted 6x  by water. Meaning you have to use 6x as much to get the same effect of a professional shampoo. You will go through 4 bottles of non professional before you finished a professional shampoo.   Technically  in the long run you spend the same amount of money.  Just there is an initial investment. Keep that in mind when using new shampoo. Use WAY less for the same results.

Hair,353x5j,pandarynn,2,Wed May 6 22:07:47 2015 UTC,I think the color is going to be so awesome. Love red.  If you plan on ever going platinum I would not recommend it ( unless your extremely patient). Otherwise it would suit you well.  Will you get the highlights as well? A highlight with a color in between is an expensive service. Usually starting at 150 and going up in price. ( At any good salon ) So keep in mind your budget.   The shorter fringe will require more maitence. Keep in mind your glasses. So it's better to go above or a good inch below the frame. I personally like the idea of a short fringe on you. :)
Hair,353x5j,DANICUNT,1 point,Thu May 7 02:57:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :) I am going to get highlights as well, although I know it's going to be so much more expensive.

I have really curly hair to the point where I have little to no styles I can use. Its severely curly, and I'm kinda sick of it. Is there any way to straighten it? Like with a relaxer or flat iron or what have you?"
Hair,354if9,TonyFromTheBlock,1 point,Thu May 7 19:13:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly curls on men's hair is tough! For a different style along those lines it does take time and effort. I always recommend taking the sides really short. Buzzed short and then style just the top.   It also depends on your curls. You did mention that it's super tight so that's what I am going off of. With a boar bristle  brush and a smoothing lotion anything is possible. Blow dry and carefully flat iron.   If your curls are too short then grow the top out. 3 Inches is ideal for this type of styling.   There are chemical relaxers available. The first time you do it your hair feels really good. The second time you risk extreme damage if there is ANY over lapping. Which there will be. I never recommend permanent straightening systems.   It's also a different type of straight.  I find blow drying,  flat ironing and not wasting for 2 days tell most effective and appealing way to style curly hair on men. I'm at work right now but later I can post a picture.

Hair,354if9,DANICUNT,1 point,Thu May 7 03:23:54 2015 UTC,Blow drying will pull out a lot of your curls and make it 1000x easier to style.  With a boar bristle brush and a frizz control product (Relaxing Fluid by Davines) you'll be laughing.  So much easier to flat iron and will last longer.
Hair,354if9,DANICUNT,1 point,Thu May 7 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"Will my hair still be styleable? I want to get it kinda quiffy but in the front, so after straightening it won't just fall flat with no volume, right?"
Hair,354ols,saintbargabar,1 point,Thu May 7 02:03:50 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/o7b9u5S  We have almost the same exact hair! I part on the side opposite of my cowlick and blow dry and push it down with a comb. My bangs are kind of long and I make sure that they push a lot of hair forward for more bangs since our hair is thin
Hair,35357t,McSaac36,0,Wed May 6 18:36:27 2015 UTC,I never really did much as far as styling went with my hair. I just stopped parting it in the middle and would sometimes dye it jet black and keep the part to the far right or left side. Anymore I usually keep it pulled back into a low pony tail. I'll post a picture of myself to show you.   Edit: Here you go: http://i.imgur.com/PzanGlB.jpg  It's from 6 months ago or so. Not much has changed it just got longer.

Hair,352l1u,DANICUNT,2,Wed May 6 21:33:29 2015 UTC,Hahaha good question. It's a fact of life. If it happens to you there is no way to control it from not happening. There is preventative measures that are topical and internal but the effectiveness depends. It's also only usually works on the existing hair and not on the bulbs that have already died.   For example: thinning hair shampoo will help the existing hair appear thicker and grow in faster but won't regenerate the dead bulbs.   Rogaine will also act similar.   The only real way is through surgery. You can get your bulbs surgically removed from the back of your head and implanted back on top.   Anyways. Just don't worry about it ever. It's just happens to men. Just like the other poster mentioned you'll just loose your hair faster!

Hair,352q2l,graveyardgirl,1 point,Wed May 6 16:47:02 2015 UTC,Second this. I have already had 4 inches cut off my back just to keep it from doing that. I might have to go in again for another inch here soon. Wish the rest of my head would do that.
Hair,352q2l,MarnietheDoug,1 point,Wed May 6 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"Get ready for a lot of awkward lengths! I've chopped my hair to a pixie and grown it out to past my shoulder blades numerous times.   Keep trimming the back until the top/front grows out and you can aim for the Jennifer Lawrence/Kayley Cuco cut that's popular right now. Then you'll have to start growing out the sides. I recommend investing in a good small barrel curling iron or a nice flat iron. If you have straight hair, making it curly and messy will help hide the awkward length. Embrace the bed head! You'll also want to get good at using bobby pins. Sometimes the best thing to do is just pin everything back! Once the sides are grown out, you can do the Victoria Beckham inverted bob. From there, it's about finding a bob that you like - the bob is my least favorite hair cut on me, so this is the worst stage imo. I usually keep adding layers, curling it and pinning it back until it reaches my shoulders. this girl has some great tutorials for that mid-length bob. this girl has some great tutorials for a long pixie."

Hair,34z21i,threefour2,4,Tue May 5 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a hairstylist and there are a million different products out there with their own instructions for each one. That being said, it sounds like a keratin treatment to me. The product we use for our keratin treatment is called ""Brazilian keratin treatment"" so it may have been an advertising error or something. And if your hair is fine or thin or short then it can take as little as an hour to do a keratin. I suggest calling the salon and asking what brand they use and do some research on it to find out if you were given the wrong service or not."
Hair,34z21i,laenooneal,3,Tue May 5 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your response. I figured there would be different processes for different treatments but they specifically advertised 'Brazilian Blowout' and repeated this multiple times while I was there. I actually have really thick hair, that's why I was a little concerned about how quick it took. I had to pay an additional fee because my hair was so thick they had to use more than was covered in the amount I paid on Groupon. I'll certainly get in touch with them!"
Hair,34z21i,iheartzombiecats,2,Tue May 5 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"To be seriously honest, not a whole lot of stylists (this is from what I've read in comments from professional pages) will take the extra time and measures for groupon person.  Using groupon kind of comes with a stigma; which is a cheap person that only gets something expensive done once a year, who also doesn't intend to care for it properly, keep up with the maintenance, and will probably ask if tipping is a requirement.  So maybe they overlooked and rushed a bit because of the stigma. I don't know if you're a regular at that salon, or your relationship with that salon or you personally so don't take this personally.  That's not my intention."

Hair,350nk0,hotshot0121,1 point,Wed May 6 03:03:30 2015 UTC,"I have been really liking seeing men with braids lately.  I think that fishtail braids tend to look great on men, because they are a bit more messy and textured. You want to avoid braids looking too polished....It can look a bit odd.  Unfortunately there aren't many pictures of men wearing casual looking braids. Search results pretty much yield pics of corn rows/microbraids.  Here is an example of Neige From Alcest.  I think Jared Leto pulled off this braid.  I think this is a woman...but this braid would translate very well on a mans hair. It doesn't try too hard.   And obviously Tolkeins elves make use of braids. IMHO the Legolas braid style only looks bad if you have a large forehead or really curly hair."
Hair,350nk0,0culus_,1 point,Wed May 6 16:00:41 2015 UTC,"Guy here...braid is my go-to style honestly. It looks better than a ponytail imo. I mostly do just a simple English braid down the back. I know how to a French braid, too, and sometimes do that. It actually looks great with a driver cap.   I cannot do a fishtail on myself, even if I tried. Had it done once by the hairstylist and I liked the look, though.   IMO, looking a bit polished is a good thing. On the other hand, I rock a fairly wild beard, so it doesn't look too out of place."

Hair,350nk0,0culus_,2,Fri May 8 13:24:43 2015 UTC,"I prefer to not post pictures of myself in the internet, sorry! However, it's really nothing that fancy. I literally just brush it all back, break it into three reasonably equal sections at the nape of the neck, bring the outer sections over, and then do a 3 strand English braid and tie off with an elastic a couple inches from the end. [edit] I finally have grown out a lot of layers, so it stays together reasonably well. If you have a lot of layers, it will be hard."
Hair,350fj3,Kibs96,1 point,Wed May 6 01:51:55 2015 UTC,"No sorry, it won't work. The reason is that your hair starts growing from inside your head, which you can look up more, they are called ""hair follicles"". Basically dark skinned people have very curly hair follicles inside their head so their hair grows in an afro type shape, and it is impossible to change your hair follicles to make them straight.  It's the same way people with cowslicks want to get rid of them, but it's just the way their hair grows.  But if you keep doing what you're doing it will train your hair to stay like that more often, and using hair products will keep the hold, but you will have to keep doing it because your hair will naturally go curly again A good example of this is Dani Alves who plays for Barcelona FC, his hair isn't as curly as an afro but it is still reallly curly, and he is able to keep it slicked back with products and combs (but it will still go back to being curly) hope this helps"

Hair,34xgwp,phx702,1 point,Tue May 5 14:44:43 2015 UTC,Use a styling lotion or gel on towel dried hair and blow dry it in the desired position.  Keep in mind to get the hair 100% dry.  Then use a paste or hair spray to lock the shape in.    Washing your hair causes the hair's hydrogen bonds to reform into their orginal positons.  You have to break the H bonds by blowdrying it into a new postion.

Hair,34thcz,amariaexathent,1 point,Mon May 4 18:48:39 2015 UTC,I say switch to a severe side part do a Bob length to start and try a side bang. If you like it or feel you could go shorter there's still the option.

Hair,34tkfo,InDireNeedOfHairHelp,4,Mon May 4 13:18:21 2015 UTC,The reason your struggling is you have a woman's cut! You need to find someone who cuts long men's hair.  Call and ask around. See a style you like on someone ask for their stylists name.   A man's hair cut is cut more square with masculine lines and graduation in the back. You have a woman's Bob.    Outside of that. Generally at this length you comb your hair back off your face with a texture product.  Source:  8 year stylist who loves cutting long men's hair!
Hair,34tkfo,DANICUNT,1 point,Mon May 4 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"Well, thank you for the advice but I am actually looking to get it cut.

Hair,34uq2b,jamesthe7,2,Mon May 4 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"Do you use conditioner? What part of the country do you live in, is it dry, humid etc? Normally does your hair get oily a day after washing, two days etc?"
Hair,34uq2b,belousugar,2,Mon May 4 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"i use conditioner daily. i do live in arkansas as a student but usually texas back home, so that shouldnt be the problem. It does get oily after a few days after washing, usually after two or three days. I just dont know exactly how to handle it all."
Hair,34uq2b,belousugar,2,Mon May 4 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"If it's humid there that might have something to do with it. I have stick straight hair and use conditioner a lot, but when it's humid my hair gets puffy too. I think curlier hair has this problem worse.   You might want to try using Moroccan oil on it, it can help keep things moisturized and in control."
Hair,34uq2b,belousugar,2,Mon May 4 20:48:08 2015 UTC,awesome ill give that a try. thank you. anything else i should do for longer hair? any kind of specific function on conditioner or shampoo? just upkeep in general as well.
Hair,34uq2b,belousugar,2,Mon May 4 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"When it comes to shampoo, the thing I go by is to only use it to clean your scalp. So I personally don't lather it all over my hair all the way to the tips, just around my scalp so it doesn't dry everything else out.   When it comes to conditioner it's the opposite, I don't put it on my scalp - only on the tips and shaft of my hair (excuse the language but it's applicable). I use 3 pumps of Morroccan oil but my hair is long, halfway down my back, so you should only use one. You can also use coconut oil, wicked cheap and natural (I'd guess you'd use a dollop the size of a pea). Use it the same way as conditioner, work it into the very tips of your hair first (spend a good 20-30 seconds really distributing it and working it in, almost like you're combing you hair with your hands but with oil), and a little bit up the shaft as well but not on your scalp.  I hear people with curly hair sleep with it in a braid or a bun to keep it from rubbing all around in the night and getting tangled, and supposedly silk pillowcases keep it wicked soft as well (it also helps with wrinkles on your face)."
Hair,34tgil,hosea0220,2,Mon May 4 12:41:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which would help you more, if you do do the toner all over you will have those cooler tones in the brown part of your hair as well so you need to take that into account. I mostly came here to say make sure you do a 10 volume developer!! I was platinum this past summer and got invited to a wedding last minute a week before my next appointment (to say the least I was very yellow) so I did the wella t-18 with 20 volume developer.... It was amazing my hair turned icy white just like I wanted... And my roots turned bright golden yellow.  So make sure you get the right stuff!!"
Hair,34tgil,cable0318,2,Mon May 4 13:18:21 2015 UTC,"I am no hair expert by any means, but I recently had this problem. I bought ion brilliance brights in purple and mixed it with conditioner until I got a Barney purple color.i covered my whole head in the conditioner mixture for two hours, covered with a plastic bag, then rinsed out in cold water. I had a few lavender streaks for a washout two, but it's been two weeks and my tone is still pale/ash versus the yellow/gold tone I had. I thought my ombr√©-d blonde wasn't light enough to do this to, but it worked out really well. I also still have enough of the purple ion to do this again in the future, if necessary."
Hair,34tgil,workinonmytwerkin,1 point,Mon May 4 13:15:14 2015 UTC,Tone only the blonde but if you overlap a little bit on the brown don't stress too much. You run the risk of hot roots if you tone everywhere plus it's a waste of product because you probably won't effect the hair you coloured brown that much.

Hair,34sgil,tempertemper_,2,Mon May 4 04:15:48 2015 UTC,"Try looking up Guy Tang. He uses them all the time. You'll need the pravana color extractor kit to pull out the violet. And I'm sure you know you'll have to bleach to a level 10.  I also recommend looking up and purchasing Olaplex. It's a relatively new product that rebuilds the disulfide bonds as they're broken during processing.  As for how to use the vivids line, there's no need for any developer. What comes out of the tube is the color that your hair ends up. I  would guess for teal you would use blue, green and a little yellow.  And if you have a lot of hair buy a lot of color. The formulation is very thick so you go through it fast.  And also Rusk has a new pure pigment color line out now too. Their formula isn't as thick so you use a little less product. They have a teal color already made so you might want to check that out as well."
Hair,34sgil,Smellmyft,2,Mon May 4 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"That's weird that you aren't familiar with pravana yet, its what I always used in beauty school, and that was 10 years ago! That stuff is freakin awesome! It's really basic, you don't use a developer or anything, just apply it right out of the tube, the trick will just be getting your hair to a light enough level for a red to work."

Hair,34qili,stickyshoyu,5,Sun May 3 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"i spray my hair with a texturizer first, then put the headband on and tuck in the first two rolls of hair.  Then criss cross bobby pins inside the rolls. Finish up the hair style and kill it with hairspray.  Depending on the headband, like if its flat or not super bejeweled out, you can clip contour clips on the part above your ears to hold it in place for added help.   On one headband I had to cut off the original elastic and reattach a longer piece to reduce tension."

Hair,34qili,SassyTeacupPrincess,1 point,Sun May 3 18:33:36 2015 UTC,"The bobby pins are what works for me, you just put the hairband through the bobby pin middle and push it all the way until the rounded part of the bobby pin touches the band. Then just crisscross it with another bobby pin and you're good to go. I do this once and it works well enough for me, but doing it twice is always good too. Hope this helps :)"
Hair,34qili,blue_cash,1 point,Sun May 3 20:14:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm just not sure how I can use bobby pins and still loop my hair through it
Hair,34qili,jiyounglife,1 point,Sun May 3 20:45:24 2015 UTC,"Use the bobby pins at the front , there should be a  piece under all of the decoration and you would attach the bobby pins to that ; or you can use short pins through the teased part of you hair going forward and again attach them to the headband."
Hair,34qili,ambird138,2,Sun May 3 21:55:43 2015 UTC,That's very pretty!  Another trick is gluing a velvet ribbon to the underside. The velvet should act like a soft velcro on your hair.
Hair,34qili,Smellmyft,2,Mon May 4 07:37:59 2015 UTC,Since the portion that would go around the back of your head isn't showing just cut the elastic back portion and attach the head band using bobby pins inside the hair roll at the back. Then you won't have to worry about the tension of the head band making it slide off. It'll look the same on the outside.   Edit: ok this is a dumb comment. LOL I just did a Google search ... Didn't realize this tuck and roll style uses the band potion to actually hold the hair! LOL Sorry. TIL.

Hair,34m6pc,nesinesi,1 point,Sat May 2 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"Do you microwave the honey before you make the mask?  Honey has naturally occurring peroxide and that might be contributing to the dryness. Heating it first removes the bleaching properties without removing its hydrating properties.   How often do you clarify your hair?  It's hard to diagnose problems with hair that might have a lot of buildup on it.   Oh, and I haven't trimmed in two years, so ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
Hair,34m6pc,ronniejean1,1 point,Sat May 2 20:22:22 2015 UTC,"Hey! I mix it in a glass dish and I place the dish in a bowl of hot water to warm it up. I had no idea honey did that to hair, but I just thought hair took better to hot hairmasks that room temperature! :o thanks for that! I try to clarify my hair maybe once every two weeks with diluted apple cider vinegar and some drops of lavander oil, but I could probably do it more often!"
Hair,34m6pc,ronniejean1,1 point,Sun May 3 08:00:22 2015 UTC,"ACV alone is not a clarifyer.  Because of its acidity, it makes the hair cuticle lay down flat, which does help with shine and smoothness, but doesn't help remove buildup.    You're going to want to use a clarifying shampoo or a baking soda solution on your hair first to actually clarify it before you finish with that ACV rinse.  Don't get me wrong, ACV is good!  But in this case it's not doing all that you'd hope it's doing."

Hair,34kiym,nollynoon2,1 point,Fri May 1 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"I did that last year and I wouldn't say it caused any damage. My hair is normally silky, but for about a month after coloring it dark it felt a little rough. Not like straw, just different, if that makes any sense. But that went away.  It was colored platinum blonde in September, then dark brown in October. And unfortunately by February it was a light/dirty blonde color...extremely different than the color I wanted. That could have been from a number of things (sun, hair products, brand of coloring product), or more likely the bleach.  If you're unhappy with your hair color and you've waited at least 2 months, I would say go ahead and have it professionally colored darker. If your experience is anything like mine, you may need to re-color it dark again 4 months later. You feel like you've wasted money, but at least you're more comfortable."
Hair,34kiym,omgaspoon,1 point,Sat May 2 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"It's not damaging, just time consuming.  You need to tint back, and to tint back you've gotta know what level you want to end at and what colors you need to replace in your hair.  Bleaching removes all color, so you need to rebuild the base before putting the desired shade back on.  It'll take up to two chemical processes, one to fill with a Demi permanent color and one with a permanent color.  Both are done with 10 volume developer, and won't cause any more damage.  Don't skip the filler or your color will wash out really quickly. A quick trick is to buy the same color you want the permanent color to be, but one shade lighter and a demi.  Follow the manufacturers directions, and don't put the Demi on your roots."
Hair,34kiym,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Sat May 2 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"It's fine, but remember that you need to fill your hair with warm pigments first. Otherwise you'll end up with a flat and green color."
Hair,34jruz,Relytiam,1 point,Fri May 1 19:22:32 2015 UTC,I think you would be happy with a trim and some even layers. Maybe thinned out a little and part it in the middle if your hair will let you.

I Spent FOREVER ensuring that the brown was super rich, even, and wouldn't fade out, because she was POSITIVE that she wanted to be a brunette. Went through a thorough consultation. She absolutely adored it. You could see her in her car taking selfies when we were finished.  Went home, called the salon.....Came in the next day and spent 4+ more hours in the salon removing the brown and bringing her back to blonde. When she called to say that she wanted the blonde back, we could hear her husband in the background screaming ""Next time I see you in this house you better have that shit out of your hair""  She payed twice, so whatever.....I quite enjoy long complicated dye jobs....But I couldn't help but feel bad for her, because of her obviously verbally abusive husband."

Hair,34hye1,wildthrift,3,Fri May 1 08:44:23 2015 UTC,"If you want the grey badly, see a professional for a color correction. Having been bleached twice in one day and having the silver deposited on it will require some gentle, customized color pulling. You're right, it didn't get light enough in addition to banding where color has previously been applied. Bleach on previously colored hair is something I'd leave to pros (We really do have your best interest in mind).  As for an at-home fix, throwing a super dark shade over it will be your best bet. A tip for rich blue-black: Use a regular ammonia base dye as pure black as you can find it, then follow with a color that functions like a stain (even Manic Panic works well for this if you maintain it) in the brightest shade of blue you can get your hands on. When the light hits it, your hair will shine blue."

I do know my hair and I might try to lighten up the ends... only because I'm open to chopping it off if it gets too fried. :) Honestly I don't have the cash to get it done pro even if I wanted to.

Clip ons can be a little tricky to get the hang of.   160g should be enough for a nice result, unless you have very thick hair. If you have a very blunt cut, that can make the extensions hard to blend too. They work best if you have some layers."
Hair,34glq9,alisonfd,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"I believe UK and US color products vary somewhat BUT:  There's several reasons a color you've used in the past with no problems can suddenly come out funky.  Someone might have made a boo-boo at the factory and not put everything that was supposed to be in that batch of color in that tube.  Your hormone levels can also affect how color takes to your hair (don't ask me why, but it can!)  Different water conditions can leave behind different minerals etc. in your hair that affects how the color takes; you mentioned you travel a lot so this may possibly have something to do with it.    If you want to cancel out those green tones, you need to use the opposite color, which would be red.  I would look for a blue tone that has some red in it like a blue purpley color.  This SHOULD counteract the greenish tone.  Rather than doing your whole head, I would pull up half of your hair and just put your purpley tone on a piece underneath as a test.  If that test strand comes out the way it should, great!  If not, you're not stuck with your whole head being funky.  I would also recommend doing some kind of clarifying treatment before you color again.  If you can find Malibu Wellness products in the UK, they have great clarifying shampoos and treatments. If not, just try to find a good clarifying shampoo.  If it's in your budget, I would go into a salon and ask for a clarifying shampoo.  If not, they do of course sell them at the drug store, etc.  Wet your hair down, lather it up, and then let it sit on your hair under a shower cap or damp towel for a bit, say 30 minutes or so, then wash it out.  And I have NOT tested this so I can't say with certainty, but I have been told tomato sauce on the hair will have a neutralizing/clarifying effect on the hair.  It makes sense, the acid and vitamin C from the tomatoes would break down minerals and such in the hair, but again I haven't personally tried it, so tomato at your own risk. :P"
Hair,34glq9,muricanwoman,1 point,Fri May 1 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the help.  Not sure if I am brave enough to try tomato sauce :P   There seems to be some Malibu Wellness products available over here. I'll see if I can find one of their clarifying shampoos, maybe even an import from the US will be worth it. How much do they normally cost over there? The ones on eBay seem insane."
Hair,34glq9,muricanwoman,1 point,Fri May 1 05:30:29 2015 UTC,"Here they run about $10 - $15.  They have the shampoo and conditioner, but they also have a line of ""hair remedies"" that are little packets you mix with water to make a gel and then let sit on your hair.  There's a basic ""Crystal gel"" packet but they also make one called ""color prepare"" and ""quick fix "" that would be great if you can find them."

Hair,34g742,graveyardgirl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:07:42 2015 UTC,"Okay. What about a haircut and style like this except with bangs being above the eyes? Would it look okay and not be annoying?

You'll probably want to wash it AT LEAST every other day, if not everyday. I had a friend who had long hair and he washed it everyday, sometimes twice a day, and it was in perfect condition.

Hair,34ekbv,RangerRandyFord,2,Thu Apr 30 18:46:54 2015 UTC,"it can be damaging to the hair to use shampoo every day. your hair functions best with your natural scalp oils, and when you shampoo you wash those away, and thus leading to your body over producing scalp oil to compensate for you washing every day. if you start to put a period in between washes your body is able to adapt and won't produce so much oil"

I'm shocked really that the stylist would choose to do a partial hilite. She's clearly inexperienced.  What the stylist should have done is lift through regular all over color by using a higher level developer. Based on the photos, I would have used a natural level 7 color with 30 vol from roots to mid shaft and use 40 vol on ends. Ends are usually trimmed anyway after color or lightening. You can tone afterwards as well in the event that she prefers slightly warmer or slightly cooler blonde tones.  It is often best to make big changes in stages so as not to damage your hair. It really benefits you to use a deep conditioning treatment in between. I would call and speak with the salon manager and explain the situation. She should have the colorist perform the color correction at no cost. I would apply an all over color to bring the color levels closer together. Maybe like a 6 or 7 range."
Hair,34cf6k,Nevergonnaknowunow,6,Thu Apr 30 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, they should either fully refund you so you can get your color corrected somewhere else or the salon should fix it for you for free."

I do ""other"" salon fix ups for free, gaining a client for life. Not to late for a 7n Demi colour to mesh it all together...."
Hair,34cf6k,stellar_fox,3,Thu Apr 30 07:25:37 2015 UTC,"If she had previous color,  as you stated,  the stylist would not have been able to use color for an all over application as color cannot lift color.  The stylist should have explained this to your fiance,  which it seems like she sort of did,  but did not explain it clearly.   The highlights aren't terrible, and honestly the only thing I can suggest is her getting more highlights to even out the color to where she wants it to be.   That being said,  the two inches of untouched roots are not acceptable,  and she should look into a different colorist.   Hair color is an expensive venture,  not only to initiate,  but also maintain.  If she's not willing to spend the money, I suggest she get a glaze to darken the highlights back closer to her natural color and pretend it never happened."
Hair,34cf6k,Raviepooh,2,Thu Apr 30 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry that your fiance had such a bad experience with her hairdresser, I would go back and explained that you are not happy, they should fix it. The problem with lightning dark hair is that it might get quite brassy if do it with color, and hairdressers prefer to do it gradually with bleach, specially if there is color from before. So after 2-3 highlight sessions she would get color she wants. Roots are way too long, I agree. But go back and tell them, I am sure they will more than happy to fix it."

She loves it because it's a lot easier than listening to someone try to describe something when they don't know the technical details.   It's best to have different people from different angles with a similar style to give a better idea of the look you want.  But to the untrained eye, this looks like a layered haircut that frames her face and is finished with a ""beachy waves"" style."
Hair,34bht0,LegitimateVape,8,Wed Apr 29 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"This is already very ""styled"" in a messy way. I would describe it as very long layers beginning x amount of inches from the chin and tapering down, with the layers being even around the front and back (ie: there are not face framing layers in a high amount in the front as compared to only a few in the back; it's ""even""). Really, the cut looks quite simple, and its the loose curling and ruffling that's making it look complicated. Just my humble opinion."
Hair,34bht0,TinyOne9,7,Thu Apr 30 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"A few things I'd like to point out.... First, your hair will never look like this when you're just ""out"". Every photo, no matter what, has an extreme amount of styling that goes into the photo. Photos tell stories and they want you to want the story. Second, after taking that into consideration, the photo looks like a combo of Velcro rollers and a round brush blow dry. If you don't style your hair like this it won't ever appear that way. Lastly - I always recommend going for styles in which you share similar length & hair density. Other than that looks like it a long layers haircut with some dry cutting/texture cutting to break it up. Good luck achieving your hair goals!"
Hair,34bht0,kimqueso,3,Thu Apr 30 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means knowledgeable in hairstyling, but I feel like it must be slightly frustrating to show a hair dresser of a picture of something already styled and saying 'I want this'. I am absolutely IN LOVE with this model's hair and I really want to know how to tell them what I want, how do I properly describe how her hair is cut?"
Hair,34bht0,audreyality,8,Wed Apr 29 20:48:49 2015 UTC,Can you not show him/her the picture on your phone?
Hair,34bht0,chz_plz,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"Whenever I show a hairdresser my picture they just kind of don't care, they don't ask to see it again nor do they really examine it, and it ends up looking like nothing I asked for. I don't know, I think I just want to be really clear and specific about what I want."
Hair,34bht0,audreyality,22,Wed Apr 29 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"Then you need another hairdresser. Bringing in a picture is totally normal practice and is WAY easier than trying to describe (as you are seeing). Printing out the picture might be a better option, so they don't have to fiddle around with your phone to try to keep the screen on, but bringing in a picture is what you should do. Depending on your hair texture, this may not be totally possible, but you can at least explain with words along with the picture, things like ""I really like this length, I like the way the layers fall, etc etc"" so they know what you like about the hair."
Hair,34bht0,clean_eating,9,Wed Apr 29 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"How could anything be clearer than a picture? If a hairdresser is passive about the picture, say ""what type of cut is in this picture, and how would you do it to my hair?"" Ask for specifics and related it to your hair."

Hair,34bht0,5949,4,Wed Apr 29 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Also, be specific about what it is that you like about the picture. When clients show me a picture I always ask what stands out to them, and also explain to them the difference between the person in the pictures hair type and density, along with what goes into styling it like the picture as well.  This picture is a lot of layers as well as a lot of face framing, starting at the jawline. It is also blown out with product and then curled. If you just let your hair air dry it will not look like the picture, even if the cut is exactly the same."

Hair,34dpxq,LilacLeaves,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:08:53 2015 UTC,"A ""toner"" is just a demi-permanent color.  They're usually used a lot more often with blondes, but it's the same stuff and can be used on dark hair.  Just make sure it's zero lift, deposit-only.  It will usually say it on the package somewhere"
Hair,34cvtt,meroyderp,2,Thu Apr 30 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"in order to achieve pastel colors, or a white-ish pink, you have to lighten the hair to it's lightest level. i suggest lightener powder and 10 volume, as to not compromise the hair itself.  you want your hair as light as christina aguilera's. then you can put a pastel pink over that."
Hair,34cvtt,kebordworyr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"hmm that's a good game plan, i'll keep that in mind, thank you!! :)"
Hair,34cvtt,muricanwoman,2,Fri May 1 02:10:07 2015 UTC,"Red is very tricky!  It fades more quickly than other colors, yet it seems to leave the most pigment behind and is difficult to fully remove.  As to your questions:    ""Toner"" as we refer to it is really just a demi-permanent color.  Think of it like pantyhose.  Permanent color is like solid black tights - you put them on, you really don't see the color of your skin on your legs anymore.  Semi and demi-permanent color is like a pair of light tan colored pantyhose - you see the color of the hosiery over the tone of your skin but you still see your skin underneath.  This makes sense in my head, at least. :P  So if there is anything ""whitening"" it's going to be something like a 'high-lift' color, which is a permanent color that has a tiny bit of bleach in it.  Some color lines sell a ""clear"" which usually has a little ""lift"", meaning it can lighten hair a tiny bit, like a shade.   If you put the pink over the brassy ends, you're not really going to see a big difference.  You may get a more rosy dusty blonde, but it's not going to be HEY THAT'S PINK!  When you bleach/lighten hair it goes through several stages of ""lift"", depending on the original tone of the hair and any artificial color in the hair.  It usually goes from a yucky orange stage up to varying shades of yellow.  The only hair to achieve a whitish tone is to get the hair LIGHT, up to what I call the 'banana peel' stage (the pale inside of the banana peel, NOT the yellow-yellow outside of the peel) and then depending on the tones of the hair, apply a demi-permanent color with a lavender, purpley, or blue tone.  It's almost impossible to get a pure white, honestly!    Since you are prepared to go into a salon, I would go just for a consultation at first.  You can even go this week, JUST for a consult.  Have a stylist look at and touch your hair, and they can judge the health of it and see if it can stand up to more lightening.  A good salon and stylist will have no problem giving a thorough consult, even if you're not getting the color done that day, and they should be able to quote you a price.  They'll probably recommend a good trim afterwards as well.   And if they don't recommend one (but they probably will), ask about a Malibu treatment.  It's a good service to do pre-color.  If you haven't had one before, it's like a deep cleanse/deep condition for your hair and helps pull out impurities.  I live in an area with hard water and I lighten my hair up to a ""Playboy bunny"" blonde, so I get a Malibu every two or so color retouches to keep my ends from picking up that yucky yellow orange tone from the iron in the water.  As to the harsh line, I wouldn't try to do anything to it at home, I personally would say wait and let a stylist work on that.  Hopefully some of this was helpful!  If you have any more questions I'll definitely try and help with an answer :)"
Hair,34d1k3,pinkpanda23,2,Thu Apr 30 04:10:06 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/iv_lhvWEjaI  I think this is pretty close from what I can tell!  The girl talks a little excessively but it's a decent tutorial.  Also if your hair is pretty straight, you might want to curl it or do a hot roller set beforehand.  I know it seems silly to curl your hair if you're just going to brush it out and style it, but it gives your hair more ""movement"" and actually makes it easier to style for looks like this.  My hair is pin straight but I get good success with retro and vintage styles after using pincurls or hot rollers.  Good luck and please get pictures of the result! :)"
Hair,34b7j1,_iLikePie,2,Wed Apr 29 19:32:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know about those brands, but I got my extensions (Halo Couture) through my stylist. It isn't a clip-in, but is very, very, very easy to use.  Google it and see if it appeals to you. PM me with any questions. good luck!"

I've been wearing clip in extensions on and off for almost 8 years now, and these are the best ones I've had. I even highlighted these ones myself and they are still holding up very well. They are thick from top to bottom, so you might have to get them trimmed by your stylist,mans to be honest, they are so heavy they take some getting used to. But they look so beautiful, and really don't look like extensions, they look like your hair. I saw some negative reviews on reddit about bellami so I was so nervous about buying them, and it felt like a lot of the YouTube reviews were sponsored. But I couldn't be happier with the end result."
Hair,34b7j1,Emac2014,2,Thu Apr 30 07:52:42 2015 UTC,Fantastic! I kept browsing YouTube and feeling the same way. I was worried they were hyped up simply because of the fact that Kylie Jenner supposedly wears them and maybe they wouldn't be worth the money. I also know I'll have to dye either the extensions or my hair (yay for impulsively box dying your own hair so it's not a real color! Never again...) so I'm happy to hear you've highlighted yours without ruining them.

I have my appointment with my hair stylist Saturday morning so I'm going to ask her to trim my hair and put them in to make sure the extensions are good enough. I have fairly short hair, about a little above the shoulder (a lob)."

Hair,34a6kp,LeeHarveyT-Bag,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:48:15 2015 UTC,"I would also wear it up a lot more with protective styles like buns and braids. You tube is a great resource for neat things. The Cutegirlshairstyles channel has a lot of cool styles to try. Things like ponytails have the tendency to cause a lot of broken hair where the elastic rubs, especially if you wear one daily. If you do buns, I would also try to stay away from elastics to hold them in place. Open and crimps hair pins can work. Those Goody spin pins are great for buns and hold really well. You could also look into getting hairsticks or hairforks as a fancier way of putting up a bun (you could use chopsticks too, but they might be a bit long). They let you do a bunch of different bun types (lazy wrap, nautilus, etc). There's a lot of you tube tutorials for that kind of thing too. Ever since I started, I have a better time limiting mechanical damage. You may also want to be using a wide tooth comb instead of a brush as well. You can also oil hour hair if you choose to. That can help with moisture issues. You can use things like olive oil that you may already have or other things like coconut oil. Coconut oil can be comedogenic to some people though. Also, the SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) in a lot of mainstream shampoos can be a bit harsh. You might want to consider one that does not contain SLS. I have used brands like Nature's Gate and Kiss My face in the past, but there are big name brands that do have lines that omit SLS. There are a lot of hair care forums out there, like LHC, that have a lot of great advice."

Hair,34b122,ElleDoublevee,2,Wed Apr 29 18:46:09 2015 UTC,"I know that the baking soda as shampoo thing is supposed to be good for your hair, but it may actually be why your ends are so thin, and why your hair grows so slowly. Baking soda may make hair soft at first, but over time, it can be very damaging to hair. Hair is slightly acidic, whereas baking soda is very alkaline. The pH of the hair is then brought up, and the hair is weakened. On top of that, the layer of oil, salt and water on the scalp, called the mantle, dries out, and this obviously is less than ideal for hair growth. Even if the baking soda is diluted, it is still too alkaline for the hair and skin. The apple cider vinegar really doesn't do much to ""balance it out,"" either. It's important to use pH balanced products, which have a pH of around 4.5 - 5. Other than using different products, I'd also recommend applying coconut or olive oil to your hair and scalp, leaving it in for at least half an hour, and washing it out. Taking biotin supplements can also help. Be sure to stay hydrated, and maintain a healthy diet containing a lot of protein-rich foods. Gentle scalp massages and flipping your head upside-down (and keeping it upside-down for about five minutes) can be beneficial, as well. Hope I helped. Good luck, beautiful!!! <3"

I could go and get it done right for more or do it myself and risk the fuck up for less. Either way my hair is short enough and grows decently fast so I wouldn't live with it for more than a couple of months."
