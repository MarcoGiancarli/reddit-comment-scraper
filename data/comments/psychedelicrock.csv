psychedelicrock,3e33cd,Lilyo,7,Tue Jul 21 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"I don't really expect this to appeal to everyone on this sub.  It's certainly psychedelic but definitely not rock.  That being said, I'm totally in love with this album and I think it's a masterpiece.  He definitely threw out all reservations making this one and just did whatever he felt like doing.  I like that."

psychedelicrock,3dwe41,mebenun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, all of the above! I suppose the trailer could be a bit misleading as the particular song that is featured is more orchestral/ambient but I thought the emotions worked well to capture that cinematic feel. That said, the album is very 70s psych influenced with a good deal of catchy dream-pop elements as well as trippy, avant-garde aspects on the contrary end of the spectrum. Some of my main influences are The Doors (I covered ""The Crystal Ship"" a while back), Pink Floyd, Tame Impala, Temples, The Beatles, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Wooden Shjips, Om, Goat, The Raveonettes, Holy Wave, Cromagnon, Blue Cheer and many many others of various genres... I have a very eclectic taste in music and as such elements of jazz, classical and new age find their way into my overall sound. I've got a few songs/clips from the album on my Soundcloud, feel free to check them out, would love to get some opinions! http://www.soundcloud.com/aurablaze"

He owns a record store called Birdman Sound that I would highly recommend checking out.

I was lucky enough to see these guys at Liverpool Psych Fest last year. They were absolutely incredible. National Drone gave me goosebumps. They probably played for 45 min to an hour, but I got so lost in the moment it felt like it could have been 2 hours. Had a chat with Kalle too. Incredibly nice guy."

This song, along with this newer album is some great music. Anton is (allegedly) a much calmer, reasonable person now and they sound really good. I think they could put out more music and it would still be fire throughout"
psychedelicrock,3dk1fc,Angry_Walnut,5,Fri Jul 17 18:14:13 2015 UTC,Agreed this is my favorite band anton is a genius
psychedelicrock,3dk1fc,fun_machine,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get that either. Revelation and Aufheben were both really strong. Everything in his catalogue has its place as far as I'm concerned. Anton is a very creative and productive artist. He may be calmer these days, but the man is still very much an eccentric.

It's about Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and their adventures across America spreading LSD to the masses. It's a really incredible story, it's nonfiction but reads like a novel. You also get to hear stories about the underground psychedelic concerts, and bands like Grateful Dead (who were also a huge part of the Acid movement) pop up randomly. It's such a good read."

psychedelicrock,3daof9,bowagahija,6,Tue Jul 14 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"For those interested, the link posted here is a demo version. Here is the studio version from Spacemen 3's debut album, Sound of Confusion. A fantastic debut of slow, fuzzy, minimal psych. Their cover of the 13th Floor Elevator's Rollercoaster is also awesome.  Just to clarify, this isn't directed at the OP, but I think it's a damn shame many people always point/link to the Taking drugs to make music to take drugs to album. Amazing title aside, it's an unofficial demos album, and their studio albums are even better and seem to get forgotten a bit. For example, the TDTMMTTDT album is often put in 'best of' lists, while their studio albums are not (e.g. in NME and the like and on various blogs), and it always seems to be just because of the title.   Having said that, all of their recordings are great, once you've listened to all their work, you will wish they recorded more!"
psychedelicrock,3daof9,chickenkyiv,2,Tue Jul 14 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"There's something really awesome about the ""dirty"" punk vibe that makes up TDTMMTTDT, but their whole discography is simply incredible, this is just my favorite recording of this song and it embodies psychedelica in a really unique way. Playing With Fire, Recurring, and J's and Sonic's solo stuff are straight up beautiful, no questions about it."
