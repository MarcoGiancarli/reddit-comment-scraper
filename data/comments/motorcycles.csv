motorcycles,3e2czd,silentbobsc,28,Tue Jul 21 12:38:58 2015 UTC,I just ordered vinyl wrap and a new mirror visor for my helmet. I could have just ordered this thing and been twice as cool.  Fuck.
motorcycles,3e2czd,Mister_McNasty,3,Tue Jul 21 12:49:00 2015 UTC,"How hard is it to wrap a helmet? I've wrapped a few pieces of my bike and it was a complete pain in the ass, I can't imagine how hard a helmet would be with all the contours."
motorcycles,3e2czd,good_morning_magpie,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:32 2015 UTC,Not hard from what I've read. I'll try to update this weekend when I dive in.
motorcycles,3e2czd,Mister_McNasty,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would be great, I've been putting serious thought into it. From what I have read the best way to do things like this to complex contours is hydrographics but I have no idea how you would even go about that with a helmet."
motorcycles,3e2czd,good_morning_magpie,5,Tue Jul 21 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"Graphic designer/installer at a sign shop, here...  helmets can be damn tricky, depending on the size and coverage of the vinyl.  Accents, stripes, and partial partial coverage pieces aren't so bad,   but once you approach > 75% coverage, its going to be a royal pain to achieve using larger pieces.  Getting it applied smoothly without wrinkles or bubbles will require some patience.  Should you go ahead with wrapping your lid, here's a few tips before you get started:   Surface prep is key.  Clean the entire helmet as thoroughly as possible.  Final step should be a wipe-down with isopropyl (rubbing alcohol).  Might be a good idea to remove the liner as well, just in case you decide to use application fluid - see below. A nice clean work area.  If you peel your decal off the release film and then accidentally drop it on a dirty surface sticky-side-down, you'll be ordering new decals.  No, your tears will not rinse away the crap that is now stuck to your sick graphics. A heat gun or blow dryer will come handy.  Heat gun with proper temp control ftw - the key here is using the heat to 'relax' the vinyl not to cook it.  Most materials stretch fine when cold, so if you have to stretch it, don't heat it first or the memory of the material is toast.  Stretch it cold, apply heat to relax it once the decal is already down (removing wrinkles, etc) Patience.  Seriously... you can't have enough of it when dealing with full coverage over compound curved surfaces.  Take your time. Application fluid can be your friend, but it depends on the decal itself and what type of vinyl its produced from.  Air-release materials don't play with with wet applications.  Check with your supplier to see what they recommend. Beer.  Copious amounts of beer is always good.  Might not help with the install... but still...  beer is good.   Good luck and post some pics of the results if you go ahead with it!"
motorcycles,3e2czd,gisdood,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"The shape of your helmet is definitely a factor when it comes to wrapping, but my AFX90 is a decent platform to start on. I've seen some elaborate wraps on YouTube with funkier looking helmets than I have and the results were always beautiful.  I picked up a cheap black carbon print vinyl off Amazon for $6 shipped, so if it comes out like shit, it's not like I'm out a lot of money."

motorcycles,3e2czd,allenpa5,3,Tue Jul 21 13:09:57 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good observation...  Maybe make some sort of break-away fastener for it?  Something that will only get detached if you has X lbs of pressure?  That way the wind won't take it off.
motorcycles,3e2czd,CarbonGod,6,Tue Jul 21 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"Cutting and using a light velcro, or snaps might be enough.  This way, if it does catch, it'll just rip itself off like male-stripper pants."

Big shout out to Powerline Motorsports of West Mahopec for hooking it up BIG TIME with a tow and repair in under an hour. The owner there was easily the nicest mechanic I've encountered.  We rode a huge length of 133, up to Rt. 4, took 4 out to the Long Trail Brewery around Killington, then did a big loop back around toward Manchester. We went to a couple swimming spots near Poultney and Lake St. Catherine. Mainly just cruised around 133 and surrounding roads, hung out at the quarry in Dorset one day. We were more into doing scenic loops than crushing massive amounts of miles since we wanted to hang out where we rode as well."

My question is ""what is the difference between a drz400sm and a drz400rzxvawdfqwfe and a drs400 blah blah""   Maybe it's just a weird question, my examples in my idiocy are all suzuki bikes, if you can parse my idiot mashing on the keyboard.  Edit: I'm not concerned about suzuki bikes and I'm not trying to buy a bike, I just honestly don't get it.  I think some other folks with the wheel size and whatnot are making some sense."

motorcycles,3e0u3y,zombiebunnie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"DRZ400SM has a more stretched out gearbox I believe, 17 inch wheels, street tires, stuff like that, things to make it more road going.  DRZ400S is their dual sport model so you get 21 inch front tire, knobbys, and a closer geared gearbox.  DRZ400E is the non-legal dirt bike version that can be converted to a dual sport in some states. It has an aluminum frame instead of steal which saves weight, is geared like a madman, and you pretty much need to be suicidal riding the bastard. Its a gateway to such silly things as the XR650R."

In America, Florida is a place that people retire to when they're old due to the pleasant climate.  This has led to a state populated by semi-wealthy, hyper-conservative senior citizens that turn out in droves to vote.  Those old folks, coupled with immigrants, have established a state government that is completely out of touch society.  They have absurdly lax laws surrounding debt, taxes, guns-- you name it.  They are also one of the most populous states, so chance would have it that some of the crazier shit happens there and media has made a business of publicizing it.    You would never notice anything awry in nicer, upscale parts like Key West or Naples.  50% of the population in those areas are tourists/summer home owners."

There are also impact studies undertaken to assess the effect a structure that large filled with people would have on local infrastructure.

They render insignificant these types of encounters that often end as horrible accidents for those who weren't wearing the proper gear. With your jacket, you would hardly have noticed the wasp, without it (and depending on your personal fear level regarding these types of insects) a wasp sting can cause a crash that may very likely kill you. Same with gloves. A little pebble that does nothing more than catch your attention when it hits your glove protected knuckles can feel like a bullet against bare skin, causing you to react unintentionally and crash. The gear does much more than protect you in the event of a crash, it often protects you so that you don't crash in the first place. ATGATT."

But one of the bolt releases some engine coolant. I tighten it back up immediately and leave that one in.  It's not very easy to check the coolant level on my bike, so I just left it, only a small amount came out, I'm sure it's fine.  Skip to the next day, first time I ride the bike after the incident. Starts fine, cruising.. Lean my left hand over to rearrange the bar end mirror on the right side (used left hand as I didn't want to ease off the throttle).  Bike conks out. My bike is only a year and a bit old, this takes me by surprise.  I pull her over. Inspect, no leak, no nothing. Walk a few minutes to get some 3G so I can find out where I find my coolant level. At this point my gear is off because it's bloody hot.  On my way back to the bike I see my mums car. She's on her way back from shopping and is scared shitless because she thinks I've come off the bike. ""No mum I'm fine, but the bloody thing is broken.""  Remove some bolts to move some fairing so I can see the coolant level, expecting it to be low, as that's the only explanation for my bike to stop working.  It's fine. As I suspected the day before, I only lost a tiny bit, nothing to worry about. What. The. Fuck.  I start to consider my options. I'm only a minute from my house, but it's up a bloody hill. Nightmare to drag it up. Well shit.  I sit on the bike, try the engine again. Still not working.  But. But then. I turn the key, and the fuel injection doesn't work either. I know this. This has happened before. What is this.  I remember. My friend and I like to play a game. When we see eachothers bikes, we turn their kill switch off in the hope they won't realise and think something is wrong (hilarious I know). I'm the king of this game.  I hit my fucking kill switch when I rearranged my mirror.  But because of the coolant issue the day before, I immediately assumed it was a big issue. It must have been something to do with that.  Good one."

At one point theres a relatively long straight in the flood plains where I ride and he goes to pass. Well, I just paced him and wasnt really even trying. Cracked WOT and just walked away. He had to merge back into our lane behind me due to oncoming traffic. I had to make a fuel stop anyway and theres a station at the end of the straight. I turn off and he flies by middle fingers a blazin. Felt good.  Edit: Since I have to spell it out for some people here: The road we were on has no options for a turn off, no shoulder, and no areas to pass. This fool was riding me for roughly 3 miles with less than 10 feet between us. When the road opened up into a long straight, he went to pass and I took off, leaving him behind. I then turned off.

motorcycles,3e356h,Seseorang,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Modern engines should cut the injectors supply until engine speed has dropped enough to activate them again.   That's not really a good idea due to bikes not having direct injection. That means that there is residue gasoline on the walls of the manifold directly infront of the intake valve. If you cut out the injection, that gasoline still goes into the cylinder with the fresh air. But it's not enough, leading to lean conditions for a short time. That can lead to not so nice things like detonation, knock etc. Repeatedly running the engine in lean conditions, even if it is just for a short time, is asking for engine damage/failure."

He is saving like  0.00000001% (made up) on the total revs of the engine over the course of its lifetime, and increasing wear on other components.

motorcycles,3e356h,thescott2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:32 2015 UTC,He's not wrong or dumb at all. He is simply making a different choice in how he chooses to brake however you are right that he won't have the ability to resume as you described.  100% brake with no engine brake = wear is 100% on the brakes.  Little to no break and heavy use of engine brake = less wear on brakes and the transmission/clutch takes a bit more [debatable and practically non-existent if properly rev matched]  In my province's version of the MSF (it's a mandatory course here) there is absolutely zero talk about engine braking.   Personally I use engine braking myself and ride the way OP does in order to have power in case I have to abort my braking.

motorcycles,3e356h,dotslashme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:09 2015 UTC,"You could tell your buddy he's going to wear out his clutch by coasting around with it held in.  While true in some sense, it holds about as much value as telling you that you are going to damage your bike by using engine braking to help slow as you prepare to stop.  Perhaps the most machine-friendly way would be to kick it into neutral when sighting a stop light, coasting a bit and then just drag your feet to the light, as you wouldn't want to wear out those brake pads.  :)"
motorcycles,3e356h,tuckfard0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"Engine braking doesn't hurt it.  It's mostly down to personal preference, although engine braking ensures that you're in the right gear for the speed you're going, which helps if you need to take off again quickly.  Let's say you are coming up on a stop light in 5th gear, you engine brake through 4th and 3rd, but you glance in your mirror and see a car coming up fast behind you not braking at all.  Rather than get rear ended, you could hit the throttle and get off to the side, possibly avoiding being hit.  If you're still in 5th, you're not gonna get the ideal throttle response.  That very unlikely situation aside, some bike transmissions work better if you're rolling while shifting through multiple gears.  Mine gets finicky when I try and downshift multiple times while stopped.  All that aside, it's your choice whether to ride the clutch or engine brake."

motorcycles,3e356h,mrbbrj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:31 2015 UTC,If your stopping is damaging either the clutch or the brakes such that they need repair then you're doing something wrong that's not best fixed by just abusing the other.
motorcycles,3e356h,BigRedS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:23 2015 UTC,He means that if you're not a pro at engine braking and don't match the revs well you're adding a bit of extra wear on the transmission that otherwise would go directly to the brakes.  Proper engine braking at low speeds will not cause wear that would require repairs. For most motorcycle owners it will never be a factor but someone who buys an old 1985 and wants to keep it until he dies might be more invested in keeping the guts running pristine.

WR250R is 6700 bucks + TTL where I""m at. I got my Grom out the door for 3600. I'd be paying almost double for a 250.  It comes down to personal preference.

Even if they were the same in cost the grom is an amazing commuter because the maintenance is so easy. I can change the oil and check the valves in ~20 minutes and it is ready to go. The small size means I can lane split more easily, I get 100 MPG and I can pass it off as a moped and chain it to the bicycle parking spots... and everyone loves it and is always asking me what the hell I am riding.

motorcycles,3dxo04,InaneD,4,Mon Jul 20 20:59:11 2015 UTC,I use mine to get back and forth to work and around town during the week. On the weekends if the weather is nice and I have the time I take it to the mountains and make the big bikes look slow. The grom handles very well and with better tires you would be amazed at what it can do. The fun roads in the mountains where I ride it have a speed limit of 35 and you can only do about 50 tops in the tight sections so the grom works great. Its all about staying on the gas and off the brakes. Sure the big bikes can run away from you in the straight sections but if thats the only place you can out run a grom your slow.

motorcycles,3dxo04,thorsound,3,Mon Jul 20 15:19:28 2015 UTC,I saw the same one twice yesterday. I usually wave at oncoming bikes but when I see a Grom I instinctively point and scream inside my helmet/
motorcycles,3dxo04,SumoSizeIt,3,Mon Jul 20 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"So I'm the guy on the far right. I've owned 4 bikes now. 00' 955 Sprint ST, 2001Aprilia Mille R and an 05 BMW R1100S Boxercup. This being my 4th and by far the most fun out of all of them!   It gets the best gas mileage, its the cheapest and the fun factor is the highest. When you get 5 of your buddies together and thrash them around, its the most fun feeling you'll ever have one a bike.    Btw im also 6'2"".

China brands around here would be Racal (shittiest quality), Motostar (highest quality ones), Sinski, etc.  It's bad enough these bikes need a serious going over straight off the showroom floor (very low quality control) but the culture here is also that people hardly maintain their bikes besides oil changes so they get a really bad rep."

motorcycles,3dxo04,cup-o-farts,6,Mon Jul 20 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's good they use full size bikes for training. The Grom is light and easy to throw around, but it's not necessarily representative of what it's like to ride a ""real"" bike should someone choose to go out and buy a 250+ after the course. The weight and power difference is noticeable, not just because of the engine displacement, but the size of the wheels and your center of gravity as well."

motorcycles,3e1piy,peeholestinger,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:00 2015 UTC,This was how I mounted my GoPro to my Shoei. There is a ridge right below the vent so you only get a minimal mounting surface. It worked decent up until last week when the adhesive finally gave out. I cannot find a helmet mount I like. Chin was the best. I may try this method. I just hate all the mounts needed.
motorcycles,3e1piy,DoingitFortheMusic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:31 2015 UTC,This is how I have my set up. It is uneven but the adhesive is strong enough. I trust it enough because I can't rip it off easily. I just don't want to buy all the other attachments. I'm content with it.
motorcycles,3e1piy,ridethepiggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:51 2015 UTC,I could see it blocking the vent but the uneven surface isn't much of an issue.  My mount is only stuck in the middle of the adhesive and holds up at 130+mph with head turns.
motorcycles,3e1piy,niciuffo,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:10 2015 UTC,"Could you provide a link of the mount? I have the same helmet and am planning to buy a gopro, but don't want to mount it to the side."
motorcycles,3e1piy,bastion72,2,Tue Jul 21 11:10:59 2015 UTC,This is how I did my mount.
motorcycles,3e1piy,WatchingourWorldBurn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing this OP.  I have a RF-1200 and hate the teletubby forehead mount because of the way it fucks up the aerodynamics.  I've been wanting to set up a chin mount but didn't know how because of the ridge on the chin.  I'll definitely try this out!
motorcycles,3e1piy,beestakingthe405,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:55 2015 UTC,I ended up 3D printing spacers for my chin mount. But in the end I decided to sell the GoPro and get a Sena 10C instead. Here's my review of that.
motorcycles,3e1piy,m_w_l,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"Got the same setup too. But every once in a while, you should check the adhesive part. It will eventually become loose."
motorcycles,3e1piy,bscb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:36 2015 UTC,Does it block out a lot of air that would normally go through the vent? I'm debating on how I should mount a helmet camera to my X-Twelve.
motorcycles,3e1piy,igbad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:42 2015 UTC,i'm pretty sure gopro has an upside down shoot mode so you can mount the camera upside-down but the video will be in the correct orientation.  https://gopro.com/support/articles/how-to-rotateflip-a-video-in-gopro-cineform-studio

motorcycles,3e1piy,ccosby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:19 2015 UTC,Nice setup. Better than sticking it on top of the helmet like I did with my rf1200(which I don't like). I might have to try it myself.

Anyway, the new R1 is going to feel really similar in power curve, but the delivery is adjustable, so you'll be able to play with the modes as you get comfortable. The real difference will be at higher rpm: when the Z1000 starts to fall off, the R1 is just starting to make peak power. But you basically know this going in. The bike gains nearly 50 hp in less than 2000 rpm... whoosh.  You'll also have to get used to mapping out fuel stations, with low 30s average economy.

For the aftermarket parts you'll get half the original price at best, probably less. The underglow kit wouldn't be worth anything to me and I would probably remove it as soon as I get the bike. Additional weight and all that.  For the bike itself NADA/Blue Book should give you a pretty good idea.  All in all I'd say 6-8k sounds ok, depending on the state of the bike and which aftermarket exhaust and pegs exactly.  Edit: overlooked the ""dropped"" part. That easily brings down the value 1-2k, so we're looking at $4-7k."
motorcycles,3e2zb6,alfix8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:15 2015 UTC,The bars are vortex and so are the pegs/controls.

If not, one of the keys, likely the ignition was changed at some point. I'd be worried a little about that.   You can always get some saddlebags, rear seat bag (or a saddlebag / rear seat bag hybrid), or a tank bag for a few hundred dollars. It's not super secure in my opinion, but for storage while riding instead of a backpack, it's an option! Expect to spend $50-100 on the low end, with nicer examples in the $200-300 range. I plan to get a rear seat bag sometime soon-ish (maybe, we'll see) and the one I want is a medium sized bag (think like 12x8x8) and it's about $100. Not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either!"
motorcycles,3e3ag1,SVTf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"Bought it from my dad's friend who was the original owner, and I think the deal is that the gas tank is a different key than the ignition, which is also a different key for the seat lock. I don't know if the seat lock and the helmet locks have the same key(the key my dad's friend lost was the one for the seat, so we had the pins removed for the time being). I'm so confused at this point with all the locks and keys. Need to label my ignition and gas keys.  EDIT: Thanks for the advice on the bags, I'll give them a look!"
motorcycles,3e3ag1,SVTf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"That's weird. Every bike I've owned has only needed one key for all locks and ignition. Label them up then if you have more than one!

Go over the dam and camp on the west side of the reservoir, way better camping spots over there, and after riding 50 across Nevada it's like an oasis. I've done 50, and would encourage anyone to do it once. Twice? Well, some people get off on suffering, I suppose...   I did get to stop and watch F/A-18s dropping practice bombs on targets just off the highway as I got out near Fallon NAS, which was pretty cool. Finding that my front tire was flat due to a failed valve stem a few miles later kinda sucked. There is no where in Fallon to buy a 17"" front tire, BTW."

I'm not afraid to do stupid things on motorcycles.  I noticed something on my last trip and it really stuck with me. It was the first encounter with another motorcyclist on a similar trip, where the other person was just hitting the road. He was on his third day and was totally redoing his loadout at a gas station. I was mentally on my way home, and he was just setting out. I helped him remount his gear and gave him some straps.   After I rode off I had a strange melancholy for the rest of the day.  I still had lots of cool shit to see, and some of the coolest stuff I just stumbled upon was just around the corner (Experimental Breeder Reactor-1 in Idaho), but I was on my way back to home and work and the default world.

motorcycles,3e2krg,vscoy00,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, really. I've never seen the GC, so do you think I should still bypass? I will get to see it eventually in my life as well as Vegas which would also be skipped if I skip the canyon. I am prioritizing scenery over most everything: Rockies, deserts, PCH hopefully, Pike's Peak, etc. I am going to probably cut out stops in San Antonio and NOLA and probably do more directly to Deal's Gap. Also, I have about a 250 mile fuel range; go you think I should consider bring a spare can? I have a collapsible emergency container I could bring along.  I always enjoy your posts, btw. Nice stuff.

motorcycles,3e2krg,Marshall498,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"There's nothing on earth like Vegas & the GC, but I despise the roads that lead to them. The Colorado Plateau is barren, windy & dull. It makes Amarillo look nice.   Southern Utah is a way better ride. Zion, Bryce & Capitol Reef aren't the GC, but the highway between them is so much more fun & scenic. Same with the central AZ & NM mountains--AZ 89, NM 152, and US 191 / 180 are some of the very best roads in the country. I-40 through Gallup is just the worst. Literally the worst.   US50 & US6 are actually pretty similar across Nevada; I like 6 because Yosemite is less of a clusterfuck than Tahoe. Both are good rides.   Also, CA198 up to Sequoia NP (near Bakersfield) is the best road in the country. Death Valley's awesome, too, but it's a little out of the way.  I don't think you'll ever go 250 miles without passing a gas station. Just keep it topped up in the desert.   There's absolutely no reason you can't average 500 miles a day, but you'll always be under pressure to keep moving. You could dramatically reduce the miles by trucking out to Colorado & just riding the western loop, but that's kind of cheating."

motorcycles,3e2krg,Zomberry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"I'm working out the numbers now, and it shouldn't be too bad. I routinely do 500km a day upwards to 1000-1200km so a bit more should be ok, weather permitting. Must easier to accomplish alone.

motorcycles,3e2krg,MiguelMenendez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"As we've become online acquaintances I felt I'd offer some opinion that is being overlooked here. Fatigue.   I rounded the trip to 7k miles for detours, traffic avoidance etc. Thats 425 miles per day.  That being said, it's doable in my opinion if you're trained and have built up for this sort of sustained riding. But....  Are you confident in your riding skills to take on a trip that big? Changing a flat roadside, diagnosing a mechanical error as being catastrophic or minor? Changing your oil roadside? Surely it may go by without a hinge, but gotta be prepared.  How many times have you ridden for 6+ hours back to back to back etc.?  425 miles a day is cakewalk for a 3 day 2 night weekend trip. But fatigue will set in if you keep going, and I get the feeling seeing your trips (which are all awesome and I applaud you) that you don't get past the 3 day mark often. If you go on with the trip regardless of that, I would suggest setting up points throughout your trip that are equivalent to a 3 day weekend trip and find a hotel to stay at on those nights. Rest, shower, all the good stuff. Inexperience leads to accidents, but rarely do people consider fatigue from being in the saddle for hours on end. Its physically draining as we all know, but mentally our brain is working hard to stay focused and alert. No matter how much training you have, your brain will lose focus and it needs sound rest. AND NUTRITION! Glucose!  I raced for a long time. About 15+ years of motocross mixed with superbike racing for the last 9 years. No matter how much I race or ride, I still get tired mentally and physically. Hell this old man Bobber I built kills my ass and back after just 2 hours! You know your bike, you know your body, but most importantly know your limits. Be honest with yourself and what you're capable of.   I support your trip 100%, but if it comes down to being a race against the clock I suggest pushing it off til next spring when you can get a couple extra days in there. Id hate to see a fellow rider have a bad experience or go down because they had to rush it.  For what it's worth...Most X-country trips are done with the overarching idea of sightseeing this beautiful country. Knowing how much you like to camp and ride I'd hate to see you rush through it....  Just my 2 cents. I support your adventures no matter what so don't take this as negative, just a different approach from a fellow rider."

This is of course assuming that the engineers at Kawasaki know what they're doing. If you think some guy on the internet knows better, feel free to search the myriad of forum threads discussing the pros and cons of oils, filters and spark plugs and buy whatever they recommend."

motorcycles,3e36fa,Gnomish8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:26 2015 UTC,Yea for the average setup go with what the manual recommends as far as oil weight goes. For filter just a quality one that fits. I'm partial to the K&N myself as it is easy to find.   For spark plugs the difference can be in how long they last. There is some talk how some plugs can actually help with fuel economy but it isn't by much. Personally I like the NGK plugs and they do make their iridium plugs for my bike so I went with them. They should last longer than the stock plugs but if you replace them on the schedule the vendor recommends it shouldn't matter.
motorcycles,3e36fa,ccosby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no way the spark plug changes anything about fuel economy.   But yeah, longevity can be different. The question is if it's enough of a difference to warrant the higher price."
motorcycles,3e36fa,alfix8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"Eh. Okay this is how it goes. Thicker oil protects the engine better. Thinner oil flows and coats the engine parts faster.  Thick oil is what you need when the engine is hot, to protect it. Thin oil is what you need when you first start (cold), so the engine isn't running dry. It's a balance.  This is why a lot of us use W-graded oil. Eg, 10W-40. W=winter (cold). Low numbers = thin oil, high numbers= thick oil. So when you start the bike cold, the oil is at a thin 10 SAE rating. Once it gets warmed up, it thickens into 40 SAE rating.  If you live in a hot environment, or are in a lot of standstill traffic, you can switch to 20W-50 oil to protect your engine better. Or, if you are in a wintery environment with a lot of open road, 5W-30 may be better for you."

Thinner oil flows and coats the engine parts faster.   is a huge simplification and not really how oil works.  It's also not really relevant for the question. The oil recommended by the manufacturer will work in almost all external conditions. Exceptions might be living in the arctic or in the middle of the desert. As long as you don't regularly ride in temperatures below -5°C or above 45°C, there is absolutely no reason to get a different oil than the one recommended by the manufacturer."

Seriously though, tires will do much more for you than ABS ever will. IF you get a good set like Pilot Road 4s, they will channel water away and offer you plenty of braking power.

And not having abs will force you to go out and learn the correct braking technique, specifically how to use your front brake, which everyone should do whether on an ABS or non-ABS bike."
motorcycles,3e340a,Stridercal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  It would be technically possible to add ABS to a model that has both ABS and non-ABS versions, but the cost would be prohibitively expensive."
motorcycles,3e340a,Flypflap91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"Seriously man, just get one without ABS and learn to brake. you should be able to ride non-ABS bikes anyways.  The whole ABS into a non-ABS bike will probably be more expensive than you now imagine."
motorcycles,3e340a,HeroDanny,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"ABS is overrated anyway. It's a nice safety feature. But it's not any safer than having good braking technique. When I was searching for a 600 I was adamant on getting a 09+ cbr600rr because of ABS. But after about 5 months of searching I decided I don't even want ABS. It weighs a LOT and makes brake maintenance much harder + it is more expensive by about $1,000 (even the used bikes are more expensive with ABS by a good margin and they're also super rare).  I bought my 08 cbr600rr non-abs and couldn't be happier. I threw on a set of chinese shorty levers for <$30 and I use 2 finger braking and got some street pilot 4 tires and I brake just fine, no issues."
motorcycles,3e340a,alfix8,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"But it's not any safer than having good braking technique.   Hahaha, what? That might be true on good, dry asphalt in a planned stop, but in any other condition on the street ABS is a huge improvement. Stop spreading bullshit.   It weighs a LOT   Sure, because you can feel less than 1kg of difference in weight. That is less than the difference between eating before riding or not."

On top of that I have only ridden abs bikes, and I haven't even gotten my license yet (full A). Though I am looking at the middleweights and medium displacements I would rather have abs until I get to the point where I am much more knowledgable of the limitations of bikes in general. Besides statistically there are 4x more insurance claims from non-abs bikes vs abs.   I know I know. A ST isn't an advisable first bike, but I just got curious about he topic when looking at used bikes (80-90% of them are non-abs)"

Unbelievable customer service.   Altogether spent $1300+ on gear before I'd even taken my MSF course or bought a bike. But it was well worth it. I have leather everything so I can be as safe as possible. I did go back and get some Kevlar jeans for short trips to grocery store, etc.   Two months after buying gear, I found a Ninja 300 ABS lightly used for $3600. People laugh that my gear was a 1/3rd of the price of my bike and I'm definitely one of the few around town rocking full ATGATT in 90 degree weather, but I don't care.   Jacket  Boots  Helmet   Gloves  Leather Pants   Kevlar Jeans  EDIT: In retrospect I'm not sure if I'd spend the $400 on Dainese leather pants. I LOVE their jackets but to me, the pants I'd be ok with another cheaper brand. But the feel of a Dainese jacket is magic.   I also couldn't find a pair of Dainese gloves that fit my hands right, hence the Alpinestars.   But the jacket is freaking magic. There are other Dainese jackets I'd love to get in the future...but...you know, budget. :)  The boots have been fantastic. Managed to run my foot over during MSF (derp) and was fine. They are super comfortable. I ride to the coffee shop, church, etc and wear for several hours and my feet still feel fine. Love that on these ones your pants can go over instead of being tucked in. Highly recommend a boot that does that. It just feels natural and looks great too.   EDIT2: Definitely recommend going into a store to try things on. I wouldn't have known what to order without trying stuff on. I think Revzilla is awesome once you know what you need, but as a first time buyer, having a real person help you figure out what you need is invaluable."

There was ice on the road and I slid off. But it wasn't my fault, there was ice.""  Or, one woman hit a school bus, but it wasn't her fault because the bus was stopped in the middle of the road as she came over a crest in Pennsylvania too fast and couldn't stop in time.

motorcycles,3e20sp,AnTyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:59 2015 UTC,"It's a VanVan so there's not much to go wrong with it.  But like AnTyx said, change the oil and various filters on it.  Check your tyres!  And the battery is pretty much guaranteed to be flat.  Don't worry, that's normal.  If you have a charger, put it on that for a while.  If you don't, well find yourself some jumper cables and someone with a car to give it a jumpstart, and ride the hell out of it for a bit (after changing the oil!) to charge the battery back up again.  Basically, give it a proper routine service.  At least you don't have to worry about radiator fluid.  Oh and it's a Suzuki, so some of the electrics might have corroded.  Give it a proper T-CLOCS check to find out what might have gone wrong with it.  Otherwise, though, it's a hardy little bike.  If it's been inside a garage, there's unlikely to be too much that's gone wrong with it."
motorcycles,3e20sp,dagbrown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:01 2015 UTC,"Oil and filter maybe, charge the battery, check tyre condition and brakes, try cranking it. If it doesn't crank check the fuel, may be old - it'll smell bad if it's gone, you could also try spraying some WD40 down the spark plug holes to free up the engine a bit (unlikely to be a problem at just 5 months) or running some carb cleaner.  VanVans are invincible, school I'm learning with has a few approaching 300k miles. I doubt you'll actually need to do anything other than charge the battery to get it going."

motorcycles,3e2lao,elkster88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"If it charged the bike enough to start it, riding it should have recharged the battery. It really sounds like the charging system isn't working. Parasitic drain is a possibility but it's a rare thing. Far more common is a failure of the reg/rect, or a poor connection, or a failed stator."
motorcycles,3e2lao,triplefreshpandabear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"Make sense, thanks for the advice.  Probably will make sure all the connections are good and use a voltmeter to check the charging system."
motorcycles,3e2lao,elkster88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"I only suspect parasitic drain because, if it's starts good, rides to work, and then can still start again for the ride home after being drained on the first start and ride then I assumed it was charging on that first ride, but would drain when it sits. could still be the case if it's a good battery with a lot of reserve minutes though, and you are correct that parasitic drain is pretty rare. won't know till you check, just throwing out ideas to check for"
motorcycles,3e2lao,mustanggt90210,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"I am not ruling parasitic drain out, but it's not necessary to explain how OP could ride multiple times without the battery going dead. His battery is big enough that he could ride for some time with no charge being contributed by the alternator. Also, charging system failure is not always absolute. I had a bike with one failed diode in the rectifier that would supply almost enough charge to power the lights and ignition so a fully charged battery would last a week or so before going too low to start the bike.  First thing to do is charge the battery and see what the charging voltage is. My experience tells me 9 times out of 10 it will be a failure to charge."

motorcycles,3dzecq,BlowMeNougat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:59 2015 UTC,Yea given he is in his mid 50's I bet the real reason he went with the R3 was because of that.
motorcycles,3dzecq,mackmack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:55 2015 UTC,"It has a little more power than the R3, but not by a whole lot (1-2 hp), and it weighs significantly less wet (about 50-60 pounds) so there is a significant difference on the track, but I'm willing to be the R3/Ninja 300, would be a lot better of a ride.  The reason I got the Ninja 300 is that it had ABS and it has a long lineage so likely cheap aftermarket parts. I don't think the R3 has ABS. The RC390 does, but it didn't seem very comfortable, and it was a bit more expensive. The RC390 also has a much smaller fuel tank, so long distance you need to refuel more often, and the fuel economy was a little less efficient."

Overall I got a good deal, if only it had ABS though."

That peace of mind was worth a lot for me, and I intend on keeping this bike for a long time, I'm not a speed-maniac.  Figured I couldn't get as good a deal on the 2015 since they will be wanting to clear inventory on 2014's with the 2016's around the corner, and was able to haggle them down decently under MSRP with no extra fees."

motorcycles,3e17ze,htshadow,5,Tue Jul 21 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"I've ridden both and would go for the FZ-07.  There's something about the 390 that just invites hooning. It is an absolute blast to ride, but I can really see myself doing all kinds of dumb shit on it. The small KTMs are hilariously tiny and almost feel like insanely overpowered mopeds. They'll do fine in the city, but they start to run out of steam around 115km/h. The 390 should definitely be your choice if you'll be spending most of your time filtering through city traffic, but as an all-round bike I think you might find it lacking.   The FZ-07 does have a more powerful engine, but the way it delivers power (less hooligany) makes it easier to ride it in a sane way. You won't have to worry about running out of power anytime soon, and the bike will exceed all speed limits with ease while still leaving lots of headroom for overtaking and whatnot. The seating position is great, and you can still ride the hell out of the bike. At 190cm (6'2""?) I also found it a lot more comfortable than the 390. I'd say the FZ-07 is a great beginner's bike, and will do more things than the 390. It can still filter with no problems, even if it would be easier on the 390.   In case of vanity both bikes will sound great with aftermarket exhausts. The 390 will be a braaaapy little monster, and the FZ-07 can have a throaty growl to it that's just awesome. The stock exhaust on the 390 clearly sounds better though."

motorcycles,3e17ze,iAteATree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"How did you come upon these two, seems like two totally different bikes to narrow it down to.  Personally wouldn't get the 390 Duke, good if all you want is short hoons around country backroads it's really a one trick pony, fun blasts. Everything I've heard about it says ""I wouldn't have one as my main bike but it's bloody good fun"" but at the end of the day it's your preference, definitely take one for a good test ride before committing.  The FZ07 is a good all rounder and what I'd choose, especially being that it's got better power and a smoother power band. Good first big bike.  Comfier too, even at your height you'd probably find the 390 less than comfortable on long journeys, then again being 6'6"" and 300lbs I'm probably biased on that point.  Final point, buying a new bike as your first bike, you've got to accept the fact you probably will drop your first bike at some stage, and you may even come off it. With that in mind would you still want to spend thousands on a brand new bike? Personally think it's always better to get something a little older as a first bike."
motorcycles,3e17ze,Megaross,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"Why not a DRZ400-SM? Super slick first bike. Awesome city bike. Tons of fun in town. Corner to corner, light to light. Cheap to insure. Cheap to maintain. Cheap to fix if you do skid it down the road.  With handguards, you really don't break anything. Basically bulletproof. Tons of aftermarket support. Can do highway speeds easily (not a ton of passing power). Super easy seating position. Made for your target height and weight.

I think as an urban commuter exclusively, the 390 Duke would be excellent.  That said, I ended up buying the FZ-07 and am very happy with it as both commuter and occasional weekend ride.  I would love to get an RC390 down the road as a 3rd bike, specifically for canyon or track use.    I've been riding for 13 years and had what may be one of the worst starter bikes, a Ducati 748.  I think either of your choices are excellent.  If you have a good head on your shoulders and are smart enough to be scared as a newbie, the FZ-07 would be just fine.  It is very easy to ride, will work well on the freeway and has great low speed handling.  The engine torque also makes your gear selection less relevant which will help as a new rider, not that this will not apply to the Duke as well."

I do have second thoughts only because I bought it brand new, so 7k in debt at age 17 was a bummer. I've had it since November and had no issues when storing it for the winter. It broke in really well (after about 600miles) and my friend that owns a ninja loves to ride it too. I have it in blue and get butterflies every time I see it in my garage.

Same thing about rain covers... right now my bike gets parked under an overhang, out of the rain, but before it was just out on the street - to me it's always seemed like a cover would just trap dirt and moisture and not let the bike dry out properly.

Not to mention, my Harley friends love the Fury but they're just like Jeep guys (no offense to Jeep or Harley guys) in that the brand is the greatest in the world irregardless of price or reliability.

I’ve done trips that were about 200-300 miles with a lot of highway. The suspension is going to beat you up. I would also consider it a mid-sized cruiser and at your height, you may feel cramped. I test rode the 2013 Yamaha Bolt and the physical size felt the same so again, you may feel cramped.  I think between the 4 you are looking at, it is going to be the Vulcan. I was going to say the Fury because of the engine but those tires are going to track cracks and tar snakes better. Plus the rake on the Vulcan should give better turn in. *I say should simply because I’ve never ridden the Fury. There is a lot to like about the Vulcan and my only gripe would be that I would want a little more power from the engine but it’s still plenty.

He makes the point that it would be money well wasted because if he never goes down at the end of his riding career, and never had to use the gear to save his skin, it would technically be a waste of money, as it would have never actually been used.  He isn't making the assumption that riding skill means everything, and he states that if he learns to ride well, he MAY not need it, which leaves open the possibility of crashes outside the rider's control.

Basically, I figured getting a motorcycle (being also broke and a student) is a little impractical nowadays. I learned that you have to keep the moto maintained, and the ride depends on the day; traffic, bad drivers, weather. Also, the gears will cost you more (you already got em) but I will be surprised if you didn't spend at least 200-300 dollars on them. They look pretty good. Bic being the cheapest. You also have to get your mindset ready for the road, and for me, I think I need a little bit of 10-15 minutes to get my head ready for riding (if you're going to be a commuting rider) and it sucks if you've been sitting infront of a desk for more than eight hours.

motorcycles,3dym9z,DemonEggy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the heads up. I have tried the helmet and its snug, I was advised to get one that ensures thee isnt much play when turning the head. As in too loose. Its snug as anything and takes a bit of hassle to get on.  Good point about the boots. I need to save up some more and get a decent pair. Is it normal to sweat like a pig when you wear your helmet?   The pants are CE armored camo pants. which these will go over for added protection?"
motorcycles,3dym9z,geoelectric,7,Mon Jul 20 17:00:33 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sure those pants will do fine.  I just find them a bit .. Loud .. For my tastes hehe   And as for boots even a decent pair of high ankle steel toes is a good start on a budget at least your getting protection if your toe clips a rock or something in a turn and ankle support should the worst happen and you're doing a 50mph pretzel impression   Sweating like a pig with a helmet on happens if your in a hot climate or stuck in slow traffic and can't get any wind going   A good rule of thumb I was always taught for helmet fitting is to have someone else grab the front of the helmet right below the visor and try and turn your face from side to side.   As long as the helmet doesn't move more than about the width of your thumb before your head starts to get pulled around and your good to go anything tighter and you might have some comfort issues along the way.  Any looser and your gunna pop your skull like a twist off bottle cap if you go down hard   Keep in mind there's a myriad of options when it comes to adjusting the inner foam lining of a helmet to make it fit better. Just remembers it's your pretty face we're dealing with so buy the kit don't DIY without knowledgable guidance

motorcycles,3e2r28,DooDooBrownz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:07 2015 UTC,I did bleed the brakes?
motorcycles,3e2r28,DooDooBrownz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:38 2015 UTC,if you still have air that means you didn't bleed it enough. you did both sides? until the lever felt normal? with tubing attached to bleeder to prevent air from getting sucked back up?
motorcycles,3e2r28,RightOnTheEdge,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"Remove the wheel. Use the screwdriver to push the pistons all the way in.   Then, buy an MV8020, attach it to the bleeding nipple on a caliper, use the tool to draw vaccum while topping off the reservoir on each of the bleeding nipples in turn, then the MS bleeding nipple. Then, top of the reservoir if needed, put the wheel on, squeeze the lever untill it feels hard, then zip tie it in the squeezed position to the handlebar and leave it overnight.   If you still have  a spongy feeling, you can bleed the brake nipples with the lever once more, just remember to close the nipple before you release the lever.   If the pistons are having a hard time going back in, you probably need to rebuild your calipers and replace the seals."

motorcycles,3e2r28,SlidePanda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:03 2015 UTC,caliber   Caliper. Caliper.  You probably introduced a lot of air into the system. And are you bleeding things properly?   And I'm going to assume yes. But if you've pushed the pistons back into the caliper bodies it can take a good number of lever pulls to move them back out to their proper rest position
motorcycles,3e2r28,biscuitsarefodunking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:07 2015 UTC,Getting this resolved all my brake bleeding woes. And there were many.
motorcycles,3e2r28,Wolf_Hook,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:12 2015 UTC,"You don goofed, but you already know that so I'll skip it.   Anyways next time don't ""drain the caliper"" remove the lid from your fluid reservoir, put a piece of wood  or the old brake pad over both pistons and then put a C clamp on that to compress them, if the fluid rises too much in your reservoir suck some out with a turkey baster.   Now, you can either get a vacuum bleeder (hand pump or compressor version) and do it that way or you may have to reverse bleed your brakes by using a syringe to push the fluid from the caliper up to the master to force the air up and out, then bleed it as normal from the bleeder at the MC.   Either way, I wouldn't recommend draining fluid or splitting the caliper ever again."
motorcycles,3e2r28,Stridercal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:42 2015 UTC,"By ""bolt on the caliper,"" you do mean the bleeder bolt, yes? You didn't disassemble the caliper in any way, did you?  When you actuated the caliper off the rotor, did you push the pistons past the seals, or did any fluid leaks past the seals?"

I've come close to being rear ended multiple times.  The best strategy is always clutch instead of shifting to neutral, stop facing an empty part of the road (not square behind another car), and watch the rear mirrors. If you see a car coming way to fast, pin it and split. And if you don't see the car, at least you fly forward instead of becoming part of a car sandwich..."

Well my sister wasn't paying attention and came within a foot of hitting a guy and his girlfriend on a motorcycle and she wasn't even phased by it. I flipped out and she just couldn't grasp why I was mad. People just don't realize if you bump into the back of a car with your car their may be some whiplash but generally there isn't a ton of damage. If you hit a bike with a car your going to kill someone. Is there anyway to get over this fear? On my way to work all I see is people texting while driving and not paying attention it."

Don't let fear hold you back, the motorcycle community is a great thing to be a part of.

The clutches in cars work so differently and everything is opposite (clutch with foot and shift with hand), so it would really be better and easier to just take the MSF course and learn there. Take advantage of the beater bikes they let you use and get your technique down on those. Maybe find a cheap dirtbike on craigslist and practice on that if you have an area to do so"

I wanted a bike but just like you I was so afraid of all these videos you see people getting jacked up on their bikes. I almost didn't go through with it when I started to get anxiety about it all.  Plus there are the stories you hear from your family and friends about the guy they knew who was hurt or killed on a bike back in 1997.   We had a local car guy die last year when he was hit by a drunk driver while riding his bike at 11am during a week day on the busiest street in the city. There is a car show in his name every year now. It was a pretty big deal. That was weighing heavy in my mind when I was thinking about getting my licence.   Its like this man. Do the course, get your licence and then see what you think of it then. I bought my supermoto a week before I did the course. I even posted in this subreddit about how I was afraid of crashing. Now that I have my permit and I have been out there riding around, I feel better about it. You just gotta be careful. Assume no one sees you. When I stop at lights behind another car I kind of keep to one side of the lane so I can ditch out of there if I need to because I  am constantly watching my mirrors to see what the car behind me is doing and if they are stopping. Being rear ended is my main concern. That plus left turning cars, but at least I can see them coming and slow down or avoid them.   I LOVE my supermoto now.

I could have improved by being more aware, I only reacted when I heard tyres screech. Didn't check my mirror.  It is vital that you realise that any crash you have on a motorbike can be avoided.

I was ready to go on the shoulder if anyone came up behind me, but there was gravel so I was worried I'd drop the bike. If it happens again I'll definitely filter or ride the shoulder.

Who knows."

motorcycles,3e0x24,du44,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree.  When I took the course I could throw the dirtbike around those at around 20-25 mph.

This is the most promising solution for a motorcycle dash cam I've seen so far.  I plan on getting one in the next month or so.

motorcycles,3e1ezr,tuckfard0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:59 2015 UTC,"If you charge it every night then that could definitely make sense, assuming the battery life could survive your commute.  The software of the 10C makes it a bit non-ideal though.  Apparently you can only run it in two modes.  One is as a normal camera, so you'd have to constantly delete old files.  The ""dash cam"" mode only saves a file if you press a button on the device.  It does NOT do cyclical recording (which to me seems like a huge oversight), so if you were in a crash and forgot or were unable to press the button you would lose footage of it.  Doing both definitely couldn't hurt though, haha.  The reason I like the one I linked is due to the separate ""black box.""  Since I have a naked bike it'd be tricky to hide the camera, so it'd be good to know that if someone stole the camera while parked, the brains of the unit can still be hidden away safe under the tail.  For that particular unit a replacement lens is $60 if needed."
motorcycles,3e1ezr,Shishek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"All good points. I'm definitely going to look into that further. It's certainly cheaper. It would be nice if they'd throw a longer cable on it. I could clip the camera portion to my helmet before riding, and keep the main module connected to the bike. Or just leave it on the bike."

Find a drill bit that's exactly the size of the bolt itself (not the head). Center on the head and drill. The head will pop off when you hit the threads. DON'T GO DEEPER. Really critical that the drill bit is centered. Use an easy out to get the rest if it's stuck in there. Buy replacement bolt at Home Depot.

Riding position makes a big defence.  The forward leaning position of a sport bike makes the bike super easy to handle on curves.  On a sport bike you start to seek out roads with twists and curves because they're so much fun.   Cruisers with their upright riding position are more comfortable for long road trips.

motorcycles,3e1r66,CrayolaS7,3,Tue Jul 21 08:21:53 2015 UTC,Some bikes do shed speed quickly with engine baking but the rear tire is doing all the work.   The front brake / tire are capable of about 80% of your braking force. So it is no comparison.    If you can grab a handful of front brake and not have it nearly throw you end over end or lock up you have a bake problem. Now I'm not saying lock up your front or do an endo I'm just saying that the front bake is the end all be all of braking force on a bike.

You're basically talking about trying to make the engine go much faster than it's going if you do engine braking wrong. The rear wheel is at too high a speed for the ratio of the gear and will be trying to turn the engine over, bigger engines take more effort to turn over so bigger engine braking and bigger danger of a lockup."

With a two-day camp, you've got tons of time on track, so don't worry about making the most of every lap - make the most of every session.  My problem at a school like this usually comes down to two factors: unlearning bad street habits; and shutting up to stop making excuses.  Also, i know it's tempting, but try to leave any action cameras at home, or at least until day two - they are a huge distraction."

I'm usually very relaxed and can tell my emotions to take a back seat, but my biggest worry I think is going to be riding a supersport for the first time, and not just any supersport but a beast at that. I know the S1000RR is supposed to be 'easy to ride', but still..."
motorcycles,3dzagy,Marshall498,4,Mon Jul 20 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"S1000RR is supposed to be 'easy to ride', but still...   Its easy to ride, not easy to ride fast. The bike feels like its falling into  corners at highspeeds.   You are used to riding a 650r which is more than capable around a track and a well tuned one is looking at 600 SS times so its not like you are jumping from Harley to S1000RR.  Just listen to /u/stridercal and listen."
motorcycles,3dzagy,RightOnTheEdge,6,Mon Jul 20 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"You will be going at beginner pace the entire time. Even level 2 is really no faster than mid-low intermediate. And if you catch on quickly, you may even get bored.   CSS isn't the ""hey, here is the 200 HP bike, we expect you to ride full throttle all the time"". Its very structured, kinda like the MSF course. And in fact, its really oriented towards enjoying yourself on the track without crashing, not really how to be the fastest out there.   And as others said, don't pay attention to the myth that supersports are somehow harder to ride. The only functional difference between the S1000RR and your bike is that the S1000RR doesn't hinder a much faster, much more skilled rider. Other then that, both bikes can be ridden slow."

I am also paranoid of regular road conditions on turns and corners so I maybe go much slower than I need to so I doubt I'll get bored on a track for the first time. Thanks for the info.

Even if you are naturally really good and really fast, take the time to learn what they teach you starting with Level 1. Each level is broken down into courses that you apply on the track. If you really try to do what they show you, even if you feel you could go faster, try to focus on the skill/technique/lesson they are showing you. Then, when you advance to where, say you can now use your brakes fully, pick up your pace, but only a little. Get used to your new found freedom and follow instructions. Before you know it, you'll be flying around the track and having a ball. It's designed to make you better and those skills apply to the street. Pace yourself, you have two full days.

A) I would love to try a supersport for the first time and the BMW is an amazing bike for just that. Regardless of speed I know that the ergos, suspension and handling will allow me to corner better, and the electronics will provide more safety than mine. B) I don't have a trailer or any way to get my bike there and back without riding it. If I crash it I can't get home.

Don't get me wrong-- great guy who just fell into something and after 3 great years and then another year of being completely done but trying to figure out how to fix or help I realized what was done was done.  In the process a mutual friend got in touch with me after recognizing what was happening around home-- he was also putting his ex through rehab after their divorce and dealing with similar problems trying to keep things good for her and his son.  Well we got in touch (he lives out of town) and he was buying this motorcycle from the city I live. Told him to come stay when he picked it up because he was going to be driving it back to his house...Well one thing led to another and it's now almost a year later.  And it really was just one of those ""Should we do this... this absolutely feels right let's go!!"" kind of moments.   I hopped on the back of that bike and we did an incredible tour just out of nowhere, stopping in several places and spending 10 awesome days on the road ( and a 24 hour ferry!) Really was the time of my life. Made it to his house... spent the night... got a ride to the airport at 5am the next morning and was back home at work by 10am. We now go back and forth once every month or so. Sitting up sipping early morning coffee as the sun came up... and incredible nights. Now I'm all reminiscent. sigh.  Took the Port Hardy - Prince Rupert ferry and it was coho season so the gray whales were all out at the river mouths and slapping and smacking and breaching and porpoises were everywhere.  Happy to say I feel rather complete right now and that things are calm and collected and very loving. Lots of respect and love on my side-- and hopefully lots of good times ahead.  ***Terrace Beach Resort in Ucluelet was the absolute best!! We just lounged around... made good food, watched tv, sat on the porch and had some beers together and made it a really great time for both of us."

There's enough power and comfort to ride two-up, loaded with gear for both. In that situation I occasionally wish I had a bit more power for passing while at elevation or ascending steep stuff -but it's still faster than most any car you'll run across and it's got great mid-range torque. Only other drawbacks are basic suspension and the stock seat, but both can be improved relatively cheaply if you can't deal. The engine is a bit vibey at 85+ mph, but tolerable for sure and it pulls strong well into triple digits. Such a great handling bike... even though it's 450+lbs you can flick it around fairly easily which makes both cornering and parking lot shuffling easy peasy."

He took the same turn I was taking so I followed behind but I misjudged the turn. By the time I realized that the turn wasn't as wide as I initially thought, It was too late. I launched straight to the ground, face first at around 18-19mph.   As far as accidents go, I'd say this is the least serious one to have no? My helmet put in work since the chin took most of the impact. My right elbow is bruised and my arm and leg ache. All in all I walked away pretty nice from that.   The bike has some cosmetic damage, along with the brake lever being bent inwards a tad but still functional. Hindsight 20/20, I probably could have leaned into the turn and pulled the throttle to make it out of the turn, but you know how it is sometimes :). It looks like target fixation, and maybe it was, but I genuinely recall only seeing the curb by the time it was too late for me to react accordingly.

It also makes me look less hooligan-y; cops and park rangers (camping) just wave now, even when I'm clearly camping somewhere that I shouldn't be.   I used to hate Harley, not just for just producing inferior bikes with higher prices, but because the company is something of the exact antithesis of what originally made the bike a successful piece of Americana; it was a symbol of anarchy and independence - not white collar jobs who wanted to ride to a bar on the weekend.   Then I thought ""oh, this little contradiction is the perfect symbol of what America actually is, so that makes it kind of cool in an ironic sort of way.""

The problem is 250s are not fast enough for the highway and you wont be able to dance with cars or get out of the way.  A CBR500 would probably be ideal.

motorcycles,3e1a2p,oglih,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:42:46 2015 UTC,"Upgrade the front and rear suspension.  The rear is simple, a good set of shocks with some adjustability.  The front...   Cut the fork springs and add a spacer to make up for the amount removed. This will make the front stiffer but the damping is still shitty. You'll need to add a suitable hydraulic PVD (not sure of yr name, but same thing as race tech gold valves) valve. There should be a guide out there for the XR100 suspension (strangely similar to the 1980+ CB125S).  Oh but the front drum brake kind of blows. Turns out, the front end from a Honda MB5 is a direct swap. As in, slide the CB125S forks out and slide the MB5 stuff in. Or you can get a new set of steering stem bearings from allballs racing and swap on a complete Honda Rebel 250 front end.  And you could upgrade to an electronic ignition and fuel inject it.  And you could just get a new bike at that point... Seriously. Any really worthwhile upgrades to the end CB125S cost a lot of money and won't add to the resale value. They're not worth a lot in perfect, restored condition. Enjoy it and ride the piss out of it."

Here, it's if there's any property damage, you have to attempt to locate the owner, or leave your contact information. I've seen it in other states, though, where it's just failing to remain at the scene of an accident. Which is vague at best. I've also seen states that require they be reported if there is over $x amount of damage (usually around $1k), if the vehicle is incapable of being normally operated (i.e. needs towed away), or if there is an injury."

motorcycles,3e0ylx,RedBearded_Gentleman,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:02 2015 UTC,"The KTM 390/690 Dukes are pretty light and have an upright seating position. Those cafe racer style bikes aren't built for performance, so they're normally heavy and underperforming."
motorcycles,3e0ylx,alfix8,6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that the modern Cafe racer thing is almost the opposite of what it originally stood for and if the cafe racers from the 60s and such were around today they would think they were posers. The modern version of a cafe racer is clearly a ""streetfighter""/supernaked like an S1000R or Z1000 made to go super fast on the street."
motorcycles,3e0ylx,CrayolaS7,4,Tue Jul 21 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Original cafe racers were built to be fast. Modern ""cafe racers"" are built to look ""old fast""."
motorcycles,3e0ylx,alfix8,3,Tue Jul 21 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"I think you're on the right track, but the modern ""cafe racers"" are SS/RR bikes.  The ""classic"" cafe-racers were street bikes imitating race bikes, and you really can't get closer to a race replica than you can now with an SS/RR bike.  I get that the modern ""standards"" are more in line with the cafe esthetic, but I don't think you would have been able to talk a ""Cafe racer"" out of buying a race bike replica for nostalgic reasons.  RR/SS bikes would have dominated the cafe scene if available at the time."
motorcycles,3e0ylx,elmacanudo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:59:11 2015 UTC,"Funny because I've actually said that before on here but upon further thinking, I think they would opt for the Supernakeds as the RR bikes can be a bit too hardcore for bumpy British A/B roads. I'm not talking about standards like an SV650 or Er-6N, I mean the ones like the S1000R or GSX750R that have the same engines as their race-rep brothers just with gearing and suspension tweaked for road use.   I get what you're saying because the original cafe racers were imitation race bikes of the time, but the race bikes of the time were also much less hardcore compared to what we have available nowadays.   One thing that's for sure is that they wouldn't be going and modifying old CB400s to look like BSAs and Triumphs."
motorcycles,3e0ylx,CrayolaS7,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:22 2015 UTC,"Given the numbers of sports bikes that have been sold in Britain over the years I'd say you're wrong and the Cafe Racers would have bought sports bikes. After all they had cafe racers as race replicas weren't available, once they were they sold in huge numbers.   I believe Britain has been the biggest market for sports bikes in Europe for years although sales are now falling. That's more to do with the increasing average age of bikers though."
motorcycles,3e0ylx,Yetibike,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:45 2015 UTC,"No shit they would buy sportsbikes. Are you saying S1000Rs and GSX750Rs, Z1000s and Tuono T4Rs aren't sportsbikes? Obviously they would ride sports bikes, I just think the naked sportsbikes that are made for going fast as hell on the street would be better suited to ""Cafe Racing"" than something like the R1M or Panigale 1299 which is super track focussed. Some of them probably would go for the straight up race replicas, people have different tastes after all; it's just my suspicion that in functional terms the supernakeds would be quicker on the types of roads they would ride on."

motorcycles,3dz81x,BikeBandit,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:19 2015 UTC,This is pretty close to what I do as well. The only difference is that I have a strong arch in the ramps so I don't gain much from a lower angle and run the risk of hanging up on the bottom once the front wheel hits the truck bed.  Only other thing is to avoid walking the bike up the ramps from the dirt. I have broke traction and had the rear walk to the side on mine while clutching it up. Completely out of line and had to start over. Poop.   Edit: I don't use a chock. I pull it down on the kick stand on the straps and haven't ever suffered a problem from it and have traveled from Seattle to middle of Montana that way. It will trash the bed of your truck if you care.
motorcycles,3dz81x,rotyag,3,Tue Jul 21 03:55:06 2015 UTC,"I don't use a wheel chock, I just put it in diagonally and the front wheel can't go anywhere.  Don't use the grips for tie downs unless you have the canyon dancer 2 bar harness, which puts the weight on the bar ends instead.  I usually loop the tie downs around the bottom triple clamp, so that they come out the bottom of the fairings and don't mess up the paint.  No, compressing the forks will not ruin the seals.  That is not how forks work, there is no pressure against the seals when they're compressed (besides a bit of air pressure, which should bleed away after time).  Now if you go leaving them compressed for months on end, you could give your springs a new memory..."

motorcycles,3dz81x,spongebob_meth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use stands while driving. Use a wheel chock of some kind, really, any will do. Just something that secure the bike upright.   Yes, putting too much pressure on the forks could blow a fork seal. You want the bike to be snug, not have the forks slammed. Also running a tie down off the subframe helps keep it tight.   Use these for the front end. It's the best thing ever. Not this specific brand but anything similar to it. There are a few different brands out there but they function in similarly. linkz"

motorcycles,3dz81x,Marshall498,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"You first need a ramp setup. I suggest buying either 2 long 7 foot ramps, or a wider 7 foot ramp. The latter is going to cost more, but it will allow you to ride your bike up instead of clutching it up on one ramp and walking up the other.   Then, you basically, get the bike in, put the bike on the kickstand, and start tying it down. Usually, the best is the ""X"" pattern to each corner of the truck. At first, you want to basically do the front tight enough just so the bike stands upright off the kickstand. Then you do the rear and crank down until you can barely move the bike side to side. You don't need to tighten the front any more after this and you are good to go.   You can also use slopes to get the angle of the ramp more flat, and walk the bike in neutral without starting it."

As i was on my way, i was behind a slow driver so decided to switch lanes and got in front of someone, while switching lanes i did speed  up a bit. As i was switching someone pulled out of a gas station on my right and threw themselves in front of me and ended up taking up my portion of the lane while he was trying to jump into the middle lane but didn't move. I tried to find a way around and couldnt as to the fact that the car i just tried overthrowing was right next to me. Next thing i know, BAM! Im head first flying and flipping in the air. I don't remember anything from there on, and random glimpses of the ambulances and then waking up in the hospital. I was awake through out it all, but i wasn't conscious? i guess you can say. I was talking to the ambulance people but i don't remember doing any of it.  Legally, im scared. In Miami its not a law to have insurance on the bike so the bike is trashed but what pisses me off is that this accident wasn't my fault because HE cut me off and i had the right of way.

motorcycles,3dzbx6,elkster88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:24 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good idea. I'll look into the bicycle unit. I have a bunch of co2 cannisters with no threads so I'd like to be able to use those.
motorcycles,3dzbx6,Asshole_Salad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"I have and the tire held air just fine.  I only rode ~15 miles to the bike shop for a replacement though, luckily my tire was already nearly due for replacement.  The CO2 canisters should be universal, off-the-shelf models and sizes but you'll want to confirm once you get the kit in hand.  They almost certainly buy their canisters from the same manufacturer as everybody else rather than building their own."

I stuck one of these and 3 of the other type in the hole, and pumped it up real slow with a bicycle pump. Took two tries before it held with high pressure, but then I rode 300 miles home on it. It was really hot so the rubber was nice and sticky. I didn't stop except to get gas and slam a gatorade. I was worried that the plug would come out if the tire cooled off."

If you want to find spare bits to upgrade, it will cost less and there will be more options available.  If you want to insure it, it'll be cheaper.  If you ride for a while and don't like it, it won't be too hard to resell."

I'd also look into buying a couple new sets in case your torsion bars go or get sloppy and cause valve float.

It must suck to suddenly have a car going 20 mph less than the speed limit right after a corner because he's following the suggested speed.

motorcycles,3dycvj,Gunthusiast,11,Mon Jul 20 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"Modular helmets are generally not unsafe these days - testing standards are such that any certified helmet is going to be roughly as safe as any other in a crash, and a closed modular should be roughly as good as a full-face.  The problems with modulars are that:   They're heavier. Just can't be avoided - the chin bar needs reinforcement, the mechanism itself has weight, etc. There are light modulars, but using the same tech/materials in a full-face will always produce an even lighter lid. How much you care about the extra two hundred grams is a matter of personal preference and experience, but manufacturers do seem to find enough buyers to sell carbon versions at a 50% markup to identical composite versions. On many helmets you can't actually ride with the chin bar flipped up, at least not at anything above parking lot speed. There are some exceptions (Shark Evoline is the cleverest one, but I recently tried a Caberg Modus where the raised chin bar slides into a locking position), but a modular is still a compromise between the comfort and freedom of a jet and the safety of a full-face. Modulars don't work in a sporty riding position, or at least I still haven't found one that does. They're designed for upright touring/adventure bikes, which is fair enough - that is the audience which will pay a premium for the convenience. But when you get down into a tuck, the upper edge of the viewport will almost always be too low. If someone knows of modulars that don't have this problem, I would love to know!"
motorcycles,3dycvj,AnTyx,5,Mon Jul 20 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"I had a modular Caberg helmet that took quite a beating. I hit a dog at about 80kph and tumbled off the road through some fairly rocky ground. The hinges were bent out of alignment slightly, though it all held up reasonably well, no problems with the quick release chin strap. Overall it was covered in dents, deep scratches and abrasions with a two inch crack across the top. External visor broke off on one side, the internal visor was down though it flipped itself up and left a red line across my nose. It definitely saved my life, no question."
motorcycles,3dycvj,dchky,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen some discussion about modular helmets being less structurally resilient. But not a lot of evidence.   Anything is going to be less resilient when you are adding in hinges/latches.  When you look at the full helmet vs the modular the modular has more points for failure and is less structurally sound.  The real question should be, does it really matter?  As far as the actual crash difference between a modular and full face there might not be a major difference.  The the fact is still there that its not as safe as a fullface, even if its .00004% less, its still less.    And lets not forget to mention, 34.6% of helmet impact is on the chin."
motorcycles,3dycvj,kabish,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:11 2015 UTC,"Impacts may be on the chin, but unless the impact is coming straight up like an uppercut to the jaw, focused ON the bottom of the chin bar, the chin bar would stay locked, and if it's going to rip the chin bar up, your neck breaking is the main concern at that amount of force"
motorcycles,3dycvj,Throwaway58990,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"My response from another Modular thread:  Various helmet certification including DOT & ECE have no requirements for the ""chin-bar test"", meaning the the chin bar can literally fly away as soon as it touches the ground and it will still meet DOT standard (Personally I wouldn't even call DOT a ""standard"" for anything).  ECE allow their certification for helmets with or without the chin-bar testing, but there is a special designation for helmets that are certified with the chin-bar test. Snell certification subject Modulars with the exact same test as full face helmet (integral chin-bar) testing, WITH an addition test for the release mechanism. I think to date there are only 2 modular that are Snell certified; LS2's FF394 size L, XL, XXL & Zeus 3000 in only size small.  In reality, IMO, I think what you got would be sufficient for street use but more importantly you don't want to give your dad a feeling that what he got for you is not good. Helmets need to be changed every 5 years anyway, so use it for a few years then get a really good one next time.  Ride well.  source: http://www.smf.org/cert https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_helmet#Modular_or_.22flip-up.22 (refer to source references in the article, too much to list)"
motorcycles,3dycvj,Rock3tPunch,6,Mon Jul 20 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"Modulars were less safe 20-30 years ago. Technology has come a long way since then. A modern good modular is just as safe as a modern full face helmet.  If you are worried about the chin bar opening: Think about where the force would have to come from. Something would have to hit you on the chin like an uppercut, and with considerable force. If that happens, your neck breaking is a much bigger concern than the chin bar opening."
motorcycles,3dycvj,alfix8,4,Mon Jul 20 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"This is kinda what I thought too, or if you were flying down the road feet first face down maybe it would pull up.  I got this modular helmet and I've been very pleased with it. It's my first helmet so not a lot to compare it to, but it has metal on metal locking pins for the modular part, it looks quite sturdy to be honest and I don't worry about it coming undone in an accident.  That being said, my next helmet will probably just be a full helmet. I only lift the front up when equipping/removing the helmet, or for pumping gas and stuff. It is kinda nice but it makes the helmet bulkier."
motorcycles,3dycvj,BoomMichaelScoon,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:23 2015 UTC,This has been my experience with Modulars as well.  They are great for running around town getting gas or a quick run into the grocery store etc.  But on long trips the full face is my goto.  By the time I stop for gas on a long trip getting my head out of the bucket is nice.
motorcycles,3dycvj,midpipps,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"I have the same helmet, it's great. I wear glasses; with a modular helmet I can take it off and put it on without removing my glasses.  Not the case with full face lids."

motorcycles,3dycvj,BoomMichaelScoon,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"SHARP does a good job testing modular helmets, and will even give you the percentage of chin bar failures they observe.  Example:  I have a Scorpion EXO-900.  They had 17% chin bar failures.  Shoei Neotec had 7% chin bar failures."
motorcycles,3dycvj,jagged2600,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"My only fail was the release broke. Fortunately when it was not on my head, so I released the latches with needle-nosed pliers and rode home with it open. This failure mode (and being trapped inside) is a very serious design issue."
motorcycles,3dycvj,PermANewbie,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"There is some empirical evidence available for review.  The UK SHARP testing data does list the percentage of test impacts where the modular mechanism failed.   By comparing modular helmets, you can see differences in the manufacturers locking approach.    Some example and entirely randomly chosen sources:    Shark Evoline- 30% of test impacts the faceguard didnt remain locked Shoei Multitech - 17% of test impacts the faceguard didnt remain locked Nolan 104 - 0% of test impacts the faceguard didnt remain locked    I occasionally choose to use a modular for multi-week really long trips (convenience), but generally choose to ride full-face the rest of the time.   The SHARP data - ignoring all the debates about testing methods, etc - while probably not entirely conclusive was helpful in making my final choices between manufacturers."
motorcycles,3dycvj,ObtuseMoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:16 2015 UTC,"It doesn't show that at all, it shows the number of times it didn't remain fully locked.   It could have remained closed but the lock on one side failed.   Having crashed in a flip front (it stayed locked by the way and all the damage was to the chin bar and visor) I'm happy to take the potential slightly increased risk in exchange for the convenience."
motorcycles,3dycvj,Yetibike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:11:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Did I say anywhere in that comment that the results implied they opened?  I said it didn't ""...remain locked"" which is the same as not ""fully locked"".  Your point is entirely a semantic construct and no different than my intent."
motorcycles,3dycvj,ObtuseMoose,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:55 2015 UTC,"Serious question: why do people ride with anything other than a full face helmet?  Not trying to troll, I genuinely want to know the reasons.  I have a hard time understanding the logic."
motorcycles,3dycvj,BeowulfShatner,6,Mon Jul 20 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"Different people, different priorities, different risk management. Someone could easly argue that riding itself, being one of the riskiest transportation method around, it's irrational."
motorcycles,3dycvj,tartare4562,3,Mon Jul 20 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"Because a modular is more comfortable to get on and off as a wearer of glasses.  Plus modulars can be quieter because manufacturers can make the opening smaller since your head doesn't have to go through it.  Since there are only insignificant differences in safety, I see no reason to get a full face."
motorcycles,3dycvj,alfix8,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"well, you have more of a field of vision with an open face helmet (for instance, trying to glance at a map on your tank bag is much more difficult with a full face helmet). Halfs and open face helmets are a bit lighter than full face versions, as well. And the look is different.   I wear a full face helmet, but those are a few reasons people would want a different type."

motorcycles,3dycvj,BoldMrRogers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"This doesn't answer your question, but since we're talking about modular vs. full face, I'll add my 2 cents.  I bought my first (and last) modular helmet last year - a very expensive one (schuberth C3 pro) that is supposed to be the best.  It's... ok.  I don't find it to be particularly quiet (which its supposed to be).  The ventilation isn't great.  More importantly, the ability to flip up the chin bar isn't worth the extra cost/weight IMO.  Helps if you need to dig into your chest pocket for $ at a toll booth - easier to gas up without taking your bucket off, but all in all not worth it.  Honestly my $200 scorpion was just as comfortable.  I do love the retractable sun shield of the schuberth, though.    My next helmet will be traditional full face."
motorcycles,3dycvj,thunnus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"I can't say a lot about modular helmets, other than to echo what others have already said. However I can tell you something about quality full face helmets.   My previous helmet was an HJC-CL16. Literally about the cheapest helmet that you can buy. I honestly hated wearing this helmet (add to that it was not fitted properly). The air flow was terrible and the helmet was both loud and heavy.  I currently wear an Arai Signet Q.....and it has totally changed my perception of helmets. Not only does it flow TONS more air but also actually fits my head well. It is noticeably lighter and really does not mess with my vision at all. I would not say I ever ""forget"" that I am wearing a helmet but I often stop noticing that it is there.   From my understanding....the benefits to a modular helmet is that if you take long commutes and have to stop often for things like fuel, food, grab a drink, etc. they allow you to do some without needing to remove your helmet. The trade off is extra weight and more limited shapes (often modular helmets are mostly round shaped rather than more narrow)."

motorcycles,3dycvj,ronoverdrive,0,Tue Jul 21 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents on modulars... Assume they are 100% as safe as full face helmets (which, they aren't. But that's besides the point). When your riding you will want to have it closed otherwise if you go down its not going to offer any more protection.   If you are stopped and have the time to open the modular part, you can normally take off the helmet. The modular part isn't worth messing with at a light in my opinion. Your just going to open the visor, which you can do anyway.   Having the hinge and latching mechanism will make your helmet at least 2x as heavy...   Just take the extra money you will save by getting a non modular and get a good full face that's super light and comfortable."
motorcycles,3dycvj,motsu35,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"I have a full face and a modular.  I prefer the modular as I can push the release, slide it up, and talk to someone.  This is better than taking off my gloves, releasing the latch, pulling it off, then putting my gloves and full face down.  As far as the weight thing goes, I can not tell the difference."

Most are around 1400-1600g.   The flip front is very convenient for people who wear glasses as there's no need to remove them put the helmet on or take it off. It's also handy at petrol stations or stopping for a smoke."
motorcycles,3e0ath,Leventhan_,3,Mon Jul 20 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"Your bike's petcock has a vacuum line and a fuel line that needs to be connected. Make sure they're both connected where they're supposed to be and not switched around. The vacuum line is a smaller diameter (usually) than the fuel line so it would be difficult to get it wrong. Also make sure the vacuum line is still connected to the port on the carb inlet rubber.  If you've not started the bike for six weeks it could simply be the float bowls have dried up and you need to prime them. Set the petcock to the PRI position and let the bowls fill for about a minute, then turn the selector to ON."

Either something got pinched or broken putting the tank back on, or possibly you messed something up installing the choke cable.  Also see if you have spark. This will tell you if you are looking for an electrical problem or a fuel system / carb problem.   On my ""82 FT500 the battery stopped charging after I had the seat and tank off.

motorcycles,3e1loi,avsbdn,7,Tue Jul 21 06:47:18 2015 UTC,That's a bit of a weird metric to use when deciding how to brake... You use your brakes in whichever way is best for stopping. Don't worry about which is easier to replace.
motorcycles,3e1loi,DemonEggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah. In the grand spectrum, brakes are very cheap. One's looking at many oil changes, generally at a higher cost per iteration, that a new set of pads.  And it's generally multiple sets of pads before a rotor ever needs to be replaced due to wear.  I'm with you Eggy... I don't get this one."
motorcycles,3e1loi,SlidePanda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:43 2015 UTC,"Not really, it depends on how you ride. I tend to favour engine breaking and my rear brake more bc it's only one set of pads to replace. This is fine if you're just cruising around and it doesn't mean i don't use my front either.  Ofc for more serious riding you need to brake properly. Then again, I'm over 40 n been riding a long time so maybe I'm just an old fart."

motorcycles,3e1loi,DemonEggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:08 2015 UTC,"What do you define as ""inefficiently""? I anticipate when I need to brake, therefore the amount of breaking required is generally minimised."

There's some argument that twin front discs are more faff to replace than the single rear (since there's two of them) but they also probably wear at half the rate they would for a single caliper..."
motorcycles,3e1loi,RightOnTheEdge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:43 2015 UTC,"You really should use your front more without touching the rear, solely to get used to how hard you can squeeze without locking the lever. That muscle memory is very important in a panic stop."

motorcycles,3e1loi,CrayolaS7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"If you want to save your brakes, rely on the engine braking for the majority of your stops when you're just riding normally, e.g. when coming up to a red light engine brake (but grab the lever very gently so your brake light comes on) through 3rd, 2nd, into 1st and then apply the brakes at the end."
motorcycles,3e1loi,CrayolaS7,0,Tue Jul 21 09:25:53 2015 UTC,I tried that a couple of times but it seems kinda of hard to match the engine speed on those down shifts so quickly and whatever gas you'd use to rev it up would eat up any saving from changing brakes. Thanks though.
motorcycles,3e1loi,CrayolaS7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:44 2015 UTC,"The downshifts won't be coming quickly if you're engine braking only, you have to be riding defensively and have plenty of time to stop, not using the brakes at all. If it's still to difficult then you need to practise downshifting because blipping the throttle makes it much smoother and puts less strain on your drive-train and gearbox. Any extra fuel you use rev matching you'll save on maintenance costs in the long run."
motorcycles,3e1loi,Flypflap91,0,Tue Jul 21 12:59:34 2015 UTC,Hmmm good point. It just seems awkward when people behind me are gradually decreasing their speed instead of going to speed limit until right before they stop.
motorcycles,3e1loi,Marshall498,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, now I'm more confused. If you just engine brake you will be slowing down very gradually, not stopping quickly at all. Are you worried you will be going to gradually compared to the others? If so you can add some brake too, just use mostly the engine.  Edit: If the weather is nice tomorrow I'll shoot a short video showing you what I mean."
motorcycles,3e1loi,tintern74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:19 2015 UTC,"pretty much depends on your bike tbh, i wouldnt worry about wear at all when braking... pads are fairly cheap and its easy to change them.  i brake only front most of the time and shift down to let the engine brake my rear."

motorcycles,3e1loi,Megaross,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:22 2015 UTC,WTF? On my 600 GSXF my rear pads were shot at ~8000 miles.  I'm seriously thinking maybe I have a slightly sticking rear caliper. We'll see how long these new ones last.
motorcycles,3e1loi,KingLuis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"I NEVER use my rear brake, unless im already stopped.   I do however service my calipers both front and rear every year."
motorcycles,3e1loi,DooDooBrownz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:13 2015 UTC,Use both with a heavy bias on the front brake. Keeps the suspension nice and steady and utilises the grip on both wheels. It's the best practise for braking.  Both are about the same to change pads. Disks are arguably a little more effort on the rear but you shouldn't really be changing disks often.

It's not all that different than driving a car or riding a dirt bike.  Just be cautious and ride like nobody sees you.  See if you can get your learner's permit, then you won't have to worry about riding illegally.  Here in Utah, it's really easy, you just take the written test and they let you ride with certain restrictions to give you time to practice, and then you schedule a time and go take the riding test.  Easy peasy."

If the gas is fresh, I'd check the spark plugs and air filter, then I'd clean the carbs.  You can also see if it will start after you spray starting fluid in the air intake.  If it starts with starting fluid but won't stay on or start again normally, pull the carbs off and clean them.   Really, just clean the carbs.

motorcycles,3e0rx1,inspectormac,3,Tue Jul 21 02:36:48 2015 UTC,"Just like tiny little jockeys control massive racehorses, tiny little women can ride just about any motorcycle they put their mind to. Your best bet may be to find an empty parking lot and practice. Practice everything you learned in the MSF course until it's second nature. Practice starting, emergency stops, obstacle avoidance, and anything else you can. You'll feel better, and you'll be in a place where other cars aren't going to bother you too much, if at all. That really builds both skill and confidence. I've ridden with some tiny little girls on big bikes, but they had developed the skills to ride them. You can do the same, it just takes lots of practice."

Maybe it's fear from lowsiding again but i become especially uptight making right hand turns at intersections.

I'm sure they went after the driver for the deductible cost, but I didn't have to pay anything.  Hopefully it's as easy as that for you.

Fewer riders per row (e.g. staggering 3/2) or an empty row every 4th or 5th row would give riders more space to maneuver around disabled/downed bikes."

motorcycles,3dxs32,jchristianh,3,Mon Jul 20 14:07:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty fucked up, but I found this pretty confusing:  ""The driver of the tractor trailer has been charged with felony hit and run and misdemeanor death.""  I understand hit and run has been a felony forever, but how is that more serious (criminally) than a death (now two)?"
motorcycles,3dxs32,jchristianh,5,Mon Jul 20 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"I'm far from a lawyer, but I'm assuming that without being able to prove that he intentionally hit them, it's still considered an ""accident"", so he'll get something low like vehicular manslaughter, which I think is a misdemeanor.   Leaving the scene though is a felony and more serious because he had to have intentionally done that.  Nobody flees the scene of an accident by mistake.    I think it may be possible that the charges change though now that the second rider has died.  I doubt he'll ever drive a truck again."
motorcycles,3dxs32,infecto,3,Mon Jul 20 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, I get all that... I just don't get it if that makes sense. I'm not sure what state his CDL was issued, but a couple states (including NC) look like they suspend for 1 to 3 years on a first major offense, and a lifetime suspension on a 2nd: http://www.dmv.org/nc-north-carolina/suspended-cdl.php - Both of his charges qualify as a major offense, so he may get the lifetime ban right up front unless they consider them as a single offense.  I did look up ""vehicular manslaughter"" for reference though, and found this interesting tidbit:  ""Vehicular manslaughter can be charged as a misdemeanor (minor crime with a maximum punishment of a year in county jail or only a fine) or a felony (punishable by a term in state prison) depending on the circumstances. Gross negligence or driving a few miles over the speed limit might be charged as a misdemeanor, but drunk driving resulting in a fatality is most likely treated as a felony."" - via http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2212  Although it's unclear if this is under specific jurisdictions, or if it's nationwide. I do agree that the charges will most likely change now due to the second person's death. If there is an option in NC for vehicular manslaughter to be a felony, it'll probably be upgraded to that at this point...and now with 2 counts."
motorcycles,3dxs32,joseycuervo,3,Mon Jul 20 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, you looked up some great information.

Me and a few other people had jackets on at the start, but quickly took them off. It's way too hot and you are moving way too slowly to get any airflow. Just bring a long-sleeved shirt.

motorcycles,3dzbsp,alfix8,2,Mon Jul 20 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"It will be noticeable, but not much. A 300 will never become a good accelerating bike, unless you put on a huge rear sprocket and that is just nonsense.  For acceleration you need torque, and a 300 has only a very limited amount of that."

The R3 tops at 116mph so you aren't losing too much in that department.  Check GearingCommander and load up the Yamaha YZF R3 and scroll down to the ""Top Speed / Gear"" combination chart. The dead center is the stock set up. Most people would do a -1/+1 set up to start (subtract one tooth in front, add one in back) to increase torque. You'll lose about 10mph off the Top Speed."

They were so much faster that the crashes were so horrific that they felt they had to ban them from racing. Recumbent bicycles are also banned from traditional bicycle racing, because recumbent bicycles are so much faster that an average athlete could beat a Tour de France super athlete.

The closer to the ground and the more streamlined you are, the faster you are; these are simple rules of physics. A motorcycle is simply a bicycle with a motor, and the same rules of physics apply. A fully faired recumbent bicycle is up to 20% faster than a traditional upright racing bicycle, even though it is considerably heavier, simply because it offers so much less wind resistance.  compare: http://thekneeslider.com/images/2014/06/bob-horn-outside-line.jpg"
motorcycles,3du223,michaelmclees,21,Sun Jul 19 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"With a recumbent, you can put pressure on the pedals that exceeds your body weight."
motorcycles,3du223,not4smurf,10,Sun Jul 19 19:17:12 2015 UTC,Have you never seen people sprinting on a bicycle? They stand up and pull on the handlebars so they can exert much more force than their body weight on the pedals.
motorcycles,3du223,cosmopaladin,5,Sun Jul 19 20:16:30 2015 UTC,But you can do the same thing on a recumbent bike by pulling on the bars the pedals are raised up to the geometry is pretty much the same if not better. You also don't gain any net energy from your body weight because it cost you energy to standup which you get back when you push down with your added weight. You do have extra energy if you are just looking at that one down stroke. Bikes drag really badly though so the recumbent reduction on drag makes it faster regardless if you could get minor temporary boosts in energy.
motorcycles,3du223,not4smurf,4,Sun Jul 19 23:42:23 2015 UTC,But you can do the same thing on a recumbent bike   I never said you couldn't.  michaelmclees' statement implied (to me at least) that the force you can apply to the pedals on an upright bicycle is limited by your body weight. That is not correct.
motorcycles,3du223,ZachPlaysDrums,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it could be limited by your body weight, but your body weight is not the limit. If you're pulling against the pedal by the handlebars you're adding force beyond your body weight but body weight is still the main component of force.   Now, idk which produces more force, standing up on a traditional bicycle or bracing your back against the bike in a recumbent... the reduced drag being the real advantage."
motorcycles,3du223,Silverjackel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"Look at it like a free body diagram.  The forces moving the traditional bike are all moving up and down the opposite the direction you're trying to go,    it makes sense that aligning all the forces in the same direction reduces lost energy and the momentum of your body rocking back and forth while pedaling adds more to your forward momentum than your body wasting all that up and down movement fighting gravity."
motorcycles,3du223,cosmopaladin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah that is true it is limited by your arms, core or legs depending on which is the weakest.

motorcycles,3du223,Cj145,6,Mon Jul 20 01:44:32 2015 UTC,You can do this with clipless pedals on any bicycle.
motorcycles,3du223,bfuller181,11,Sun Jul 19 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"Clips aren't about increasing the amount of force/pressure applied to the pedals, but about increasing the amount of time that the force/pressure is being applied. Instead of only pushing on the down stroke, you can push/pull on both down & up strokes.   Theoretically, you could clip into a recumbent the same way. The point of increased pressure is because when you push out, your back is braced against the seat so you can push harder."
motorcycles,3du223,cosworth99,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"And blow out your knees.   With clips you have a circular stroke, that's the efficient, long term power delivery you want.

motorcycles,3du223,EvilStig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:17 2015 UTC,"Simply: No.  For a bicycle it is true, since the top speed is so severely limited by wind drag vs a small amount of power. In bicycle races, straight line speed matters more than cornering ability, since they never move at speeds so fast that cornering ability really comes into play.  On a motorcycle, however, you have plenty of power, and circuits are tight enough to test the cornering ability of the machine and rider. While a recumbent motorcycle would have a much higher top speed, the geometry of a recumbent motorcycle severely limits the ability to flick it into corners, as well as the maximum lean angle. So while it might win in a drag race, it is at a severe disadvantage on a circuit."
motorcycles,3du223,friends_not_food,17,Tue Jul 21 03:06:35 2015 UTC,There is no way they'd out corner a gp bike.  Large fairings are banned because lateral wind can take out the whole field in one big gust.
motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,10,Sun Jul 19 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"There is no way they'd out corner a gp bike   I've seen this said before, but I have never been able to find actual proof of this claim. I haven't looked that hard, but it seems to me that if one could have a recumbent that is lower to the ground, and with a short(er) wheelbase cornering would present no problems.  The large fairings seem to present no problem to recumbent bicycle racers,"
motorcycles,3du223,tylorjams,7,Sun Jul 19 18:12:03 2015 UTC,I think the issue is wheelbase. As far as I can recon there's no way of maintaining the ultra low profile without drastically increasing wheel base.

motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that this is entirely incorrect. Looking at the photo, why can't the driver raise his feet slightly, and push the front tire between and underneath his legs? I ask this because I ride a short wheel base recumbent bicycle, it's set up this way, and it's exceedingly nimble."
motorcycles,3du223,tylorjams,2,Mon Jul 20 02:40:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're understanding is based on bicycles.    Looking at the photo, why can't the driver raise his feet slightly, and push the front tire between and underneath his legs?   Where does the engine go?"
motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,4,Sun Jul 19 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Here is a photo showing how that might pan out. In this photo, the location of the engine on the bike is unchanged; only the seating position, steering and footrest are changed. http://www.velomobiel.nl/allert/Recumbent%20motorbike_bestanden/image039.jpg so the engine could go more directly underneath the rider; yes this would raise his height slightly. With an electric engine this setup could probably be more easily improved with the engine going under the rider and the batteries behind him.  http://www.velomobiel.nl/allert/Recumbent%20motorbike_bestanden/image039.jpg  By adding fairings to this setup, and with no other significant modifications, this builder was able to improve fuel consumption significantly, more than doubling the mileage from Fuel consumption stock Innova: 113mpg to  Fuel consumption streamlined Innova: 237mpg. He did find he could not ride in very high winds due to the fairing. There's more information on the build here if you're interested: http://www.velomobiel.nl/allert/Recumbent%20motorbike.htm"
motorcycles,3du223,tylorjams,4,Sun Jul 19 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"There's no argument from me that it's a much more efficient design but as far as cornering, it's just not going to happen with an internal combustion engine. That photo shows a drastically smaller engine on a drastically smaller bike, we're talking about large displacement race bikes with 1000cc engines, you're showing me a modified scooter.   Electric though, that could solve the issue of space and make for a very fast recumbent motorcycle with a short wheel base."
motorcycles,3du223,friends_not_food,9,Sun Jul 19 19:32:43 2015 UTC,Positioning would be the problem.  You can't drag your shoulder while sitting in a recliner.  Bicycle riders aren't going 220 mph.  Edit:  and good luck getting a shorter wheel base with this style.
motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,8,Sun Jul 19 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"The cyclist lacks the power to reach a cruising speed where almost all resistance he meets is induced by aerodynamic drag. The average street motorbike though has a very bad aerodynamic shape, at 55mph 90% of all resistance is due to aerodynamic drag and only 10% to rolling resistance. Reducing air resistance on a motorbike is very effective. Whereas a fully faired recumbent bicycle can expect to have a top speed of up to 20% higher than non-faired upright racing bicycles, and since we follow the rules of physics in this house,  one would expect that a fully faired recumbent motorcycle would see a greater increase in speed when compared against an average street bike; the higher speed of a motorbike is an argument in favor of a streamlined recumbent form factor, not against it. I would expect the gains on the flats to be so impressive that they more than compensate for the drawbacks.   Also, you can get very short wheelbase recumbent bicycles because when reclining with the feet up, the feet can extend past the front tire."

motorcycles,3du223,boobbbers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"It's based on how high the center of gravity is so one can lean. If the center of gravity is lower, one must lean the bike more. A bike with higher center of gravity can accomplish the same steering trajectory with less lean angle. This is according to Lee Parks from the Total Control book."
motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"That's interesting; when cornering, it seems to me that racers make an effort to lower the center of gravity on a bike by putting a knee down. This permits them to lean the bike less.. So recumbents must lean more, I wonder how detrimental that is to performance. It seems to me that it requires less effort/less of a weight shift to actually lean the bike since center of gravity is lower,"

Aero tends to be better due to smaller frontal cross section, but any other quality of a ""fast bike"" suffers tremendously."

motorcycles,3du223,ErectileRage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:01 2015 UTC,Changed what rules where?
motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"I can't find the exact link I was reading earlier and maybe I am mixing up different resources: my understanding is that real streamlining was banned by FIM in 1956 or 1957; as a result, no modern motorcycles use real streamlining.   I saw something similar to this quote: ""Charlie is the Technical Coordinator of the FIM - Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme, Switzerland. What an honor to speak with him. Charlie listened to me respecfully and explained that this year, the rules for streamlining were already being relaxed"" located here:  http://www.craigvetter.com/pages/470MPG/Last%20Vetter%20Fairing%20P17.html  and I interpreted it to mean that fairing rules were beginning to be relaxed for motorcycle racing.  but, it may be that it applied to a specific type of electric motorcycle race only. There is some more detailed discussion here: http://craigvetter.com/pages/470MPG/TTXGP%20Fairing.html  This is fascinating to me, because it suggests that the electric motorbike races should very suddenly start racing at much higher speeds than conventional motorcycles; we will see real world examples of fully streamlined motorcycle racing. The only thing remaining is to see a change from traditional motorcycle seating to recumbent style, which electrics should permit, and physics should encourage, as we know that the lower to the ground we are the less wind resistance, and the less wind resistance, the faster we go. This has always seemed like an inevitable revolution to me, dictated purely by physics. My suspicion is that the argument: ""...but you can't put a knee down"" won't matter, if your center of gravity is lower in comparison."
motorcycles,3du223,mnp,2,Mon Jul 20 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"Recumbent bicycles stink on hills.  You can't stand on the pedals, so you're basically all leg all the time, in low gear, pressing against your back."
motorcycles,3du223,Nolano,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:45 2015 UTC,"True, but my own personal experience with my own has been that it's not as bad as you'd think once you've done a fair amount of riding, as long as the bike isn't absurdly heavy. And then going downhill I can usually outrun any car traffic on the roads without much difficulty."
motorcycles,3du223,humanefly,3,Sun Jul 19 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"sure but you go so much faster that you can approach the hill at up to 20% higher speed. Also, you use different muscles on a recumbent; I think the glutes are more involved, so the inability to stand is less important. The recumbent is much faster on the flats and downhills; there's a downside to everything though"
motorcycles,3du223,boobbbers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"sure but you go so much faster that you can approach the hill at up to 20% higher speed.   That speed advantage will only make a difference if that hill was a speedbump or something just a tad bit bigger.    Also, you use different muscles on a recumbent; I think the glutes are more involved, so the inability to stand is less important.   The reason why one stands on pedals when cycling uphill is because one let's their body weight + gravity do some work too. It's more than just the muscle groups you use (and you can use plenty of gluts in common cycling posture).   Notice how John Museeuw does his hill climb. When he gets off the seat, his butt and back bobs up and down."

motorcycles,3dza1s,batcrab,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"In TX, you get what is called a bonded title. It stays bonded for three years much like a lost title;however, during those three years you are allowed to sell it while its still under bonded title. Do keep in mind that most people will only buy clear titled bikes, and not many businesses will loan on anything other than clear as well.. So purchase with the intent of long term ownership."
motorcycles,3dza1s,shauneky9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"As long as it isn't listed w Tx DOL as ""salvage"" bike and doesn't have a lien on it then you can apply for a lost title and get it registered. I think most states have a 3 year minimum wait for a lost title, but that won't keep you from riding it."
motorcycles,3dza1s,giaxxon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:00 2015 UTC,For the 3 year waiting period is that to get the title? So if I wanted to upgrade in like 2 years th e bike still wouldn't have a title to sell it.
motorcycles,3dza1s,giaxxon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It may be different in Tx though, and you can still sell it with a bill of sale and release of interest. If you're really interested it'd be worth your time to stop by a licensing agent and asking them about the lost title process."

motorcycles,3dxmsu,Clenzz,2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:59 2015 UTC,Nice! 3 points? That's bonkers. Did you have experience on a bike already? I had literally not even sat on a bike before Saturday. I was pretty surprised at how confortable I got(even though I barely made it point wise).
motorcycles,3dxmsu,Clenzz,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had ridden a little before. At one point in another state I had a motorcycle permit and rode on the street with some friends, but decided that I was too 'young and dumb' back then.   We had 3 people in our class that had no experience at all. All did very well. Some of them even did better than others that had been riding, illegally, for quite sometime. Kinda scary lol."
motorcycles,3dxmsu,Clenzz,2,Mon Jul 20 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah we had one guy who was riding illegally that ended up only getting his permit. Part of me wishes that the course was a day or two longer so I could really drill the skills in. We had twelve people in our class and I feel like that's a whole lot of sitting and waiting for others to be done, not a lot of time for each individual rider."
motorcycles,3dxmsu,Mirrory,3,Mon Jul 20 12:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah overall the students were pretty good, we got out early each day. Except for a few of the exercises, there so there was not too much sitting for us.  Where I am they do offer a ERC (experienced rider course) and from what I can tell it looks to be pretty similar to the BRC class, except that you use your own bike. You could also try and setup the obstacles yourself or go to the parking lot during off hours. Our instructors told use to go and practice in a parking lot once we get bikes."

motorcycles,3dxmsu,Domo929,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you can get on the brakes to the point it will lift the rear of the bike off the ground. If the pavement surface is good (no gravel/sand, and its not wet) then there's a lot more traction there than you think. Mind you don't want to just slam the front brake to the handlebars right away but start with firm pressure then gradually increase, just like you probably already do in a car.   With the rear brake you need to be careful because it locks very easily in hard braking conditions. Try rolling at around 10 mph and press the rear brake hard to get it to lock to get a feel for it. It feels like locking the rear tire of a bicycle"
motorcycles,3dxmsu,Domo929,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. I definitely locked the rear brake a couple of times after the instructor tipped us about it, for the same reason you mentioned. Figured itd be easier to get used to if I tried it at low speeds."

I can't imagine what Honda was thinking other than trying to make sure it was really super easy for very small people to tip it back onto its wheels.    For hers, our driveway is pretty uneven so I'd just roll it to a spot where the kickstand landed in a low area, or if I couldn't do that for some reason I even resorted to parking with some chunks of 3/4"" plywood under the wheels.  If we had been keeping it longterm I would have removed the kickstand and taken it to a welding shop to get it shortened by 1/2"" or so."
motorcycles,3dzupu,Asshole_Salad,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:08 2015 UTC,I've looked at it in detail and I'm a bit apprehensive about shortening the stand cause I'm not a welder and I don't trust anyone's welds. The only thing i thought of was to buy a new kickstand...
motorcycles,3dzupu,focuskids,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"I know some pro welding shops in my area that can do it easily, that I would trust.  If you think about the physics of it it's not too bad - it just has to support the bike while leaning, so like 10% of the bikes weight is on the kickstand and more importantly that pressure is pushing the weld together.  If you were hanging the whole weight of the bike by the stand so it was pulling the weld apart, I'd share your concerns a little more.   Think about all those custom Harleys - they weigh a whole lot more than your CBR and they're all custom welded, including the kick stand.  It's a very sturdy way to join metal if done competently and it's not too hard with the right equipment and some practice."

Still, it's worth repeating. You will drop your first bike. You'll probably crash your first bike. Starting a bigger, heavier, taller and more powerful first bike will only make the resulting incident worse.  I started on a dirt bike, then got a used Honda 250 before moving to an old Yamaha Seca II. I'd been riding for 6 years before i bought my first all-new bike at a dealership.

In OP's case, I don't believe he actually locked the rear, I think it was mechanical failure, but overusing the rear brake on an R6 isn't a good habit to get into, as most riders will go to habitual behaviors in an emergency and bin it by locking up the back."

motorcycles,3dvfvt,juddvong,-17,Mon Jul 20 06:02:43 2015 UTC,When used together with the fronts.  The fronts apply something like 90% of the braking force (due to weight transfer forward).  The rears do almost nothing (except lock up).  The main reason I use my rear brake is to clear the surface rust from the rotor.  There's a reason you have two large rotors up front and only a single smaller rotor in the rear.

motorcycles,3dvfvt,LittleBigWorld,9,Mon Jul 20 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry but if your riding hard enough that you have to brake so hard as to put 100% of the bikes weight on the front and rendering the rear brake useless then you're riding too fast for the street.   Not everyone rides around at 100% all the time.    I'm assuming you mean this piece of ToTW: ""The obvious mathematics of the situation are that the front wheel can do 100 percent of the braking and the back at that point just locks up no matter who you are.  Learn to totally rely on the front brake for quick, clean stopping; then, if you still have a use for the rear, go ahead and use it. But realize that the rear brake is the source of a huge number of crashes both on and off the track. I’ll leave the final decision up to you. While it is true for most riders that a motorcycle will come to a full stop quicker with both brakes applied, in racing, you don’t come to a full stop until you’re done.""  Which is fine for the track but the street isn't the track and you ride differently for both.   If the rear brake is useless then why does Honda use a linked braking system along with a handful of other manufacturers?"
motorcycles,3dvfvt,conairh,-4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:18 2015 UTC,The guys I ride with at the track. That's why some track day guys remove their rear brakes to remove weight if they can get away with it at some organization. It's also a bad habit to have for panic situations. If you're a professional rider trail braking into the corner that's a whole  different story.
motorcycles,3dvfvt,friendly_jerk,4,Mon Jul 20 00:16:47 2015 UTC,May be different for people riding in IL4 but I use the rear brake on corner exit to keep the front end down.

motorcycles,3dzwsr,PLD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"I recommend you try two of the same bikes, one stock and one with just slip-ons and see/feel the difference for yourself.  Less restrictive pipes allow the engine to rev up faster and produce measurable performance gains, and they weigh less.  Every bike raced in a professional setting has a full exhaust change because stock exhausts are aimed toward goals of less noise at a cost to performance.  For us plebes, we swap out our silencers so the engine can aspirate better, adding performance and, yes, noise.  I like the noise and the performance.  Both are real things and make riding fun.  I like the way it feels.  I do agree that the EX650 sounds pretty bad with aftermarket exhaust, but it does rev up faster.  I'm not a fan of that bike anyway, but if your bro digs it, I'm not going to knock it."

motorcycles,3dvlob,Karlen89,4,Mon Jul 20 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"Just look at the cost/usefulness.  A Grom is a tiny ass bike.  It has a low top speed that barely qualifies it for highways and is insanely cheap.  You know when you buy it you're probably not going to take it out of town [even though you can].  It costs new like $3100.  For double the price you can get a DRZ or WR250.  You'll go a little bit faster but not too terribly fast.  You can take those bikes out of town [or just get lost in them being a hoon] but you're not going to do it very fast.  You're going to have a little bit more fun being able to cover more ground.  What would you rather have?  A go around town bike or a maybe go long distances bike for double the price?  Also don't forget running costs, while I haven't done a quote, I'm guessing the Grom is going to be cheaper on insurance as well as being cheaper overall with tires, fluids, and the like.  ....I wish I had the money for them all."
motorcycles,3dvlob,sirkazuo,8,Mon Jul 20 02:05:50 2015 UTC,"Unless you absolutely had to have new, there's no reason to spend ""double"" a grom's price on a DRZ. You can get a great DRZ for under $4k all day long and do just about everything better than a Grom. Only advantages a Grom has is mpg and fuel injection."
motorcycles,3dvlob,Karlen89,5,Mon Jul 20 03:16:09 2015 UTC,Comparing new price with used price is disingenuous.  Whatever money you'd save buying a used DRZ could be saved buying a used Grom too...

Unless you ran it out of oil, or put sand in the crankcase instead of oil, I can't imagine why you'd need a rebuild on such a new bike.  Have you seen the bike lately? Is it torn apart? I checked part numbers and the clutch basket (for example) is the same part number for 2008 and 2011. Sounds to me like you're being played big time. There is no reason to have that bike for 4 months. I could have rebuilt the entire bike 10 times in 4 months.

In my case, the mechanic was paid a fixed price for every job by the shop, and he had already spent too long on the motor.  He took other bikes on to continue making money, leaving mine in pieces off to the side.  I ended up threatening the shop owner with a lawsuit and they finished the job the next day.  I'd say you should start escalating it quickly.  Get to the shop owner and ask them to help, and then call them every couple of days for an update.  If he can't move it along, say you're going to take it from his shop and drop hints of legal action."

motorcycles,3dwpa2,Danbeta,4,Mon Jul 20 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely a shit mechanic, in the olden days before the coming of the internet the engine could have been rebuilt top to bottom in a month or less. In my experience the longest part of a rebuild is having parts go out for precision machining because any quality machinist's shop will be back logged with work orders. The fastest part of the rebuild is the actual assembly. If your engine didn't require any machining it would have been done in two weeks, 2 days to strip and measure the engine 10 days to order and receive parts and 2 more days to reassemble."

motorcycles,3dubgs,paulybabyp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"I would guess it's the gear shift as it looks like it goes into the transmission.  It wasn't until about the 70s (or around there) that gear shift on the left and rear brake on the right was a ""standard"" worldwide (i.e., transmission control on the left - clutch and gear shift; stop and go on the right - throttle and front & rear brakes).  So you can see a bunch of older British bikes and Harleys with right side gear shift."

motorcycles,3dyst3,Stridercal,13,Mon Jul 20 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Because...  You'll be on a bike with nearly double the weight and a good foot or more of wheelbase with lazy geometry. The bike won't turn without filling out forms in triplicate to request a direction change.  You'll be riding an engine that makes barely 65 hp stock, and although the torque is decent, you'll be running into the rev-limiter constantly. Don't worry though - you can always buy one of Harley's $5000 crate motors to get yourself a 100 hp...  The foot-forward position puts all your weight on your lower back, and the shit rear shocks will transfer hits direct to your spine. You won't be able to stand on the pegs to avoid these impacts easily, either. Still, it won't be much worse overall comfort than your R6.  Basically, you'll take everything the powers of motorcycle science has created - power, handling, braking - and throwing it all away. You'll be signing yourself over to old age, boring rides, drunk riding buddies, and all the wonderful marketing of the H-D machine.  You want to get a cruiser? Fine, just get a good one, like a Triumph Thunderbird Commander, Honda Valkyrie, or Ducati Diavel."

Victory makes a good motorbike, especially on the handling front (again, relative to the class). Polaris brought the same know-how to Indian, too.  The problem with Victory is that they are quite possibly the worst buy you can make in the entire industry, losing over 50% of their residual value in less than five years - across the entire OEM!  If you had a gun to my head and forced me to buy a cruiser with my own money, i'd buy a Triumph Thunderbird Commander, a new Honda Valkyrie, or a Yamaha Stryker.

I wouldn't, the prototype was garbage and I'm fairly certain the production bike will follow suit given H-D's track record.  There was a lot of concern about branding to the LiveWire event I attended and performance issues were dismissed when I brought it up during my ""interview"". Fuel range, power output (in power mode) and handling needed improvements.  I'm still banking that Tesla will bring an e-bike to market before HD does."

I imagine Victory will be first on scene from a major OEM. Zero is getting better every model year, too. The really spoiler might be Kawi. Something like 70% of the patents taken out by Kawi over the last year and change have been for e-bike tech... watch this space, as they say."

The FZ-07 looks really nice but I think for you this is one or the other.  A lot of Harley dealers do demo rides (at least in my area). If that isn't available, try and find a dealer that does rentals. Better to spend a full day getting to know the bike before giving up an entire ride style.  I know Harley has a reputation on this sub and I have to say I really don't agree with it. I ride mine fast enough to get pulled over on twisty roads. I can put several hundred miles on my StreetBob comfortably and cost of ownership really hasn't been any worse than any sportbike I've owned. In fact all the maintenance has been easy enough for me to figure out where its just the cost of the typical maintenance items. I have over 50k miles on my StreetBob so far and any issue I've had has been self inflicted."

Needed tools to get at it, but once I hooked the line up and switched to prime for a few seconds, it started fine and ran like a champ.  So, the pods were only very indirectly to blame, don't need re-cleaning, and plugs are still good.  Very low effort fix, just a pain in the ass and briefly worrisome."

motorcycles,3dyqvg,meadeballl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"The MSF can be a quick and easy way to get your license based on where you live. It can also get you a discount on your insurance, so it helps pay for itself.  As far as comparing the R1200RS to a 600 (assuming you get something like a GSXR600) it'll be a lot lighter, and it'll handle at speed better; the trade off being that your power is locked behind higher rpm which (because of how the bike is geared) you can't really get to legally, and you'll have less torque overall because of the engine setup. They're also hard to handle at slow speeds, but for different reasons than the BMW. If anything I'd watch out for the brakes, as they're pretty strong and can loop the bike if you aren't careful."

motorcycles,3dyqvg,McDiggums,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:21 2015 UTC,This is a useless statistic alone. What percentage of total riders are MSF certified?  That would tell us something.
motorcycles,3dyqvg,BeaverCascadian,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:39 2015 UTC,Ultimately we want P(Accident | MSF); probability of accident given MSF certification.  Which is given by P(MSF | Accident) *  P(A) / P(MSF); probability of MSF certification in an accident multiplied by the ratio of the probability of an accident to the probability of MSF certification.  So far we can say P(MSF | Accident) is .20; since P(~MSF | Accident) is .80.  Does anyone know the probability/proportion of riders in an accident to riders not in an accident?  Also the probability/proportion of riders with MSF certification to riders without an MSF certification?

The Nighthawk has a 15mm front axle, like many, many Hondas over the years.  You would have to do some fabrication, but a front wheel from a CB175 with a dual leading shoe brake of 160mm diameter should be fairly easy to swap, or the CB/CL350 twin with a 180mm drum.

motorcycles,3dxaj6,okmijnuhbg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:56 2015 UTC,"Depending on the part, it can be okay, but generally not. Houston's planning division generally sees bike lanes as basically glorified shoulders (just paint a little and add a side to the road). Houston's drivers are extremely aggressive and generally not kind to cyclists. Finally, the city is planned in such a way that highways (and larger faster roads) are how you get around most of Houston (again, depending on the part you are in). These roads do not favor bikers, even as far as crossing them.  As I said though, it REALLY depends on the part of Houston you're in. I grew up where I would have to either cross Beltway 8 or I-10 to get anywhere really. Some downtown parts of Houston can be decently friendly to bikers, though I would still caution their use.  Also you should include roughly what sort of terrain is your route to your job. If it includes highways primarily, I would advise to think of that when choosing a bike. If not, I might go dual-sport or supermoto to deal with going over/around construction zones and pot holes that scatter the city."

A ninja 250, or older UJM's can be had for the same price point.   I just don't see the need in buying new when it's mainly going to be a commuter anyway.

Lightweight and easy to pickup. Nimble as fuck, rugged, awesomely easy to lane split, and you can drive over obstacles, potholes, curbs, small rodents, zombies, whatever you need and you'll stay upright. You can drop it and it keeps on tickin'.   I have ridden sport bikes, Harley's, Russian sidecars, British bikes and nothing compares to my xt. If you want less revving on the freeway?

motorcycles,3dz8zb,Marshall498,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"The mark 1's are  a good robust bike, and while the engines can take all sorts of abuse, other components can suffer. Make sure and check the head bearings as they are prone to fail. Front and rear brakes have a tendency toward binding. (good overhaul and some red grease sorts it) , the HT leads simply slip into the plug cap and can cause a cylinder or two to stop firing in very wet weather. The link pipe between the collector box and can is notorious for holeing due to rust and vibes but looks like its been sorted in theses pics. If it sounds a bit clicky ticky on a cold start, thats normal! (once described as mice dancing on an old style typewriter) Check for rust everywhere (especially inside the tank). Paint is pretty thin on these and a couple of hard winters will see them acquiring a 'patina' sooner than you expect. None of these are a deal breaker, but might help you drive a bargain."
motorcycles,3dx7jd,lawny13,4,Mon Jul 20 07:39:28 2015 UTC,"I imported 3 bikes from the states a little over a year ago, the entire experience was a pain in the ass. Were it not that I paid much less in the states than what I would have otherwise paid in Australia I would have not gone through this.  So here's the government site regarding the issue. Like all things regarding the Australian government it's pretty fucking confusing/useless. You can apply to import it as a personal import under the stipulation that you have owned the vehicle for 12 months.   To save you some time, this is the application.  Keep the bike stock. When you get here you'll need to get a blue slip from a certified mechanic, in order to actually register the vehicle. If it isn't stock they won't even touch it. A H-D dealer refused to pass my V-Rod on the grounds that the plastic covering the headlight, and indicators, wasn't the correct type (some AS1698 bullshit), and I had to laugh as I pointed out the none of his Showroom bikes had plastics indicating they met that standard either. Funny how that works huh? Just tell the guy it's completely stock and go somewhere else if they try anything funny.  It might also be important to note that other than Queensland (which apparently accepts ECE 22.05) the only helmet certification that legal in Australia is AS/NZS 1698.  I think I hit everything of note there, if you have any other questions I'll try to help you out."

motorcycles,3dx7jd,elkster88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:13:28 2015 UTC,"Hmmm thanks for the heads up. I would consider selling and buying another bike there. But I figured I would love the MT once I have it and they won't have the full version available in Oz. would kinda suck having the full version here only to sell it and get the castrated version there. As I said I will own and ride it for at least 12 months.   The only thing I might replace on it would be the exhaust but that upgrade option would be ordered from Yamaha (the akra Ti exhaust), so I figure that would be fine. Or I simply swap the original in to get it approved before swapping again. Other than that the usual accessories shouldn't be an issue right? Frame sliders and axis protectors, radiator guard and also the yamaha's comfort seat (maybe third party). Either way since I will probably buy the bike used I would have all the original stock parts stored away anyways.  Then again I might have progressed in my riding for an upgrade. They sell full version of the street triple there or also only this LAMS bullshit????"

I got some waves back, which was nice.  My clothes were soaked by the time I got to work, which I knew that was going to happen, so I packed accordingly.  The ride home was less sweaty.

motorcycles,3dxao8,GroundsKeeper2,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:42 2015 UTC,I would look at them in order of simplicity.  Have the battery checked at a local auto parts store. Most will do it for free.  Look at/replace the filters since they are cheap.  Clean the carbs or have someone do it for you.  If none of that works then look at replacing the stater. I suspect the starter is not to blame though.
motorcycles,3dxao8,spinninspeakers,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:53 2015 UTC,I have the same issue with my Bandit 400. (small cc inline four as well! Fist bump!)   I found that I had a float needle and seat issue. I did a pressure test and it would go up to 9psi but then fall off to 2-3psi. So basically I needed to have the throttle at WOT so it pressurized the carbs enough to start properly.
motorcycles,3dxao8,Marshall498,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:00 2015 UTC,battery or bad starter motor. When you bump start the bike it spins the motor fast enough. When your cranking the stater motor is not spinning fast enough. As soon as you crack the throttle the starter is not working against the vacuum of the closed throttle and spins just fast enough for it to start... Its only a few RPM's but it is enough to make the differance.

motorcycles,3dueid,happyshlappy,4,Sun Jul 19 19:31:41 2015 UTC,It's 99% for use on the track to analyze body position. Very useful to see what you were doing felt like vs. actually looked like.  But it's sort of dumb on the street.  That being said if you're a guy trying to give someone shit for you're undoubtedly slow. But that's ok too.

motorcycles,3dueid,avboden,5,Sun Jul 19 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"Entirely my fault. I've taken this corner probably 100 times. I lost concentration for a half a second, caused me to have to brake way late and trail brake way more than usual.   As I started to lean into the corner the road just felt like ice and the bike wobbled, I stood it up and braked as hard as I could to scrub speed and then just hoped I could keep it up when I went off.   Luckily I did. No damage to anything besides my ego."
motorcycles,3dueid,elmacanudo,4,Sun Jul 19 16:11:01 2015 UTC,why not brake before the turn instead of usually having to trail brake? i get that trail braking can be more efficient to save speed but it seems a little unnecessary for twistie runs

I wasn't fond of the vtec engine either, the 1200 has power when you want it in pretty much all of the rev range, no waiting for the vtec to kick in. the 800 did handle great and it the shorter wheelbase made it more agile but the 1200 is a better bike overall."

My idea is a rear mount, so on the top of the tail, the same place you'd mount a camera to check your body position. Instead of mounting a camera there, because all you will see is ass, mount a long arm on it (something like this) and put the camera on top of that.  This way, you get a shot of your body, but you can also see over the rider and see the road ahead.  It's the best of both worlds.  I haven't been able to test it yet, but I think it'll work great.

motorcycles,3dwgye,brokenblinker,2,Mon Jul 20 03:38:18 2015 UTC,"You may already know this, but correct foot positioning during corners is with the ball of your foot on the peg.  I would guess that your foot was under the shifter when this happened - I remember when I started getting more experienced and cornering more aggressively, I caught my foot more than once.  Now it never happens because I have my foot back on the peg."
motorcycles,3dwgye,cinemashow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, but I appreciate it. It was the wear bar under the foot pegs that hit, and vibrated through"
motorcycles,3dwgye,aquoad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"My Tiger has a 3/4"" peg protruding from the peg and I've scraped it up some on both sides. Jarring.  I worry about the message I'm sending to an oncoming Cop or CHiP if I'm leaning off....I foresee rollers in my rear-view even going at or below speed limit."
motorcycles,3dwgye,aquoad,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"I discovered that on my old bmw airhead, on right turns its the bottom of the brake pedal that scrapes first, which is not that confidence inspiring since it has very little give, and the next thing to touch after that is probably the cylinder head, which would likely lever the bike off the ground and leave me lying confused in the gutter."
motorcycles,3dwgye,cinemashow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course.. the brake pedal has enough give to kinda serve as a feeler. The cylinder head sure doesn't :)"

Prolly happened to some unfortunate and sent him flyin. my guess is the exhaust header cover plate on Tigers have caused same issue.  Surprising how far over we lean when just counter-steering without leaning.
motorcycles,3dwgye,veyron3003,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this - shifting your weight on the seat will buy you extra lean angle (i.e., you won't have to lean over as much if you slide your butt over.)"
motorcycles,3dwgye,brokenblinker,3,Mon Jul 20 20:49:00 2015 UTC,Crank up your preload or get springs for your weight.
motorcycles,3dwgye,Bazgab,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:08 2015 UTC,That isn't the problem.  The problem is most likely incorrect foot positioning during cornering.  He probably has his foot under the shifter rather than the ball of his foot on the peg.
motorcycles,3dwgye,brokenblinker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:08 2015 UTC,"I have done it a few times on my BMW when the balls of my feet are on the peg.

motorcycles,3dv477,handmann,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"These photos are really great! Looks like a solid trip.  Did you wild camp during this trip or have you had any experience wild camping in Germany, and/or other countries in Europe?  I'm asking as I'm going on a 3 month motorcycle trip across Europe, and I really want to wild camp, for a better experience."
motorcycles,3dv477,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:06:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot.  Generally, camping in the wild is not technically forbidden all over Europe, but you have to be a bit careful where you camp. In places like sweden you can sleep anywhere, in germany the best thing to do would be to ask for permission and sleep on private grounds (which you dont need to do if you are careful).  General rule for me is: Be aware where you are, who might stumble upon you, how visible you are from streets/other places and how accessible your spot is (motorbikes can go places cars can't).  What makes it easier is not setting up a tent. Maybe look into a small sleeping hammok or sleep on the floor. You can leave way faster and are not that visible.  If you have any questions let me know!"
motorcycles,3dv477,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for getting back.  I've thought about getting hammocks, but my girlfriend will be coming also, and to be honest, three months is a long time without sex and we'd both feel a lot more comfortable in a tent.  So, If I see like a farmer or something similar, I could ask him 'Would you mind if we camp on your land tonight, we won't make a mess' and that generally comes back with a positive response? Or will I be laughed at?  Wild camping is so important for the trip, it's whats going to make the difference between it being a 1 month trip, and a 3 month trip. (Save money on accomidation)"
motorcycles,3dv477,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"The sex thing, don't worry, you will get enough chances at that. Europe is not as crowded as you would think, there are so many nice and solitary places, just be smart about it.  And yes, as weird as it sounds, asking is always better than being sent away. Saves you from pitching the tent after dark and having to leave early. The first few nights you will probably need longer to find a good spot, and sometimes it can get frustrating, but with more experience it gets a lot easier. For the cities I would advise camping far outside or getting a room. 20€ should be possible in all eastern Europe, 30€ in western Europe, just don't try this in switzerland."
motorcycles,3dv477,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  So Switzerland is a no no for wild camping?   Luckily only planning on passing through there, really feel like driving through the alps!"

motorcycles,3drkbk,Xenophyophore,4,Sun Jul 19 01:21:42 2015 UTC,Cars use differentials to allow their wheels to move at different speeds.
motorcycles,3drkbk,geking,5,Sun Jul 19 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"yes, but if it is an open diff all the power would go to the wheel off the ground.  A LSD would force both wheels to do at the same speed unless it is a helical.  A FJ Cruser would not have a Helical - Racecar bro.  SO, what kind of diff is it?  I think that the US Driverside half shafts are removed and the diff is locked on that side."

motorcycles,3drkbk,ldrider,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the brakes need to be on for the wrench to be able to loosen the lug nuts so perhaps that has something to do with it.

motorcycles,3drkbk,geking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:43 2015 UTC,But the brakes would be the same on both sides.  How would the brakes stop the wheels with no resistance yet let the wheels pushing the suv spin?  Perhaps the brakes on the passenger side are disabled.

The bike is leaning to the left, so it takes some effort to move it to vertical then lean it right until it falls.

The reason for this is that accidental deployment while riding would be incredibly dangerous, and if for some reason you do push it against the tarmac, it should close further, not open further.   Still, with all the electronics on modern bikes, there could be a better solution (such as the sidestand locking in the open position until the key is placed in the ignition)."

motorcycles,3dvv4r,degoba,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:18:18 2015 UTC,Theres an easy solution to this. You need to ride the hell out of the first tire so that you can put the second one on sooner. Get your moneys worth and all that.
motorcycles,3dvocw,MyPenisBatman,10,Sun Jul 19 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"Looks like the radiator is leaking, if so you've got two real options. Replace the radiator, or see if you can find the spot of the actual leak and wedge a gob of JB water weld into there. Water weld will cure even under water, so no need to even drain the system.  Is there other damage? Tough to tell from the pics.."

motorcycles,3dvocw,friendly_jerk,8,Sun Jul 19 23:01:17 2015 UTC,"When I was first building my racecar I had added a huge ebay aluminum radiator, but hadn't yet removed the ac system. It all seemed to fit, but coming on and off full throttle there was just enough movement for the condensor unit to rub against the aluminum radiator. Developed a small leak and I patched it with water weld (and removed the ac). This was five seasons ago I think, doesn't leak a drop. It's pretty amazing stuff."

Obviously not going to fix a 6"" crack, but for a small hole I will always try it first.  There are of course less expensive aftermarket options, but an oem radiator is $430!! Then you've got to fill and burp your cooling system.  Is it not worth spending $10 on water weld first to potentially avoid all that?"
motorcycles,3dvocw,AWESOM-O_jed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"OEM Radiator   $430    That's pretty much the cost of a USED one for a Street Triple :P OEMs are in the $600 range :( I cracked my radiator looping a wheelie. Just now had the time to swap a used one I had sitting on my shelf for like 5 months.   Mine had a tiny crack in it, but I didn't feel like using a stopleak and blowing the water pump eventually, since they harden at contact with air (as in the next time you flush the coolant). It was worth the wait. New one does it's job, no leaking."

Autos are, by and large,  tools of convenience used to accomplish relatively mundane tasks like moving your body to work, picking up groceries, taking the dog to the vet, etc. The experience also sets a person apart from their surrounding in a ""cage"" of glass and metal  which causes many people to shut off their brain and not be in the moment. It really becomes a cage when you consider how much of our lives we spend sealed away servicing dull tasks with the brain in Off position.  Yes, you can still do mundane tasks on a moto but you are outside, in the wind, you are making the bike an extension of your body by moving on the bike, shifting, counter steering...both your brain and body are active. You are engaged and in the moment.  FWIW, I think all of these negatives about autos are exactly why the red, manual, convertible sports car is the symbol of male midlife crisis.

I'm a much better driver because I ride; I'm more aware of my surroundings and am much more patient when in a cage. Cagers could care less to what's going outside their little cage; unless, of course it's a rider splitting  even though it doesn't affect them negatively in any way."

motorcycles,3dth9f,lunixss,0,Mon Jul 20 09:26:40 2015 UTC,"It's not us vs them.  That's not what the phrase cager is about.  Every time we get on the bike, we feel free, wild, unleashed upon the world.  Then the weekend ends and we take the kids to practice in the civic/minivan and we feel caged.  ""Nah I gotta take the cage today"".  4 walls around you on the road just doesn't feel comfortable to some people who love riding, so they feel like they are in a cage.  So the phrase cager derives from that.  It's not meant to be an insult, it's just lingo of the lifestyle.   I've personally only ever heard the term used between motorcyclists and never as an insult to someone else on the road.  Frankly it's not even a good insult if you used it that way."

motorcycles,3dth9f,catsfive,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:16:44 2015 UTC,It brings about the image of someone who is not attentive or sure enough in there ability to operate a motor vehicle. So they must surround themselves in a metal box. Thus is where the parallel between motorist and motorcyclists is drawn. As we are more attentive and sure in our abilities. So we strip ourselves down to the bare essentials.  But I do understand not everyone has there head up there ass. Many people in cars respect and share the road equally despite our size differences.

motorcycles,3dth9f,Dcajunpimp,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"I view ""cagers"" as people that have no clue about motorcycles.  Bikers that drive cars are not the same.  We know to look out for motorcyclists, know not to hang in their blind spots, give considerations at intersections, and I'd bet are significantly more aware of our surroundings when driving than most people in cars.  As such, I don't consider a biker using a car as a cager.  Hate if you want, but it IS an us vs them thing.  Most of the people around here that don't ride would probably not lose a night of sleep over doing something that caused an accident.  Updating Instagram in the car was far more important."
motorcycles,3dth9f,HyperTraveler,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"Us and Them is perfectly normal.  Only when we malign others do we cross over into the ""vs"" territory, and even then it is something that the average human does on a daily basis without even thinking about it.

motorcycles,3dth9f,absentminded_adjunct,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"It is an 'us vs. them' mentality and it has to be. We all know you have to be very defensive while riding because often times the cagers just won't see you.  Having an attitude of, ""We're all just people trying to get somewhere"" doesn't promote this defensiveness. I prefer to think of them as the enemy because that allows me to not underestimate them. I'm on guard any time I'm around other cars."
motorcycles,3dth9f,engineerrol1,-2,Sun Jul 19 16:21:03 2015 UTC,Uhh I dont see the problem.  I highly doubt many cagers know we call them cagers.  The term cagers is pretty much a term that is inside to the motorcycle community.

motorcycles,3dtms2,random_echo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I had the same problem.  The first day taking out my bike I ran it out of gas in the middle of the desert.  I was there for an hour before someone could come pick me up.  Definitely would have been nice if someone had stopped to get me gas...or offer me water.  My dad came to pick me up and I chugged a liter of ice water and a cold powerade as soon as he handed them to me.

motorcycles,3dtms2,Kavc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:42:18 2015 UTC,By finding the problem (bad seal on the spark plug) and determining there wasn't really anything I could do at the side of the road. Continued on another 800 miles on one good spark. Big thumpers are awesome.

I stopped for this lady who looked really stressed on the side of the road in traffic. I merged over to the right lane then drove very carefully on the gravel off the freeway backwards to make sure she was ok. (It was also 100 out and everyone was dying that day) so when she said she was ok I offered her a water and was on my way. (I keep a couple waters in my backpack at all times just in case)

motorcycles,3dwysd,Flanman3410,3,Mon Jul 20 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on a few things. More modern bikes have more components that are annoyed by the variable voltages you get from a duff regulator, but simpler bikes don't mind at all.  Reg/recs can go wrong in a few ways, and obviously putting out no power whatsoever affects the bike differently to putting out 18V.  What bike is it, and what's wrong with the reg/rec?"
motorcycles,3dwysd,BigRedS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:19:52 2015 UTC,Rhe bike I have is a 2006 gsxr600. The regulator apparently is a huge problem on this bike model since it overheats easily
motorcycles,3dwysd,BigRedS,3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:12 2015 UTC,That'll be modern enough to get annoyed by variable voltages I'd have thought (being EFI). So whatever the reg/rec is doing wrong it's best to not ride the bike until it's fixed.
motorcycles,3dwysd,blackrhubarb,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:42 2015 UTC,It's not a good idea. You could damage other ignition components that are much more expensive than a regulator.
motorcycles,3dwysd,one-of-the-herd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think you are okay, I would give it a try, the bike ran until the battery went dead and it must have been declining for a while so I can't see the harm."
motorcycles,3dwysd,TheeBeeDeeGee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't do it with a newer bike like BidRedS said. I would make sure to unplug the failed R/R from the system when doing this.  Not sure how long a battery will last with no charging voltage as I've never tried it.
motorcycles,3dwysd,aquoad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:39 2015 UTC,"With no charging going on, the battery will not last very long at all, and when it gets low enough the bike will freak out and stop running. Also, running it down will negatively impact the battery's service life. You could get as little as 1 or 2 hours of riding time out of a fully charged battery depending on the bike."

motorcycles,3dwtoh,ILitYourBabyOnFire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:48 2015 UTC,"Not likely unless if you left it there running for many minutes. It's always a good idea after spilling a 4 stroke bike (excluding dirt bikes because, well, dirt bike) to stop the engine ASAP, stand it up and let all fluids drain back to where they belong. Even if you didn't do that you would have noticed any problems by now.   As for walking it around I was told to make sure you always have the bike leaning toward you. The only time I've dropped my bikes are when I was pushing it backwards and trying to go to the right.   Also don't push the bike around if you're straddling it. Jump off. You increase the risk of dropping it while straddling and pushing it. You also increase risk of injury to yourself. If you drop it while standing next to it and pushing you can get away. If you're straddling it you may be going for a little ride."

There's also the Kawasaki straight 4 cruisers. You could also check out an 80s Yamaha VMAX. That thing is just pure insane."

Honestly that ZR1000 I linked is basically how I imagined my perfect bike, but the fact it's 1000cc is the only thing keeping me from selling my PS Vita to gamestop so I could buy it tomorrow...

Check out the maxims,   I did s quick search and found  Yamaha maxim $1000 http://kansascity.craigslist.org/mcy/5106551909.html  I had one of these for about 8 years, rode 66 to LA and back through Ut/CO.

One of the two bearings is pretty new and works great, the other seems like it's still the stock bearing. To make things worse is that the outer bearing ring is stuck and I don't have a ring pull to sort that shit out! I can't even get a screwdriver in from the other side to tap it out! Now I have to hope I can get away from work early enough to go to a shop and hope they can fix it.

motorcycles,3dwyi2,obnoxiously,2,Mon Jul 20 05:41:06 2015 UTC,Endorsements are generally easy. Take a MSF class and take the proof of completion to the MVD and they give you a new license.   Insurance isn't that bad. I started riding two months after my 18th birthday and my CBR600RR was around $100 a month.   As for the mechanical part If you have a car and can afford to have a bike break down for a little then you can learn how to fix it. I only have bikes so I have two I know will start every time I push the button. Then In the backyard I have a old busted CB750F that I have piece by piece restoring and you learn a ton  So yeah it's very easy and possible. As long as you don't get a Super Duke as your first bike you will be fine insurance wise.   Also don't forget gear costs. I'd say put away around $1200 for the really good stuff. I didn't budget for it when I got my bike and ended up in budget gear. The difference between a cheap and expensive helmet is night and day and you won't ever regret the awesome high quality protection
motorcycles,3dwyi2,DarkOdeus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! The insurance is about what I expected I guess. My car is $120/month, so I guess it's just an adjustment.   I was planning on first investing in a very good helmet, and then getting the rest of my gear afterwards. I would feel comfortable riding around my town as long as I have a good helmet on my head (and long pants, only took one exhaust pipe burn to never make that mistake again).  How long is the MSF class? Is it long and drawn-out like driver's ed or is it more of a weekend thing?  Edit: I'm looking at a '79 Suzuki GS550 as my first ride. I've been warned in the past about that big an engine, but I think I'm responsible enough not to let it get me into trouble."
motorcycles,3dwyi2,DarkOdeus,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:08 2015 UTC,Get a jacket as well. It will make you feel safer and more confident.   I did the Harley MSF class they offer at most dealerships. It was from 6 - 9 pm on Thursday and Friday then riding in a parking lot Saturday and Sunday from 10 -  4. They give you an official MSF riding test Sunday afternoon. I literally had my license Monday by 10 am and I bought my CBR500R at 11:30. Rode to class the next day
motorcycles,3dwyi2,parkwood60,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:12:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I'll be looking into this as soon as I have a bit more money to purchase the bike itself. It looks like I also need to have some kind of motorcycle temps, but I'm sure that can't be too difficult."
motorcycles,3dwyi2,aquoad,2,Mon Jul 20 06:16:25 2015 UTC,About the biggest issues with old bikes and reliability are 1) ignition points 2) charging systems. Make sure those are in order and it will be as reliable as anything.  Stay away from insuring a late model plastic clad sport bike and I doubt it will be an issue how old you are.
motorcycles,3dwyi2,aquoad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:41 2015 UTC,I don't know if they make/made them for all the old bikes but Dyna electronic ignition systems are a godsend for old bikes and cars with points-and-condenser ignition. Never have timing issues again. I did this to a '68 mini cooper and it went from giant pain in the ass to really nice to drive. And my '78 BMW R100 has one as well.
motorcycles,3dwyi2,aquoad,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"Insurance companies seem to view what we'd call ""vintage"" bikes as being in the lowest risk category, for what it's worth, so you have that going for you. I'm sure you'd get a hair-raising quote if you tried to insure a brand new supersport, but a cool old 70's CBwhatever is probably a good choice especially if you are into working on it."
motorcycles,3dwyi2,aquoad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:46 2015 UTC,I'm sure glad to hear that; I didn't know how much they categorized motorcycles in terms of risk. I guess an old GS550 is essentially the equivalent of a Honda Accord (with more style obviously ;)).

motorcycles,3duune,CavedogRIP,2,Mon Jul 20 15:09:57 2015 UTC,I think the ATGATT hate is present everywhere.

No mother fucker, neither will the fact that you never wear a seat belt in your cage...  I just finished up my MSF training and the instructors said that this is one of the worst areas for wearing gear. They said only 25% of the riders wear helmets... I can't believe how low that is. But I don't doubt it's the truth. I 've only seen one out of ~50 riders with a helmet on this summer."

I'm struggling to see what the R3 would do better. It's probably the best of the 300/250 class, by the way, but it's still built down to a price and the difference in torque and peak hp will be a letdown for most, unless you just like thrashing the tits off a small displacement bike, which I can understand."

If you were financing the 650, I can't see whatever insurance payout you're going to get for that resulting in an extra $5k after the lender gets their balance paid off.  If you are restricted to picking only a new bike, maybe pick an R3.  But I would take that $5k and spend it on a nice condition used bike.

For example, locally I find: http://daytona.craigslist.org/mcy/5072131147.html, and that will require way less maintenance and time at 2500"
motorcycles,3dw1cj,Pickleahoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, thx for the info.  Im leaning more towards this bike, even with the necessary maintenance, because its basically brand new from someone i trust"

motorcycles,3dw1cj,Rahnis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:50 2015 UTC,"For a bike like this I would want to do all this work myself. Everything it will need are all simple enough maintenance items that any shop is going to charge you a small fortune to perform. Meaning you'd have to give your friend a crazy lowball offer which I doubt they will be pleased with since it was only 8 miles and they're you're friend.   Were I in your shoes I would be looking for something that runs and doesn't need anything at a decent asking price. Or prepare to turn some wrenches doing minor stuff. Tons of guides on the Internet and basic motorcycle maintenance should be learned by every rider, because again you'll spend a small fortune taking the bike for regular PM stuff like chain adjustments, clutch adjustments, oil changes, etc"
motorcycles,3dw1cj,ILitYourBabyOnFire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:25 2015 UTC,Agreed and thats why i havent completely decided on whether or not ill be doing the work myself.  Time will be the main factor as i have to be ready to move in a month.  Im leaning more towards this bike rather than a random one off craigs list because i know that after i do the PM stuff its basically a brand new bike from someone that i trust.  Would you say that 1500 to 2000 would be a fair estimate if i do go through with the purchase?
motorcycles,3dw1cj,Tenroh_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:22 2015 UTC,Having been there and done that you can easily find an example that's turn key ready to ride needing no new parts for $1500-$2000.

motorcycles,3dvgx3,PLD,4,Sun Jul 19 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"Those two feet do matter, however its more so because if you go faster, that two feet will become much more than two feet (so if you are going 40, that extra two feet might end up being an extra 10 feet more than you need to stop).   The turn matters because in the real world, there are all sorts of turns out there, with all sorts of obstacles that block parts of lanes. However the larger issue is being able to make that turn, because thats not a tight turn to make and making it shows a level of skill.  So i would do this.  Ride everyday. new riders need to be on a bike everyday (if possible). ride around your neighborhood until you get comfortable. Once you can do that, go to the store and pick up some cones and head to a parking lot. Practice all of the skills they taught you.  Remember that the MSF course teaches you the basic skills needed for riding, there is a reason they teach you the skills they do and use the exercises they do."

He has some good reasoning and seemed to be progressing on it.  (Stromtrooper.com, IIRC)  A friend with a Strom has a windshield with serrated corners, he says it helped a lot.  I think the key is finding out where your head is in relation to the disturbed flow, and either deflecting (difficult once you get above a certain height) or using strategies to break big vortices into little ones.  (The serrated edges, for example.)  If you have a center stand, try suiting up and sitting on it and get a friend to measure the height of your helmet's top.  This may help you find the best solution."

That's a low price for a rare bike, but if you actually get an offer to go see it, go check it out. The Shiver fucking rules - really throaty sound to the twin engine, a sexy pair of pipes, and great horsepower and torque. Since it's a 2008, insurance shouldn't be outlandish. The gas mileage/tank range will be a huge step down from your 300F. It's also much heavier, but you won't notice it as the bike feels very balanced. It's a proper step up from your 300F, and you can sell your current bike for somewhere around $3000 on craigslist."

motorcycles,3dvgze,maxwellmaxen,2,Mon Jul 20 06:18:33 2015 UTC,"there is not THE reliable and cheap bike.  there are a lot of factors that play into that. generally, japanese bikes have a good reputation for being reliable. lesser cylinders are usually more efficient with fuel, inline 4 engines are higher strung than other engines, which makes them use more fuel than a twin, and so on.  i know of suzukis that they are pretty cheap in maintenance, and usually smaller bikes are cheaper for parts (tires especially).  you can tour on pretty much any bike, and most won't overheat after two or three hours.  the best bet would be to check out a couple of dealers around you, talk to people what they would recommend, sit on bikes to feel the ergos and then buy a used bike.  your infos only cover that you want to save money, but riding in general will cost you more than what you would expect.. last season every km cost me about 1€, because i was dumb, because i was new, because there were a lot of snags you can't anticipate.  this year so far, it's been a little cheaper, but riding still costs you money.  in the end, it's sure as hell cheaper to get around europe than with a car, but you'll cover more ground with less money and more comfort if you get an interrail ticket.  i don't want to say you shouldn't buy a bike, you SHOULD buy a bike, but we can't really give you too much help with the information you provided."

Someone who works in the industry or someone heavily involved in the world of motorcycles would probably do something like this or see the reasoning behind this. Or he just happens to love bikes and be wealthy enough to support his passion to this level.  My only issue would be feeling like I put enough time on all of them to so I know I'm getting my money's worth, and since I do my own maintenance I just might go crazy keeping track of intervals, the break in periods and just tires.. That's around $1000  for tires, $200-250 for oil, god only knows if he replaces the oil filters and drain washer bolt every time...  Only a mad man does this."

You can buy outside of a dealer if you want, but at least with a dealer if something is fucked, you bring it right back and they fix it. If you HAVE to take a dealer loan, just suck it up and refinance that bitch a year later through a credit union/bank.

These are valid questions that come up in my mind when you are asking about buying your first bike, and are considering an open-class machine.  Of course, maybe i'm expecting too much...?  I bought my first used motorcycle at 17, after i had been riding for four years, on- and off-road. I then bought my second bike at 18, and my third bike (new this time) at 19. So i worked up over 6 years before buying a shiny new 100 hp motorcycle."

As I stated I've had my Sportster 883 for close to 10 years. I am ready to do some wheelies, have a bigger and newer bike, and ride something that has more torque.  But I need to see these bikes up close, so I don't know if I should go to the dealership or what not just to see them in a more intimate setting. Most sellers of used say no test rides and cash has to be in hand. 6G is a lot to be walking around with.  I want to finance a bike out, but I need to talk to my bank about that one. I just want to test ride some of these fuckers and see them up close. But I am drawn to the Yamaha.  Although I did see a super sexy Buell, it's just that I already have a sportster, and IIRC they are the same engine."

The long and the short of it is that you should arrange to have money in hand before you go bike shopping. That applies to both new and used machines. Best bet would be an insurance-bank, like state farm, or a credit union. Short out your budget, payments and pre-approval with them first. Then you can go shopping, and when you pay, you're paying with a bank's money order... not a pile of cash.  r/personalfinance could also be very helpful here.  Finally, regarding the Buell. The air-cooled bikes are based on the Sportster powerplant, but radically different. That being said, AVOID - they are baskets of problems and the brand is now kaput."

motorcycles,3dvg90,dulap7,2,Sun Jul 19 21:24:23 2015 UTC,I removed the baffles in a shadow 750 that I used to own a few years ago. I used a hole saw on a drill to cut around the edges on the back of the baffles. Then take a pair of pliers and move the baffles around inside the pipe untill the forward weld breaks free and it slides out. You will be left with somewhat of a rough edge on the inside of the pipe that cleans up nicely with some light sanding. The bike wo t be much louder but will have a nice much deeper sound to it.
motorcycles,3dvg90,WillRideForTacos,2,Mon Jul 20 07:37:06 2015 UTC,I was thinking about using a metal file but I'll take a look at it and then I'll see if I should sand or file it. We're you happy with the mod after you did it?
motorcycles,3dvg90,WillRideForTacos,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:46 2015 UTC,A file would work fine for cleaning up the edges. I was happy with it. It won't sound as good as new pipes but it did give the bike some character.
motorcycles,3dvg90,phadeout,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"I just drilled them out. It doesn't quite sound like new pipes but I am happy with it. They are loud when I get on it but have a nice rumble when just cruising. NOT to happy I had to spend 50 bucks for the cutter and attachment piece; that was a bummer. Overall, the mod was worth it and I will spray paint the inside just to touch it up."
motorcycles,3dvg90,phadeout,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"I did this to a v-star 650 back in the day; it was pretty easy.  I used a Dremel tool with a cut-off wheel, but if you have something higher powered it will work much faster. The sound gain was minor and kind of unrefined (kind of sharp and barky) but it was essentially free vs paying money for new pipes. Plus you don't need to re-jet the carbs; you aren't moving air through the engine any faster (no performance increase), just making it louder. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
motorcycles,3dvg90,phadeout,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:42 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I wasn't sure if I should get some type of paint or something to spray inside the pipes after I cut it out so it wont rust. Did you have any issues with rust or anything after?
motorcycles,3dvg90,southsun,2,Mon Jul 20 01:25:21 2015 UTC,"I sold it a year or so afterwards so I couldn't tell you. Probably hitting it with some high temp paint wouldn't hurt, but I wouldn't make it a huge priority. I imagine it would take years of parking it in the rain to see anything happen to your exhaust, by which time you'd have lots of other problems too."
motorcycles,3dvg90,chewycoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:21 2015 UTC,So I cut them out and now it sounds a lot better. Very happy with this mod. One day if I have nothing else to do I may clean it up but I guess I wont make it my priority.

motorcycles,3dvmds,Bushiewookie,2,Mon Jul 20 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"Was transferring out of the Navy in 2011 and had a 1980 CJ5. I couldn't take it and my truck from SoCal to VA beach. Decided to sell the Jeep. This Jeep had a clean metal original tub, no frame rust, but the suspension and motor were wore out, it needed a rebuild. I had bought a used motor and was in the process of swapping them when I ran out of time.   I had it on CL for a few weeks, and was asking around 3k for it. It was a hard sell because it had no smog equipment on it since it was bought and plated in Louisiana.   I decided to trade it for a MC since I had just taken the MSF class. A dude emailed me about a 94 Ninja 600. Had pics, a video of it running, all the good stuff. A friend was supposed to come with me to look at it since I knew nothing of bikes at the time. He ended up being sent on a last minute flight and I went alone. The bike started, had a little body damage, but not much. All around looked solid to me. Dude dropped off the bike and took the Jeep. I left California about two weeks later so I was never able to get my endorsement. Got out to VA and had issues getting it started and took it to a local shop. After a few days they called me up and told me it needed around $1000 worth of work to just get safe to ride. $1500 to make it like new. We're talking fork seals, brakes, cables, tires, transmission seal, oil pan gasket, and so on.   Now, this wasn't the only bike I was offered. Or the only offer I had on my Jeep. People had offered me up to 1k for it before I put the trade option. After the trade option I was offered a few Shadow 750's from the 80's and 90's. But, I was told that I would grow out of the 750 in about 2 days. I basically got blinded by the Ninja and committed to it. I reckon I lost around $2500 on this deal. Had I paid to get my Jeep to VA beach I could have easily sold it for $3k+.   They basically told me it wasn't worth fixing since in pristine condition these were worth around $1200.   However, this place also sold used bikes. They told me they had an 85 and an 86 Ninja 600 they would sell me for $500 each. Neither was running. The 86 had a good motor and drive line, the 85 had most of the motor but excellent body work. I offered $1000 for them to build one good bike. I ended up getting the 86 Ninja with the 85 plastics."
motorcycles,3dvmds,z9nine,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"Get the VIN and check it out for sure.  Ask them for lots of pictures and even a video of them starting the bike and at idle.  Probably best to plan to transport the bike back home, as it will need to get an out of province inspection before you can register it in Alberta.  Get your friend to go with you if you can, will be a fun road trip at the very least.  The Clarity.net link has great advice, print it out and bring it along.  Ask the seller many of the questions that are on the list over email or call and talk to them, if they can't or won't provide answers and photo's/video, it may be best to walk away."
motorcycles,3dvmds,FightingShibas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:58:02 2015 UTC,"All of your legal concerns are secondary to the question of condition.  Unless it's much cheaper than the usual market value, it's not likely to be stolen, and it should be a simple matter to run the VIN past a law enforcement or provincial motor vehicle services department to check on whether it is legally registered to the seller.  I'm not familiar with what that bike is worth in AB but here in MN that would not be an exceptionally cheap price, so I really would not be worrying about it being stolen. But that's easy enough to check on.  If the seller is legit, he should have no problem giving you the VIN either in an email or by phone.   I don't know what the paperwork requirements are in BC and AB so I won't comment on the bill of sale question. Your questions around paperwork are going to be answered best by you phoning the AB motor vehicle bureau. It wouldn't hurt to google for the BC equivalent and see what they say about temporary plates for transit back to AB."
motorcycles,3dvmds,elkster88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"as far as pricing goes, $3800Ca is about $2929US right now (thanks to our crappy dollar at the moment), which as you said, is a little on the high end for this bike, given it's 14 years old, but if it is indeed in mint condition, as he claims, then it is not unreasonable. The cheapest one i've seen so far is $2000, while some of the newer models are selling for up to $6000, while to buy it new I think it's about $14,000. most of the ads are between $3000 and $4500.   I'll for sure check the bureau, thanks. as far as it being stolen, or having a substantial lien on it, i'm not too concerned about it, given the price and the age, but there's always a chance, I think i probably will ask for the vin just to be safe."
motorcycles,3dvmds,elkster88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"I would mostly be concerned about committing to a long distance journey with the possibility that the bike wasn't what it was advertised to be. So I would want plenty of high resolution pictures and as much background info from the seller as I could get.  One way of getting a warm fuzzy feeling about this stuff is to be on a bike forum (not this one) that has long time members who have a real life reputation to uphold and a track record of honesty and fair dealing. Buying from a guy like that is generally far less risky when his entire group of online friends would know if he tried to pull something shady on a fellow forum member.  I very nearly bought a ZG1000 from a guy in Phoenix sight unseen (Concours Owners Group forum member, like me) and was going to do a fly and drive deal to get it back to Minnesota. In the end I found a similar deal in MN but looking back I would have been miles better off going to AZ as the bike I bought locally was in nice shape except for a blocked oil line to the cylinder head which completely trashed the cams and rockers.   :(  I don't think the seller knew about it or could have known about it because there weren't any symptoms when I first bought it. So in the end, there's always the chance there is something wrong with a used bike, and unless I would have removed that oil line at the head (why?) and observed no oil coming out while the engine was running, there would have been no way to know that the cams were going to self-destruct in a few hundred miles. Not trying to scare you out of buying that bike, but just saying that buying any used vehicle is something of a gamble. Over the years I've had a few bad purchases but the majority are good. And most sellers are honest if you know what questions to ask."

motorcycles,3dvmds,lancerlot,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:32 2015 UTC,Just because no one else has mentioned this... You'll need an out of Province inspection done at a motorcycle shop before you can register the bike I think.  I'm not 100% sure how it works but I'd look into this before hand.  Not sure where you are in AB but in Calgary Universal will do them and in my dealings with them they've always been very helpful and fair.

motorcycles,3dv5f4,Alan_Roy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"I know if I hit a bad bump the rust will go through the seals. Will this destroy them?   Yep. I've had some success on minor pitting using increasingly fine wet-or-dry sandpaper to polish up fork tubes. I take the forks off the bike and clamp the tubes (using wood or plastic blocks with appropriate diameter circular cutouts) in a vise, then go to town with a strip of the abrasive paper about a foot (30cm) long and an inch (2.5cm) wide. I rotate the tube around to expose different areas and try to feather the intensity of the sanding out so it's not concentrated in a narrow band. Not that you're going to cut all the way through that hard chrome. It's quite time consuming but cheaper than replacing the tubes or having them re-chromed. If you take care and finish up with a really super fine grit it seems to work OK, at least for me it has."

These things work when large hunks of metal move into the field and disrupts it. I've had some not notice my 96 ram. That is due to two reasons. The first is it is buried too deep or paved over too many time. The second is the sensitivity is set too low.   All those magnets will do is lighten your wallet.

Then if that passes, take an ohm meter  (if you have one) and test each circuit in the switch connecter to see if it's switching properly. If both of these pass it is more than likely a bad power or ground."

Figure out the kind of tools it requires and get them.  A philips, flathead, and some metric sockets for sure.  Never hurts to have some star pattern screwdrivers.  Honda likes to be an ass like that sometimes, especially with exhausts.   YouTube has guides for every bike.  Search for an issue and there will be a thread or a video somewhere.  There are build guides for certain bikes, but thats not a big deal.   Most of the work you'd do can be found online"

motorcycles,3dttvy,DrStuttgart,3,Sun Jul 19 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"I probably overpaid slightly based on the mileage, which clicked over to 41k when I test rode it. I spent $2500 but the previous owner had all the paperwork from each of the previous owners, all receipts from the Dale Walker tune/exhaust right down to the oil changes. It's in fantastic shape with only a few paint scratches here and there; totally reasonable for a 10 year old machine. I know it's been well cared for and that's why I was willing to pay that price for that mileage."

motorcycles,3dttvy,ThatBeardedCarGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:07 2015 UTC,"I went and sat on some bikes today.  I stopped in to a  Honda dealer near me.  Sat on most every bike they had to get a feel for what I wanted.  A lot of the sport bikes are too tall for me, namely the CBR600RR, VFR1200F, etc (damn short legs!).  I ended up sitting on some cruisers.  I think i'm in love.  I came upon 3, really 2, that are within my scope and interest.  The main 2 being a 2008 Harley-Davidson 1200 Sportster 105th Anniversary Edition and a 2013 Honda Shadow Phantom 750.  I also really like the styling of the HD Iron 883, but the exhaust was weaksauce and its a 2013, so the price was way high.  Here is an album of all 3 bikes.  What do you think?  I found the 1200 to have the best exhaust, which is no surprise.  but I prefer the styling of the Phantom.  I could change the exhaust on the Phantom and get a better sound, for sure.  I've also been eyeing a 2006 Harley V-Rod at another dealership.  About the same price as the 1200, but a totally different bike.  Goal is to purchase this fall when prices drop."
motorcycles,3dttvy,schwaffelmeister,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:51 2015 UTC,I think the HD Iron is one of the most sexy bikes out there. I'd get one if it weren't for the crazy prices of HD's in Europe.

motorcycles,3dsdaa,southsun,13,Sun Jul 19 00:17:56 2015 UTC,If you don't have the gear for it you will probably be uncomfortable. And I doubt many people in SoCal have cold weather gear.
motorcycles,3dsdaa,RamShaman,9,Sun Jul 19 01:35:56 2015 UTC,This is totally true. When I started riding 50 was unbearable to me with a mesh jacket and sweater underneath along with some cheap cold weather pants. Now that I have proper gear I can comfortably ride in temps in the upper teens and low 20s
motorcycles,3dsdaa,DarkOdeus,-5,Sun Jul 19 02:28:46 2015 UTC,It doesn't cost that much.
motorcycles,3dsdaa,southsun,10,Sun Jul 19 02:28:19 2015 UTC,It's not the cost that's the problem . It's the fact that you won't use that gear enough to justify the spending. I'm a SoCal resident and I can tell you honestly I don't own any winter gear... If it's that cold I won't ride .. Whatever call me a bitch about it we are spoiled it's like 70° year round

Took a trip to yellowstone a couple years ago and even with a full rain suit and all the right equipment, the straight 150 miles of rain we rode through was really just bullshit.

Motorcycles are pretty common in India, especially for their ease of transport and their ability to filter through rush hour traffic.

It was sort of a mix of pure terror and amazement. Like I had battled with Zeus himself only to emerge victorious, yet damp and dripping from my waterproof gear.

motorcycles,3drl6n,RobMoore,2,Sun Jul 19 04:22:45 2015 UTC,"Right now the Yamaha, because I have only had it a week and a half. It's the most fun and functional. It needs some upgrades to the suspension. I don't know why a budget bike has to have springs meant for a 120lb rider vs the average 170lb rider. I think they cost the same to make. Anyway, apart from that the bike does handle pretty well and it's slow speed maneuverability is by far the best of the bunch.  The exhaust is super quiet and I am replacing it with a yoshimura tomorrow afternoon when it comes in, and adding a small windscreen when that arrives Tuesday. I regularly go 90mph on my commute and that SUCKS on a totally naked bike.  That's where I love the ZX6r, the ability to tuck in and go 120, 130....160 is a mere seconds away at any moment, and I never found the ride uncomfortable, it's just that the FZ-07 is more comfortable...except at high speed. The torque is a lot of fun though. Twist the throttle and it GOES, whereas the Ninja needs to build a head of steam first, unless you click down a couple gears.  As for the SV, I haven't ridden it in a while as I had it taken apart as a project. It was my second bike after my Ninja 250. It is a cross between the other two for characteristics. It's been upgraded with stiffer springs and a ZX10r shock. It's a good track bike.  I told my wife ""now I need to buy a Honda so I can have the big 4 all under one roof"". Let's just say she needs some work before she'll be convinced of that."

Like with any brand bike, do your research and understand what you are buying -- what are the common problems people have with that specific model/year, how to spot it, don't buy the first one you see, etc. The Used Motorcycle Evaluation Guide and brand/bike specific forums I found to be great resources.  I've bought two Ducs off CL -- valve adjustments, belts and steel tank hinge leaks (carbie) or plastic tank swelling/deformation (FI) were the primary Ducati Monster specific things I was concerned with. Now, its definitely true that Ducati parts are insanely expensive. Buying used parts, when it comes up, off eBay and forums help but obviously risky -- I've had good luck tho. YMMV."

motorcycles,3duks3,Caffinz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"I wanted to learn with first gear so I could really be able to control them without having to be going 40+ mph, you know? Im not really afraid of looping because I've been working my way up slowly. This definitely wasn't my first day working on them."
motorcycles,3duks3,Katoom72,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:49 2015 UTC,"It does not require going 40mph+, at all. A clutch up in 2nd brings you to the balance point with a shitload of rev's to play with. Throttling/clutching it up in 1st you're climbing in RPM fast, when the wheel is high enough to require less throttle you're already in high RPM so the torque curve starts to drop. You have a low-end torque motor that starts around 4k and keeps pulling up the torque until like 7k. That's the window that you want to use. How fast do you need to go in 2nd to clutch/throttle it up to to 4k-5k? You can do that from a stand stil.  On your 2nd try it shows you're almost imediatly close to the balance point, giving you some slack on keeping it up with the throttle. (first few secs in that wheelie the revs creep very slowly, staying around the climbing torque curve for longer) It's also clear at that point things where kinda stable and easy to maintain. Until the wheel drops way past the balance point and you're able to wheelie the rev range out. But then the torque curve drops on it's face and your wheel drops to the ground to. Throwing you a bit over the bars. And that's a good example on how a 1st gear wheelie is jerky and unstable compared to the 2nd gear clutch up. Imagine doing that in 2nd, where you have low rev's on the (or close to) balance point. And you can creep slowly trough the torque range with the front wheel around the same level. That wheelie will be way longer and easy to control then your current ones.  Not trying to bag your technique. Just trying to help make it safer and easier.

A few moments passed before anyone was at my side, and I had the chance to try and move myself. Immediately, I could tell that I had lost my left shoe as my toes were burning on the hot road. My right foot felt   stiff, completely unmovable, and I thought it was probably broken. I noticed that my knees were uncovered when the little pieces of what I thought were gravel scraped against my skin, only to find out later that they were my actual kneecaps grinding against the pavement below them. My right arm was trapped underneath me and my shoulder felt hot. My left pinky was the most noticeable pain in those first few minutes, a throbbing and stabbing pain, as it bled profusely right in front of my face. I could smell my blood as it pooled beneath me on the road.      Link Picture of her at the hospital NSFWish picture of her after a few weeks/months"

motorcycles,3dsalm,Flinx98,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"You want to unload the transmission when you start. If you are already off the gas to decelerate then you've accomplished this already, but if you are accelerating and trying to downshift to get higher in the power band, then you need to unload the tranny.   But, yes, by the time you are pushing the lever into the the lower gear, the revs needs to be going back up to match the transmission.   In the end, it sounds more complicated than it really is.

motorcycles,3dtpbn,mushyz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:19 2015 UTC,When your going 50 miles an hour over the speed limit they usually don't chase you. I had one officer follow me but I just went 130 for about 10 minutes. My fuel light came on so I pulled into a gas station off the highway. I parked on the opposite side of the pumps so you couldn't see my bike from the road and he just drove by.
motorcycles,3dtpbn,bporter84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:58:54 2015 UTC,so all they have to do is catch your plate and then just go to your house?

Stock I ran just under 14.00 which was avg. I live in tx its hot af and way above sea level so it wasn't optimal for a subaru. With the mods I ran 12.6 probably could have been better if it weren't for my injectors maxed out and me driving, the car was actually better off rolls though that's what it was tuned for.

Mechanically simple single cylinder, air cooled, belt drive, 380lbs and msrp is $5,499. Made more sense as a first bike. As my instructor for the MSF course said, ""you get the best breaking power before ABS kicks on."" Then taught us to not lock the tires while emergency breaking and how to handle if you do."

motorcycles,3dutqp,Balder666,-10,Sun Jul 19 18:15:13 2015 UTC,How well can you control your bike on loose sand over pavement?
motorcycles,3dutqp,Flypflap91,9,Sun Jul 19 18:19:43 2015 UTC,you did something wrong if you find yourself on loose sand over pavement.
motorcycles,3dutqp,Blitzkrieg_My_Anus,2,Sun Jul 19 18:31:27 2015 UTC,I dunno. Some places sand their highways amd don't always properly clean it for summer.
motorcycles,3dutqp,Flypflap91,-7,Sun Jul 19 22:00:57 2015 UTC,By that logic then you've done something wrong if you find yourself hit by a deer running across the road...
motorcycles,3dutqp,Flypflap91,12,Sun Jul 19 18:40:33 2015 UTC,"no, i cant see that a deer will be running on the road. you dont ride a corner that fast if you cant see into it. do you think i have never encountered gravel in a turn? i brake down before i hit it. jesus, i made a trip today and it happened 2 times that there was gravel in a turn. i saw it, braked, and everything was fine."
motorcycles,3dutqp,Flypflap91,-8,Sun Jul 19 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"And why was I riding so fast into that corner? Because I was passing like a retard. I was riding recklessly, which was avoidable, but don't say I can't control my bike through a corner. I saw the gravel a bit too late and tried to slow down which locked up my rear tire. The thing wanted to go down but I was able to not only keep it up but make it most of the way through the corner until I inevitably drifted a bit too wide and the gravel took me down.  EDIT: Just noticed you aren't the one who posted the original comment about not being able to control my bike trough a corner. Still, I think that it's pretty easy to be riding faster than you should be and rip around a corner only to find that there's sand/ a turkey / a Hungarian goat farmer in the road. You can't tell me that you always ride slow enough into corners that you have time enough to safely break in case there's an obstacle in the way. I'm probably going to get reprimanded for saying this, but it's fun to ride too fast; it's not something that you should always do (in fact, it's really something you should never do) but if you ride a motorcycle then at some point you will ride somewhat recklessly. If you never do, then I admire your willpower and dedication to safety."

It probably has been dropped a couple times and since this is your first bike, you will probably drop it a couple times as well. The main thing you want to make sure is that mechanically it is solid. Ask for maintenance history not just what was done and when, but where at. Hopefully they kept records, of course maybe they didn't. Such is the way with used vehicles.  Find a mechanic you trust to look it over for a pre-buy inspection to give you some peace of mind.  Best case scenario, you could maybe haggle the price down a little since it's beat up."

motorcycles,3dt34r,BlackJackBrabham,5,Sun Jul 19 12:12:21 2015 UTC,"Im going to second taking a look at the vulcan s.   Generally cruisers dont have the same issues as sportbikes as they are created for a different purpose. They are not geared the same and they generally weigh more. The result is that getting a 600,750, or 900 isnt a big deal. Getting say a honda shadow 750 is not the same thing as getting a GSXR 750.  I do recommend sitting on many different motorcycles though, put your feet up. Find out if the seating position of the 883 or the street fits you better.  If you cant tell, then just buy the one you can afford. After that you will know what things you like and what things you dont like so that on your next bike you will have a better idea."

Almost EVERY review put the Speedmaster first, and those that didn't put the Shadow first. Most reviews said the 883 was a rougher ride, which makes no sense on a cruiser. Lastly, I personally looked at the pricing (the reviews were just about the rides), and the Harley cost $1200 more. I would have had to pay another couple hundred to move the controls forward for more comfort (personal preference).  If you really want a Harley, go for it, but everything I've read suggests that you're paying extra for the Harley logo."
motorcycles,3dt34r,Qubeye,8,Sun Jul 19 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"46 horsepower in Iron 883 is not a big deal for 550 pounds.

On the better side - water cooled and not shaking that hard.  Drawing the conclusion, having this amount of money you can find a way more interesting and comfortable bike."

Two, I've tested bikes made in India, both domestic brands and CKD bikes. They are anywhere from years to generations behind modern stuff. Compare them to something made, in say, Thailand, and you'll get what i'm saying rather quickly.  And yes, the bike industry is huge in India, as it is in SEA and the islands, but millions of cheap, nearly disposable commuting machines is not the same as modern engineering, and isn't competitive on the world's stage by any means.

For the record, I did actually quite enjoy the Pulsar, and the Indian-built Yamaha Fazer 160s. India's motorcycles are built for India, though - they need to be simple, light and low-tech. Those are not bad things… but with those priorities, these bikes can't compete against world market bikes.  Sorry to come off as a typical know-it-all american cunt, but my point was that Indian-made stuff is just not up to spec as the Thai-, Indonesian-, and Brazilian-built bikes that world OEMs are making. That doesn't mean they won't be able to close the gap soon, especially in light of how hard the average worker is willing to be.  Give it time - in twenty years, after my economy is blown out, and your low-lying manufacturing competition is literally under water, India will be one of the true world powers.

I mean bikes made in Thailand are specifically made to be imported, not to be sold in Thailand.  My point being Indian Manufactures and those making bikes in India make them with Indian roads in mind and Indian population in mind.  I am sure you saw that there weren't much tall bikes in India, at least not taller than 33inches. Because average height is lower than U.S so shorter saddle height.

I've ridden a buddy's built 1200 and I'm sure that would be plenty for me. The 883 is my 6th bike.  It's not that underpowered but it's not too much for a beginner. But it really comes down to you,  what you want.  A metric bike runs another, doesn't shake at idle, but it doesn't sound/feel like a Harley man...."

Where I'm from in the midwest, there's no license or org membership requirements. Just show up, pay your $40 per class, and have the most fun you can have with pants on.  As far as motorsports go, motocross is practically free to participate in. Relatively small initial investment (especially if you go used with your bike), cheap entry fees and open practice days, more tracks in a given area (less fuel costs and more variety of challenges), cheaper parts, etc."

That said, I am VERY sensitive to noise, and take good care of my ears.  In town and for short highway stints, I use these.

State/County/Municipal police in legal states are under directions to not enforce the federal marijuana laws, and instead defer to state laws where it's legal for personal use. They could enforce the federal law, but their boss (or someone up the chain of command) would have an aneurysm and the case would be dropped long before trial.

This says it's ""not authorized,"" but that's weird, because it's not specifically forbidden, either.   If I'm not mistaken, that's how it is in California (not illegal but not specifically permitted) except that the California Highway Patrol came out with some information about to do it safely, making it de facto legal. (Someone else who knows more about the situation in California, please correct me here if that's wrong).  Anyway, my experience with it has been that I don't lane-split, but I do filter (usually in the right-hand lane) at stop lights. It saves me a bunch of time, and I haven't had anyone get pissed at me or had any cops take exception to it so far (it's been about six months now)."

I decided on the bike because it was less than a used 600 out of the gate, and I knew i would have the startup costs of the shoei helmet i wanted along with insurance and registration.  0-50 mph is where it excels in my opinion, and have never doubted its acceleration to get past a vehicle or felt uncomfortable cruising around at these speeds.  I'm 5'6"" so i was also worried about the size and weight of the bike as a beginner.  I flat foot it easily and its something I got over quickly as I got more confident with riding in general.  I've had it at highway speeds and that's where i have to say it could be more stable, and that's where I don't feel as comfortable as I would like.  I'll be moving up in a year or two, but the way I see it I would rather start off on something less powerful and feel like I earned the more powerful bike down the line.    I drive a stickshift car and I've ridden friends dirtbikes quite a few times as a kid.  I'm confident I wouldn't have died if I started out on the 600, but i don't regret my decision."

Oh and an r6 weights 416lbs.  I think the misconception that 250's are alot lighter stems from the low seat height.  It just feels lighter because you have more leverage while sitting on the bike.
motorcycles,3drdu8,LucasSatie,2,Sun Jul 19 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"It may partially come from the usually slimmer rear tires too which I feel makes it a little more maneuverable, e.g. it's easier to flick it from side to side.

motorcycles,3drdu8,sdoMkciDyMkcuS,4,Sat Jul 18 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - also disagree but there is some wisdom in the notion  For many, a 250cc machine is a great fit.  Everything is a trade off and there are many benefits to low displacement.  They are often thought of as ""beginner bikes"" which is unfortunate because an experienced rider can have tons of fun extracting all of the performance they have to offer and a non-experienced rider can still seriously hurt themself.  High power output is disadvantageous in that it requires more attention from the rider to manage and the consequences of mismanagement are more severe. As a rider gains experience, managing power becomes more reflexive and therefore requires less attention but not none and the consequences of mismanagement don't disappear.  There are a great lot of things that demand attention while operating a motorcycle and a rider only has so much attention to give.  Lower power output effectively frees up attention to spend in other areas.  That said, sure you can start on a Hayabusa if you like and do just fine but it means that you'll have to spend more attention (and discipline) on throttle control (which means less to spend on other areas) and if you mess up at this then you may be more likely to get yourself into a situation that you don't yet have the skill to get yourself out of.  That F800GT makes just as much power as an EX250 until the rider tells it to make more."

motorcycles,3drdu8,bigjilm123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:35:13 2015 UTC,Try it out do whatever feels good for you. For me I'm forced to ride a 250 because no insurance company will insure a new rider like me with a bigger bike. But I feel at home with my 600r.

motorcycles,3drdu8,Roboman01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:05:53 2015 UTC,I think a big part of it was that I had ridden dirt bikes before. I can see why a 250 would be good for someone whos never had 2 wheels a motor and a clutch

motorcycles,3drdu8,AIM-9enema,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"You probably already know this, but a hyper sport inline 4 600 is a completely different beast compared to a twin.  If you doubt your self control, something like an R6 might be a bad choice.  I started on a 400 twin and it was perfect for a year and then a little too slow.  A 650 twin would have been a way better choice for me."
motorcycles,3drdu8,thrawn86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:43:54 2015 UTC,totally agree. I am definitely not confident enough at all for an inline 4 600. definitely want something a little more layed back
motorcycles,3drdu8,motosexuality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:04:25 2015 UTC,A ninja 650 or sv650 are good bikes that fill the gap. They have plenty of power enough to even power wheelie but they still have relatively manageable power for a beginner with dirt experience
motorcycles,3drdu8,motosexuality,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:03:16 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue for people with less experience/confidence making the transition to i4 600s is the peaky power curve, especially on older ones. New-ish i4s have EFI and have ECU maps that at least smooth out that massive power spike you'd normally see around 8500-9000 RPM. 600s that are '06ish or newer are a lot smoother than the older models (and even newer ones have traction control and all kinds of cool stuff to let you limit horsepower and change how the engine behaves).   A lot of people get 600s as their first bikes and they don't die, drop it, get in an accident, etc. I do think that starting on something with less horsepower tends to make you a better rider, especially if you learn how to extract the most performance out of what you've got instead of just wringing on the throttle and going fast in a straight line. I rode a ninja 250 in a group of 600s and 1000s until I got my zx-6r and was able to keep up with them just fine in twisties, though it was absolutely exhausting because I had to constantly upshift and downshift to stay in the power band so I wouldn't fall behind.   I think the EX500 is a great beginner bike, though a little dated (or really any twin in the ~500cc range - the CBR500R is a good new one). I personally don't like ninja 650s because I don't fit well on them for some reason and my legs just aren't in the right spot for me, as I found out while ferrying one back for my friend before he got his license, but my friend really likes his. SV650s are great too and have a little more torque than the ninja because they have a v-twin instead of a parallel twin.   There aren't many people I'd recommend a ninja 250 to unless you're grossly incompetent (in which case you probably shouldn't have a bike at all) or if you're learning power management and gear selection to make the most of your engine. I wish I could've kept mine in addition to my 600, though, because it's so much fun on twisty mountain roads."
motorcycles,3drdu8,GoGoGadgetBearAttack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:44:36 2015 UTC,"I started to ride 1.5 months ago. The first thing they put me on was some yamaha 700 cc motor. (fz-07 i think?).  Did i drop it? yup. plenty of times. Would i have dropped a smaller motor? yup. plenty of times.  After 9 hours i got my license and i got myself a 650cc sport/touring bike. I enjoy the crap out of it, and even tho it scares the shit out of me, u get used to it within the hour.  (P.S: I didn't even drive a bycicle before i started riding 1.5 months ago.)  Not sure why people keep hammering on starting with a 250/300cc. To me those bikes are just made for different purposes like city commute or smaller people. I sat on my friends CBR 125 a week ago and it's just laughable for a person my size, looks silly as hell (and not comfortable whatsoever).  It's kind of a running joke on this subreddit that 'you should start on a hayabusa' or 'you should start on an r1'. Tbh, act stupid on a 600cc or on a hayabusa, both are gunna get you killed. I wouldn't buy one myself. But offer me a GSXR 1000 right now and I wouldn't say no."

motorcycles,3drdu8,KILLjoy31313,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"disclaimer: I wish for more power on the highway all the time on my ninja 300 but not for safety reasons. I'm also 150lbs and I've stripped about 30 lbs off it from stock.  I do not feel unsafe at all, but I totally see the need for power to increase safety in some situations depending on the bike and rider.  I find it mildly amusing that a lot threads like this will be in favor of basically using throttle as a crutch instead of proper lane awareness and maneuvering skills, and other threads will have thousands of replies about how new riders shouldn't use ABS because its a crutch to avoid proper braking and avoidance kills."
motorcycles,3drdu8,MStockyy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely things like lane awareness and maneuvering come first. But sometimes it does come down to just hitting the throttle and getting out of there. And I feel much more comfortable knowing my bike can get out of their quickly. I'm also a significantly larger person(6'1, 230+ pounds) so it's going to take a little more power to pull me haha"

motorcycles,3drdu8,Kjata_,0,Sun Jul 19 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"Lol just say you want it for the power.  Nothing wrong with that.    An inline 4 will absolutely get you into more trouble than a 250... the situations where having so much power on tap actually helps are few and far between (and usually you have made a mistake to be in that situation).  Especially since the newer low CC bikes can easily do 90-100 mph no problem.  But an inline 4 will be begging you to go 40 mph over the speed limit every time you ride it.  I'm not saying don't get it.  I started on a big bike...  but don't lie to yourself about why you are getting it...  a ninja 300 has plenty of power for every day riding, and can be very quick off the line.  I accept the reason I'm reaching for my zx12 keys rather than my cb360 keys, and safety has nothing to do with it."
motorcycles,3drdu8,Kjata_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:30 2015 UTC,hahaha absolutely I want the power for more than the safety reasons. The safety part was just an observation I made riding
motorcycles,3drdu8,lgop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:43:06 2015 UTC,IMO People who have good motor skills and previous experience on a motorcycle shouldn't have a problem starting on a 600cc. Self control is my main issue. I ride a yamaha r6 and wonder sometimes if riding a smaller bike would enable me to take less risk. I plan on getting an Adventure style bike next because the super sport just isn't practical for street use. You have the power so you will use it. Ive never herd of anyone buying a 500Hp car and driving it 70mph tops. What ever bike you get just be safe and keep your head on straight!
motorcycles,3drdu8,NitRoSubZeRO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:58:24 2015 UTC,"I had about 3000 miles on a 50cc scooter before I bought a 250cc CBR. Why would I get a 250? Because it was cheap and I could afford it. That's it, and I make the best of it. I don't know where you're at or how old you are, so ride what you can afford.   $150 for full coverage insurance for a year is cheap. 6 bucks will fill the tank for 170 miles. It's great in that regard, if you want power get something bigger."

motorcycles,3drdu8,shorty1988m,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:25:05 2015 UTC,It all depends where you live. If your in a condensed city I'm sure it will be OK but 20-28 max HP is just so damn slow it hurts. I'd get a 500cc. Somthing that is at least 50hp. You have to remember you are not at max HP all the time so you have to look at torque and the use street power band as well. Don't get a 250.
motorcycles,3drdu8,happened,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:11:05 2015 UTC,"I started with an 865cc and just took it very gently for the first few months.  Worked out just fine.  Feels just right on the highway.  If you get a 500 or something, just start with city streets and stick to <45mph for the first month or two. As you get more used to it, take very short (<2 miles) on the highway a few times.  Kind of freaked me out the first few times I got on the highway.  Just don't exceed your abilities. Rule #1 in motorcycles, in my opinion."

I think I might've ridden it a couple of times in Dec. 5-6 times before it became way too cold / snowy icey.  I struggled a lot early on.  My friction zone was like at 97% all the way out.  Stalling over and over again.  I could never find that fucking friction zone..    Well come this Spring I took it out again after winterization and I practiced a lot.  Remember I didn't ride it a lot fresh out of the MSF and I picked it up pretty quickly.  I stall in traffic here and there once every blue moon but I'm happy I went with a 600CC.  I'm actually about to put the bike up on Craigslist because I want to upgrade to something more my style.  Looking to get a FZ09 or FZ07.    I think if you have that dirt biking experience, just go straight for the 600 or more.  If you're nervous or have doubts do what I did.  Buy a cheap 600 as a beatdown bike and just sell it later.  If I could learn off a 600 anybody could."
motorcycles,3drdu8,EatADick96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:57:15 2015 UTC,I think being comfortable with the clutch is a huge part of it. I could definitely see why someone whos never ridden on two wheels with a clutch could benefit from riding on a 250. And its funny the fz07 is the exact bike im looking at. Gotta try to find the funds for it first...
motorcycles,3drdu8,kbthatsme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not sure which one to get.  I can put a pretty decent down payment on either now so it's all a matter of someone just buying the bike I got now and then there's more money.  We'll see in time I guess.
motorcycles,3drdu8,EatADick96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. You don't need to restrict to a 250.  You have to consider that, as a new rider, your skills in turning and braking are not very far advanced. This can be a problem if you have a bike that accelerates quickly as you can speed around a problem only to realize that you have created and even worse problem. Also, if you haven't learned enough throttle control you can easily spin up the rear wheel exiting a turn.  If you have some restraint most people would probably agree that a 650 twin or the 800 you mentioned would be fine as a starter bike. Parallel twins general have predictive power curves. Its usually just the super sports and super bikes that people caution against because they add speed at an explosive rate when in the power band. They are wonderful bikes and I would definitely recommend you try one but put it on the list down the line.  If you are interested in track riding a 250 is actually an ideal bike as it will teach you to conserve momentum through the turn. Its much more difficult to learn track riding on a super bike.  A used bike is also important for the first bike. A 5-10 year old Japanese bike will be plenty reliable and allow you to learn the basics on a bike that you can resell later and not cry too much about when you drop it in the parking lot."

This is in the UK though where we go through a lot of hours of instruction so he knows how well I ride.  When I asked opinions pretty much all the people at the centre were recommending 600cc sport bikes as sports are the route I want to go down. At the minute I'm looking to buy my own first bike and I've been trying out everything in the 600 range and I don't feel nervous about them at all. Got my eyes on a triumph 675r.   Basically, advice is just that, advice. Why get a bike you don't necesarily want because someone told you to? Or why buy a bike you don't like the look or feel of just because it's a 250 and that's what you're 'supposed to do'?"

These bikes are not as simple as the standard jap bikes. Are you ready for increased maintenence and more expensive upkeep? It is significant with a 675r.

And if both your feet touch the ground, you need not worry much. And don't forget when a bike is moving, the weight of the bike doesn't play such a big factor as it would when standing still.  As for your confidence, that comes with experience, keep riding and you'll gain it!"

The contrast between the harsh flash on the ground in the foreground and the soft orange of the ground in the background isn't really doing it for me.  I also would have composed the first one slightly further over, so the whole bike is in the shot and it has some room to breathe. Just a touch though. I like the composition of the second one better, though I'm not fussed on the whole grass thing that's going on.  Few hot spots on both that I would have brought down in post, but if the flash power was cut, that'd sort that right out.  I assume you're shooting RAW and post processing yourself. What lens did you shoot this with? Maybe it's just this sample, bokeh looks a bit odd though."

First time really playing around with artificial light. These two were the best of about 40-something shots we took.  The first one unfortunately was the best exposed and lit, though not the best composed. Ended up using it. I'd much rather have the bike a little further in-frame. I wonder if I dodge the ground below the bike if it'll look better.  There were a couple of blown out whites (especially on the aluminum part of the gas tank), but there wasn't a whole lot I could do with the time and energy we had last night...   I am shooting RAW (always). This was shot on a Canon 6D and the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM. First one shot wide open, and the second at f/2.2. I wanted to play around with full-open on this lens in low-light as I had yet to do it (just got the STM version last week; was using my partner's 50mm II lens before that). If I stopped down to ~f/4 or something the bokeh should clear up a bit."

Stepped down to f2 is just sharp sharp sharp.   I'll have to pick my flashes up again and clean my bike. Get out and take some shots."

At least they are decently cheap  Edit: You can also look into these from Altrider but again you suffer the loss of right on the engine protection for more fairing protection.

I'm a former aircooled and watercooled VW guy (3 beetles, 1 bus, 1 cabriolet, 1 jetta) so I'm familiar with the pricing for vehicles I've wanted, but I'm new to motorcycles.  By the way, what is it about MSF that wears motorcycles so bad (beyond the obvious fact that they're used by a lot of people)?

motorcycles,3dry7u,DeadZeplin,2,Sun Jul 19 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"All i can think of is that it really just the amount of people running train on the bike.  Same thing with letting someone learn to drive manual on your brand new car, or buying a car from a former rental car fleet.   I would Personally fear that the clutch will be abused a lot by newbies, and the bikes are stored away in a storage container. Probably don't use the top of the shelf stuff in terms of maintenance. People drop them all the time (my MSF bike had broken signals held by duct tape and they still didn't work lol).  Either way, he's asking for a ludicrous amount, no matter how pretty it looks. $2000 can get you a fair bit. Experienced buyers know when to move on. No harm in sending a lower offer his way, but two grand is laughable IMHO."

motorcycles,3drs7a,southsun,2,Sat Jul 18 22:02:57 2015 UTC,I did it in Northern Virginia.  I used mass transit during snow.  My wife had a car for taking pets to the vet and other issues.    Good gear is important with winter weather.  I rode when it was 2 degrees out once.  By the time I got to the store (less than a mile) my hands were so cold I had trouble undoing my helmet straps.  It was beneficial for Christmas shopping.  I parked in the space where they had pushed all the snow.  I have since moved to the mountains in West Virginia.  I do not think that it would be reasonable to try moto only here.
motorcycles,3drs7a,Grass-NaturesLatrine,2,Sat Jul 18 22:09:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on the weather where you live. I ride year round, but we don't have snow. Gear is warm, it's made to keep you warm, so cold temps is no problem apart from your fingers getting a little numb in your gloves if it's cold enough. You can get mesh gear for the summer. I have a vented textile with a removable inner jacket that you can put in during winter. In summer it's hot when you're just standing around, but once you get riding it's fine.  Rain isn't really big to me, you get a little wet and dry off, gear is usually waterproof-ish, not perfect but you won't get off the bike soaking wet. As long as you take it slow in the rain and don't lock your shit up you'll be fine.  Riding year round is definitely doable, almost always enjoyable. Sometimes you need a car purely because you need to transport stuff, or people. Imo the joy of riding outweighs the practicality of a car, I bought my bike and I've never wanted a car.  If you do decide on a bike, just know that it isn't always cheaper than a car. Bikes are a niche market, accessories are expensive, gear is expensive, parts are mostly expensive, services can get expensive, and bikes require some more attention mechanically than cars. Also one bike is never enough, never..."

Weather gloves: http://www.cyclegear.com/BILT-Demon-Waterproof-Motorcycle-Gloves  Daily jacket is nice for the quilted vest and shoulder/elbow armor, the back padding is a joke though. During fall, I add a hoody underneath which does the work nicely.  The joe rocket gloves are not bad but not great, some of the threading is gone and the top covering layer has rips on it.

The lows are in the single digits and sometimes drop to the negatives but normally stay about 15-45 in the middle of winter, the highs are up to 110 with a normal summer day being 95-105.  The only days I don't ride is if I'm not going out that day, or if its hailing/snowing, or I'm taking someone else somewhere.   I wear pants, a light T-shirt with a long-sleeve denim shirt over it, gloves with the top halves of a pair of crew cut socks under them tucked into the denim shirt, and a full-face helmet with the visor cracked. The summer gear is mostly because I burn very easy and any sun exposer for +30 minutes means a sun burn. I've been told I almost give off light.   One thing you won't think about is that after the temp rises past ~100 the wind is no longer giving windchill, it is now convection and makes you hotter.   In the winter I normally wear denim pants with a pair of sweats under them (if going for a long ride I add a pair of pajama pants under the sweats), my normal gloves with 1-2 extra gloves as thermal layers (if long ride I use a much thicker mitten like glove, not as flexible but warmer), waterproof boots with 1-2 pairs of crew cut socks (waterproof blocks wind pretty well), T-shirt with 1-2 light jackets as thermal with 1 heavy coat over it all, most importantly I use a balaclava or facemask with a scarf built in that fits under my helmet and tucks into my coat. Cold necks/faces are the most painful thing. Side note: I do not own heated grips, if you can afford them I strongly recommend them.   With the above set up I have taken a 2.5 hour ride to my parents house with it raining for half the trip while it was about 55-60 outside and been fairly comfortable and not once feeling chilled.   Like I said the only times I don't ride my bike is if its snowing/hailing/heavy rain, or if there is someone with me, or if there is ice.  I otherwise ride completely all year. Its doable but it will take some getting used to.   If you have any other questions feel free to PM me."

Nothing wrong with it, other than more people in cars aren't expecting to see a motorcycle. Plus increased stopping distance due to rain."
motorcycles,3drs7a,arcticamt6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"Last year I was year round but then my work moved our office far away, nearly twice the distance and the traffic on that route has become just ridiculous, so i've been wussing out lately because of the 100ºF Degrees + 80% humidity. Sometimes A/C is nice. I'll probably wuss out during winter as well, but ill still try and ride more than i drive."

My brother spent $170 on one when he was in 6th grade. He gave it to me 2 years later and I used t for another 4 years. It has no rips or tears it's just a little dusty. All the zippers work and it has a lap top holster with a decently sized pouch. He bought another one that is the next size up that he's had for quite a while that's water proof and has room for a camel pack that he's giving me soon so if loo into Oakley bags.

motorcycles,3dq95w,JapanStan,55,Sat Jul 18 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"I NEVER pass if I don't have a super clear line of sight for oncoming traffic. If I go to overtake and get in a head on accident I WILL die.  Having said that..if the road is clear and there is high visibility,  I will consider a pass on double lines. Especially if the driver in front has moved towards the edge of the road to let me pass."
motorcycles,3dq95w,Nothing_Is_Strange,9,Sat Jul 18 11:51:52 2015 UTC,In VT unless otherwise stated you are allowed to pass in the double yellow. People seem to only do it in safe areas which is good. It really comes in handy during leaf peeping season.
motorcycles,3dq95w,brooksdy,2,Sat Jul 18 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"Also legal in Ontario, Canada."

I'm not anyone's mother here so I wont tell others how to ride but we recently had people get seriously injured and killed around here from a truck driver that tried to pass on a double yellow. He managed to hit multiple bikes and injure several riders killing one on their way back from a trip over the weekend.  It's just not worth the 45 seconds it may take to find a safe place to pass, for you or anyone else."

motorcycles,3dq95w,fake_tea,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. It is illegal to pass on double lines and they are there because that section of road has obviously met the 'guidelines' for requiring a double line.   Last time I broke this law I was sitting behind a car towing a caravan. He was driving up a hill 30km/h under the speed limit. I believe that I did so as safely as possible because,  like I said, if I am in a collision I WILL die.   I'm a pretty boring rider..my friend works in a hospital so I hear A LOT of horror stories."
motorcycles,3dq95w,Nothing_Is_Strange,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:39:00 2015 UTC,i know of plenty of roads with double yellows and with lots of visibility and space to pass the vehicle in front. For some reason New Jersey seems to have more of these.
motorcycles,3dq95w,Rotaryknight,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:30:21 2015 UTC,No.  They exist because when the road commission last did a study on it was 40 years ago and cars and bikes were much slower.  A dodge dart can make a quick pass on most sections of road.  A bike easily.
motorcycles,3dq95w,OreoGaborio,16,Sun Jul 19 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"In your example, car going 10 under the limit?  If I have a good line of sight, yeah I'm goin for it.  Side note: It's LEGAL to pass on the double yellows in Vermont.  However, by law, the passer is ruled automatically at fault if an accident occurs."
motorcycles,3dq95w,PermANewbie,14,Sat Jul 18 12:28:05 2015 UTC,"Vermont needs this, those curvy mountain roads can trap you for years behind some old guy in his beloved 1988 Subaru. On the plus side, I've only ever seen a slow driver pull over in VT.  In MN the penalty is crucifixion, IIRC, and generally around here, the double-yellow no-passing zones are smartly chosen.  Still, on a group ride, passing has happened and one time at Ludicrous Speed. (Never riding with them again.)  Final bit: when in farm country, remember that a combine is as wide as the road. So a bold pass can end in a way that non-farm states' residents might not grasp. (Yeah, please don't bother reminding me that Farmer John is required by law to take that huge thing off the front before going on the street. Every season I see one ""just hopping"" between fields and I'm telling you, there's no MSF training in the world for seeing a head-on approaching obstacle of that size with that combined closing speed.)"

Also, if you cross a double yellow and suddenly find yourself with oncoming traffic and still have a car to your right...don't just submit to a head on collision. Lane split. You can ride the line and let the oncoming traffic pass you to your left."

motorcycles,3dq95w,cloudstrife82,2,Sat Jul 18 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"In Ontario, its legal to pass on a double yellow, as long as there isn't a sign prohibiting it. The lines on the road are merely suggestions, and signage makes it legal. However you are 100% at fault if anything happens. Might also be something about prohibited within a certain distance of a curve and crest of a hill. Commercial driving course was a few years ago.  That being said, the bike passes so quickly, I do it."
motorcycles,3dq95w,horsespower,2,Sat Jul 18 14:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do, but only if I have a ton of sightline and I've been stuck for a long time, like 10minutes. On a fast bike you can be around a car in about 1 second flat. Passing zones are designed with the acceleration ability of your average car in mind, so there are a vast amount of places where a bike can safely pass a car despite double yellows.   That being said, it may be illegal where you live and a lot of people will be indignant that you would ""break the law"", despite it being tantamount really, to doing 5mph over the limit, or not coming to a complete dead stop at a stop sign. Furthermore if you're an idiot about it you're an asshole. Some people might think you're an asshole period and I can actually empathize, it's easy to say just don't do it, but when you're on a 1mi stretch of highway, with nobody coming, behind a minivan, on a super sport....   That exact scenario with a pickup doing 5 under resulted in the guy in his NASCAR hat and his ginormous wife following me to a gas station and yelling at me for 30 seconds  while I pumped gas about how I was going to kill somebody. I let him get it out of his system, then pointed to my ears and said ""sorry dude earplugs"" - at which point he went nuclear and I rode off. So you may not be popular for it."
motorcycles,3dq95w,Mercuryboarder,2,Sat Jul 18 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on conditions. In my area the lines are like strips of ice when it's chilly or wet out. If it's a double yellow because you're going to have to wring it out to make the pass, I'd rather just check out the scenery for a bit and pass when it's safer.   If it's a double yellow for no good reason and the conditions are good and blah blah blah then fly on by."
motorcycles,3dq95w,MizTaKes,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"If its at least a quarter mile of visibility, I am personally ok with it.  Otherwise, I would rather not take my chances."
motorcycles,3dq95w,PulaskiAtNight,2,Sat Jul 18 17:33:53 2015 UTC,They break the double yellow lines in places where CARS will have enough space and line of sight to pass. It's just completely stupid and arbitrary to follow them as strict rules on motorcycles. Just make sure there isn't a cop behind you and be on your way.
motorcycles,3dq95w,gibuthegreat,4,Sat Jul 18 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"Whether riding or driving I'll usually just back off and try not to suffer.  Reckless tickets in Virginia can get pretty annoying so I don't think it's worth the risk, even if I've got a clear line of sight for oncoming vehicles."
motorcycles,3dq95w,CrayolaS7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:43:15 2015 UTC,"Occasionally if I have clear lines of sight but not for 10 kays under, it'd have to be someone going way under the limit to justify breaking the rules for me. Much more common is I overtake in places where it's virtually never done by cars, e.g. regular two-lane roads within city limits. They have dashed lines but you'd basically never see a car do it because they're generally too short for one car to overtake another."
motorcycles,3dq95w,Velocicrappper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"I really try not to, but I have done it and will probably do it again.  Sometimes people are just holding things up and it's safer for everyone if I'm not behind them anymore.  I usually will not pass if they are doing anywhere around the speed limit, and I won't tailgate either. They need to be driving considerably under the speed limit and/or driving erratically.   I don't like passing on a DY because it's one of the things that makes non-riders really hate motorcyclists.  We are ambassadors for the hobby/sport and should remember that anything and everything we do reflects on everyone else riding out there.      I won't do it if I don't have a great sight-line, and I'm not fairly certain the vehicle I'm about to pass won't try something stupid like running me off the road or initiating chase.  You can sort of read people like that...sad that we have to think about such things.  Also, I move as far into the oncoming lane as possible so I'm not buzzing their side view mirror, I get by quickly, then don't return to the correct lane until I have put a very safe distance between us.  Even as a rider, I get pissed when motorcyclists buzz my door during a pass, then cut right in front of me.  That's riding like an asshole and all it does is make people hate us."

I'd rather go 30 on the straights so I will always pass the slow cars there when safe. (Alpine loop/squaw peak Utah)"
motorcycles,3dq95w,C------,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's a safety thing, which for me is more important than the law so I pass.  Why: if they're doing 10 under they probably aren't paying attention. I automatically keep a good distance from people on autopilot. Secondly, they're the anvil and it takes one more autopilot cager to be the hammer and then you're a fucked sandwich.   My friends dad was in a traffic backup waiting on some road work. long straight road, perfect visibility, 2 lanes. Someone rear ended him at 60 mph in a 50mph zone at a full stop. That is the level that people aren't paying attention right now."

motorcycles,3dq95w,SophisticatedVagrant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"Is it actually illegal? In Canada (where I grew up) it is an indication of ""unsafe to pass"" but passing on the double lines itself is not technically illegal. You could still get nailed for ""reckless"" or ""unsafe"" driving, if you did or caused something reckless or unsafe to happen. Here in Germany, it is the same thing (though it is just solid line vs. double), and there needs to specifically be a sign which says passing is illegal. Even then, I will still often pass if I feel I can safely do so. The acceleration of a 900cc bike vs. a 1.2L Opel Corsa is a bit quicker than the intended ""car vs. car"" which is taken into account with the lines and signs."

No, I am just trying to guess at the condition of a few bikes based on pictures and vague descriptions of what the sellers CLAIM is wrong (or right) with them. Sellers have a vested interest in minimizing potential problems, to make it look like a relatively easy fix. Unless the bike runs good and is obviously in good shape, it's a judgement call. Having little experience with bikes, you are in the worst possible position to judge for yourself. The best advice I can give you is to enlist the help of a knowledgeable person who is not interested in owning the bike to give you an honest appraisal of the bikes you are looking at. Not by looking at the Craigslist ads alone but by inspecting them in person and asking the seller the correct questions. Otherwise you might as well just keep saving up your money until you can buy a reasonably good condition used bike. I realize your objective may be primarily to learn how to work on bikes, and that's a good thing. But you have to be prepared to find that the project bike you buy is a project from hell with a lot more wrong with it than you thought. It's part of the learning process."

motorcycles,3dou4w,socks86,4,Sat Jul 18 03:45:48 2015 UTC,"By researching a bit you can determine which ones are quality and well constructed with features that work.  If you want good protection look for gauntlet gloves with good quality leather and stitching, and palm sliders/scaphoid protection.  Knox gloves are actually quite good. If you are worried about the handroids cutting your hand you could get the knox biomechs instead. Almost the same without the unnecessary junk on the top side.  The most important feature of those gloves is the knox SPS (scaphoid protection system) which is a pair of puck like sliders on the palms. They actually do work, I've crash tested them myself. Very important and I wont wear gloves without them.  Similar gloves are the RS-Taichi GP-Evo (same SPS sliders, incredibly comfortable gloves.) and Heroic racing gloves, and to a lesser extent some of the Held models."

Good, thick leather gauntlet gloves, with some sort of knuckle reinforcement (kevlar/CF encased in plastic) seems to work well."

This is the best I can come up with:  I've been through depression for years. I've had a couple suicidal episodes, panic attacks, etc. When I first got my bike and my friends asked why, I jokingly told them, ""well, I already want to kill myself, so why not? It'll be a fun way to go!"" With that you might think I just have a case of reckless abandon, fuck-it-all, and squid it up. However, these past couple weeks I've been incredibly diligent about what gear I buy, and every time I ride I'm cautious and careful as hell. Riding reminds me that I DONT want to die. It's been an incredibly therapeutic obsession. When I'm out there, my life's problems no longer bother me. It becomes about me, my bike, and not dying. How will I approach this intersection? Is this guy turning left? Can this truck see me? And then... man, those long stretches of roads. I know it's meager, but these last 250+ miles have been liberating.   That... and 60+ mpg.

Six years later, at the age of 25, I'm currently on a leave of absence from my job. Since I have nothing else to do, I decided to take him up on it, not expecting much.

For me, it's the feeling of absolute freedom.  You can do whatever you want, in a way - there are certain limits of course. There are rules and laws. But I like to think that I can bend them slightly and set my own sensibility as the limit.  If you drive with the right mindset, with the idea that you mustn't harm or endanger others, that you must expect everything and adjust accordingly, you are free. At that point, it's only your own basic instincts limiting you.  Part of that mindset should probably be not wanting to die yourself, but... that's everybody's own decision.

The feeling of i am in the moment who i always wanted to be, and feeling alive whilst all other moment generally lead me to feel as if Im only partially in. Kinda there.   The closeness to my friends who ride..the closeness to absolute strangers. The smell of gas on my clothes and dirt in my face.   It lets me know I'm here.   SN. I went for a slide last week at highway speeds. Fully geared up but it still ate through my pants and got first layer of epidermis. You never know how much you love something till it hurts you. I immediately started going through everymoment of the ride (left work furious and wasnt being 100% in the moment as i said earlier) and it bit me within a mile of getting on my bike.  Point is, you never know how much you love something till it hurts you. I came out of a slide that was closer to 100 than 0 Mph and i can't wait to get back on my bike so i can practice and live the skills and decisions that will make me a better rider.

motorcycles,3dpgnh,Challenge_Considered,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:54 2015 UTC,Tips?   Riding boots.
motorcycles,3dpgnh,ElwoodPlantagenet,3,Sat Jul 18 20:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well your elbows appear locked which makes the bike rider system react very sluggishly as the natural act of counter steering is counteracted by the weight of your other arm/body. Sport bikes with low bars are designed that way to get weight low and get the rider out of the air stream. The downside to this in daily riding/cruising is that there is a strong temptation to support ones weight with the bars. While ok on straight stretches you absolutely have to pickup your weight with your lower back, bend your elbows, and get your weight lower when cornering with any sort of authority. It's the single biggest thing separating someone from riding a sport bike safely and quickly from dangerously and poorly.  Also those hiking boots will have really thick soles, throwing of feel and the rider triangle. They also will offer little more protection than a sneaker, so there's no upside. If you want a lightweight riding shoe you're better off with something designed for riding with solid soles and some kind of ankle reinforcement.  As for the photography - no clue mate!"
motorcycles,3dpgnh,chriszens,2,Sat Jul 18 16:02:54 2015 UTC,"While I respect you being an ATTGATT representative, and appreciate you presumably looking out for me and caring about my safety, I am 100% aware of my clothing and protection situation. The jacket is slightly large on me, and my arms aren't locked. I don't support my weight with my arms, because my wrists hurt when I do. If you're not familiar with the VFR, it isn't a full on sport bike, but it a sport touring motorcycle. The riding position is much more upright than a racing replica bike, and it was created that way. On to the boots- I acknowledge they aren't the best. However, these specific ones are summer hiking boots, with good ankle support, and very pliable soles, created to give the feel of the ground. I usually ride in my winter boots, which are triple stitched, heavy gauge leather and are significantly better than sneakers. I simply can't afford real boots with hard protection at this time."

I have some Alpinestar riding shoes I use for just cruising and they cost like $70. Better than the snow boots!  And the posture thing was more me being a smart ass about ""tips"".

Supporting your upper body by squeezing the tank with your knees is helpful on any upright bike. When on the brakes on your bike, supporting your weight with your legs and keeping your hands neutral on the bars will increase stability, also. Amazing habit to get into no matter what type of riding one does. Also good on ya for asking for advice to improve. Hopefully others will learn something from your questions, also."

motorcycles,3dpgnh,theundaunted617,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"There is some motion blur. While this is somewhat wanted to make it look like the wheels are moving, and the blurred background, the shutter speed was still too low. ISO and shutter speed need to me tuned up a little. Also, a low F/stop will help achieve the blur look without losing focus. The angle currently is a good angle, but the photo was taken has part of the wheel cutout. This isn't even a rule of thirds problem, but more of an keep the bike in the frame.   The photographer will have to find less awkward position to take photos. That way the side view mirrors aren't in the frame. I use a minivan and open the side door if I want good pictures."

motorcycles,3dpgnh,butsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"The bike is blurred because the aperture is set a couple stops low. you can't compensate focus with shutter speed, they're independent. shutter speed only fixes motion blurring, but since the rider's arms are in focus the focus itself and the shutter speed are fine."

Look at the ghosting of the Honda logo, Alpinestars logo, license plate, and tail light. If it was the aperture only, things would be OOF, but not ghosting.  It is a combination of problems, but saying it is only the aperture is incorrect.

Increase the shutter speed, adjust the DOF (aperture) until the whole bike is sharp, pan the camera/sync up the speed of the chase car to the bike so that the background blurs but the bike doesn't, maybe jump in the back seat to avoid that mirror. Done."
motorcycles,3dpgnh,sdoMkciDyMkcuS,0,Sat Jul 18 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"A slightly faster shutter speed would help, yes.  But if you want to get the whole bike in focus, you need to used a higher f-stop.   Both of these factors require an increase in exposure, so you cannot compensate one with the other."
motorcycles,3dpgnh,iruleyoutrout,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"From their first comment:   Increase the shutter speed, increase the DOF   DOF is depth of field. To increase the depth of field you decrease the aperture (higher number, smaller hole)."
motorcycles,3dpgnh,sdoMkciDyMkcuS,0,Sat Jul 18 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the photography 101, buddy.   If you increase your shutter speed, your image gets darker.  If you use a larger f-stop, the hole gets smaller, your image gets darker.   If you want more in focus and a faster shutter speed, you clearly cannot compensate for it without upping your ISO."

motorcycles,3dtxkf,thesteelerfan18,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:26 2015 UTC,Just make sure you're not accelerating while increasing lean angle.  Trailbrake or keep a steady throttle going into a turn.
motorcycles,3dtxkf,oldassnoob,2,Sun Jul 19 13:53:07 2015 UTC,trailbraking is using the (usually the front) brake lightly as you enter a turn to control entry speed. It helps to keep some load on the front suspension to increase your cornering stability.
motorcycles,3dtxkf,thesteelerfan18,2,Sun Jul 19 14:04:42 2015 UTC,"as oldassnoob was saying trailbraking is trailing off the front brake as you lean the bike.  On modern sportbikes going around a track there's almost no use for the rear brake, all braking is done by the front brake.  So your braking 100% while upright, and as you lean the bike over you gently let off the brake and that is trailbraking.  I recommend only trailbraking to maybe 20 degrees lean angle until you get to a track or parking lot and practice it.  With slicks on you'll see the pros trailbrake all the way to max lean angle.  Obviously mere mortals like us won't be doing that, but remember it's always better to trail off the brakes in order to keep the chassis stable and the suspension in the sweet spot.  As to why you don't want to accelerate while increasing lean angle, it's because your taking weight off your front tire as your entering a turn.  This will make the turn in slower and you're decreasing your front tire contact patch.  Ideally you want to setup your body positioning before the turn, start braking, simultaneously lean in and let off the front brake until you reach max lean angle, crack the throttle open and slowly roll on the power, pick up the bike by pushing on the outside handlebar and start rolling on more aggressively as you decrease lean angle, at the last 20 degrees of lean angle pull on the inside handlebar to pick the bike up the fastest.  Oh and lastly don't take my word for any of this, do your own research!  Motorcycle techniques have changed drastically and lots of pro riders have different opinions on the fastest way to get round a corner.  Pick which one you think is best and give it a go!"

motorcycles,3drv8q,Nutritious_breakfast,3,Sat Jul 18 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"Learn the fundamentals (non-abs) and when you have that down, learn to appreciate ABS on the next bike. Don't rely on ABS so down the road if/when you have to ride a bike without ABS, you don't panic yourself into a frenzy at the first quick stop, never mind the emergency stop.  Buy used, sell used, recuperate a larger percentage of your initial investment back."
motorcycles,3drv8q,mmmmaaarrk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:37:46 2015 UTC,It's up to you to weigh how much you want the ABS.   Try widening your search radius. They're out there.
motorcycles,3drv8q,PLD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm applauding you for asking this question. My vote is ""both"" and to reiterate /u/PLD's statement to widen your search radius.  That means not only distance and price, but bike and condition. (I saw a Honda CB300 with ABS and road rash on CycleTrader earlier today.) An ugly first bike is a luxury, you get to improve it. ""Ugly"" doesn't mean battle damage, it means ""not the love of your life.""  So loosen up your criteria a bit, list your ergonomic requirements, especially minimums, and look for candidate bikes. Yep, the market is hot right now, so prices are up, but so are sales volumes. You'll succeed.   PS: ABS brakes are good all the time, to all riders, in all conditions.  Will I walk home if my ABS fails it's startup test? Yep."
motorcycles,3drv8q,PermANewbie,2,Sun Jul 19 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"OP, many people that are replying are quite myopic. If the extra cost of ABS and proper gear is not a tax on your finances then seriously consider it. You may drop your bike but repairing a bike is the cheap part. If ABS saves you from going down once at speed the added cost of ABS will pay dividends in what it has prevented. Medical costs and loss of wages due to injury are the real costs when you go down. Please consider yourself when you are making these decisions not just the bike.   PS I feel ABS should be required on all road going bikes to help with all this myopia."
motorcycles,3drv8q,P0RTILLA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get the slamming of even basic technology on a bike.  Would you buy a car today without ABS?  Probably not.  The technology available today makes riding better, not worse.  If it saves your ass, fuckin' buy it.  It's like listening to people saying the world is flat."
motorcycles,3drv8q,Apapabo,0,Sun Jul 19 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"Can you afford a new bike and any repairs it may (or may not, not everyone drops their bike) need, and money you will loose on the resale value? If the answer is yes then get the new bike with ABS, if the answer is no get the used bike.  Personally I think ABS is a great thing to have, but as long as you practice your braking in a variety of conditions it isn't necessary. If you are really on the fence about what to do I would recommend getting a used bike without ABS and just learn to brake properly, I've never owned a bike with ABS and I haven't been down in 5 years of all weather riding."

motorcycles,3drv8q,P0RTILLA,4,Sun Jul 19 00:37:53 2015 UTC,This advice is false. Some sand or dry leaves in the roadway way can trigger a lockup. In fact I have encountered this much more than during wet weather where I increased following distance and rode much more timidly.

I'm not saying that's what's happened in this situation but it is an issue in some cases. A scientific test equipment company I worked for was having a issue with companies in China making exact duplicate of the equipment we made and selling it with different branding and sometimes our branding. Hell I worked for a radio repair shop before that who had a customer that wanted a kenwood radio but didn't want to pay kenwood radio prices so the they sourced manufacturing in China to knock off the kenwood. The China radio was ugly and cheaply made but it fit inside the kenwood housing and when one broke it was cheep enough to buy a new one instead of having us fix it."

Dunno how much experience you have with doing your own maintenance, but if you plan on it I'd go Shadow or Harley. I've been trying to help my buddy with some routine maintenance on his '94 Magna, and it's a pain in the ass.   Shadows are awesome. They're all over the place and as such they're easy to find parts for. Also sounds like you're going to want something around 1200+ cc.  Also, Harley's aren't that expensive if you're buying used. You can get a nice bike for a decent price if you do enough shopping.   I'd say an average motorcycle will get 40-60 mpg depending on how you drive it / highways, etc., so if you're gonna be taking it on long trips, you'd probably wanna go 4.5 gallon tank or so.

I know In Australia if you're in even a mild collision that you're not at fault for and keep driving you can be charged. It was pretty obviously a dumb ass mistake instead of attempted murder on behalf of the passenger but the rider might have assumed it was.

motorcycles,3drk62,apathetic-irony,3,Sat Jul 18 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm going to offer what I can.  1) Was definitely neglected at one point, the fuel residue leaking down the side of the engine is a sure sign. Unless this thing fires up perfectly (with a touch of choke) when cold, negotiate $200-500 off the asking, depending on how much time you want to spend working on carburetors. Tires appear to be vintage, and need replacing, $2-300 additional. Has a silly headlight, with integrated turn signals. New shocks. I didn't see a listed price on this, but $800 would be a good starting point, imo. This is the only bike of the 3 I would buy, assuming the maintenance listed can be verified. edit: the kickstart spring is probably broken, and would require going into the engine cases to repair. Not a small job, but not likely to cause further issues as is. Maybe reduce offer based on this as well.  2) Tires could be newer, but tough to say. Engine looks filthy, but could be the angle/lighting. If it's corrosion, I'd avoid this one, expect to extract screws to do anything to the engine. Has a replacement seat cover, so I guess that is a bonus. Way too much money, I'd start at $500, and I'm nervous about that much.  3) $2300 with a cracked tire? Out of his mind. A bunch of poorly chosen ""mods"" on this one, pod filters are difficult to tune properly, no front fender, home made seat, no thanks.   Adding more:  Pod filters are truly a pain to sort out on these, I'd recommend the factory air boxes only. The carburetors in these do not respond well to anything else without significant modification. On dotheton.com, a user by the name of crazypj is probably the world's foremost on carburetion on the CB360, and sells his services in making them run well with pod filters. Unless you want to send them to him, I would avoid anything without factory airboxes.   There is no oil filter, only a screen. You should clean this screen at least once in a while, and the process is somewhat involved. Most services skip this, and it's tough to verify unless you open the side case and check it.  Listen for a lot of noise in the valvetrain when the bike is running. If it sounds like a clattering diesel, the cam chain could be loose. I would not buy one that sounded like this.  Save a copy of the manual, even if you don't intend to do a lot of maintenance, there are many things that you will want to verify and check."
motorcycles,3drk62,shinysidemoto,2,Sat Jul 18 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the quick reply!  For the second bike, here is a different angle of the bike: http://i.imgur.com/4clnxAB.png  The '75 is listed at $1450 and the '76 is listed at $1400. For the third bike, I would not pay above the other two so it really depends on how much they are willing to come down. But it seems like it appears to be a really bad bike anyway?"
motorcycles,3drk62,shinysidemoto,2,Sat Jul 18 20:07:51 2015 UTC,"The second bike looks much cleaner from this angle, I'm less nervous about it. Check the tires for fine cracking (dry rot), and adjust offer by $2-300 if you find any.   The orange bike is overpriced. You can always come up from your offer, but if you start near their ask, there's nowhere for you to go. I would still start at $800 or a bit less.   The 3rd bike isn't ""bad"", but there are a lot of tasteless things done to it. If maintenance checks out and you like it as is, you can offer for it, but you could buy either of the other bikes and get the same look for at least $500 less, even paying the asking price of the cheaper two. Cracked tires are bad news. Tires are brakes are sacred."
motorcycles,3drk62,shinysidemoto,2,Sat Jul 18 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"Going off of your analysis, I think I'm going to look more into the '76 bike.

And do you think his labeling of it as a wrench turner is something to be cautious about or is it a given for these bikes?"
motorcycles,3drk62,authentic010,2,Sat Jul 18 20:43:44 2015 UTC,"$1200 is ok. I'd still start much lower. Tires are pretty easy to replace/have replaced. Just adjust the price accordingly and don't put off replacing them. Anything this old that isn't fully restored is going to require regular maintenance. The manual I linked covers just about everything that could go wrong with it though. Expect to tinker with it pretty regularly though.   When you go check any of these out, try to listen to the bike start from cold, engine cool to the touch. Choke is probably required, but shouldn't be needed for more than about a minute. Idle should be steady near 1200rpm. Engine should rev quickly and return to idle if you snap the throttle back.   edit: if bike 2 isn't really well sorted, I'd beat down the price on bike 1. Recent maintenance could save you a bunch of time and a bit of money."
motorcycles,3drk62,authentic010,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"Head on over to /r/hondacb and ask them as well, they are the best place to ask. You will get a few reply so from some old Honda mechanics we have over there. Also so you know to keep these old bikes running properly you have to do regular maintenance on them. You can pay a mechanic but it will cost you a good amount, but you can easily do it yourself. These bikes are pretty simple and great starter bikes for learning maintenance on a bike. You will have Regular things like checking the points, valve adjustments, oil changes, timing and very very important the cam chain tensioner. Going off what shinysidemoto said is pretty spot on. The blue one I would skip.  the pod filters are so hard on see bikes to tune correctly. Stock filters are the way to go. Most of the bikes you could talk down."

I don't think you quite understand that it's a bit more complicated than you think. Not all modern cars have great sound insulation. Many cheaper models don't. Also, when traffic is gridlocked, and the rider is filtering through, it is much easier to hear outside sound, to include pipes. Yes, not EVERYONE will notice your louder pipes, but some will, some is better than none. Any degree of added visibility is a win."

Youre leaving the largest portion of the sound behind you as you travel forward. Do you hear emergency vehicle sirens very well once its past you? No, you dont. Its no different than mufflers pushing sound behind you.   This right here shows that you have absolutely no idea how sound waves work. You will never outrun your own sound on a motorcycle. Sound travels over 700 MPH at sea level. Yes, most pipes face to the side/rear, but that does not mean the sound is not also projected to the front. Sound is not linear like that. Don't believe me? Have someone start your bike and stand 50 or so feet in front of it. Have them rev the engine. You will hear it. This is not to say that the shape and orientation of the pipe have no influence at all, but I assure you, a respectable amount of sound DOES indeed travel forward. Emergency sirens around here can be heard very well from all directions. Not sure if Los Angeles uses some superior form of siren or something, but either way, its not very relevant.   Think what you want, ""loud pipes saves lives"" is bullshit. You just want loud pipes. And whats wrong with that? Why do people need silly justifications, like safety, because they want a loud exhaust?   Exhausts can be heard from the front, even if it is to a lesser degree. A louder exhaust will be heard from a greater distance than a quiet exhaust. That right there is not bullshit. Here in Los Angeles the weather is great and many people drive with their windows down year round. Traffic here is also some of the worst in the world, so wind noise in many situations is almost non-existent due to the slow speeds at which cars are moving. In these situations (my own, and many others' commute home from work everyday), louder pipes are a HUGE advantage to me as I split the gridlock at around 30-40 MPH. Even if only 10% more people hear me coming, that's a pretty respectable difference, and is certainly not bullshit. This is just a single situation, there are many more in which they are useful."

The Yoshi pipe itself does very little over a straight pipe, except remove some of the raspy sound you would get without a resonator of any type. Before I added the secondary straight through muffler under the car, it was incredibly loud, and I like loud exhausts.  It's probably pretty similar to the louder bike exhausts on the market. On a motorcycle this would mostly only have application on a turbo setup, or a bike build meant to anger people (which is acceptable :D). I imagine most people would be happy just cutting down their pipe to be shorter, and leaving the stock baffle in."

Don't try and smooth out your take-off with the throttle, instead smooth it out with the clutch.  Keep a steady throttle hand and work that clutch lever.  SMALL corrections, not big ones.  For downshifting, same thing.  It's all about using the friction zone to your advantage.  EEEASE it all the way out slowly.  For swerving, it's all about ASSERTIVE countersteering.  Keep your body upright and SHOVE that handlebar away from you.   Don't be afraid to give those handlebars a strong push while at the same time having a nice, light grip.  Keep at it.  The kinda stuff you're doing takes a lot of practice in order to develop the fine muscle movements required to do them smoothly."
motorcycles,3dr4q8,OreoGaborio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm pretty sure friction zones aren't typically as far out as they were on the bike that I was riding.

But one thing i will tell you that will help A LOT is 1: keep your chin and head UP. and 2: turn your head in the direction you want to go..  i mean REALLY turn it..  almost too far.. you will be amazed at how that helps turns and swerves.
motorcycles,3dr4q8,Flinx98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"1 and 2 are both about practise, NOBODY gets throttle/clutch control the first day. Small throttle adjustments with clutch control, find that friction zone and use it, in time it will become instinctive when taking off and downshifting (REALLY but it takes practise lots of practise.  3: Don't speed up or decelerate instead countersteer is key here and you don't have to lean to countersteer but it helps. Again practise practise and practise some more until it becomes muscle memory and you do it without even thinking.  So 1, 2 and 3 are all about control that nobody with zero experience gets the first day, that is why there is an instructor there and why you are going to class.  BTW here is good thread to read on countersteering, click the link in comments it leads to a good but long video.  Edit for typos and wow I really need to reread before hitting save"
motorcycles,3dr4q8,Ogow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"If your MSF is anything like mine was, there's usually points where the whole flow is stopped waiting for someone who either stalled out or did something incorrectly and is being instructed.  During these times don't just throw it in neutral and relax.  Play around with the friction zone, release until the bike starts to pull a bit, squeeze closed, rinse, repeat.  Get to know that friction zone intimately.  It seemed like I was the only person sitting there messing with the friction zone during down moments where we weren't instructed to have the bike off or in neutral."
motorcycles,3dr4q8,Cornholioh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:31:53 2015 UTC,I just took my first day too! I had a problem with twisting the throttle when I would break. It helps a lot if you just focus on reallly feathering the throttle. And remember even at those low speeds you can lean pretty far.
motorcycles,3dr4q8,TheMuffinMan2035,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"Just like you use friction zone to smoothly take off from a stop, you still need to use some friction zone to downshift from 2nd to 1st. I rarely downshift from 2nd to 1st so it took me longer to do smoothly (usually if I have to slow down that much it's because I'm going to stop anyways or I just pass the person making me go slow). The higher up in gears you go the less friction zone you need to worry about to do it smoothly, the opposite applies for downshifting. I have years of driving manual gear boxes so the mechanics of the clutching system transferred over."

This bike is or is close to the bike you will love. Don't buy it right now, get a Suzuki S40 (or similar lightweight cruiser) and then ride the shit out of it.  Flog that thing until it's a hollow shell. (Riding a slow bike fast is not only a huge skill library, it's hard and it's fun.) Then, when it's leaking oil, and pieces are falling off, dump it and buy the dream bike.  And then, with all those hard won skills, you will mount that big monster and tame it. And trust me, you'll make the same sounds as Homer does when he gets the giant donut, and you'll rme ever this moment as the best thing you ever did: wait for the big one."

I believe the oem of this product is named Akarai.  From my experience, don't waist your time. The ribbon cable connecting the visor insert to the external control breaks very quickly. It also takes forever to charge, only has 1 tint option that is not adequate for direct sunlight, and does not go completely clear.

motorcycles,3drcdz,needitall,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess I'd say it's a electric problem. Charge/check the battery and see if your bike starts, clean the terminals and cables. If it does start put a multimeter on the battery terminals, rev to about 3k from idle and see if there is a voltage jump or drop, jump is good and drop is bad. If there is a drop and it continues to drop first thing I would check is the stator and voltage rectifier.   I'm not a bike mechanic but have worked on a few over the years. If you don't know how to use a multimeter to do these checks then goto a friend that does or a good mechanic."
motorcycles,3drcdz,Flinx98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:56:10 2015 UTC,At idle the battery read 13.9 volts and when I rev it reads 13.3 - 13.5 volts.
motorcycles,3drcdz,cat_on_tree,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"Normally, it should read more at higher rpm than at idle/off.  This may indicate a failure of the charging system.

motorcycles,3drcdz,Flinx98,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:05:03 2015 UTC,"3k is low but I have no idea what bike he has, some redline fairly low so I figured 3k to be a safe rather then 4.5k to 6k that I thought about at first.

motorcycles,3dq1ja,relentlesslyawesome,3,Sat Jul 18 09:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'm running a PR4 on the front and a PR2 on the rear.  The rear will be getting a PR4 whenever the 2 wears out.  The 2 has lasted about 8,000 miles so far and it still has a long ways to go before I call it worn out.  I have about 2,000 miles with the 4 and 2 combination.  They do awesome in the rain and has more grip than my skills allow.  I think it will get even better when the rear eventually gets a 4.  The Pilot Roads are awesome tires.  I think you'll be happy with them."

motorcycles,3dq1ja,BossMaverick,2,Sat Jul 18 10:06:22 2015 UTC,"They really are a great tire.  I just went on a multi-state trip and I was expecting to have to replace the PR2 rear when I got back.  To my surprise, it hardly wore at all.  I'd probably have to make the same trip two more times to have it worn enough so I could justify replacing it for a PR4.  The PR4 front has no visible wear from the trip.  The trip included rain, puddles, gravel roads, and crosswinds.  The tires gave me no issues at all."
motorcycles,3dq1ja,malistryx,4,Sat Jul 18 10:33:16 2015 UTC,"Love 'em. My partner and I have slowly converted our entire (very spirited) riding group over to the church of Pilot Roads. Long life, wonderful behaviour in adverse conditions, and compliant with a wee bit of hooning."
motorcycles,3dq1ja,thesteelerfan18,4,Sat Jul 18 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"Just got through my first set of pr4's and I had previously ridden with the pr3's on my sv650sf.  Unfortunately the pilot road series has a problem with cupping in the front tire and because of that I think when I'll be switching to the pirelli angel gt's.  From what I understand it's due to extreme load while hard breaking which I like to do during spirited riding.  Also I now notice a ""wavy"" feeling while hard breaking which isn't really that big of a deal but it's not ideal.  On to the good points: it warms up extremely fast, faster than the pr3's and you'll quickly notice that in the winter.  I've literally ridden these things over ice at 7F (walking pace) and then proceeded down the road.  To test the tires grip I would ease on the rear brake, and at first the tire would slip, but then a block away I would apply the same pressure and there'd be no sliding.  This translates into excellent grip during the first 50F days of the spring where you can start having fun, gravel permitting.  Unfortunately I don't have an exact figure on miles.  My rear lasted approx. 9k miles and the front last a few thousand more than that at about 12k.  These figures were both about 1 thousand miles longer than the pr3's.    Wet weather grip is great, but I'm not pushing the tires in the wet so I can't tell you exactly how great.  I do notice it displaces a crazy amount of water to the point that my dad who was riding behind me pointed out that it's like riding behind a jetski.  dry grip is good but if I'm being honest I wish it had better grip on the sides.  I've been to the edge of my rear tire and not on my front and felt the rear slip slightly a few times which leads me to believe that I'm reaching the limits of traction.  Still though I'm playing with tire pressures and my own skills to see how far I can push these things.  I'm fully confident that no one could ever really hate these tires grip, but rather just want a little more.  Hope this little review helps!  Good luck!"
motorcycles,3dq1ja,Vo0Do0972,3,Sat Jul 18 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"Pr3 front pr4 rear.  Insane mileage, great grip in dry, great (obviously still less) grip in the wet, including sitting water in heavy rain."

They were an amazing tire, I'm waiting until my tires on my Hyper are about to go and I will replace them with PR4's.

Mountains are a bit different and I have been wanting to get back into that, but I'm over the honeymoon faze of needing to ride 24/7.  Riding to work is definitely better than driving, but with my short commute it actually takes me longer with gearing up and down. That and it's a straight road the whole way, nowhere I'd feel comfortable parking it, etc.   Everyone is different and to each their own."

I can buy a helmet that probably protects my brain better for far less money, I've never had a problem with GPS through the headphones, watching your mirrors should be instinct, and merging into a car is like the lowest possible chance problem anybody could ever have.    Honestly it is a total waste of money, none of these features prevent the most common types of motorcycle crashes besides being rear ended, but there are so many questions.  Is the HUD always active, how sensitive is the vibration, has it been stress-tested on the streets yet, what is the protection level?

If it is supposed to pair with the phone for GPS, calls and stuff, why not linking all that to the phone, why is additional (and very expensive) module is built in to double the functionality?  You'll never need all those rear-view technologies riding two-up, which is quite common (except the situation when your GF has really outstanding boobs, but this will distract you from driving safely). Guys who are aimed for speed try to reduce weight everywhere they can so a 4 lb helmet won't go.

motorcycles,3dpdoq,therealdevon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:04:00 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an okay deal to me. If it runs, and the charging system is working (if the headlight gets brighter when the motor revs then it usually is). If it doesn't run good, likely the carbs need to be cleaned, then cleaned, then cleaned again. And put an inline filter on the fuel line. Perfectly fine bikes, not the most durable, but even below average for a Honda means it will likely run until you get tired of it and move to a bigger bike.  People who say that bike isn't worth $500 are living in a land of 20 years ago when mint CB750s were $250, and nobody wanted old Hondas"

If you need something that fits right and won't break they are not a good choice.

motorcycles,3dmhje,Mototerrestrial,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:09 2015 UTC,That's the everyday price. I've bought them as cheap as $9.99 on sale with a coupon. Or you can just use one of their regular 20% off  anything coupons and get it for $12.
motorcycles,3dmhje,SlidePanda,4,Fri Jul 17 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yea, regardless, the outcome is, you still have your bike, so the lock did its job. Next disklock you get, make it an alarmed one.

motorcycles,3dmhje,tollakas,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:43 2015 UTC,A box truck and a group of guys awkwardly carrying a bike around will attract a lot of attention. A good thief can break a lock without anyone noticing and ride it away.

motorcycles,3dmhje,cg_Sprite,6,Fri Jul 17 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"Sucks man, similar situation as you, I live in San Francisco and park my bike on the street. The first month I got my bike, someone took bolt cutters to the triple tree yoke and ripped out the entire key cylinder (cost > $1k to fix the damage). Luckily I had comprehensive insurance on it since the moment I rode away on it from the previous owner. A few weeks later, someone stole my plates and replaced them with stolen ones and got me thrown into the back of a cop car in the middle of an intersection. After that I started covering my bike and locking the cover to the bike overnight every single night (someone stole the first cover off the bike, lesson learned), since then I've had 0 theft related incidents. IMO no product is going to keep your bike 100% safe, but from my experience the cover made the biggest impact. Also, get comprehensive insurance if you don't have it! This bike is such a big target for thieves you'll continue having incidents like this for a long time and the insurance will pay for itself. Even beyond theft, OEM Triumph parts are so expensive that even minor tip overs will cost a ton to repair. A few months ago someone backed into the bike and knocked it over the kickstand side (hit and run), the repair bill was ~$2k (damaged tank, bars, kickstand, indicator, fairings, bar-end mirrors, etc.)."

Same exact Xena disc lock too it looks like with the same kind of damage.  I had just gotten my new 2013 Ninja ZX-6R 636 and had it roughly 3 weeks until I wake up one morning to ride to work and walk out into my apartment parking garage to find my bike cover was halfway off the bike and the lock damaged. I had to call a locksmith to cut the lock off it was so destroyed.  The worst part is that they also bent the front disc it was on so bad that it would no longer rotate between the front brake calipers. Didn't really matter though as the calipers themselves were damaged as well. The rims were also damaged and chipped. Whoever tried to take this thing off went full rage mode it seemed. Made a police report and luckily insurance covered the costs as vandilism but it was roughly $1,500 in damage.  Make a police report if you haven't done so and if you live in an apartment complex make management aware. They may not give a fuck like mine did but I bitched enough and raised so much hell they gave me a personal detached garage on the property for rest of my lease.  Fuck bike thieves."

The pin is supposed to go through your rotor and not be easily exposed to a power saw.  I know what you're talking about is the broken lock face but I noticed you're using the lock wrong.  If you continue to use it the way you are it can still be pushed away after they've broken the steering lock, it might move  slowly but its still able to move because it will not be blocked by the brake caliper after it makes a rotation.  When it's through the holes it stops at the caliper and won't move another inch without breaking it.  Edit: looks like you bought the wrong size lock for that rotor."

motorcycles,3dqtw5,irontap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"About eighteen years.  The list of how it's the same would be shorter. The only similarities that I see are that it has an engine and it gets you where you want to go.  Car drivers are totally insulated from the world around them, immersed in music or conversation, eating, or something else, and too often don't pay attention. That's why so many motorcyclists (and other cars, for that matter) get hit by inattentive drivers.  I've been hit by seven or eight vehicles. I know all the incidents, but I don't know if one of them hit me before I hit a parked car or if they just pushed me into the car without hitting me. That wss the first collision I was ever in."

motorcycles,3dqtw5,2strokes4lyfe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"Riding dirt for 11 years. Riding street for 4. I'm 23 years old.  Bikes are completely different than cars. You lean instead of turning the wheel. Your power to weight ratio is insane even on a 250. Most bikes are waaaay faster than your average car, and even a 250cc will feel fast compared to Toyota Camrys and Ford Focus etc... Also you are completely exposed. There's literally nothing between you and the pavement.   I have two really big pet peeves about car drivers (besides them being slow and always in my way). The first is when a car is trying to pull out in front of me. They literally have to wait a few seconds to let me pass by, but more often than not the pull out in front of me forcing me to cover the brakes. Inevitably I end up tailing the shit out of them because they are in a car on a twisty road and they are slow as shit...   My second pet peeve is when I'm following said slow driver down a winding road, and THEY KEEP CROSSING THE DOUBLE YELLOW!? Like even though they're slow as shit, they are too shitty or too lazy to stay within their lane through blind corners!   My commute is through a really twisty steep road, so I see this all the time.   I've never been in a collision with another driver but I've wrecked on my own before. Definitely had too many close calls from people pulling out in front of me though..."
motorcycles,3dqtw5,schwaffelmeister,0,Sat Jul 18 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"One year. I'm 25.  It's better than driving a car. It's fun to ride on twisty roads but at the same time even riding from my home to work gives me a smile on my face. Where I'm from there's a lot of congestion and people are always stuck in traffic. Filtering through traffic is one of the best things ever. It's like I'm outsmarting everyone on the road ;)  Riding a bike really opened my eyes about how careless some car drivers can be. Sometimes they just pull out in front of me, or they choose to spray their window whiper thingie when I'm right behind them. I gotta say that I'm a hypocrite though, back when I didn't have my motorcycle license I used to be just like 'them'.  On a bike, no. In a car, yes."
motorcycles,3dqtw5,wlm2048,0,Sat Jul 18 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"I rode from 13 or 14 until 21 when I had a bad crash (my fault); I started riding again about 6 years ago (I'm 48 now), and ride full time.  I feel completely connected with the world when I ride. All the smells, the sounds, the feel is all there. When it's hot, I get hot. When it's cold, I get cold. When it's raining, I get wet (yes, even with good rain gear, you're gonna get a little bit in). I feel completely in the moment. I realized the other day during a long ride that everything I do while I'm riding has something to do with riding the bike. It's a very zen/in the moment experience. There's nothing else to do, which brings me to:  Drivers seem to do everything but be in the moment. Cell phones are the absolute worst, but I've seen laptops, someone making notes on a legal pad pressed against the steering wheel, a bowl of cereal being eaten, makeup being applied, shaving, and the list of idiocy goes on and on. I understand why, of course, driving is so easy - when I have to drive, I listen to the radio, and turn up the AC, and all that shit... it's just so easy, but I hate it because it's not like riding.  Yep. I hit a car when I was 21 which put me off riding for a long time."
motorcycles,3dqtw5,ilovehand,0,Sat Jul 18 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"I've been riding for about 5 years.  It's much different from driving a car. Things that would never bother a car like wet paint lines and manhole covers can easily cause a bike to go down, you have to constantly be thinking about your visability to other vehicles and lane position, the handling, braking, and performance is completely different, etc. There is very little they have in common.  My biggest two issues with car drivers are inattentiveness and incompetence. Most drivers treat driving like a secondary task; they will text and talk on the phone, play with their music, put on makeup, and eat and drink, and even if they aren't doing any of that very few are actively paying attention to their driving, instead they are thinking about work or what they are going to do when they get home. Stemming from the attitude of not taking driving seriously is the fact that most drivers on the road are just flat out incompetent. Very few people know how to handle their vehicles in an emergency situation or what the limits of their vehicles are. My brother is a cop and he is always going on about the number of people who don't even brake hard enough to engage ABS when they are heading towards a collision, and I've seen people crash simply because the have no idea how to handle even slightly adverse conditions like avoiding a slide on a slightly slippery road or recovering a slide before it gets out of control, or how hard their car can turn causing them to run wide on corners. I think people need to realize that they are in control of two tons of metal going faster than any human was designed to go with the capacity to injur or kill anyone on or near the road with nothing more than a twitch of their steering wheel.  I have never crashed on the road, but I have crashed 5 times on the track and countless times while trail riding."
motorcycles,3dqtw5,dgomez5,0,Sat Jul 18 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"2 months lol. I feel like it's pretty different, don't need to look through turns and I always find myself leaning even though i don't need to.

Motorcycles don't ""roll"" like cars do. The engine is always controlling the bike, whether it's to speed up (throttle on) or to slow down (downshifting), unless you clutch in.    What is one thing that annoys you about the way car drivers drive?   Nothing, really. Just have to be cognizant that they're going to do dumb things, like talk on phones, or not see you.   Were you ever in a collision before?   Not yet."
motorcycles,3dqtw5,gamerplays,0,Sun Jul 19 01:34:58 2015 UTC,"4 years  Everything is different. How you mechanically get the bike to move is different. Your body is much more connected to the motorcycle than a car. Speeds seem faster on a motorcycle. The road is bigger on a motorcycle.   A lot of drivers will try to muscle their way into where a motorcycle is, because they know ill get the fuck out of their way.  No, thankfully. I have had two code browns though. One of them was the infamous left turn. the second was an idiot at a light was on his cell phone, and for some reason decided to go into the intersection. Practice your basic skills!"

I've ridden a fair amount in the west and make it a rule to avoid interstate highways if at all possible. You're missing out on a lot of good roads by taking I-15 and I-80. I really wouldn't bother riding through Utah and Nevada on the route you have (both states have some fantastic roads but your route isn't on them), for example you are missing out on a spectacular road not very far from SLC, the Mirror Lake Scenic Byway from Evanston WY to Kamas UT through the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Salt Lake City is just a big city and shit to ride through.  You go through Idaho and Montana but in my opinion you're missing all the good bike roads in those states. Lolo Pass is one I always like to ride. Instead of going down I-15 to the east, head into Glacier NP and ride the Going to the Sun road, then head south on US 2 to Lolo and head west on US 12.  /u/edited4upvotes might have been joking but you could check out Owyhee, NV.  The best advice I can give- stick to 2 lane US highways, avoid the Interstates. Zoom way in on Google maps and try to follow rivers as much as possible. Stay away from areas where the road is mostly straight."
motorcycles,3dpobw,elkster88,3,Sat Jul 18 12:33:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I-80 across Nevada and Utah ain't great. But his only other real choice is US-50 (the loneliest road in America).  North on I-15 from SLC to Helena MT is 500 miles and is not bad for an interstate. It gets better the further north.  Going north out of SLC he could take Utah 39 (called Monte Cristo) and up around Bear Lake and up through Jackson WY and Yellowstone. (But will add many miles).  I enjoyed riding Mirror Lake with you those few years ago, we couldn't do both Monte Cristo and Mirror Lake and had any chance to make Moab in one day."

I think after OP leaves Susanville, he should head northeast and basically avoid NV and UT altogether. Or go to Winnemucca and then north on US 95. That long stretch of desert on I-80 is just about the worst road for a bike trip that I can think of, and for what?  Utah 39 does look like a nice road, I'll have to check it out."

motorcycles,3dpdvx,Thedude598,2,Sat Jul 18 04:12:18 2015 UTC,"First watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89LirTCRRUI  Next, dual sports or whatever is comfortable for you to ride on.  It's generally all good.  It's generally preferred you don't start off on a serious sports bike for a variety of reasons but if you have a level head on your shoulders they can work also.  Can you get a good dual sport for under 2K... that's highly dependent on your area.  Keep in mind that it might have been beat to hell, if they're used as their name suggests they take more beating than a straight street bike.  Jacket: Watch the video.  Protection is good.  Pants: Watch the video.  Boots: Again, watch the video but I'll add to it.  Timberlands would be better than sneakers which would be better than DOT approved flip flops.  Bike specific boots have certain features that timberlands do not.  You'll note in the video that boots are fairly highly rated pieces of safety gear.  You go down, there's a fair chance your bike goes down on at least part of you, the most likely part being your feet.  Motorcycle boots have 'safety boxes' around your heel and toe to help defend you.  If you go off in a sudden stop (unintended deceleration due to obstacle), you'll fly forward, your feet will be the last part off the bike and will often strike the bike.  Good boots are armored around your shins to protect them when they contact your bike in these situations.  Good bike boots also have specialized soles which are grippier and often stiffer than ordinary shoes.  This makes them nasty to walk in (remember this the first time you try stairs in a good pair and curse my name as you try not fall), but they are nice to ride in and very useful when you put your foot down at a stop.  Basically I'm very pro safety boot, but then I've had a lot of foot trauma through my life (the most injured part of my body by far) so I'm rather protective of them.  Enjoy the course and have fun and remember, once you've dropped that 2K you're not going to do it again for a while regardless of the result.  While the desire might burn bright in you, it might be better to wait and save up another 500 or whatever.  You're not stuck forever but it's a serious chunk of change for a lot of people much less a 17 year old to save up, take your time and do it right.   Oh dear gawd, now I sound like I'm talking to my kids."
motorcycles,3dpdvx,XunTzu,2,Sat Jul 18 05:08:20 2015 UTC,"I'm 18 and have been riding for probably around 3 to 4 months now. I'll offer a bit of advice from my situation, maybe it helps you maybe it doesn't. First off, I bought a 250cc dual sport as my first bike. I have had years and years of experience riding quads and smaller dirt bikes, since I was 8 I would say. I'm already bored with my bike. At first it was exhilarating and incredible, now it just feels powerless and lacking. I love it, but I really need an upgrade. Also, I have trails near me to ride but if you don't or don't know of any near you, I wouldn't buy a dual sport. Since they are geared as dirt bikes, I can't do highways, and I'm always finding myself reaching for that sixth gear that doesn't exist. It just doesn't feel comfortable riding at higher speeds.  With all that being said, its a really fun little bike. Corners are awesome, its really responsive turning wise, and the freedom to just dip off the road when I see a trail is awesome. I've collectively saved myself hours of sitting in traffic jams by hopping on R/R tracks and going around them. Roadwork or rocks in the road? Meh, no problem. Its awesome to not have to worry about the road imperfections as much when you're learning the ins and outs of operating your motorcycle, and it really gave me peace of mind while I was really starting off. The 250 is very forgiving, especially a thumper like dual sport or supermoto. You can peg the throttle and unless you're in first you are not going to power wheelie or lose control because of it.  To be honest, I kind of wish I had gotten an HD sportster or an r6 or something that I wouldn't have been able to reach the limits of so quickly. Even a 450 dual sport or supermoto would work, but then again that's just me. You could take longer to get it than I did, it just depends on how much experience you have with things like this. One thing to keep in mind though is the seat height of a dual sport. I don't know how tall you are but definitely consider that as part of your criteria. I'm 6'1"" and all legs and I can't get my leg over my bike lazily. Its not hard, but I can't do it without thinking about it. Anyways, if you have any questions shoot away, I'll do my best to get back to you. Good luck!"
motorcycles,3dpdvx,Dancoolface,2,Sat Jul 18 06:35:49 2015 UTC,Thanks. I don't think have trails by me but I do have a truck and plan on driving the bike to my upstate house to do some offroading around there. I've been riding quads for a while and my 250cc honda is lacking in power. But dirt bikes are a lot lighter and I only weigh 130 pounds so I think a 250 should be good. I don't plan on doing any highway riding. If I do find a 400 or something though for a good price I would buy it.
motorcycles,3dpdvx,Dancoolface,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"I weigh 160 and i still feel like its pretty wimpy. Not arguing with you, just suggesting a 400 or 450 would be a better idea. As for the tracks I haven't had any problems. I live in MA, but the cops in my town are really chill compared to most. I've been caught on my quad on the streets and pulled over, and all the officer told me to do was cut the shit and he told me where the closest track was and followed me there so he knew i wouldn't fuck around. I did get pulled over once on my bike because the officer said she thought my bike was a dirt bike registered for offroad use. Once I told her it was legal she left me alone without even asking for my license or registration.  I love the dual sport aspect of my bike, would love to sumo it, my only issue is the power."

The MV's were uncomfortable to me but the F3800 gave me a taste of that supersport speed that I really do eventually want. The ninja 300 is perfect for what it is, save for its uncomfortable seat. Easy to ride, plenty of safety mechanisms through the slipper clutch and ABS, lightweight, and the finesse required to ride one isn't that much at all.    Now compare that to a supersport like the F3800, opening the throttle even a little got you into trouble. I'll probably be buying a S1000RR or another supersport like it in the future (I always have wanted a supersport), but the Ninja 300 will always have a special place in my heart and will always be a fun bike to ride through a city.

Some places say the 300 can't handle a 70+mph run for long distance and it vibrates and the control because ""squirrelly"". It does say it handles better at lower, <60mph, speeds better. This makes sense since the 300 weighs 80lbs less.   I would argue that it's not really a maintaining speed issue, but acceleration issue. There are times where you really do have to hit the throttle and GTFO of an arising situation. The 300 tops out at around 70-80mph, but the 650 can pull you to over 110mph+. The simple fact that you have that power available to you in sticky situations, especially on the highway, is a good thing.  It seems that I am incorrect about this part (TIL!).  Nonetheless, I still maintain that the Ninja 650 would be better for frequent 5-hour rides"

motorcycles,3dox8y,oblivion007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:18:29 2015 UTC,"To me a 650 makes more sense. Im 6'1 210 lbs. A bigger bike will feel more stable at speed and likely be more comfortable for longer trips. (I have not ridden a 300). Coming from a mechanical design background, it makes more sense to me to have a bigger engine do a small to medium amount of work for 5 hours than a smaller engine screaming for 5 hours. Less work means less stress on mechanical parts. If you are concerned that the 650 has too much power just keep in mind that just because the power is available doesn't man you have to use it; however the power will be there when you need it. The best thing you can do is take everyone's advice with a grain of salt, go to a dealer and sit on both bikes. Leave the kickstand down and settle into the riding position for 5 plus minutes, you'll know which one fits you better."
motorcycles,3dox8y,Ashdhevdkejwndk,0,Sat Jul 18 08:44:06 2015 UTC,"Well.... as for the five hour rides and your weight/height I'd go for the 650 mostly on comfort, assuming you'll be making these trips frequently. The 300 can handle the 80mph for long runs no problem, its just I figure the seat sucks for long distances. I've done a few 700 mile+ trips on a 250 at 80+mph (Texas) and so I'm extrapolating on the 300 from that.   I'd still personally go for the 300 though, but I'm 5'10 ~160lbs. I feel its more fun."

When I asked what size/thread he said it is out side.  I followed him out to see it, on turning the corner for the door, out the window of the shop I see a Bourget with a needle nose vise grips on the threads holding the axle in place.   I sent him a few blocks down to the Bourget dealer and advised him to walk.  He road.  Nothing surprises me anymore."

motorcycles,3dmg2w,srgtbear,4,Fri Jul 17 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"The big issue is that IIRC the wheel bearings in that eara are tapered not sealed rollers. With out the axle nut being tight, there is no preload on the bearings. It's a good way to destroy wheel bearings, axle(though the vise grips also likely killed the threads), hub, caliper and brake disc.  I might consider this a acceptable risk if one is stranded in the southwest US desert or in bear/mountain lion country, as a way to get to civilization.

If there's a mushroomy shaped thing with pleats going around it then that's a pod.   I'd be surprised if you had the stock one if there's flat slide carbs tbh.  It's an old trick to leave a hairdryer pointed at the engine for 10 minutes if it's cold and struggling. Also to whip your plugs out and heat them with a lighter, but that's only worth it on bikes with easy access to the plugs. Given the SV's plugs are buried 8ft deep in the engine, I doubt they'd see the warmth of a hairdryer. Worth a shot though."

motorcycles,3dp8mm,techmonkie77,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"If I had to do it again, I'd buy the tour version like I did before, toss the windshield and get this fairing. I have two friends get this fairing, one for a C90 the other a Nomad and have nothing but good things to say about it.  I can only say for heresay about how much of a PITA taking the deluxe fairing off/on is so I say skip the deluxe get the tour and find another fairing and customize it to your tastes.  On another note, the VStar 1300 is a great bike, I loved mine and wish it could have been repaired. The only time it let me down was my own dam fault for not using dielectric grease when I put the battery back in from the winter the third year I owned it, just about 30,000kms on the bike.  edit meant Nomad, typed Vulcan"
motorcycles,3dp8mm,Flinx98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your candid response.  The fairing you linked is very similar to the OEM Deluxe fairing, the deluxe fairing having the benefit of having the OEM speakers and Garmin built into it.  The only real question I'd have to ask is how much trouble is it to take it on/off.  I've noticed a lot of aftermarket ones come off very easily, and it would suck to have to try to replicate all of the functionality in the deluxe trim level using aftermarket parts.  The full dressed look is starting to grow on me for this bike; I've never ridden a 'naked' cruiser, and everyone that has had the luxury of both tells me how much of a difference the front fairing makes when it comes to ride comfort.  I could just see times when I'd like to go with the stripped down front end look (cruising around town vs long distance highway driving for instance)."
motorcycles,3dp8mm,Flinx98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:49:55 2015 UTC,"How much trouble is sort of subjective. On the C90 about 20 minutes some of which is because of farkle installed into and onto the fairing that it wasn't meant to have and about 30'ish to put back on. The Nomad if memory serves me is about 10 minutes to take off and 20 to put back on, give or take. Thats assuming you leave the bike side mounting bracket on the bike otherwise I have no idea.  OEM is nice for some things but well when I go riding I really don't want a gps, tunes yes but that gps has to go. I like getting lost and finding roads I've never seen before a builtin gps would take the fun out of it. Also how loud are the tunes, loud enough for highway use with a rig beside you? I can hear the Nomad from 5 city blocks away and name that tune long before he rides up to me house. Of course I don't imply that one should play their music that loud because that is just wrong wink wink."
motorcycles,3dp8mm,Flinx98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:40:17 2015 UTC,"lol, honestly, I'm not sure yet on the sound of the speakers on the V Star; I've not had the opportunity to take it out and listen to it on the highway.  The GPS is both good and bad; just because it's there doesn't mean I'd have to use it.  I like the option of it's available.  I'm also a fan of the OEM speakers and handlebar mounted controls, but I'm just as happy with using my Bluetooth headsets (I can't imagine a couple of 8 inch full range speakers are going to sound as good at speed than my JayBirds inside my helmet).  If I can remove the fairing in 10-20 mins in my garage w/ a basic set of hand tools, not have to worry about cutting harnesses, or otherwise going through flaming hoops to strip it down, then I'd consider that 'acceptable'.  Having the benefit of all the 'extras' when fully dressed and a nice set of color matching OEM hard saddlebags are worth that minor inconvenience if/when I decide I want to take the fairing off, assuming the price is right."

Compared to my 98 VFR it was more comfortable, had more torque and is lighter! With the throttle closed all the way, clutchless downshifting was smooth, really nice.

motorcycles,3dok04,Corave,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:09 2015 UTC,"I've looked at the MS, but where I live the insurance is double the price of the XR and since the cost of the bike is also higher I'm not sure it's worth it over the XR. However from specs alone the Ducati looks more impressive than the XR, so a test ride is needed. I've heard the BMW is quite boring and lacks the feel and excitement you get from the MS.   I also kinda like the quckshifter, integrated brakes and the way the XR works with the BMW GPS, but I'm not buying a bike until next year so it depends on what extras are available then. KTM is supposedily laucnhing their 1290 super duke tourer next year so I might have to look at that too."
motorcycles,3dp85p,BPSmith511,3,Sat Jul 18 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"Gonna go in reverse order here:  Use engine braking, I don't understand why people would say otherwise.  When you are off the throttle you can cover the brake, but you will have power if you need to hit the gas because of the higher revs, and it is less percentage wear on the bike's components.  The only negative I can think of is if there is a car behind you and they don't expect your speed to be slowing without being on the brakes.  An easy solution to this is to flash your brake lights a couple times when you know you will be in a situation where you want to change gears/engine brake to reduce speed, I do this all the time.  As for pressure on the bars, have somebody hold the bike for you, sit on it, put your hands on the handlebars, then take your hands off while not moving any of the rest of your body.  You want to be hunched over the bars, not on the bars.  If you get the weight of your body on the balls of your feet and hold your abs/back tight, this should be no problem.  It definitely takes some getting used to, but once you do it will become second nature and make your riding much better overall.    Edit:  Oh yea, the adage I go by is something along the lines of, ""Hold the handlebars like you would hold a bird you wouldn't want to get away""."
motorcycles,3dp85p,Willillica,2,Sat Jul 18 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"As /u/Willillica mentioned, engine braking should be primary especially on longer hills.  Main reason for this is if you're using your brakes to keep your speed on a longer hill you will heat up your brakes significantly causing a huge amount of wear and even potentially failure.  As for bar pressure.  Yeah.  There's tons of advice and I tried it all.  I didn't learn until I was on a longer trip, about 75 miles in and I was aching so bad I was sure I'd have to pull over.  Ended up I was gripping WAY too tight and leaning on the bars.  Once I figured that out and relaxed life became much easier.  I would have sworn I was neither leaning nor gripping."

(Either the R1200's or the 1190 Adventure R that you're riding.)  Unfortunately it's hard to find someone that's rich or just lucky enough to have ridden both bikes extensively to tell me what the better route is to go when that does come, so in your opinion, how does your bike fair against the competition?  But I almost don't even care because that 1190 is so fucking gorgeous."
motorcycles,3dkwaf,CoRoRo,3,Fri Jul 17 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, I was considering your bike as a small, light weight ADV.  I had the GS and now I have the 1190 (standard, not R). I'm not going to give you a full review, as it depends on what you prefer in a bike, but...   The GS is a much better cruiser/long distance bike, less tiring - though both are a league above many ""standard"" bikes. The GS is heavier and therefore on road it feels like on railroad tracks, but also off-road... which means it's not as easy ""playing"" with it in technical trails, but forest roads are easy with it. The GS has more ""sensible"" behavior - it is faster than the KTM, but doesn't feel like it, it's more of a grown up bike. The GS is very reliable, I've heard stories, but from experience (I travel a lot and talk to people on the road) it is almost a bulletproof bike. The KTM has a ""bug"", if you ""get"" the bike and infected by this ""bug"", it's awesome, if not... then I'm sorry for you :) It feels like a hooligan sometimes, which for me was a refreshing change from the GS. although the bike is big, it feels much more nimble and easy to ""play"" with, on and off road.   In my opinion the GS is the better overall bike, more round, as long as you keep your on/off road activities above 80/20%, but even if you are doing close to 50/50% (which I am doing now), the GS is still very good, it's just that if you are stupid enough to take a $20K bike that weighs 500# off road, you might get how stupidly fun the KTM is :)"
motorcycles,3dkwaf,Enrage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:52:41 2015 UTC,"The CB500X is a WONDERFUL bike, I have no complaints, just someday I plan to go cross country/continent and won't be able to do it comfortably on this bike.   Thanks for the review, it was exactly what I was looking for. What is the comparison in terms of repair/maintenance? I've heard horror stories about how much BMW maintenance can cost, but I've heard KTM is roughly on the same level. Japanese bikes are so unbreakable I wish they'd make something as bad ass as KTM or BMW!"
motorcycles,3dkwaf,mexell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:01:02 2015 UTC,"On the maintenance side, I don't think it is expensive at all, the BMW is a very well built bike, although some parts are expensive (brake rotors for some unexplained reason, brake servo as well), overall it's a solid bike with an engine that was developed some time around 40BC.  In 4-5 years and around 40K that i had it, I spent less than $1K on maintenance beyond oil and filters (so that means I'm counting the ""big"" 6K services).  The only expensive part with the BMW is the touratech catalogue - so as long as you have self control, the bike is cheap.  I can't attest to the KTM reliability, as i had it for only a year and around 12K, but with so many computers and complex engine, i believe it will be less reliable (by a fraction), though parts are cheaper (some KTM owners are laughing now...).  A word about Japanese bike - make sure you are comparing apples to apples, don't compare the GS to a CBF500, they are not in the same league, though I'm not arguing the fact that Japanese vehicles are superior in terms of reliability. just make sure you are not comparing M6 to Honda civic.  And last - if you are not looking to do any offroad, I would skip the GS and look at the RT - much better deal and better for long distance. and if you'll do some gravel roads, it will handle them just fine."

Keep good maintenance and bike will keep serving you well.  With what i saw people doing with their GS (and KTM for that matter), the bikes are VERY reliable."

The Alpinestars will look better on bike if you get a sporty bike and not much worse off it.  One thing you should get in addition to both: a back protector. Either one you can wear under the jacket or one you can put in the back compartment. The Alpinestars already has some foam in in, but that can't replace a proper protector."

motorcycles,3dncot,Ravinac,11,Fri Jul 17 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"A few assumptions - the Ninja is a 2005 ZX6 and quick googling is yielding accurate answers.   The Ninja weighs about 100lbs less than your Shadow (quick google search - 519 vs 423). The Ninja has 129HP (at 13,500RPM) and 52TQ (at 11,500). Your Shadow has 43HP (at 5,500RPM) and 47TQ (at 3,500RPM). It makes triple the power of your bike, but it doesn't even start making power until your Shadow hits its rev limiter. It is a VERY different machine. Easy on the throttle, and when you do throttle up (do it on a straight stretch and roll into it don't slam it wide open) WATCH the speedometer because it will get illegal quick. You have a single disc brake in the front and a drum brake in the back. The Ninja has two disc brakes up front and a disc brake in the rear. One of the front discs has more stopping power than your entire bike -- and it's got two of them. Easy on the brake until you get used to it. On a cruiser, your seating position is very much riding a couch with the controls out in front of you. On a sportbike the sensation feels more like you are on top of and a part of the machine and the controls are under you. It's very different and will take some getting used to.   Nothing about these bikes are impossible, but they require more caution.   Wide opening your bike at a red light and quickly blasting through three gears is fine. Do that on the Ninja and (assuming you don't have a wheelie and an accident) you'll be approaching (or past) 100mph and the bike will just be getting cozy.  Grab a handful of brake on your bike and you'll slow rapidly and potentially lock up the front brake. Do the same on the Ninja and you may visit the pavement in front of the tire as you flip the bike. Slowly ease into the brake until you have a feel for it.  They're great, have fun :)  EDIT: throttle and brake are different things, oops."

When it comes to cornering I feel that with the Bridgestone mine's fitted with it leans into the corner very easily, but I've heard that Anakee's and some other tires makes it less willing to lean in, so I guess that might affect how it feels.   With regards to speed and braking it does the job well considering how big it is. From what I've noticed the bike from factory runs too lean in the 3-4k rpm range, so a PCV or something similar is probably a good idea."

If your right bulbs are going off when the switch is to the left some wiring was installed incorrectly.  you can use the circuit tester to find breaks in wires and what wire leads to where.  Troubleshoot a bit.  Did the bike come like this?  Did it start after you monkeyed with some wiring?  After you changed the bulbs?  If it just started at random then maybe you melted through your wiring harness and current is going every which way.  Sorry I don't own one of these bikes, this is just my though process when dealing with previously screwed up vehicle wiring.

One car makes a lane change without notice and that dude is road kill.  I don't appreciate aggressive drivers giving us a bad name and having someone who saw this shit harass the next guy or drive aggressive around bike because they see this shit.  It's a community and we need to be respectful of others and consider the casual or beginner riders that get lumped in with stunt riders.

motorcycles,3dhxmb,fsjja1,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:04 2015 UTC,"I think more of the issue is that you tend to see people doing wheelies and stunts in high traffic areas.

She is easier to put into the corners than the 1199 but still doesn't just ""drop"" into corners (common complaint I think.) I don't mind muscling it though as it's much improved.   I'm 6'5"" and the 1199 was ridiculously uncomfortable. The 1299, is as comfortable if not more so than my 848's I've had.   The power deliver is smooth to me, but other reviews are to the contrary. I'm an upper intermediate rider. It still definitely has that punchyness around 4-5k rpm but I don't notice it as I've been on L-twins since 08 and have gotten used to and have come to love the characteristics and torque.   There's a lot of power there, despite what others say, you can use it every time you ride it. But being responsible about it and respecting it (topic of conversation in this thread actually,) is a different story.   That said, I get on it and love the smile I get every time I roll on the throttle."

motorcycles,3dnu02,Stridercal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"Not really. Obviously, you're wearing the tire aggressively there, but apart from faster wear, it's not a problem. If you started chunking the tire, or blistering it somehow, that'd be different.  Keep riding! (But be mindful that you're pushing that tire pretty hard, and likely close to edge of traction.)"

motorcycles,3dnu02,Katoom72,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"That's just dirt from the road. You lean hard enough to bring the edge of the tire close to the road, so it can pick up some dust etc. However, you don't lean hard enough to actually use the edge of the tire, so the dust doesn't get worn off.  All in all, absolutely nothing to worry about."

motorcycles,3do9m9,kbkasey,2,Fri Jul 17 22:03:59 2015 UTC,Technically what you did is theft of services and is a normally a low level misdemeanor involving tickets much higher than the cost of parking. If done habitually can actually become a felony though unlikely for parking. if they caught your plate depends on your bike vs theyre plate camera which is normally HD. Do this enough and eventually they'll catch on and get your plate (if they don't have it already) at which point you can be looking at thousands in costs depending on local laws
motorcycles,3do9m9,nhsof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"Is what you did illegal? Meh, wouldn't say so since you 'lost your ticket' and if needed could probably prove you paid.  Is parking in a private lot without paying illegal? Yep. Chances are they have cameras, and chances are you'll be caught and slapped with a huge fine for every time you do it."

It was only £1.20 I would have had to pay if I had the ticket on me to pay. I didn't actual pay by the way.   Should I go back there tomorrow and tell someone what I did in order to pay the full ticket price; or should I just say nothing and pay like normal from now on? I feel like if I say something, they'll give me a fine, when I wouldn't have had one if I didn't say anything.

motorcycles,3do7mx,f4ther,2,Fri Jul 17 21:47:42 2015 UTC,Im amazed someone actually put almost 50k on a 125...impressive.
motorcycles,3do7mx,Marshall498,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"Why?   Maybe I'm biased (totally in love with anything between 50 and 250) but here's my reasoning.   If you adhere to speed limits, it almost doesn't matter whether you're on a 50cc or a 1800cc. Sure, there's comfort, there's a bit of versatility - but, especially in Europe, you don't have loooong stretches of highways and everyday commute at 75-90 mph, you have small roads with speed limits ~30-50 mph if you're lucky, and city roads, where 30 mph is I think mandatory in almost all European countries, with 20 mph zones introduced in some places.   Before I moved, my daily commute was ~30 miles a day and it literally included a single, 2 mile long stretch of road, where I could go faster than 30 mph. Literally 45. Of course, I could just say ""fuck it"" and forget about the speed limit, but they're there for a reason, I think.   Now, obviously, if you're haulin' a lot of stuff and you want to travel on your bike, a good cruiser with a big engine is probably something you want. But if you're a commuting European? Not really.  Also, tiered licenses here make it harder to ride something bigger straight off the bat. Moreover, you can insure a 125 for pennies, it has great fuel economy, and when needed it'll get to 70 mph. What's more to want?   In fact, I did a lot of my commuting on a 125s and 50s. I seriously wouldn't trade them for anything bigger, unless you'd offer me a CBR250RR or a GS500F :P"
motorcycles,3do7mx,Rahnis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:19 2015 UTC,"A CBR125 on the 400 series highways (in Canada)  is down right terrifying. The wind blast from huge 18 wheelers, and the fact it barely does 130kmh makes you more vulnerable on the road.   I road race a 400 Bandit...so I hear ya on the love for small bikes. But there is a point on the highways when you are actually in danger because of what you are riding."
motorcycles,3do7mx,Marshall498,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:52:40 2015 UTC,"True, that's why I said that basically every bike is good for their respective environments.  I ride mostly in the city and its surroundings, I hate highways and thankfully I've got at least 3 small roads I can take instead, to basically any destination. CBR125 is a perfect bike for this type of riding - it's light, it's nimble, and it's beautiful. :P   Now if I had to ride on highways a lot, I'd go for something bigger and more respectable. :)  I'm assuming that CBR with 50k on the odo was someone's commuter. 10k kilometres a year for 5 years isn't that hard to do when you're commuting 60 km a day both ways. :P"
motorcycles,3do7mx,Rahnis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"I live in America. My commute varies and is between 15-30 miles and the vast majority is on a 70mph highway where the average traffic speed is closer to 80mph. To feel safe and be able to safely pass, I need a bike that can cruise at 80 comfortably and pass comfortably in a timely fashion at those speeds (acceleration from 80 can't be ungodly slow, like you'll experience on a Ninja 250R). This is America though!  I agree, from time I've spent in Europe, a 250cc bike is more than enough for the vast majority of roads and commutes. In America however, a 250cc would be dangerous on half of the roads I drive or ride on daily. It's crazy how different it can be riding in America or even Canada compared to Europe!"
motorcycles,3do7mx,SVTf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if it's been well maintained, I wouldn't worry about a high mileage bike.

motorcycles,3dlmsr,avanturista,7,Fri Jul 17 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"I wonder how well a self-driving car would actually avoid a collision when it's another driver's fault. It seems as though their logic is that, ""if our car is driving fine/legally, but we keep getting hit by others, that means we are doing well as the collisions are not our responsibility."" But as any motorcycle rider knows, it doesn't matter who is at fault in an accident, it's the responsible motorcyclist's job to try to avoid it. So not only do we need to ride in such a way that won't cause an accident, we also have to ride in such a way to compensate for others' inattention/stupidity/lack of driving ability. And it doesn't seem that their self-driving cars can do that, at least not as well as a properly trained human being."
motorcycles,3dlmsr,BMWDUKE,3,Fri Jul 17 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"If these texting/distracted shitbags weren't on the roads, and everyone drove like a self-driving car, we wouldn't have to evade like that. We are on bikes, this is a car. It is much harder to evade, when your the size of all the other objects on the road, and not half the size like we are.   The problem is not the google cars, its the human operator not paying attention. No human operator error, no accidents."
motorcycles,3dlmsr,avanturista,2,Fri Jul 17 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"That wasn't my point.   Obviously, if you were to replace all drivers with Google cars, we would eliminate most if not all accidents. But my point is that if you were to replace half of all drivers with Google cars, you would still get more accidents than if you were to replace half of all drivers with careful/ attentive drivers/riders. Just like Google cars, those careful drivers would not cause accidents, but they would also anticipate the accidents potentially caused by the remaining half of drivers.  Obviously, this is pure speculation."

Though it is done in with the front being bias-ply and the rear as a radial.  Not something you would want to do on a track bike where you are looking for peak performance and maximum tread width for the best contact patch, but no reason to worry about it on a commuter where you are not going to be pushing the limits of a bias-ply tire.  Most manufactures(motorcycle and tire) will officially say nothing more than a legalies version of ""don't mix tire types, unless the bike came this way or we say it's OK because we approved the change & you should only run what was supplied on the bike when new, both in type and/or tire size and model."""

motorcycles,3dnoy4,sugarfreeeyecandy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"Plenty of bias ply motorcycle tires around and for sale as new, mate. I just ordered two, mainly because there are no radials available in my size that I know of. Plus the bike wasn't designed for them, and that does matter.  Bias ply can have advantages over radials, one of them being able to carry heavier loads because they have a more rigid structure (tougher side walls). Good for touring bikes that carry heavier loads. And with decent rubber on them aren't bad at all, just not meant for racing because they don't lose heat well. Fine for street use.  Radials are lighter (simpler construction, less parts), better at dissipating heat and less stiff. Resulting in better adaptation to road surfaces and more feel of what the tire is doing."

motorcycles,3dm73m,srgtbear,2,Fri Jul 17 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"Condensor you can just use a multimeter.  Switch it to Ohms.  Touch the red lead to the hot connector on the condenser. Place the black lead to the metal case on the condenser. The meter's needle should jump slightly to the right (toward 0-ohms), then should drop back to the left towards infinite resistance). Hold the leads in place for 15 to 20 seconds. This action places charge in the condenser. If the test shows any reading other than infinity, the condenser is leaking and needs to be replaced.   Points - use feeler gauges and adjust them to manual spec.  To set timing a timing light will be the easiest.  The other way requests to remove the valve cover and line up the the arrow that points to a notch on your cams.  Then go to your timing plate a set the pointer bracket to point to ""T"" aka TDC.  With multi-cylinder motorcycles you'll also have to check the other cylinders to the pointer bracket."

It runs beautifully when up to speed and is hot. But when starting it up and choking it for 1min it idles low (~800-900rpm) and when you try to give it a little throttle it just stalls. It does this for about 5-15 min and forces me  to use the choke a little when idling. And it forces me to build up the rpms and clutch out which is a pain.  But once ive been riding for 20 or so min it seems to go away. Dirty carbs and pilot jets maybe? Battery and fluids are all brand new.  EDIT: Wow thanks everyone for your responses. I will do this when I get home with the idle screw. I knew I liked this community!!!"
motorcycles,3dm73m,srgtbear,3,Fri Jul 17 20:50:15 2015 UTC,What RPMs does it idle at when hot and warmed up?  It might be as simple as raising the idle.  Dirty carbs wouldn't let you ride if they were junked up.  I am thinking that you have low compression.  As the bike warms up the aluminum expands allowing your pistons and rings to sit tighter around the cylinder.  How many miles does it have on it?
motorcycles,3dm73m,HEF51,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:20 2015 UTC,It idles around 1000 when its warm. Its got 9700 miles on it. I was thinking of messing with the idle screw.

motorcycles,3dm73m,donkawechico,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"I was experiencing this same thing on my 82 Nighthawk 750. The following things ""fixed"" it:   Bike simply needs to warm up for awhile before it behaves perfectly. This is normal. Mechanic noticed my idle was stalling out a lot, so he reached under the engine and found the idle speed screw and just started doing a kind of ""safe-cracker"" routine with it. Nudging it up and down while listening to the idle and watching the rpm. He eventually found the perfect sweet spot of low rumble without stalling and now it works much smoother. Being new to a bike is a much bigger factor than you think it should be. Took me awhile to learn the right friction zone to use for going from stand-still into first without stalling.   But even now, I still have to use the choke every morning just to get the bike rumbling on its own. I can then either let it rumble for 1-3 minutes and close the choke to let idle on its own, or I can immediately start riding and just close it off after a few seconds."

At least with my bike, the screw sticks out like a sore thumb (once you see it, ha). I just squat down and look through the engine and there's this single ""large"" finger-twistable screw going upward into... something. Should be the carburetor, but that doesn't fit my memory of where that screw's located.  I don't know the ""technique"" for it, but my guess is that you want to find the absolute minimum twist amount that lets your bike stay idling. So you probably over-twist it to simulate the choke being on to make sure it stays idle, then back off until it stalls, back track a few twists and repeat until you find the sweet spot.  But I am not a mechanic, that's just what it looked like the guy was doing."

I can't figure out where the leak is coming from but I know it's near/under my front master cylinder. It drips from where the line dips down and then back up again off the banjo bolt. I can post pictures tonight Would it just be safe to rebuild the master cylinder and replace crush washers/lines?  The brake lever is squishy but it eventually gets tight assuming from the loss of fluid so based on that I don't think it's a master cylinder issue. What do you think?
motorcycles,3dm73m,iresolve,3,Fri Jul 17 14:18:07 2015 UTC,it is the master cyl or line.  Inspect it bit by bit till you find the leak.  The master Cyl could be leaking and dripping.  I have had a master cyl on a car leak into the brake booster and another one leak internally so that my clutch would slowly re-engage when I had the pedal all the way down so a cyl that leaks the fluid out of the moment cyl and slowly looses pressure is possible

Could I use one of them to eliminate that possibility or do I have to use the exact model already on the bike and rebuild it?   In addition if I replace the upper brake line ( before it goes into the lower splitter should I look for another OEM/ rubber line or would braided steel be beneficial in just a 13* piece?   Thanks again!
motorcycles,3dm73m,iresolve,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:40 2015 UTC,I would use one that is the same or atleast displaces the same amount of fluid.  You might actually feel a small difference in the braided steel line.  Car drivers claim they can feel a difference after replacing a 4 inch piece so....
motorcycles,3dm73m,geking,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"Ok. That makes sense. Thanks again!   So in attempt to recreate the leak I putted around today because it doesn't leak sitting.   I took pictures to illustrate my situation  In the first picture ""B"" was dry but ""A"" had collected some oil on its ridge and besides the line above it, was the highest point that was wet.   The master cylinder was bone dry but the banjo bolt was wet where I placed the arrows. The second pic shows how close it is to the fork. I'm thinking crush washers? What do you say? Does the lower handlebars have something to do with it? Too extreme of a brake line? Thanks for the help!"
motorcycles,3dm73m,iresolve,2,Sat Jul 18 11:34:05 2015 UTC,"I would try to first just tighten the banjo bolt.  Then check the crush washers.  It is likely NOT the line, but it could be something like a tiny crack in the MC where the banjo screws in.  BTW, I am sure you know this, but you don't have to fire up the bike to test the leak.  Just squeeze the front brake like you are stopping a few times and check again.  Please check your fluid level often as well; you don't want that running out!"

motorcycles,3dm73m,iresolve,2,Sat Jul 18 23:21:24 2015 UTC,No Problem.  I am looking to pick up a 79 kz1100 shafty for a winter restoration project.  What do you think of the bike?
motorcycles,3dm73m,geking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:59:08 2015 UTC,Awesome! I really like it. It's my first bike so there'll always be that special place in my heart.   I really didn't like the stock handlebars so replacing them with some drag bars really helped the look and the feel. I may add some risers later because I ran into a few issues from the huge difference in height (like the aforementioned issue you helped with)   It's got a 4 into 1 header which makes it sound sorta nightmarish.   Very fun to ride. Gets a lot of admiring looks from older men reminiscing which is also fun.

It just takes a 1-2 second hesitation period where the all the bikes lights dim and almost turn off. I've checked the terminals to the battery and they're snug, and the battery is running at 12.8 volts. So it's close to full.   Any ideas what else it may be?   The bike always starts. It just makes me a little nervous.   Thanks to anyone who may have some insight on this situation.   Bike is a:   08 Harley Davidson nightster xl1200n W/ 9000 miles on it.

motorcycles,3dm73m,Bugtoat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"Try getting a sealed gel/AGM battery. I had the same problem with my 1980 Honda CB650. Tt would go ""put.......put.....put..put putput vrrooooooooom."" The putting being the electric start cranking over.  I just bought a new AGM battery and it purrs like no other as soon as I hit thei starter. It must be the cranking amps the batteries we have were not up to the task. I was getting some Napa Auto Part liquid ones and they did nto cut it.  For you I would recommend something from here try and find an AGM battery with dimensions that will fit where your battery is stored. they are verstile and can be set in any position besides upside down. to charge them you will need a special AGM charger/tender."

motorcycles,3dm73m,jayklam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"No problem I hope it works out for you.  I also am adding in line switches for my bike to help the cause.   One for the headlight (mine draws 6 amps!) One for the voltmeter mentioned below lastly one for my tach/speedometer light   I am adding a voltmeter so I can check the battery voltage without taking my seat off to check for a charge.  Hopefully turning these off when I turn the key will make the battery jobs easier to start then I can just switch them back on.  If I had other misc. addition to my bike like body lights, radio etc. I would add some switches for those."

Now I have zero power, and I can't even push start it. I've checked all the fuses and none of them are blown so I'm thinking its either the battery or reg/rec? I'm going to get the battery tested after work but any other ideas?  The thing that worries me is that I can't even push start it. It does crank but doesn't actually run. I'm not sure what that means."
motorcycles,3dm73m,jayklam,3,Fri Jul 17 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds like maybe your main fuse blew, I only say this because it's generally in a somewhat different location than the rest of the fuses. If you have a service manual, it should show the location in the electrical section, otherwise a bunch of googling ""cbr600f2 main fuse"" should help you out.   Hopefully that's the problem, but fuses don't tend to blow for no reason :("
motorcycles,3dm73m,jessica_rabbit__,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:21:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully that's not it :-\ wouldn't be an easy fix if something was blowing it. Maybe the starter solenoid.. pushing the starter was when everything turned off. I swear its always something with this bike!
motorcycles,3dm73m,UnreasonableSteve,2,Fri Jul 17 15:49:02 2015 UTC,That would be the easiest fix. The fuse did it's job and maybe it was just old or something. Test that battery and go from there
motorcycles,3dm73m,jayklam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"Well you can always just replace the main fuse (if that is what's actually blown) and hope for the best. Stuff gets worn out after a decade and a half, it's the nature of having an older bike. :p"
motorcycles,3dm73m,geking,2,Fri Jul 17 18:46:00 2015 UTC,I'll give it a shot. it'd be nice if that's all it needed for at least a few weeks. I'm in the middle of moving cities for work so this is definitely not a good time lol. I guess I can always just strap it down in the moving van and worry about it when I get there if its not fuse/battery.
motorcycles,3dm73m,jayklam,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"fuses+ also check your battery wires, both ends.  If you had a weak connection this could have completely blown it when you tried to turn it over."
motorcycles,3dm73m,geking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"Luckily it ended up being the battery! Took it to get tested after work and it was putting out less than 1 amp, pretty crazy that it lasted so long. She runs good as new now."

Is this even worth it? There is another place that has a CB500X for $5500, brand new, and I'm leaning toward that."
motorcycles,3dm73m,jdovew,3,Fri Jul 17 16:13:27 2015 UTC,Idk.. a 2014 that's been thrashed that much already is a little worrisome. Was it in an accident or was the previous owner just stunting it?   I'd have a mechanic you trust check it out for frame damage before you buy it if its from an accident.   I mean it seems like a good deal at half price but repairs add up if its end up being more complicated than that.

motorcycles,3dm73m,jdovew,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd be careful on that one, at least have an independent mechanic thoroughly inspect it if you are considering going that direction.  If the dealership isn't being totally transparent about the bike and giving you the records they have of repairs/damage I wouldn't risk it.

I disconnected the lead from the battery, then plugged the OEM connectors straight into two H4 halogens for now.   Is my temporary solution safe? Why is a HI/LO bulb[1] $35 when a HI/LO bulb, ballast, and relay(?)[2] is $37.50? Am I missing something? I'm positive my bike has the stock reflectors and does not have a retrofit kit to project the HID's the proper way, and a lot of people have said they're inefficient and arguably no better than halogens. Do you have any anecdotal evidence of this?"
motorcycles,3dm73m,PistolMcDaniels,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"If you've only bypassed the HID wiring it's totally safe. As it will be running as it did when stock.  I doubt you'll find anyone here who knows why things cost what they do, but I can tell you this: there are plenty of low quality ballasts out there that will fail or flicker. I'd be nervous of anything that is cheaper than $50 What you refer to as reflectors are more properly called optics. If the optics in your headlight were made for H4 halogen, than anything else but H4 halogen will yield unpredictable results. Calling that inefficient is certainly accurate, and one could even call it dangerous as it can blind traffic in the opposing lane.    IMO the two options you have for good results is just to run a properly adjusted H4 setup like factory. Or get an appropriate HID projector headlight and a good quality ballast and bulb; this won't be an H4 size bulb but rather a D2 or D3. Anything else is a different flavor of cheap junk."

Basically, shifting gears feels clunky/rattly/sloppy to me. These are the ""symptoms"":   Downshifting to 1st doesn't produce a single satisfying ""click"". It clicks, then produces like 3 or 4 clunky ""echo"" clicks. Kind of a rattle. The rattle is somewhat (but not fully) lessened when I firmly shove down my shifting foot. If I'm lazy in my shift, it rattles more. Sometimes I feel the click, but the bike won't fully engage into that gear. In general, I need to be firm and confident in my shifts for the gear to stick. When I'm lazy with it, I get stuck in a weird in-between shifting state where I kinda have to do a ""reset"" by shifting firmly down a gear, then firmly shifting up again.   It never feels dangerous or like the bike is breaking down or anything. It's just kind of unsatisfying and makes the bike feel cheap.  My guess is that this is just normal for this kind of transmission, but I'd love to find a way to improve it if possible.

motorcycles,3dm73m,Heath24Green,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:35:42 2015 UTC,Check the slack of the chain. I found a manual for your bike that says the free play should be an inch.

motorcycles,3dm73m,gainorjt,3,Sat Jul 18 02:41:52 2015 UTC,"Time to play hide and seek with your wiring. Pick up a Voltmeter, a bag of your favorite snacks, and clear the weekend; it's gonna be a trip.  Basically take your wiring diagram and compare it to what is actually on the bike. You are probably going to have to disassemble the headlight area and remove the seat/tank to gain access to all the wires and trace them properly. With luck the wires will use the stock colors so much of it might be easy to identify. Your mention of ""decluttering"" raises the possibility that the entire blinker circuit has been removed."
motorcycles,3dm73m,K2TheM,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:46:22 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond.  I did take off the tank and headlight already. The wires are all still stock colors, just shorter than expected. The wire and some wire bundles are labeled to what it does (low beam, horn, turn signal (X2), etc.)   Here's what I know:  All of the wires are still there-I checked the diagram and checked for each color in the bundle... all are there.  The turn signal wires from the handle switch are cut when reaching the headlight area. I will be home shortly to show a picture of what it looks like.   The turn signal wires that go to the rear are split off at the front and go back. They do not reach the tail of the bike and I have not found where they end near the rear.   The flasher relay was included in a box of parts and to my knowledge works, I just don't know what goes into it and out of it. The diagram confused me.  I have a manual for the bike and have been using that diagram. This is very close to it besides the large black bars were removed. This is what i meant by the 'decluttering.'"
motorcycles,3dm73m,hardkhor,2,Fri Jul 17 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"Well... the large black bars on a wiring diagram typically indicate a sheeting/bundling of some kind. So if those were removed I wouldn't call that ""decluttering"" but rather... cluttering...  Anyway.  So the wires are there, but not connected properly?  To get the signals working you'll simply have to re-wire what has been cut. Either by splicing in new wires to bridge the cuts, or soldering the cuts back together, or by replacing the cut wire completely."

motorcycles,3dm73m,hardkhor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"Probably a carb issue. Has your bike been sitting for a while? It could just need a good clean, which there are tons of videos and tutorials on how to do online. If you haven't really modified your ninja a lot then I couldnt imagine it needing a rebuild. Plus it's not that old so the parts shouldn't be worn. First step would be a good clean. I'd bet that fixes it. If not, then changing the jets. It is an easy job once you know how to clean the carbs."
motorcycles,3dm73m,lord_squirrel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry forgot to mention this part...  I've been riding this bike for about 3 months now. I bought it last Thanksgiving and it sat until around April. Started up the bike then and turned over no problem. I've been riding it constantly and not letting it sit for no more than a week and a half at a time.   Maybe two weeks ago or a week ago, I noticed that the bike would not start as in the video. However, after a few times of trying to turn it over, it would turn on fine. Progressively, it got worse and worse until now where it does not turn over unless I hold the throttle.  The only thing that happened was that about 3 weeks ago, I parked my bike on the streets like I usually do. I came to my bike 3 weekends ago and saw my bike on the ground (and scratched the car in front of me). Some asshat probably hit my bike on the way out. No idea when it got hit or how long it was on the ground but I'm guessing a very long time. Think that has something to do with it?"
motorcycles,3dm73m,hardkhor,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:33 2015 UTC,"That time frame from November to April could have done something if you didn't store it well. Aka put stabil in the gas and run it or empty the carbs. It laying on the ground for a while could have done something also. If the carbs were dirty before, one of the floats in the carbs could get stuck and cause too much gas flowing. Starting with easy and working up would be best so I'd say make sure the fuel filter isn't clogged first. Then look at the air filter. The thing to look for on the air filter is is there gas in it. If there is then it's probably the float on the carb got stuck. Either way, then I'd go to the carbs. Take them off and clean them really well and then you'll have to synchronize them. Like I said, there are tutorials everywhere online. I really don't think you'll need a complete rebuild of the carbs and these fixes I'm talking about are pretty cheap and easy."
motorcycles,3dm73m,Bomber_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:07:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm gonna take a look at the carbs. Idle isn't stable at all right now. Gotta probably make it a weekend project or something...
motorcycles,3dm73m,hardkhor,2,Fri Jul 17 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yes it most certainly does.   Stop running that bike NOW. If it was on its side for any length of time is is quite possible that a fair bit of fuel leaked down the cylinder walls and contaminated your oil. Basically the engine flooded severely and you'll want to change the oil and filter ASAP.   I could be wrong about this though, so check the oil first to confirm. If it's foamy, a cloudy brown, or any other sort of discolored it certainly needs to be changed.   If that checks out, breathe a sigh of relief and start reading up on carb cleaning. Even if it ran well just after it sat for awhile it may have taken some time for rust fragments and varnish to clog up your jets or smaller fuel passages."
motorcycles,3dm73m,Tokyo_Echo,2,Fri Jul 17 23:50:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I did an oil change right after the bike was knocked over. Also put some fuel stabilizer in there as well.   Turned on fine yesterday no problem. Now that idles are unsteady. Most likely have to clean/rebuild the carbs at this rate.

motorcycles,3dm73m,delaware,3,Fri Jul 17 20:16:57 2015 UTC,I believe the recommended speed is between 1100 and 1300rpm. There is an idle adjustment screw on the side of your carbs that will fix it. Once adjusted go for a ride and come back to make sure it's still set right. It's ok if you need to readjust it after that first ride but if you find yourself adjusting it over and over then there may be a vacuum leak or your throttle cables may need lubed up.

motorcycles,3dm73m,Crazywhite352,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:59:47 2015 UTC,Certainly too high. See if you can lower it by the throttle set screw. If this isn't possible reasons for your high idle include a malfunctioning choke or a vacuum leak.

motorcycles,3dm73m,Crazywhite352,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:30 2015 UTC,This isn't wheel alignment really as much as it is your handlebar being bent. I've been known to take a mallet to bent bars in the past if it's only slightly out of whack. First though try getting the bike up to speed and taking your hands off briefly. If it pulls to one side chances are the triple tree is twisted slightly. Easy fix either way.

My Dad and I have started to venture out together farther and farther away from home each time we go out, and I've decided it's time to purchase a windscreen for my CB500X, as anything over 55 MPH becomes horrendously annoying in terms of buffeting and just general wind annoyance.  Looking online, I can get a nice Puig screen for about $100 that mounts on the existing brackets, but has no ability to adjust and also only comes in one size. My other option is to go ahead and fork over the $250 and get the Madstad adjustable windscreen system, which seems really nice. The only problem is that I do not know what size I require! They offer a 16"", 18"", 20"", and 22"" windscreen and the stock screen seems to be roughly 12"".

I have recently had the spark plugs replaced and valves adjusted - so I don't think it's that.  R1s have a very hallmark sound..very unique to them..my bike no longer has that sound (albeit it still has an engine that makes it sound like it's a bike on a race track..that severe growl / loud literbike sound).  But it no longer has the ""modulated scream"" (I don't know how else to put it) that R1s should have, and it does not sound the same any longer.  What could this be? What could cause power loss and exhaust noise change??  ps - to give an idea of ""power loss"" - I used to be able to power-wheelie at 5-6k rpm in 1st .... now I need to be at 8k.. so it is slight.. but definitely there and noticeable. My r1 used to be a beast, now it's...less of one..but still a beast. It used to make little kids put their hands over their ears when I rode by..not anymore ? what GIVES?.  How do I find out if all cylinders are firing? How obvious would it be if I was only running on 3 or 2? Maybe it could be the EXUP? Maybe leak in my exhaust?  The easiest thing I can think of is my air filter needs to be changed? IDK. Help me."
motorcycles,3dm73m,ercaerca,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly if your only symptoms are a new exhaust note and power loss it's gonna be hard to figure out what's up. Even if you're not throwing a CEL you could have anything from a dirty air filter, clogged fuel filter or injectors, vacuum leak, exhaust leak, TPS issue or bad O2 sensor.   If the bike was damaged/dropped at all recently that could direct you where to look, but if not my first guess would be to check for an exhaust leak/loose nuts on the headers."

motorcycles,3dm73m,mundisj,0,Sun Jul 19 06:14:25 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but to see if all the pistons are firing see if the headers are hot (preferably by a digital thermometer) to make sure it is blowing hot air after combustion. You can also check the spark plugs if they are firing. It would be obvious to the ear to hear a miss firing cylinder, more so at lower rpms.  Anything that is restricting air would mean less power. If you've ridden the bike hard for a bout a year or more now the piston rings may be warn, allowing for some gas to pass into the case; ultimately losing power.   As far as the exhaust noise change may have something to do with the power loss or timing of your sparks.  Try the air filter first. the cleaner one will allow more air in to combust, its why people put larger air filters on, or why turbos have smaller engines to blow more air into the main engine."

The line of thinking is that with straight headers without a collector, muffler, or expanded diameter allow cool air to come back up the pipe and causes the valves to cool too quickly and make them brittle. This is true if you were running NO headers, but ultimately if your headers are running the length of your bike that's just fine.

If you're lean, you'll have to rejet, and possibly open up the air/fuel mix screw a bit.  I wouldn't worry about immediately doing any harm though. If you're tuned correctly right now, you won't be that much leaner without the mufflers.  All that said, if you like to ride your bike with any frequency/distance, you probably will not like straight pipes for the long term. Don't do anything permanent if you can avoid it."

Shifting definitely needs work. You'll get there.   I recommend riding in the morning instead of night. Too many drunk drivers at night and you can see road hazards much better with some sunlight.
motorcycles,3dn3nb,Aragorn-,2,Fri Jul 17 16:54:22 2015 UTC,Yeah...  I do that when I'm just slowing usually to a red light...  Thanks though!!  I'll make sure to look at that!  I'll also be taking the course this week so hopefully that helps!
motorcycles,3dn3nb,Aragorn-,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:46 2015 UTC,My biggest advice leading up to and after the course is to practice in a parking lot during the morning. Much less traffic and far better visibility. I personally rode on my neighborhood side streets for a couple of weeks before I got out into traffic.  Watch some videos on how to downshift and practice that so you get out of the habit of holding in the clutch and slowly clicking down gears.
motorcycles,3dn3nb,rofldat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:06:04 2015 UTC,Thanks!!  That's why I thought  at night it would be better....  Less traffic :)  I'll for sure practice a lot more though!
motorcycles,3dn3nb,Aragorn-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"New rider myself so I wanted to ask since I tend to cover the clutch all the time (was told this in the MSF course). Is this inherently bad to do? Or are you talking about physically keeping the hand on the clutch lever as bad?  When coming to a red light, should I not be clutching in and clunking down through the gears?"
motorcycles,3dn3nb,blade00014,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily ""bad"", but having all fingers extended like that for most of the time gives you much less control. If you're going to do that, then keep two fingers on the clutch and the rest on your bars. It's about getting into good habits early before the bad ones stick to you.  I don't think having the clutch in and going down all the gears is terrible either, but downshifting by rev matching and blipping the throttle keeps you in gear ready for throttle if you need it. Holding in the clutch and going down gears means you have to worry about being in the right gear and messing with RPMs as you're letting the clutch out. If you're coming up to a red light at 30mph with your bike in 1st gear, your clutch in and the light turns green, suddenly you have to worry about finding the right gear and letting the clutch out without locking your wheel."

Unless you're getting something like a Honda NC700, you will want at least a topcase to store your helmet/gloves/whatever.  3) Shopping is a problem, but solvable for a single guy in college - make sure you have a good backpack that straps across your chest (I have a Haglofs Corker and can recommend it).  4) It is significantly less convenient than having a crappy old beater car."
motorcycles,3dm10d,AnTyx,5,Fri Jul 17 10:44:44 2015 UTC,Adding to point 2) it takes me a good 5 mins to properly chain up. And i live/work in a 'good' neighbourhood (sp?)
motorcycles,3dm10d,NeekoBe,16,Fri Jul 17 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"Single guy and broke-ass college student reporting in: I have been commuting to school and back on my bike since last November. I live in NYC, where winters are often rather cold and we sometimes do get the occasional snowstorm. That being said, I'd say bike ownership has its upsides, among some minor downsides.  Upsides:   If your jurisdiction allows lane splitting, your commute can be reduced by up to 30%. Even if lane splitting is illegal where you live, most often you'll get away with it as long as you're not an asshole about it. On anything lower than a 500cc engine, fuel economy is on par with that of a Prius. Of course, you have approximately 10 times the fun on 2 wheels as you do on 4. Insurance is typically laughably cheap for anything below 500cc. So long you're not on a supersport/race replica machine, insurance should work out to be lower than on a car. (YMMV obviously, depending on your personal driving history and whatnot) Shopping may be a problem unless you own an NC700x, or have added storage compartments. Of course, nothing a nicely-sized backpack and a lot of bungee cords can't solve.. where there's a will, there's a way :) I typically carry my helmet and gloves. Unless I'm carrying a passenger (or picking one up at some point) I do not carry the spare helmet. You can probably do the same. I lock the front and rear wheels of my bike, and cover it up with a motorcycle cover.. even with all that included, I'd say I can get geared up, prep the bike and leave within about 15 minutes of deciding to do so (this obviously excludes time required to walk to the place where my bike's parked, which brings us to...) Parking: In a city, this is one of the major areas where you'll save time and frustration. When I drove to school occasionally, it took me several times my commute time to actually get a parking spot. With my motorcycle, finding a sufficiently large spot between two parked cars isn't all that hard.   Of course, there are a few downsides:   Motorcycles are more vulnerable to theft. You need to invest in at least a good disc lock and chain. Vandalism and people sitting on your bike and dropping it are also occupational hazards. Plan accordingly. When parking, it occasionally happens that some asshat that doesn't know how to parallel-park will knock your bike over. Again, plan accordingly. You need to buy riding gear. At a minimum, jacket, gloves, helmet (full-face), boots, and preferably a set of riding jeans. Prepare to spend upwards of $800 for a set of gear, and more if you want spares/passenger gear. If you live in cold climates, or in areas that get a lot of rain, you need to factor this in. Motorcycles tend to serve quite well even in moderate rain (though obviously the factor of safety is further reduced due to traction/visibility or lack thereof). However, snow and/or ice are the worst enemies of motorcycles, and you need to have backup modes of transport for those days. Luckily here in NYC, we have plentiful mass transit for bad days. Budget about 1.5 hours/2 weeks in cumulative time maintaining/inspecting your bike. Almost every part tends to be more safety-critical, since your margin of safety on two wheels is already lower than on four. You need to, at a bare minimum, check tire pressures every few rides, degrease and lube your chain every two weeks or so, and verify chain slack as well. Checking all fluid levels and periodically bleeding your brakes also tends to be a good idea. Obviously, stuff like oil and filter changes are also required every few thousand miles.   Overall, I'd say go for it, as long as you understand the risks/limitations. Motorcyclists in North America often tend to view their vehicles as toys/luxuries, while the concept of motorcycles being commuter appliances is quite common in the rest of the world."
motorcycles,3dm10d,more_amps,3,Fri Jul 17 11:24:59 2015 UTC,"As another single college student with a tight budget (though, I wouldn't say broke - yet, still summer, still building my reserves!) I completely concur with this.   I do have a bit to add though.   I have a 2005 YZF600R. It's a 599cc i4, but I still average 55mpg or so on 87 octane (it's in the manual!) and pay (in my opinion) very cheap insurance. I have a $50 deductible on a full coverage with theft plan through one of the major companies. I forget what I said the declared value was, something around $2500, give or take. Best part, even though I get 55mpg and insurance is half the price of my car with better coverage, I'm still faster than almost anyone on the road! You'll start to wonder why more people don't want to ride motorcycles!  I can't agree more on the parking situation at a college campus. While I still have to pay the same rate as a car (some schools have a significantly lower rate for those who only register a motorcycle), there is a number of spots barricaded off for motorcycles! It's in the closest deck to classes and there's always room for another motorcycle. Sometimes you've got to be creative on how you maneuver around as not to hit another rider's bike, but you'll always have a place to park! If you drive and want into any of the three connected decks, chances are unless you come at a specific time or are damned lucky, you're just going to circle the deck and end up parking on the opposite side of campus!   I don't live within the limits of a major city. My university is on the outskirts of a large (but not really major) city. I don't really worry about bike security as much as you are (and in NYC should be!), but security is a big deal regardless of where you are. I've gotten away with just the fork lock for the past year, but am moving to a new apartment soon and plan to buy a disc brake lock. I already have a nice big chain too. I plan to use the brake lock day to day (it's smaller) and when I'm parking the bike for a few days in a row I'll use the chain to secure the bike to part of the parking deck. Plus, if you've read through the IAMA on the bike thief, he said they normally don't mess with your bike unless it's a decently new supersport or otherwise desirable. For someone who uses a bike as their sole form of transport, it wouldn't be a bad thing to keep this in mind and buy a bike that's less desirable to thieves.  Gear can easily cost more than $800. I don't have armored jeans or boots yet and buying BILT gear, I've probably already spent $400-500 on two sets of gloves (mesh and leather), two helmets, and a mesh jacket.   You really covered this well!   I do have a question too. You say to plan accordingly for people sitting on your bike and it getting knocked over for one reason or another. Does this happen often to you? I don't know if anyone has ever sat on my bike (ignorance is bliss, right?) and it's never (yet) been knocked over in a parking lot. Have I just been lucky, and my time is coming, or is this generally rare if you're careful where you park?"
motorcycles,3dm10d,SVTf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"If you don't cover up your bike while parked, and it's in an area even remotely frequently trafficked by people, you run a very real risk of people sitting on the bike to take selfies, assuming your bike isn't some complete trash heap of a machine that's all banged/scratched-up. My bike got knocked over once while parked, and I have yet to determine whether or not it was due to a car or perhaps someone sitting on it and dropping it (happens more often than you think, as few people actually realize balancing a 400-pound hunk of metal and plastic != being on a bicycle). Either way, I was stuck footing the bill for hundreds of dollars in plastics, but luckily I got replacements on eBay for reasonably low $$."

Like others have said, a -GOOD- backpack goes a long way. I stress the word good. I've had a cheap target backpack literally like explode on me mid ride, with all my groceries with it. Get yourself something snug, with tough ass zippers.  Do yourself a favor and check the weather every fucking day. Believe me, you'll want to know when it's going to rain. I used to try to schedule when I'd leave for work or go home based on the sky. Driving in the rain is something we all have to do once or twice, but with your bike as your only transportation, you're gonna do it a lot more.  You are going to lay your bike down. It is going to happen. It's probably gonna hurt something fierce, but don't let it take the sport away from you. Just stay safe out there.  Don't get comfortable. That's the best advice I can give. Being on a bike all the time gets you really comfy with it, and it's nice to know the hell out of your ride, but the moment you become a comfortable driver is the moment you lose your edge. Don't let that happen. Stay alert at all times, and for gods sakes wear your gear at all times. I know being on a bike it's easy to think 'man I want a quick stop at Mcdonalds, lemme just ride out in my PJs and flipflops...' but don't fucking do that. Because while you're thinking about your McDouble doing 30 in your underwear, the teenager texting while driving dad's SUV is doing 30 over and doesn't see you. Don't die for a burger, bro.

And not just with big wrecks. Several years ago I got a chunk taken out of my right index finger (probably broke it too) on the way to a friends place just a few miles away.   It was like 90F out and a short trip so I left my gear (except helmet) at home. I was probably thinking more about the nice, cold beer in my backpack and the girls that'd be there than the truck full of gravel ahead of me. He hit a pothole and some spilled out. I watched this one piece bounce right up and smash my finger. Last mile or so to my buddies was rough. Bled all over the throttle and my shorts.   Walked into my buddy's backyard, backpack of beer in my left hand, blood all over my right, like ""Uh, will trade beer for bandaids.""

(Number of people who look at me like I have no idea that rain is a thing when I get stuck in a shower is insane) Don't skimp on gear, cheap stuff will usually protect you fine, but spend a little bit more to get something comfortable. Also, because you're riding more its going to wear out faster. Its better to by 1 pair of $100 gloves (full leather) than 5 $20 gloves Helmets double as a convenient carrying case for light shopping and for holding your gloves. Don't be an idiot like me...if it starts snowing call a friend. I almost wrecked like 5 times when I got stuck at work in the snow and though I should be fine getting home.

motorcycles,3dm10d,conairh,3,Fri Jul 17 17:49:00 2015 UTC,Magnificent. Highly recommend.  You can generally ride in anything except ice. So if you live in the north not a great idea. I live in the PNW and there are maybe 2 - 4 weeks of days where I look outside at the frost and decide on a different way to work.  The rest of the time its maybe raining half the time so I have some descent rain gear and I go for it.  You have to be aware of the visibility issues for cars in rain. They see even less than in the sun. I wear high viz and white helmet when the weather is shit.  There are some good rain riding tutorials but generally just slow the hell down and be smooth.  You can carry a fair amount on a bike with the proper luggage and you can always rent a car if you need to move something really big.  Every commute is a little adventure.  EDIT: The high viz will be even more important if you fall off the bike.

motorcycles,3dm10d,Kassb,3,Fri Jul 17 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've riden for a year on a SV 650, here is my tips :  A tank bag and a few straps to put some of your shopping on the passenger seat helps carrying a surprisingly large amount of stuff. (I dont use a back pack.) Keep the straps in the bike, you never know when youll need them.  Riding in the rain is fun when you choose to, but it absolutely sucks when its the only option, so get a full 1 piece anti rain equipement, and keep it with the bike at all time.  Maintenance : when your only transport is a bike and you are broke, you might get tempted to skip on maintenance, well thats ""fine"" ish if you skip changing engine oil for a few month, but be smart enought with your budget to never skip a change of tires, or spy joint, or whatever could get you killed. Life isn't worth the price of a pair of tires.  Tires : dont go for the full sporty tires just for the perfect grip on dry road, choose tires that will also be extremely decent in the rain.   If there is not a set of tools under the rear seat, get a cheap set, when it your only ride, it sucks to stay at home just for a couple of loose screws, even if you know nothing about mechanics, you learn fast when you have no other choice."

When I was in college the only thing I needed my car for was for delivering pizzas, which was good money. Probably not an option on the bike without luggage and a cool manager, but you could always find a different job. Also it made going back home for breaks much more convenient as I could take luggage and didn't need to rely on the train or bus. These are both things you can easily work around with a bike.  If you don't have a garage corrosion will be a problem. Take preventative measures. Get a good cover. Keep the chain lubed. Bike should be kept clean and waxed. Road salt in the winter will be your number one enemy.   Speaking of which winter will suck. If it gets snowy or icy I'd recommend putting the bike away for the winter.   Also be aware of and budget for repairs due to drunk people dropping your bike, especially in a college town."
motorcycles,3dm10d,shakeszilla,2,Fri Jul 17 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"A motorcycle is my main mode, but i have a car as a secondary mode. I ride most everyday, but I have a wife and we do large grocery shopping trips every two weeks. I could sell my car since she has one but some days, when it's extremely hot, or flash flooding everywhere i take the car.  So I have a few things that help. Saddle bags, expandable ones. These are great for shopping, you can fit a lot of stuff in them and work perfectly for the single guy. I use a tail bag everyday for my commute to work so i don't have to wear a backpack but sometimes on my way home i want to stop and get some things but really don't want to leave my laptop in my tail bag while i'm shopping. This is kind of a pain but I've learned to plan ahead and if i want to grab something on the way home ill bring a backpack as well, and stop at a small store, run in for 5 minutes, get what i need and get out. Usually I can watch my bike while i'm doing this.  Everything takes more time, stopping to get a pack of smokes, or a drink on the way to work? Gotta gear up, ride to the gas station, take off helmet, gloves, unzip jacket maybe, then gear up again when you leave. Whatever, it's worth it because i'm on two wheels but the days i don't get enough sleep, or am hungover .. this tends to be more work than it's worth.  Rain is fun, sitting in wet jeans all day is not. Riding in the winter can get rough. You have to get more gear and your hands get freezing. Not worth it when it's below 35ºF. Same things goes with heat, if it's more than 100ºF and more than 50% humidity.. ugh... every few days it's nice to hop into my A/C car and just relax on the way to work plus it keeps my battery on my car charged."

I've been on 2 wheels for 5 years (24 now).  I work full time and go to school part time.  It depends on the climate you live in.  If you live up north you can't ride in the snow.  I would never ever ride in the snow.   I live in Florida so it rains every day.  Wherever I go on the bike I always have my pack pack for supplies or in case I'm buying something.  Essentials:  -Helmet -Boots -Jacket (leather) -gloves  The gloves don't need to be worn every time, and neither should the jacket.  You just need the gloves for night riding, and the jacket for trips longer than 10 minutes.  The reason I say that is your hands can still freeze in the summer at night, and you will get wicked sunburnt without a jacket.  I've never had a problem with heat in Florida.  Just keep riding.  The jackets that are layered are popular here, but I use solid.  You also want a jacket in general to protect your clothes from bug acids, and from absorbing the road smells.  I also recommend leather because it is somewhat waterproof.  Boots should cover all of your ankle and part of your calf.  This is because of all the crap and rocks on the road that will damage your body.  I also work a job as a manager where I wear dress clothes and haven't had a problem with being professionally ready for work.  I carry moose (spelling? Lol) and a comb in my backpack to get rid of helmet hair.  Depending on how long you plan to ride, all these things will become a part of how you dress.  TL;DR:  wear flip flops, shorts and no helmet with definitely no sunglasses or anything.  Also ride around shirtless.  That also helps"

I plan on getting rid of my expensive car (Subaru Impreza), fixing my junker truck, and using that for transporting bikes, laundry, and groceries. Will definitely be using during the winter months though. I'm in NY as well and rode through a lot of the winter on my TW200, but sometimes it's just plain unsafe. No need to risk it unnecessarily.  TLDR: ride most of the time, get a junker vehicle for when you can't ride."
motorcycles,3dm10d,and_yet_and_yet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"If you want a 2-wheeled vehicle to replace a car, a big scooter is actually more practical than a motorcycle. This is due to storage space--a motorcycle has almost none. A motorcycle is moreso for performance and aesthetic than for practicality. Now, many people modify their motorcycle into being more practical by fitting saddlebags, windshields, etc, but that's at the cost of some aesthetic and maneuverability."

motorcycles,3dm10d,bigBastardDude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"last summer i drove my car for ~300km, and rode the bike for ~20k km. so it's my sole vehicle when the weather is suitable(not snowing).  time in transit is shorter and what you lose in gearing up you make up in riding. Especially if you filter a bit. It takes me 30min to get to work with the car and about 15 with the bike.  as others have said a topcase/side cases are a must. I drop my laptop into one of the sidecases in the morning and drop the shopping in the other one in the evening.   get good gear and heated grips for rainy & colder weather. they can make a rainy ride nice. get another set of gear for hot summer days. Something that ventilates well.  I know having two sets of gear seem excessive at first, but it's just so much easier to find a good set for cold and another good set for hot days. It's very hard to find something that performs well in both situations.   get some raincoat(or another similar product) for your visor for rainy weather. or you'll be swiping your visor constantly and that gets the gloves wet and cold.  if you have the money, get a sena 20s/cardo for radio, music and phone usage.  edit: and parking, parking is lovely...."

It becomes an acquired taste that I love. But let's be real. No decent storage compartment, even with panniers. You'll get filthy from the road, smoke, dust, etc. Cold days are colder, hot days makes you sweat like a pig. Maintenance may not that much cheap that a crap car.  Is it doable? Of course it is. I do it daily, riding 100km every day to work. But know where you are getting into.

It also makes weekend riding/canyon carving far less enjoyable because you ride every day and it gets frustrating.  I wouldnt trade it though, I really enjoy riding. Call me weird.

You might be better off stripping and painting the one you've got, if it's not damaged otherwise.  Talk to the guys on 650 CC&D about a stock exhaust.  They'll probably just tell you to chop it off, but someone might be able to hook you up with one that is in better shape.

It's possible that the tire didn't look flat at 10psi when you got on the bike, but then did look flat at 10psi when you had the weight of braking put on it (and were probably looking more closely).  One of the things the motorized bicycle folks often do is fill their tubes with Slime. Makes the tubes more resilient against puncture, and if there is a small hole, it'll seal it up. I'm one who'd put new tubes on any time the tire is off the rim, maybe I'll put some Slime in my tubes as well."

They have no interest in logic or anybodies safety just their own shortsighted opinions.  She is right about one thing we are choosing a more dangerous mode of transportation.  We're the only ones who can take steps to be safer.  Personally if motorcycles were somehow made just as safe as cars they wouldn't be much fun.

Also, if I'm slinging through tall trees, I can join the 2 together and get almost 200' now.  And no, that was a second Heli. An R66. My buddy flies it for a company locally, and he can use it personally time to time. I think they charge him $150 and give him a certain # of hours per year he can rent it.

A sweet ride in the serene snow. And a sweet ride in the air for the bike too.  Edit:  Sorry to ruffle some feathers on this comment having downs, but every time I see some sort of exotic stunt, or exotic handling conditions or stunts, it is usually done with sports bikes or dirt bikes. This is a first that I seen a cruiser being taken to a different environment and handled well there.  There was another video I discovered that a group of Harley riders have been making videos of riding around the streets with a consistent wheelie. That is something I haven't seen before, but have seen alot of wheelies with sports bikes and dirt bikes.  And another video that I seen, not on /r/motorcycles, but a video gif of a cop standing upright on what I believe passenger pegs, arms out to the side, and the bike cruised along.  It is videos like this that make me like my cruiser, and knowing that I can be able to tackle such handling conditions if I practice and gain the confidence, much like these riders (and of course, learn and learn the limitations of my ride, a tool of transportation)."

motorcycles,3dnah8,Beardologist,2,Fri Jul 17 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"Great forum to use as a resource : www.dotheton.com   Sign up and then use the advanced search to see if your specific model and year has been worked on in the ""projects -cafe racer"" section.   Just so you know; people are helpful but when it comes to Cafe Projects no one really wants to help and instead want to tell you how they would do it and what they would use.   Furthermore, the dudes on that forum have been doing it for a long time and have seen all sorts of shit. Because of this they pretty much preach 2 things : 1. don't cafe it! restore it instead! and 2. Don't do that mod/change it's unsafe! stick with stock!   Despite that BS they will know stuff that is impossible to find resources for online, they really do know a lot.  I would 100% buy the Haynes/Clymer manual for the bike you intend to work on. It will tell you everything, it's like the bible to your bike.   When you need help with something specific, always worth a shot to youtube it. For example: don't know how to make a cafe racer seat out of fibreglass but want to? there's videos on how to do that.  Good luck buddy.  I recommend you start with a relatively small sized Honda/Suzuki/Yamaha. IMO Stick with Honda/Suzuki and go for either a small Honda CB125cc to about 250cc max or an older 80s Suzuki GS. Tons and tons of parts for those bikes on ebay for cheap.   EDIT  To answer some of your questions : if you're from London UK I don't know exactly what those bikes could go for...A lot of sellers these day know about the cafe resurgence and thus sell at an overpriced value. If it runs I'd expect to pay minimum 1000 Canadian. Sometimes you get lucky and the engine runs but something else sucks/is broken and you can get sub 1k prices.  As for keeping the deep harley sound you don't really need to worry about that. Modern sport bikes sound different but older 60-70-80s street bikes sound deep and throaty. Of course they will never be as loud or as deep (think of the potato potato sound of an idling Harley) as a 1200cc Harley but with certain megaphone exhausts they can get loud and sound great.  There are plenty of megaphone exhausts with multiple baffles (I have one with 7) on ebay for fair prices. Those things sound great."

motorcycles,3dnah8,parkwood60,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"Best bit of advice is to buy something that already runs, not something from the scrap yard. Most cafe racers these days are just regular old bikes playing dress up. The changes are cosmetic. You will have a lot more fun if you buy something close to being rideable to start with, otherwise it will end up back in the scrap yard in a few months.  I would suggest the Suzuki GS400-450, or the Honda CB400-450 from the 80s as a good cheap start. By ""deep sounds of a motor engine"" do you mean a Harley running with straight pipes? It is annoying, and likely illegal for you to ride around like that in the U.K. isn't it?"

Back in my day, we tapped the tank and guessed how much further we could go, usually over-estimating by at least a 300yrd uphill push. We had a little light triggered by a thermistor submerged in gasoline that would tell us when we were running low until it was eaten by the gas it was constantly submerged in. Our bikes had muscle but, they ain't pansy bodybuilders with glistening abs. Our bikes only have one mode and it's called ""Fuckin' Awesome"" mode.

motorcycles,3dmjrq,conyak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:10:03 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken, most motorcycles don't have an alternator. You have your regulator/rectifier along with a stator that has a rotating flywheel probably attached to the crankshaft to create power for your battery and what not. I'd recheck the connections and voltages. Maybe you missed something between the stator, the regulator and the batter."
motorcycles,3dmjrq,rei_load,2,Fri Jul 17 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken, most motorcycles don't have an alternator   Actually, most motorcycles do have an alternator. The most common type is a permanent magnet alternator. A spinning permanent magnet rotor (typically on the end of the crankshaft) spins next to a stationary coil (the stator) whose AC output (why it's called an alternator) goes into a rectifier unit which converts the AC into DC. Most often the rectifier stage is combined with the voltage regulator.  The alternative to an alternator (AC output) would be a DC output generator.  Alternators can be of the PM type or of the excited field type (powered rotating electromagnet). The rotating electromagnet type can use slip rings (e.g. any of the automotive-style alternators placed behind the cylinder bank of an inline 4) or a rotor and brushes (my '81 CB900C). There have also been alternators with an excited rotating field energized by a stationary electromagnet, like my '77 KZ650B1."

The more North you go however, the less predictable the clarity will get. In Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, it isn't uncommon to hit 20+ degrees on May 1st, only to have it snow again by the 4th. Same thing once you hit the 2nd week of Oct. Just keep an eye on a reliable weather app and be prepared."

motorcycles,3dmdcu,farh303,2,Sat Jul 18 02:17:14 2015 UTC,I started riding mid/late April this year (cold but doable with proper gear) and if the bike wasn't off the road to save $ I would ride into Oct/Nov depending on snow coverage like I did last year.  The odd nice clear day in Jan/Feb is always nice too for that winter itch.   You can push it further of course but it all depends on where you are.  I saw a few riders actively riding in the middle of winter in Toronto aside from the days when snow covered the roads.
motorcycles,3dmdcu,KingLuis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"Im assuming you canceld insurance to save the money, if you dont mind me asking did you have to pay out the premium to do that ?

motorcycles,3dmdcu,watch4sharx,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"It all worked out right at the end of my policy so no payout, but I just put fire and theft on it to maintain insurance so I appear to have constant insurance."
motorcycles,3dmdcu,UnfortunateLuka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:51:34 2015 UTC,In Ontario we really only pay for the riding months but they usually spread payments out over 12 (something like 80% of the policy is the summer months).  Next year I'm going to see if I can drop it to fire and theft over winter to see if that saves anything or if I'll have to pay to do that.
motorcycles,3dmdcu,UnfortunateLuka,2,Sat Jul 18 18:54:05 2015 UTC,ya its very random.  i believe riding season this year will carry out into the beginning of november before it gets too cold and wet.  usually starts after the last storm in march hits.

motorcycles,3dmdcu,Flinx98,2,Fri Jul 17 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"This is my first full year of riding actually, but no, I probably won't be doing october-Jan due to the fact that I now have a full time job. Public transportation is not an option as it's too far/takes too long and I can't rely on my motorcycle 100%, so I'll be buying a car come octoberish. Suiting up is not fun for work purposes, but I might continue through the winter anyways for fun/leisure. The reason I could do it last winter was because I was in school and didnt have obligations for anything. Now I do so I can't risk being wrecked by the weather.    i.e.- Today it was pouring when i left work, had to take an alternate route to avoid highways cause I didn't have my safety vest with me/highway when its pouring is just asking for trouble, and it took me 50 minutes instead of 20 to get home. That's not really acceptable for work----what if that happened when i woke up in the morning or something. I'd be very late."
motorcycles,3dmdcu,Flinx98,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats understandable, luckily enough for me my job requires me to drive constantly. So I can get away with being late a little here n there. But even so I wont be riding during winter."
motorcycles,3dmdcu,Flinx98,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:10 2015 UTC,April to December usually in Toronto if you're fucking brave.  You have to watch for ice in the morning/evening at the extreme ends of the season. The presence of salt is mostly what dictates when to bring out/put away my bike. Salt and motorcycles are NOT friends. Bridges and tunnels get slick with brine as soon as overnight lows approach freezing.

motorcycles,3dmdcu,lgop,2,Sun Jul 19 00:08:48 2015 UTC,Honestly the best time to buy is late fall early winter. Buy a used bike at a dealership and try to get winter storage thrown in.

For example, they might have groups going out every hour.  For a cool new bike you wanted to get there early.  Now that I live in the middle of nowhere, you show up and sign up to ride the model you want, then wait a while until they have a group to head out.    I'm sure there are other ways of setting things up too.  I only have experience with two dealerships."

Closest I've gotten was at a Triumph dealer and he said that's the last, make-or-break, step after a price is agreed upon and there is either approved financing or proof of personal finances.  I have a story about trying to get a test ride on a cheap, used and abused, F4i at my local Japanese bike dealership. Skip to the TL;DR if you don't care to read a block of text.  When I was looking for a new (to me) bike, I went into a Japanese bike dealer because it showed they had a 25k mile F4i on the lot for $2500 or so. It was in pretty ragged shape aesthetically, dropped on both sides, but I digress. I walked into the dealership with $2k in $100 bills in my pocket and asked for someone to talk to about the bike. It was outside and I'd already sat on it. I liked it. The bike wasn't perfect, but it was a step up from my 500cc thumper. Anyways, I had the front desk page a sales associate, and the lady told me to sit at a table to the side of the desk and someone would be right with me. 5 minutes went by. Nothing. 10 mintues. Still nothing. 20 Minutes. People had walked in and immediately been helped when they were looking at new bikes. I specified I wanted to look at the F4i outside. After almost a half hour of twiddling my thumbs, I just got up and walked out. In their defense, I'm a college aged kid and they had no idea I brought cash, but they had a half dozen associates free at any point in time and none of them even attempted to help me.   TL;DR - I need to find a new Japanese bike dealer. The ones by me won't even acknowledge your presence unless you're looking at a new expensive bike and appear to have enough money for an on-the-spot sale."
motorcycles,3dmbe0,lgop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its probably the age thing, I'm middle aged so they can smell the sale. I remember going to a car dealership with my dad when I was in my 20's and the service was amazing."
motorcycles,3dmbe0,SVTf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"Funny thing was, my dad was with me during that story. I had him give me a ride and tag along. Best case, I had my gear in his car and I'd ride home. He stayed with me though just in case we couldn't make a deal! They still ignored me! I haven't been back to that dealership since! There's a closer Japanese bike dealership, but it's about 1/3 the size and the number of used bikes they have under $5k you can count on one hand. The dealership I mentioned in my story is on the other side of town and is HUGE. I'm talking a new bike inventory in the hundreds and a solid 50-60 used bikes at any given time. Oh well, it all worked out. I love my current bike and ended up getting it for cheaper than I would have gotten the F4i for!"
motorcycles,3dmbe0,lgop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"THIS!!!  Trust us, get a used bike to start. You will likely only have it for a year and will probably drop it a couple times. Get that out of your system with a used POS, then go buy the bike you want."
motorcycles,3dmbe0,ElwoodPlantagenet,3,Fri Jul 17 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind going below $5k, the Ninja 500 is ergonomically a standard, not a sportbike. Find one well cared for (not ""dropped by previous owner"", no ""needs carbs cleaned"") and it ought to keep you happy for a couple years. But it's ugly and old.   The demo day is a great idea, well worth the drive. You should definitely try an FZ-07.   If nothing at the demo day insists on following you home, a private seller on Craigslist is more likely to let you have a test ride than a dealer in a lot of places. Buying used from random strangers is a whe other can of worms though.   Don't overthink it. It's better to get a non-ideal first bike now than to agonize until you find the perfect one in October, especially since the only way to find out what's right for you is to ride a lot. The one thing I always knew I didn't want was a sportbike. But it turns out nothing else interests me at all."

motorcycles,3dmbe0,SVTf,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know why (well, actually I do and I'll explain in a minute) test rides are HARD to come by. Almost impossible. When I was looking for a bike, the consensus between the 3 dealers of different brands I went to was this: ""Show us the cash, decide on the bike, last step before you sign the papers if everything else is right we'll let you take it around the block with a sales associate following you.""  The reason most dealers won't want to let someone test ride is because unlike a car, a bike can be damaged really easily. Dropping a new bike could cost 4 figures to fix. Plus, there's no place (realistically) for a sales associate to ride, so they have to ride along side you on a different bike. It's a whole ordeal for a dealership to let someone test ride a bike, and they want to know there's a very high likelyhood there will be a sale at the end.   I've heard it's much easier to get a test ride if the dealer knows you, ie. you already have a bike and come in for service enough that he remembers you. (Not necessarily because your bike breaks, but some people ride enough they need oil changes or other minor things every month or two, and they take it to the dealer for such.) That makes sense. If you're just getting into riding, this obviously isn't an option though.   I completely agree with you though. I wish more dealers offered test rides. I'd be much more likely to want to upgrade from my high mileage machine to a brand new shiny model if I was allowed to do more than sit on it. I get the dealers rationale, I really do, but I wish it was different."

motorcycles,3dmbe0,SVTf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:58 2015 UTC,I wish more dealerships were like that. Even if they'd allow you to test ride with a non-committal / refundable deposit that would be better than completely disallowing test rides like I've experienced in the past.

My wife got me a gift card for the driving school as birthday present for my 30th. After I finished the license course a few months later (they are quite comprehensive here, and I had little spare time), I was in the stupid situation of finally being allowed to ride but having no bike. A friend stepped up and offered her R1200GS for me to finish the season on, there were two solid months of riding left. Now, I bought the bone and couldn't be happier.  Tl;dr: when you're responsible, you can ride almost every bike. Buy what you're most happy with and that makes you smile whenever you go to your garage."
motorcycles,3dmbe0,constantbiker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"All the people suggesting test rides from a dealer are pretty optimist in my opinion. I've done demo days but they always require you to be licensed and have full gear. They also asked about years experience, pretty sure ""only the course"" would not have been a good answer. Test rides from dealers are hard to come by and the reason is obvious, some exceptions are possible for used bikes, with cash in hand.  Best bet probably is buying something cheap and generic that already has a few scratches, like a GS 500F, SV 650, ninja 300, 500, 650. Ride it for a year or two while you figure out what kind of riding you're going to end up doing. On that note I would suggest trying a track day after you have a little time on the street. This is my first summer of track days, it's amazing, but if you get that bug you may decide to get something with clip-ons and better suspension as you're second bike."

motorcycles,3dm8gn,PulaskiAtNight,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"The fan automatically ticks on when engine temp is above 200 C or somewhere around there. If yours is on even when you're riding at a brisk pace then you have an issue. Soon your fan will fail and then your bike will really overheat.  You should try to bleed out any air bubbles that might be in your cooling system. Idle the bike and warm it up, then turn it off and wait five minutes or so for the pressure to dissipate. Remove the cap (a glove might be nice in case any hot coolant comes out), any air will come out and you can top off the radiator and put the cap back on.  Air bubbles in your system lower the boiling point of the coolant dramatically, and boiling causes the bike to overheat."
motorcycles,3dm8gn,PulaskiAtNight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's the plan. If that doesn't help should I check the thermostat next? Or maybe just replace with a different type of coolant?

If this doesn't fix anything then before moving on to anything like your thermostat, you should definitely try and verify that the problem really exists. Does the temperature light on your speedo go on? Is the problem still there when you're riding in colder temperatures (try going out at night)?"

Not sure whether any would actually be better than the Rogue, but they just appeared to be more aerodynamic at first glance.

Walk away, drink something, have smoke, go talk on the phone if you want but don't work on your bike buzzed. Since you've admitted to being a wrench nooby your going to get frustrated a fair amount so think ahead before you pick up that wrench.  Also a quality torque wrench pays for itself not a cheap HF one that is going to break or worse under torque something that has to be done right."
motorcycles,3dm929,Jbook815,2,Fri Jul 17 12:24:56 2015 UTC,"More riding time.   now first thing is first. Ride your ride, that means if you dont feel comfortable taking a turn at high speeds, slow down. On the other side of that, you need to make sure that you are not riding places where you end up going much slower than traffic during a turn, so cars dont all of a sudden have someone going 15 in a 60 (to use an extreme example).  Here is what I would do. Every day, really early in the morning to avoid traffic, go out for a 30 minute ride. This ride should have left and right turns if you can get that to happen. Ride that ride everyday until you are comfortable with the route.   Once you are comfortable, just go out riding for 30 minutes on different roads. Each weekend plan a route and take a couple hour ride.  Eventually you will get comfortable with turning.  Ohhh and something else you can do to help. Go to a parking lot. Look over your shoulder and drive in a circle. Make the circle tighter and tighter as you get better. When you know you can make a tight turn like that, you know how far your bike can lean, it will give you confidence in other, faster turns.  The other thing is, find that banking turn. Then practice taking the turn for a week."
motorcycles,3dm929,gamerplays,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"find a road with some curves and make laps. just ride and wont worry about speed too much, get comfy and learn the lines, get smooth with your throttle control (learn about it if you havnt already) and start to subtly increase your speed.  practice turning into turns later and compensate by countersteering faster, and remember to roll the throttle through the turn. i like to roll on just a bit before i initiate the countersteering. the faster you go the faster and more aggressively you countersteer, remember turning in later is ideal, just keep your movements smooth and controlled. its amazing how fast you can flick a bike into corners.  also make sure your tires and suspension are in good condition and set properly"

motorcycles,3dm929,Grass-NaturesLatrine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think most will say that the best way to really raise your skills is just to ride. Take a weekend to yourself and just get lost riding. You'll end up on roads you don't know and turns you aren't expecting. I know for me, I took the long way to work when I first got my bike because it was a 55mph road and I was a little nervous about highway riding as well. However, once you finally do it, you'll realize that there is no real challenge. Straight road for most of it and riding straight at 45 requires the same technique as riding at 75, which you obviously have. Try not to think about it too much and enjoy the ride."

I remember when I was totally new, 30mph felt flying and I didn't want to take it much past 50.  Eventually, you open it up, hit 90 and then everything slower feels slow. You just have to build it up. Push it just a little bit harder every time.   Whether that's taking a corner a little harder or faster, or gunning it just a wee bit more in the straights.  After a while you'll build up your confidence and everything will be good."

If you cower into corners because you are afraid to lean the bike and get your butt off the seat, you always cower into corners.

motorcycles,3dld2w,EvilStig,11,Fri Jul 17 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"I recently ordered a special (and horrendously overpriced) RAM-compatible mount for my bike from Motorcycle Hornig GmbH, little plastic and aluminum bit that weighs maybe 2 oz. I was perplexed when the shipping charge (from the UK) came to $35, despite a shipping estimate of 2-3 weeks... well, it got here in only a week and a half, but what arrived was a small, heavy box. Inside was a product catalog weighing close to 2 lbs, several advert leaflets, a crappy ballpoint pen, and a single page of instructions, in German, with accompanying photos that appear to depict mounting for a different product. I haven't a clue how to install it, since the product page led me to believe the bar cap would just pop off and you'd insert the piece, but it's apparently not that simple (thanks, Deutschland...)  In the end my total came to around $70 for an underwhelming product, and I feel ripped off, like I basically just paid postage for them to send me a ton of spam mail.  Buyer beware.  EDIT: Clarification: the mount isn't RAM brand, just RAM compatible. It's a custom part since RAM doesn't make one that fits my bike."

motorcycles,3dld2w,DooDooBrownz,0,Fri Jul 17 12:45:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but do you order stuff often on the internet? You weren't forced into buying it from them, they didn't charge you 35$ shipping without you knowing it. Yeah it sucks that they put a catalog in there, but most likely international shipping is always more expensive than domestic, so I'm guessing even without that catalog the price of international shipping with brokerage fees would be pretty dams close to 35$. You knew before hand the shipping charges. next time, look a little longer online, plus like someone said earlier, Ram is a US company, and you would have payed a lot less ordering from them or amazon"
motorcycles,3dld2w,alleif,3,Fri Jul 17 14:31:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. $35 is a completely unreasonable international shipping rate, even for a 3 lb package (you can flat-rate up to 4 lbs for $25), and the fact that they managed to bump it up from 2 oz to 3 lbs by including unwanted junkmail before shipping it, is unreasonable as well. If they hadn't included that catalog, I should have expected to spend no more than $12 shipping, max.  And yes I know what I'm talking about, because not only do I buy things on the internet constantly, I also sell them and work with wholesalers.   The mount isn't made by RAM. I balked at the price but ended up buying it because Hornig is the only company that makes a mount for my bike. They had monopoly power, and they abused it to make me pay to ship myself a magazine, and even so probably skimmed more money off the top in invisible ""handling"" charges. The fact my box came packed with marketing garbage was just insult to injury."

Oh and the sound of a crossplane R1 with a toce exhaust system.   As many will say, there is not a single recording in the world that will do these justice. Plus you can actually ""feel"" the sound in person. It is absolutely incredible, and that alone makes attending at least one bike night worth it."
motorcycles,3dk9tk,ishootpentax,2,Fri Jul 17 00:01:42 2015 UTC,I think that VTEC ruined the VFR.  That engine had a power curve you could draw with a ruler and those fantastic gear driven cams until they slapped VTEC on there and made a big flat spot right in the middle of the power band.

Worst case you end up selling it for roughly what you paid, or even lose a hundred or two. I'd make it run though. You could then sell it and make money (maybe, depends on what was wrong) and repeat!  Edit: Personally, either late fall or early winter I plan to buy a bike on craigslist that doesn't run.
