EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,happyfinesad,6,Tue Jul 21 16:57:58 2015 UTC,I've never seen him in men's clothing. Weird.
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,obmckenzie,4,Tue Jul 21 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"Right, seems like his transvestite tendencies have diminished as he's gotten older? Does that happen?"
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,happyfinesad,5,Tue Jul 21 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"He tends to adjust a bit based on the crowd and if it's going to be a mass marketed special...  All of his shows here in St. Louis, MO he was very ... not Eddie. Jeans, sport coat, sneakers... not even a suggestion of makeup..."
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,obmckenzie,3,Tue Jul 21 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"That seems counter-intuitive. I mean, people buying his tickets must know who he is, no?"
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,happyfinesad,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"He came to Cincinnati last year and we were sitting next to 2 dudes who had obviously NEVER heard of him. The 2 dudes got so pissed off then tried to start arguing with people about how ""horrible"" Eddie was during the intermission. The seriously left and never came back."
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,insomnic,4,Tue Jul 21 22:37:18 2015 UTC,Why would you even go to a comedy show of a person you've never heard of?
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,sumfartieone,3,Tue Jul 21 23:05:53 2015 UTC,"No idea, possible won tickets or maybe a friend suggested it?  I got the vibe they were a bit right wing and left because he was making left facing joles"

EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,inajeep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"You'd think so, but... I've talked to plenty of people after the shows that didn't know he was a transvestite unless he specifically talked about it during the show. I've seen him 3 times here and only the first time was him being a transvestite part of his show."
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,_THE_WIFE,2,Tue Jul 21 21:25:11 2015 UTC,I found a recent pic of Izzard in drags from April: http://i.imgur.com/S0CG9IB.jpg. Rupaul is often seen dressed as a male on tv nowadays too.
EditingAndLayout,3e2dmv,kriswone,4,Tue Jul 21 20:38:51 2015 UTC,Saw Eddie last year in Boston. Great show. More Eddie gifs!

I had pulled up behind the car in front of me, they stop, wait, the right car doesn't move so they go.  Then I pulled up, waited, looked at the car to my right who at this point had a car behind her. What was she doing? Texting. I went ahead and drove off and looking in my rear view never saw her pull off."

EditingAndLayout,3co6d2,Awken,3,Thu Jul 9 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"This is correct, at least in IL. I was taught in drivers ed that if you don't go when its your turn you yield the right of way to whoever is next. So if no one in the order ahead of you goes, then you now have the right of way."
EditingAndLayout,3co6d2,Reddit_Executive,6,Thu Jul 9 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but in IL, or at least Chicago, right of way is whoever goes first, irrelevant of who arrived at the stop sign first, or if they even stopped.  I hate driving in Chicago."
EditingAndLayout,3co6d2,GeneralRectum,2,Thu Jul 9 15:48:27 2015 UTC,This is the only way to do it.  Being timid at  4 way stops are how you cause accidents. If any of the other cars are hesitating  just go.  Everyone  stops the inching  forwards wondering if they should  go game once somebody  actually  does it.

EditingAndLayout,3co6d2,Lightspeedius,2,Thu Jul 9 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"I hate four way stops. Either give way/yield one way, stop the other. If it's too busy for that, lights or a round-about. Four way stops are too hard for so many drivers."
