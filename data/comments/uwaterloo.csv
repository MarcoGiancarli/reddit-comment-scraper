uwaterloo,3e2pm9,fishscalepanties,6,Tue Jul 21 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"Here's how it works:  On your WatCard you are given two types of Credit - Meal Plan Dollars, and Flex Dollars.  Meal Plan This type of credit can be used in the REV caf, V1 caf and just about any other food outlet on campus. Yes, that includes all Tim Horton's, Subways, etc. However there are a few exceptions to this. You cannot use meal plan dollars for    1) Vending Machines 2) Things from International News 3) And some other special places  (like campus bubble I believe, correct me if I'm wrong)   Regardless of which type of plan you end up buying you will always be given $2000 worth of credit for meal plan per term. Now, when you receive your WatCard you will find your balance to be around $1000. Don't worry, this is because the University takes half of it upfront, but gives you a 50% discount whenever you use meal plan (though sometimes it doesn't always feel like that).   What happens if you have money left over at the end of first term? It gets carried over to your second term. What happens at the end of first year? All Meal plan credits get converted into flex dollar credits. Flex dollar credits DO NOT receive a 50% discount, effectively, the university takes half of your meal plan money at the end of the term.   Flex Dollars Flex dollars are optional, and are used in place of Meal plan dollars for places on campus that do not accept it. For example, you can use flex dollars on vending machines. In addition, flex dollars are mainly used for laundry, and the campus bookstore / clothing store. Yes, you can use flex dollars to buy textbooks, and just about anything else sold on campus that doesn't accept meal plan.   You can add money to your flex dollars at any time either online with a credit card or at SLC. I'm not sure if you can also fill up on Meal plan as well, as I have never tried it.  Note: Again, flex dollars do not receive a 50% discount.  As for what the cafeterias are like, they actually offer more than what you'd expect. They have specials everyday, offer sandwiches, fruits,vegetables, desert, drinks, lunches, dinner, waffles, pizza and a lot more. Now because you're in REV, it doesn't mean you can only go to the REV caf. If you want v1 is close by and a lot of people say that their cafeteria is better.  Just keep in mind that the cafeteria at REV opens at 7 am, and closes around 10:30 IIRC. They do not serve over the Christmas break, and other special holidays.   If you have any more questions I'd be happy to reply (I lived in REV first year).  Edit: Formatting"
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,zainh96,7,Tue Jul 21 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"What happens at the end of first year? All Meal plan credits get converted into flex dollar credits. Flex dollar credits DO NOT receive a 50% discount,   This isn't quite right. Your meal plan credits get converted to ""Transfer MP"" dollars, meaning they don't get the 50% discount but you still need to spend them at Food Services locations (not vending machines etc)."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,Chris24,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,zainh96,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. This helped me so much more than the school website or the email I got regarding my question (they just sent me a link of the site). Since you were in REV first year how was your experience? I don't mind the lack of privacy or whatever, my biggest nerves are getting along with my room mate."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,zainh96,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:28 2015 UTC,"No problem! REV was fun overall You don't mind the shared washrooms or cafeteria after like the first week so if that's another concern don't worry about it. They clean the washrooms once a day (around 10am) but do not clean them on the weekends so they can get messy at times.   As for getting along with your roommates, you should be fine. Almost no one on my floor had trouble with their roommates unless they were trying to cause trouble. Make sure you talk to your room mate about things like bringing people over, cleaning up (it can get messy) and other things that might concern you. One of the things I had trouble with was my roommate snoring. If there's anything you find awkward talking to your roommate about or anything in general talk to your don. Seriously, they're there to help you so don't be shy.   Also, if you're a light sleeper (like me) then REV might be hard to sleep at for most of the time. ""Quiet hours"" are in effect at 11pm during the weekdays, and 1am on the weekends, however those are rarely the times when people stop talking/blasting music out their doors.  In the end, I enjoyed REV. It was very social and you could usually find someone to talk to or hang out with. Enjoy, and good luck in first year!"

uwaterloo,3e2pm9,zainh96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, flex dollars do not get 50% discount. Maybe there's some special exception to this, however from my own experience that is not the case.  I knew a lot of people who blew through their 2k too. It really depends on what you buy.  Do you really need a coke with every drink? Are you sure you want to buy 3 bags of chips for one night?  You can eat considerably well, and still have money left over at the end of the term. It really depends on what kind of person you are. You can get a sense for how your spending is after the first month or so. Also, if your parents live nearby and you go home every weekend you will save a lot on food."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,names_are_for_losers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:23 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you get the 50% discount when you buy food whether it comes from the meal plan or from flex dollars. It's not tied to the meal plan dollars it's tied to the cafeteria being who charged it I think.
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,zainh96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh, okay I see. Thanks for the clarification."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,RussetWolf,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:52 2015 UTC,"Basically there are big sections of time that meals are served, and the prepacked stuff is almost always available. There is a caf in REV (and other places that take meal plan on campus, like DC) and usually has similar options weekly (always at least one vegetarian meal) but the rez cafs do special event meals (thanksgiving, for example).  I would recommend the plan with the minimum flex dollars. They are not worth it. Note that you can transfer flex dollars to meal plan money, which is a better idea of you eat through your balance, and you can always top up."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,RussetWolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:52 2015 UTC,Can I always top up flex dollars or meal plan money (or both)? And thank you for this. Everyone here is very helpful and I am kind of excited to see all of you in person when school starts.
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,WRez_OCH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, you can so it online. The benefit for converting flax dollars to meal plan is that you get the 50% discount (I don't think they take half upfront, of the additional meal plan money you add)."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,TLUL,4,Tue Jul 21 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, welcome to REV! REV has it's own cafeteria with made-to-order food and other selections. There is no scheduled time to eat, the caf is open until 10:30 p.m. most nights and your meal plan also works at work other eateries across campus.  I can't quite answer the flex dollar question as meal plans & cafeterias are operated by UW Food Services so maybe you can find out more on their website. Hope that helped."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,nanogoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"Here's how it works in practice: the cheapest option takes some amount of money, takes half up front, and puts the other half on as balance. If you spend it on food at the Food Services locations within your first year, you get a 50% discount, so it's essentially getting all of your money's worth. If you have any left over, you lose the discount in future years. If you pay for a more expensive option, or top up your meal plan, the excess money goes straight to meal plan dollars. You still get a 50% discount in your first year using this additional money, but you'll notice that half of it was not taken up front - this means that if you start using this money, that's when you actually get a real discount."
uwaterloo,3e2pm9,DcScape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"However much your meal plan is, that the number of dollars loaded onto your Student Card.  You may spend that money on food items anywhere on campus.   The foodplan options are ""scam"" because you can just load up more money if you're out. That's why I'd recommend getting the Light option and load up on more $ if you need it.  Different eating areas have different hours. Check the UWaterloo Food Services website for more information."

She does however follow the textbook pretty closely and assignments come straight from the slides and notes (which makes them VERY doable with some textbook help).   Finished with a high 80, wish I had gone to class though as I would have ended up with a 90 with participation marks."

uwaterloo,3e3dug,gnoolretaw,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:01 2015 UTC,Yes but sometimes the lecture slides are incomplete. They are giving them as a support for in-class note taking.
uwaterloo,3e3dug,Tamaneko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:28 2015 UTC,Never found this to be a problem.  If you don't feel the lectures notes adequately cover it then look up the topic online or in a textbook.

uwaterloo,3e3dug,maaaath,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"I wasn't able to attend a single lecture since I was on co-op when I did it, and I'd say it's feasible with just the notes."
uwaterloo,3e53li,joanne_j,6,Wed Jul 22 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty big switch, and without any math or science courses past high school, I'm not too sure if you would have much of a chance getting into UW engineering or CS. I'm not trying to be mean, just realistic. These programs are ridiculously hard to get into, and hard to stay in as well .  If you're set on eng/CS, I personally would recommend trying to transfer to a different school.   Just my .02!  Edit* Mis-read, thought you said you didn't take math/science in high school. Doesn't really change what I think though."

uwaterloo,3e53li,twinnedcalcite,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"If this is what you really want, I say go for it. Retake the courses and get insane grades on them and just apply with  your university marks as well. If your high school marks(or retaken) are good enough you may be accepted but you will be probably have to start all over in first year. CS requires 93 average at least and SE requires 95 (if that is the program u want). I got in with a mid 70s university average but keep in mind the competition is intense and my high school marks were pretty good(low 90s 3 years ago). The competition for CS and SE is insanely intense now. Make sure to write a killer AIF and get really good marks if you decide to retake those courses."

The experience is fairly good. The work can be kinda boring but there's usually plenty of down-time. Usually shifts are 4 hours long and maybe 2-3 hours will be spent killing time on reddit or doing homework. That said, first few weeks of fall term are the busiest time of the year because of all the frosh coming in with issues getting set up on the wifi and university email.  Overall, it's better than working retail but not quite as good as a decent co-op job (in my experience)."
uwaterloo,3e2pkx,InochGodking,6,Tue Jul 21 14:31:36 2015 UTC,Why are you taking 4 bird courses in a term because of a surgery in early September? Courses are never heavy in weeks 1-3. I'm sure while recovering from surgery you should still be able to do assignments and go to class.  Unless this surgery involves removing your jaw and parts of your brain you do not need to take 4 bird courses.
uwaterloo,3e2pkx,DcScape,7,Tue Jul 21 14:54:07 2015 UTC,I would let the guy getting the surgery be the judge of that
uwaterloo,3e2pkx,iCanHelpU2,5,Tue Jul 21 16:07:01 2015 UTC,I'll be unable to do any work for 2 weeks at the very minimum. For the first week I should be stuck in bed. The 2nd week I'll be able to move but the painkillers will prevent me from focusing. I'm taking 4 bird courses to reduce any stress that is not mandatory. Why does me taking easy courses bother you so much?
uwaterloo,3e2pkx,DcScape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"It just seems unnecessary and a waste of a semester. You'll fill up your electives fast and then will have to take big courseloads later on. If you want to, then go for it. But I think it's a dumb idea. It's not difficult to catch up after missing the first 2 weeks of class. Even while stuck in bed I'm sure you could read up on the material and while on painkillers I'm sure it's still possible to do assignments and stuff.  When I got my wisdom teeth out I did everything as I normally would while pumped on t3s. Did assignments, went to class, and I actually found I was able to focus more because I was so high. Studying gave me this euphoric feeling."
uwaterloo,3e2pkx,tig_22,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"I understand your point of view. I'd like to clarify my surgery to avoid any misunderstandings. I am having both my upper and lower jaw broken and shifted. This is because my current jaw structure has an under bite that is also shifted to 1 side. In addition to having both my upper and lower jawline broken, all 4 of my wisdom teeth will also be removed.  The 2 week estimate is a sheer minimum estimated by my surgeon and orthodontist. This 2 week period represents a time in which a high dosage of painkillers will be placed. I should not have much conscious thought in this period. At best, I'll be back on the 4th week of term, as my surgery is at the start of 2nd week.   The goal of using my electives now is an act of security. I know that I'll be losing 2 weeks in the best case scenario. I will not be able to do normal functions, because both my upper and lower jaw will be broken in addition to the 4 wisdom teeth. In the worst case scenario, I lose 4 weeks."

This is a great example though, of SAF first-years being blindly misled by upper-years that exec positions in AFSA/UWAC/ACE/DECA/GCC are necessary resume stuffing(s) that will guarantee you a decent co-op job (they don't!).  My advice to intentionally anonymous first-year: don't be cocky.

Many of these alumni do return to UW to represent their firms at recruitment events.  Upper-years tend to withdraw from AFSA/related events. Frankly, I'm not surprised that the only Big4 you've met are part of your ""Big4 ECs"" - because they're the only ones who have any incentive to make themselves known (ie. for club succession purposes).

Actually you'd be surprised how uncomfortable some otherwise very skilled programmers are with recursion and functional programming, so having this course is pretty useful.  241 and 251 are more about demystifying the computer. Sure maybe you can be a decent programmer without understanding anything about the magic box you give commands to, and yeah you're probably never going to build circuits or program in Assembler, but having a  deeper understanding down to the level of bits and gates can give you a lot of insight on occasion."

uwaterloo,3dxa7r,GoodWorkBobandis,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:14:08 2015 UTC,"With FWB, both partners are training themselves to use the other. Rather than a human, the opposite is seen as an object to be used, whether for sexual or emotional satisfaction. The problem is that, though they want the fun of a relationship without the commitment, by doing the fun stuff, they create a commitment. When the relationship breaks up, each partner will feel emotionally damaged, though they may not realize it. In the future, when they meet a partner they would like to marry, it will be more difficult to commit, especially once married since they are used to only staying in the relationship for the benefits, and not the drawbacks. If you can't commit to a relationship now, it may be quite difficult to not be part of the 50% of marriages that fail. Based on that you can also get into why living with your partner is a bad idea as it significantly raises the probability of divorce. You may want to date now, but like you said, you are moving around quite a lot. If you can't have the self control to wait, you probably aren't ready to date. As well, if you aren't dating to marry, you should break up. Meaning, you should only date if you see yourself potentially marrying the other person, and you should only continue dating while you think it is true."

That said if you want to it is fine to take a smaller course load. CS 349 is more work than CS 341 in terms of time (assuming you understand the concepts in CS341, UI is a bit less conceptually difficult) and CS 370 is about the same as CS 341 in terms of both workload and conceptual difficulty.

Does it make finding transit information easier for you?"
uwaterloo,3dvh8h,sh4d3,5,Mon Jul 20 00:19:28 2015 UTC,I haven't installed it as I rarely use transit in Waterloo. But from pictures provided on Play store it seems useful for finding what time the bus will be at a stop which helps plan when I'd go to a bus stop. I often just miss a bus and have to wait 10+ min for another one this app seems like it would help with that.   Also looks like a light weight app with a defined purpose. I like apps that dont try to do too much and this seems like it does just enough for Waterloo transit purposes.

uwaterloo,3dubak,Refundquestionloo,8,Sun Jul 19 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"If you look on Quest under the finance section for the term, it might say that some of your refund was sent somewhere else (somewhat confusingly, it'd be listed under Charges).  If you received OSAP funding, some of your refund was likely sent back to them directly.  Also keep in mind that if you're still taking four courses this term, then the refunded course's original cost would be much less than the cost of each of your first four courses."
uwaterloo,3dubak,Chris24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is what's happening. To confirm you'll need to wait for Student Accounts to get back to you.   You only actually pay for up to 2.5 units. Your 2.0 units (4 courses) are charged at 100%. Your 5th course is charged at 50%. Anything beyond that is not charged. So if you have a lab in addition to 5 courses, then you're enrolled in 2.75 units, so dropping a lecture to 2.25 units means that you only get back 50% of 0.25 units. Perhaps your friend also only enrolled in 2.0 units to begin with, so dropping a course means he gets the full 0.5 units worth of fees back (or 50% if in the WD period).   Also, each faculty pays different fees. Engineering pays a crap tonne for their courses so 50% being $600 is possible, while in something like Arts or Science $600 is closer to the full cost of the cost anyway.   As I say, that's a lot of speculation but there is a lot more going on behind the scene than just dropping a course and getting a set fee back."

uwaterloo,3dsnkd,SidusKnight,12,Sun Jul 19 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"What ACN sells is their MVNO cell phone plans.  There's two revenue streams for franchisees, member signups ""bonus"" and the commissions. The first is the more attractive revenue stream and is where the MLM/pyramid scheme vibe comes from. From online posts, ACN can't legally advertise this as the main revenue stream for obvious reasons so they market the commission part.  The commissions come from each customer you signup for the phone plans. You get a fraction of a percent (depending on your distance to the ACN franchisee who signed them up) of the monthly bills those phone plan customers pay. They claim you can make a lot of money this way but the commission rate is far too low to make meaningful income. ACN mentions the magic 7 number, which is the layers you need beneath you to make money. This is exponential growth that's overly optimistic. Most people won't even get a 3 layer network beneath them, let alone 7."

I stayed in V1 and got that 'experience' that you're referring to.  However, there are some things I'd like to point out.  First, if you like to go clubbing and to bars you most likely won't be able to do that with first years primarily because many are underage. Now yeah, some are nineteen and you'll find that you're celebrating your floor mates' nineteenth birthdays rather often since many people turn nineteen in their first year.   Second is maturity."

I lived in SJ during my first year, and I find the community to be very welcoming and encouraging. There are also a lot of upper years, so you will be able to interact with people closer to your age.  Honestly, I think the ""university experience"" is dependent on what you want out of it, like what I got out of it was knowing a lot more people than I would have living off campus, since everyone was living close by. I think that's really the only thing you miss out on, the convenience of living close to everyone and the willingness to hang out that comes from that convenience."
uwaterloo,3drbql,Kev-bot,0,Sat Jul 18 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"+1 for the colleges over the other residences.   I was in SJ first year as well, and am not religious at all.

Living off campus with other students lets you meet people outside class/year and you'll probably be one of the few first years to be living off campus so you can actually host house parties. If you really want to have the university experience, you still can without living on campus but it'll be harder for sure. It's really up to you. You have to be proactive about finding parties and making friends. The best way to make a lot of friends is to host your own parties and you can do that when you're living off campus.  Don't worry about age. I knew lots of people who held previous degrees/ worked after HS and I didn't even know they were much older until years later."

Sometimes when we would party they would come, some other times they hung out with the friends they had that were their age and it wasn't weird at all.   As for your other questions all I can say the 23 year old in this case had done a decent amount of traveling and living alone but he still ended choosing rez. Thing is 4 months in (after first semester), he told me he wanted to move out cuz he thought rez was too expensive and he was having problems with is roomate (I was in REV), he ended  up staying the rest of the year.  Some people did moved out after first semester on my floor thou, so it is possible. Maybe you should look into that : doing 4 month rez and subletting the rest of the year."

uwaterloo,3drbql,LinearGoose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:44:30 2015 UTC,"It can definitely be weird to be constantly around a bunch of 18 year olds when you're more than a few years older: I spent four years working after my 2A term so I know the feeling. I'd advise against residence: it was fairly enjoyable at 17, but would probably have been much less enjoyable if I were to do it now.  Try to avoid taking elective/non-time-critical first year courses in the fall (or even winter) terms if you want to dodge that crowd. Hang out around academic or social clubs to meet people and talk to people who are at a similar place in their life. That said, you'll still probably notice a slightly different outlook on life between you and people who've been at university since they graduated from high school, that's just life. It also kind of sucks to see half your social circle graduate every single term. You might want to try to get to know some grad students as well, since they'll probably be more similar to you than most undergrads are.  Course-wise it's fine. Assuming you're coming to university with a positive attitude (here because you want to be, not because you feel obligated to) and have gotten used to work ethic, time management etc in your time away, you'll probably find school hilariously easy compared to most of your classmates.  Edit: To emphasize something that other people here aren't saying/don't really understand: it's generally true that the 17/18 year olds will be happy to hang out with you: there's no problem there. The question is whether you want to spend all your time hanging out with them, and you probably won't want to after a week or so."

Went to university at 17 because that's what you do after finishing HS, and went into CS because I was apparently good at math and programming, and got kind of miserable when school was easy and I didn't like any of the future prospects (not a fan of software dev work). Couple that with being in D-stream and getting really sick of school after three terms, I ended up deciding to take a year to sort out my life and it kind of grew from there.

uwaterloo,3drj7r,worldwise001,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:28:07 2015 UTC,"It depends. In a thesis-based program you're doing a long-term project (1+ years), whereas in courses you only do a few months (2 if you're lucky) of research, and generally unless you follow up afterwards, it won't be published nor would it be meaningful.  Recruiters who aim for specifically thesis-based master's students generally are looking to fill a specialized need at the company, usually related to the thesis. Coursework master's candidates on the other hand (I believe) would fall into the same bucket as bachelor's candidates in terms of recruiting/hiring pipeline in general, i.e. for general software engineering positions.  Of course, people sometimes deviate from this. AFAIK everyone has a slightly different path they take."

Outside known costs (Housing & School fees) I say that spending can be pretty low if you're smart about it. Weekly things like groceries, cosmetic items, laundry, and a bit of entertainment spending can be kept at around $150 a month.  Keep in mind how much you spend on food is completely dictated by just how much you as an individual eat, how often you eat out, and of course if you opted to have a meal plan on campus or not. Hope this helps!"

I knew that I was going to shit my pants.  I started to get up and as soon as got off the seat I started again loudly and I could feel my shorts fill up with feces. I walked to the front and whispered my emergency to the prof. She was appalled but quickly regained her composure.

uwaterloo,3dnfc3,sievernich,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"It's the edge case that happens when every student tries to access Jobmine the last ~4 hours or so before rankings/postings close, so we need a system that can scale in performance without being a huge money sink.    They also can't port everything over to AWS because of regulations (user's data must be stored on a server that is physically accessible and can only be accessed by authorized personnel)."

uwaterloo,3dnfc3,WaterlooWaits,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:36:00 2015 UTC,Senior coops?  The only different between this multi-million dollar failure and the last multi-million failure (the first WaterlooWorks) is that a software company created this one and coop students created the last one.  Perhaps the issue is not technical.  Perhaps CECA doesn‚Äôt know what JobMine does or what their business processes are.  How else can you explain that new timeline?  It is all testing. Have they even converted the JobMine data.  CECA should own this.  Do they know what they are doing?
uwaterloo,3dmq34,BaraccoliObama,15,Fri Jul 17 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"So glad they've been consistently checking for WatCards/ID#s at CIF. I've never seen the place as empty as it has been recently...mind you I've only been regularly going for like a month and a half, but still. Empty gym = no more playing musical weightlifting chairs for equipment 5-6x per week for an hour and a half.  Also if they could maintain the rowing machines a little better that'd be nice. With the exception of one of the four at CIF it's like trying to pull knotted rope through a hole while sliding on top of a washboard. PAC's machine is practically brand new but I feel super guilty doing long workouts on it because there's only one and people would be waiting for a while."
uwaterloo,3dmq34,JaffyTaffy,31,Fri Jul 17 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty nice. The other day they checked me and a guy behind me, his conversation went something like  ""Can I see your WatCard?""

See: environmental issues (global warming, ozone layer depletion, overfishing, etc.)"
uwaterloo,3dmq34,TheUnfortunatePB,5,Fri Jul 17 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm also looking for housing for my boyfriend and myself but the struggle is real. I can't say whether 203 Lester or ACCOMOD8U is but I can tell you DOMUS, WOCH, Coppertree Inc (199 Albert) UWRent (119 University) and SCHEMBRI (1 Columbia) don't allow two tenants per room.   My problem with ACCOMOD8U is you are renting it by the suite, so you must find roommates yourselves.  Good luck on the house search! I'd be down if you'd like to team up and rent a suite :)"
uwaterloo,3dmq34,joemama19,4,Fri Jul 17 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"My experience is only with Domus, but I have never had trouble with having two people unofficially living in one room. My roommate's boyfriend lived with us for years, and another roommate's girlfriend is doing the same now. Domus does not have the resources to ensure that this kind of thing isn't happening. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if landlords in Ontario have no legal right to tell you that your partner cannot live with you (although I have no idea if this is the case or not).  From a practical point of view, just hide it. One name on the lease, and don't openly tell them that you plan to share the room. Once you've signed and moved in, you're in the clear.   I should also mention that it would be rather discourteous to do this without talking to your roommates about it. I would be a little annoyed to suddenly find out that I'd be sharing common space with an additional person, and I would flat-out refuse to allow them not to pay an equal share of utilities."
uwaterloo,3dmq34,flashbunnny,4,Fri Jul 17 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yes please let your roommates know and be considerate to them about this. They are definitely doing you a favor by allowing an extra roommate. Please split the utility bill into the number of people at home.   I had a roommate who had a live-in girlfriend and they were the most annoying shits ever. I did not personally know the guy before so that made it worse. But it can be done, and it makes sense financially. Just be extra clean and considerate."

uwaterloo,3dmq34,WhiteDoorSilver,3,Fri Jul 17 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"From my own personal experience, I kinda got stomped my first few semesters, I overloaded on hard courses and my study ethics were really lacking I almost failed out. But I started working harder and took less courses and things got better (I took 4, then 3 last term and Im taking 4 again next term)   I believe my graduation is delayed 3 semesters which would of been really disappointing to me when I was in first year, but now looking back, its not such a big deal. I have friends graduating next term who still have no idea what to do with their lives afterwards graduation, but me well at least I get some extra time to figure things out. So if I could go back in time and take less courses first year I probably would."

uwaterloo,3dn6ut,djao,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"While this is to a first order approximation true, there are certain cases where it's still worth it. In particular, if you're a very good Canadian student, you're likely to be able to get an NSERC scholarship for graduate school. Having an NSERC in graduate school pays way more than not having an NSERC (the difference can easily be a factor of two). What makes it relevant to this discussion is that NSERC has a lifetime maximum limit of four years of graduate scholarship support. So if you can finish your master's quickly, you preserve more years of NSERC eligibilty for your Ph.D."
uwaterloo,3dn6ut,PPewt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:10:55 2015 UTC,"I realize that to some extent everyone has different goals for what they want to get out of postgraduate education, but it seems like for CS at least the top students will probably want to go to the states (if nothing else because that's where universities hire from) and at that point even if you do a master's here first odds are you won't run out of NSERC.  The part of the program that feels like a bit of a shame is that (apparently) you can't double-count graduate courses you took while an undergrad. If you could it would be a fair bit more attractive because (once again, at least in CS) graduate courses are considerably more interesting anyways and worth taking for their own sake."
uwaterloo,3dn6ut,coruscatingpotlid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. You are correct that the very best students will go to the US. But there is a big gap between the very good students (who get NSERC and stay in Canada) and the tippy top students (who go to the US). Anyone in this gap will care about NSERC eligibility.  Besides, Canadian students in the US can still get NSERC, although they are only eligible for the lower tier of funding, so running out isn't a big deal.  Lastly, you can sort of (but not really) double-count graduate courses. The way it works is that if your graduate program specifically requires CS XYZ as a program requirement, and you take CS XYZ for undergrad credit, then you are released from the requirement to take CS XYZ in graduate school, but you must substitute a CS elective instead."

Maybe it's the stress?  2) I've had people tell me that my poor performance in MATH 136 does not mean I'm bad at algebra and will have to avoid it for the rest of my time here. I think you should reconsider. There's no way to avoid further calculus/analysis courses unless you switch to CS or major in CO and run away from calc, which seems silly. See how MATH 128 goes for you, and then make a decision. You might like it more.  3) Econ 102 is a bird course so take it if you're worried about your course load. Math 235 should be fine if you did well in 136. Stat 230 is a hit or miss: Last term the midterm average was 90, whereas this term it's in the 60s. If you're new to probability then this might be quite some work for you. With Econ 102 being so easy I think you should be able to handle the rest--there's nothing in there that jumps out as super hard. And think of it this way: if you never challenge yourself then you'll never improve your work ethic. You're gonna have to take hard courses eventually."

It was a fairly easy course with easily manageable multiple choice exams if you pay attention in class and take notes."
uwaterloo,3dmht7,D_Rail,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"1) Create study schedules for finals. Have time slots in them. Stick to your schedules. Aim to study around 20-30 hours per exam. Make sure you do TONS of practice problems and create notes on how to do all the different types of problems.  2) Focus more on calculus.  3) It is manageable but considering your issues with finals I suggest you hold off on a crazy courseload for at least one term. Take out one of those courses and replace with an easy language course. Spanish, Italian, French, or any language you are partially familiar with. I find language courses easy and fun. As for the course you should take out, maybe remove Math 235. This can be done at a later time, it's not a course that is required to be done to get prereqs for many math courses and it is difficult."

uwaterloo,3dkke4,annihilatron,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"if you're on your own private network with just you on it, wifi power only depends on the quality of wifi.   make sure your router isn't shit. Generally the combo-boxes provided by robbers or bail are shit (rogers/bell). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en - see how crowded your area is. If it's too crowded you're better off running a wire. running cord through apt is usually ok. You can always tape it to the floor or something, or run it along the wall behind furniture. Since you're in a managed building you'll want to avoid any wall or floor damage though, so be careful."

uwaterloo,3dmsti,tetrisplayer31,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"There are pros and cons to being on each stream. There is definitely a lot less competition because many co-ops are in the summer. But there are also fewer positions open.   For first year, my advice would be to avoid having super high expectations for your first co-op term. Employers are aware that you have limited experience so they won't be giving you difficult tasks that are way beyond your ability. Do you have volunteering experience? If so, you can always talk about that and pull out transferrable skills from those experiences. Take advantage of the resume critiques so you can highlight your experiences, even if they are limited (just make it sound amazing). If you're really worried, have a back-up plan in case you don't get interviews from Jobmine. Call out your connections (if any). Ask friends, family, neighbors, etc.   I actually prefer to be in stream 4 since you get a break after first term. I'm on 8-stream and it was brutal. After first term, I was desperate for a break and was actually envying those who were on co-op. It was pretty stressful being in school with the heavy workload for 8 months straight."

We're the ones whose livelihood aren't dependent on convincing you to buy a property.

This does not include ongoing costs such as condo fees, property taxes, insurance, interest on your mortgage, opportunity cost of downpayment:  CMHC fees - mortgage insurance (up to 3.85% of purchase price depending on downpayment)  Buyer AND seller real estate agent commissions (5%)  Land Transfer Tax (~1%)  Other closing costs (~$3000)  Basically, you only break even if the property appreciates by 10% in 2-3 years.

The only change is that they start spinning stuff in this class, so doing some reading on rotational kinematics and dynamics is in your best interest. Inversely, it's not so bad that you'd necessarily need to self study before the class.   I would go to class for this course. Some of the problems done in class appear in a very similar form on the final. When I took it there was an opinional drop-in help session. GO TO IT if you even remotely have any difficulty or questions. The folks there were awesome :)  Finally, for some of the nastier problems, Google ft. Yahoo Answers is your friend.

uwaterloo,3dgu4v,pennycruz,15,Thu Jul 16 04:04:13 2015 UTC,"You've already taken the most important step, and that is understanding that university is no cakewalk.  To answer your question though, yes it is feasible to get really good marks right after high school.  Difficult, but feasible.  My first recommendation is to organize your week.  Look at your schedule and see where you can cram in study time.  If there is a break between classes, crack open a book.  You can even do some reading while you're eating lunch/dinner.  Weeknights should be devoted to studying material you have learned the past few days, but also remember to relax once in a while.  Too much studying can actually be detrimental.  I always take Friday/Saturday night off, but do a bit of work on Saturday in the afternoon  A key piece of advice I must share with you is DO PROBLEMS.  In high school you could just look at words on paper and think, ""Oh, that makes sense"" and then regurgitate it on an exam and get a 90.  University doesn't work that way and you'll learn that real fast.  Do every problem that is assigned to you, or even random questions in your textbook.  You will definitely get answers wrong....you SHOULD get answers wrong, as that is one of the most important steps in the learning process.  Learning where you went wrong helps you understand key concepts so when you are tasked with a similar problem in the future (like an exam), you will know how to tackle the problem in the right way.    Another thing you will have to face is sacrifice.  If you want to get really good marks you are going to have to sacrifice some fun.  Sports, video games, parties, girls (guys?), hanging out, movies, etc etc etc.  You're going to have to prioritize your daily events if you want to do well.  I'm not saying you have to lock yourself in your room everyday and shun all social activities, but you have to make smart choices.  Got an assignment due tomorrow?  Don't even think about playing Counter Strike.  Did you ace your midterm?  Go out and have fun, you earned it.   Now I just spent the better part of 20 minutes writing this up for you, because I believe that you have the capacity to do well based on your post.  Heed my advice;  don't disappoint me, and don't disappoint yourself."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,GoodWorkBobandis,2,Thu Jul 16 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you so, so, so much. I will follow your advice to the T. This really provided a structure for me to follow and I can't tell you how much I appreciate you taking time to help me out.   I screenshot this. Once again, thank you so much."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,Quock,6,Thu Jul 16 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"Their post was great, but there's something else I can't emphasize enough - get to know your peers. A degree isn't enough to set you apart anymore, you need to talk to profs and uppers in your field to differentiate yourself. I'd even argue that this is more important than good marks, since knowing the right people will get you the good jobs. Make sure you get to know your profs, your fellow students, your coop employers, and upper years in your program. IMO being social in this regard is worth the hit in your grades."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,BexterV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:46:33 2015 UTC,Also personal projects and extra-curriculars. Being successful in your program and having these on your resume (as a new-grad or co-op student) will really set you apart.
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,Quock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:26:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but personal projects depends on the program. More important for CS than it is for ENV programs, for example."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,PPewt,5,Thu Jul 16 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"I am very ambitious and very motivated. I'm willing to learn the necessary skills. I'm very worried about how I'll hold up in the future, though.   Just do your shit early, rather than late. That's really all there is to it, and to time management in general. This probably depends somewhat on program (in particular how much memorization your program does/doesn't have), but I'm also firmly in the ""if you're doing things right you shouldn't need much in the way of studying"" camp, since if you take your assignments seriously they generally prepare you.  That said, keep in mind that everyone here was the top in their class in high school, so don't be too disappointed if you don't manage to be in the top few percent of your program. It's a good goal to work for, but not everyone will make it."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,iJustWannaGraduate,5,Thu Jul 16 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"You're coming in to a University where almost everyone skated by in highschool - so try to avoid staying that way with them by partying and procrastinating. It's certainly very alluring, and seemingly prominent among the Engineering students.."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,sethnis,4,Fri Jul 17 01:13:12 2015 UTC,I think you may have a small case of the Impostor Syndrome because a person that doesn't care about school would not make a post like this.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome  Good luck with your schooling.  I'm sure you will do fine.
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,DcScape,2,Thu Jul 16 07:14:53 2015 UTC,"I skated by high school as well. I thought that university would be more work, but I was smart and I wouldn't have to do much work.  I put off assignments until last minute, skipped classes I thought to be useless, and stayed up late playing call of duty every night in first year. I almost failed out. I got kicked out of co-op.  Now my 2nd year just finished and my term avg's have gone from 55s to 75-80s. If you do not have the right mentality going into uni it will fuck you over, especially at a school as difficult as Waterloo. They really try and feed people out during first year.  You have a good mentality though, you realise that it will be difficult. If you do assignments on time, go to class, make sure to be on top of your work, you should do fine.  Please don't do what I did"
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,Victawr,3,Thu Jul 16 12:55:59 2015 UTC,The only thing I can say about it is that it gets exponentially harder year after year if you don't get your shit together.

It most likely has to do with how much I enjoy my program; I genuinely believe if you really love what you're learning in school it really won't feel like you're doing much work.  So my biggest thing to say to you is just make sure you have fun with your education and everything else will come naturally.
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,dshahr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"skated through high school, tried skating through 1a but ended up failing. It also depends on how much you pay attention in class/if you don't skip class. I have a friend who skated through high school, but with uni she'd copy assignments and skip lectures throughout the term but would study really hard throughout finals and she passed.   I tried harder the second half of the term and improved a lot so; just do you assignments on time and sit in the front."
uwaterloo,3dgu4v,annihilatron,0,Fri Jul 17 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"if you were lazy and got 90s in high school being lazy in university will get you anywhere from 65-75. So define what you want to do and what you want to get.  If you want to get the grades you have to work for it, and pound out all available problem sets, search for more problem sets, practice. Knowing the material is one thing, but when you have 40 minutes to solve an entire refrigeration cycle (3 question exam over 2hrs) and you didn't practice, you're going to make mistakes. Guess what's not looked upon kindly in engineering?  Making a mistake and choosing the wrong flow (laminar/turbulent - each has a completely different set of formulae) will fail you the question + lose most of the points for the question. So you need to practice, seek out new problem sets, exams, past exams, etc.  How much fun do you want to have?  Make the choice."

uwaterloo,3ddrmb,Xenophons,26,Wed Jul 15 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Hi Adrian, I'd just like to clarify and comment on a couple things.   Unable to negotiate out of the fear of walking away empty handed, FEDS was forced to accept the terms given to them.   This is a misleading narrative. Feds was not ""forced"" to accept the terms given. It is true that the University had leverage, but so did Feds (I was President 2012-2013). The new Student Building was used as leverage at the time, for example, as was the media coverage that Feds could create if the University did not meet Feds' requests (the University cares a lot about it's reputation... as it should... since that has a huge impact on it's financial ability to serve students and conduct research).    The upside to FEDS agreement with the University is that they finally have the opportunity to renovate and improve spaces in the SLC for the benefit of students.   ""Finally""? A clarification. Students had the ability before the agreement to renovate and improve spaces in the SLC. They could do this through an SLC Management Board which included both students and admin. There is more flexibility now than there was before, and that is why it is good for Feds/students to primarily manage the building. My concern is that history is history and shouldn't be exaggerated. There were lots of small improvements made to the SLC before Feds managed the building.   Imprint replied to FEDS that such a drastic increase in their rent was absurd, having just finalized their new yearly budget, they would be unable to afford any large increases to their rent. FEDS believed that they were acting in good faith when they terminated Imprint‚Äôs lease and offered them a new space in the offices that FEDS marketing department currently resides.    There's a lot more back story to this that I'm unaware of. I hope that Feds and Imprint met regularly throughout this process and not just via emails.   The EIC of Imprint Aliyah Kanani now claims that Imprint would somehow be willing to pay an extra $11,000 in order to stay in their office, by ‚Äúcutting back‚Äù, but it has yet to be proven that Imprint has the finances to pull this off without undue strain.   Here's where the reasons for ending the agreement start to sound funky. As Sean Hunt has noted, as has this Medium article, the  issue that led to the Imprint lease termination was that the Feds board ""deemed that it was inappropriate to continue subsidizing the costs of a 3rd party."" The issue for Feds is not whether or not Imprint can afford $11,000 more a year...    ... examining how the University administration was imposing costs onto Feds...   Clarification. The University wasn't imposing costs. Feds agreed to those costs two years ago. The Agreement was set-up in a way that the University would keep paying towards the operating costs that it had traditionally contributed to, while the management of the spaces would change. It is only $11,000 more per year if you are to compare it to other leases in the building, not if you were to compare it to the expense-revenue structure prior to 2013. With the 2013 Operating Agreement, it seems to have created a loop-hole where if the space is not a ""leased-space"" then the University would have to pay for that space at a greater amount than what they payed before 2013. It seems like Feds has realized they can take advantage of this loophole so that they can have more money to serve students with in the SLC. I don't know what happened in the last two years though between Feds and the University, and I realize that the blueprints for the SLC are old and that it's been difficult to define space well... I just never thought that the terms of the Agreement, which I thought would protect Feds from paying additional funds in comparison to the costs of operation prior to the Agreement, are being used by Feds to call the cheaper Imprint lease a ""subsidy"". I can understand the logic though that at this point in time Feds is losing $11,000 in potential revenue because of the cheaper lease, so I sympathize with the Board's decision to refuse to subsidize other organizations. I just never would have thought of that lease as a ""subsidized lease"" two years ago.  I will note as well that if there is something wrong with the Agreement, then it's both the University's fault and Feds' fault.    the overwhelming majority of students would like to see more study space made available in the SLC.   This is bringing up a new reason for removing Imprint from the SLC. If the decision was based on this alone than it seems appropriate for the decision to be made more publicly than it was... since the logic is ""we will give students what they ask for.""    the marketing department will be in need of a new home. Although the marketing department could be moved into the empty Apple Hair Salon in the interim, it‚Äôs clear that Imprint‚Äôs office would far better suit their needs.   The potential conflict of interest in a FEDS department benefiting from Imprint‚Äôs loss is evident to FEDS, Imprint, and students alike.   Good points.   The Federation of Students will have to find a way to actively engage students in the decisions of how SLC space should be used. Unfortunately their calls to students for participation have thus far been met with silence and inaction.   The space audit collected 6142 response from students. I commend Feds for gathering an amazing response rate as well as publicly posting the results of the survey. I also commend students for providing Feds with so much feedback regarding the SLC space.  Conclusion  This is complicated. I am saddened by it. Based on the information available to me, my opinion is that I wish there would have been better communication between Imprint and Feds, and that the decision shouldn't have been made so swiftly. $11,000 is not a lot of money at all from Feds' perspective. I say all this knowing that there are details that I'm not privy to so my comments may stem from ignorance. I never thought this would happen."

uwaterloo,3ddrmb,BlueLociz,5,Wed Jul 15 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"Looking through it, I think the ""shitty leading question"" was asked in order to filter out the students who didn't believe there should be study space in the SLC, so they wouldn't skew the responses for what type of study space students wanted.   When asked ""If you could add any new service(s) to the SLC, what would it/they be?"" The unprompted response of 727 of the 3695 students who answered this question was more study space. This is where the argument comes from."
uwaterloo,3ddrmb,seetons,3,Wed Jul 15 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"You mean 727 out of 3695 is considered ""the overwhelming majority of students""?  That seems a bit disingenuous."

uwaterloo,3ddrmb,Victawr,7,Wed Jul 15 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"This is the most reasonable thing I've read all week.   My issue is, why the hell am I reading all of this stuff weeks later on a Medium article?   FEDs is supposed to work for me. They're supposed to do things for me. Yet I've never understood a single fucking decision until someone comes out of nowhere way later and explains it all.  Yes. I understand there are meetings. But honestly, why isn't there more transparency? We're at UWaterloo. People aren't going to show up to meetings -- that's pretty much a guarantee. So why isn't there any way for me to figure out whats going on. I'm looking at the FEDs site -- its all useless to me. I want to see articles on whats happening now. What decisions are being made? Why? What's your thought process? Seriously what's going on. We're paying you guys to make decisions for us and work for us yet we never fucking know whats happening if we don't attend your meetings.  Work harder on telling us what's going on.     Anyway, some notes from the article:   In spite of all the debate online, there has been little carryover into action in the real world. Despite open encouragement from the FEDS executives, no students have opted to visit any of them during their widely accessible office hours to voice their concerns, and less than a handful have sent e-mails or Facebook messages. FEDS Councillors took advantage of the #TakeFedsBack Facebook event, posting that the next Councillor meeting would be held the following Sunday and was open for anyone to attend. The Councillors strongly encouraged students to come out and have their voices heard, and offered multiple opportunities for students to get involved in Feds and have a stake in the decision-making. Out of the near 300 attendees on the #TakeFedsBack, only two were in attendance to watch the councillors meeting. One of them was an Imprint volunteer who left hurriedly after the agenda topic concerning FEDS‚Äô response to Imprint was discussed, the other is writing this article.   This is the most UWaterloo thing I've read. But herein lies the problem; who really wants to make time out of their day to deal with this shit? Give me some easily digestible daily tidbits at the end of the day about whats going on. I guarantee you'll have a ton more people show up to meetings if its easier to understand what the hell is going on outside of actually attending the meetings.      They may have to go to extra lengths to recruit and keep new volunteers interested in an office that‚Äôs less enjoyable to hang out in.   Ahh come on cry me a river. I get it, its hard. But the Hack the North team has been operating for two years (yeah I know it's not 37 let me ride my horse here) and we don't even have an office. We just meet up wherever we can. Velocity rooms, random lecture halls... The vast majority of what we do is just over Slack and it works perfectly fine. And hey, things are going damn well. Our team is something over 40 this year and its all running smooth as silk. The space doesn't matter. Its how you operate, and how enjoyable you make it. Hell, we'd kill for a shitty meeting room to call our own on campus, even if it was actually a closet.     I mean, my major issue nowadays is that there truly is no space on campus for things. Clubs have no home outside of engineering groups now. Look at every other school and how they handle this. Every club has a home. We need FEDs to look at this issue after they're done moving their people into their nice office. Because honestly, we need some too."

uwaterloo,3ddrmb,bruvark,2,Wed Jul 15 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"It speaks volumes that the best example of journalistic criticism of FEDS that the editor in chief of Imprint was able to produce during her interviews the past week involved a surplus $1 fee for takeout at The Bomber.   Not sure where this is coming from, nor do I think it's at all evidence that there isn't a personal vendetta involved. I can pretty clearly remember Imprint covering the absurdly high costs of the MappedIn kiosks, and the outgoing VP who bore the brunt of the criticism couldn't have been happy about it.  Given that the decision to terminate Imprint's lease was made on that VP's last day in office, without prior public discussion and without contacting the tenant to let them know this might be coming, it's really hard for me to believe that there isn't a personal element.  I get it - no one likes being criticized. But if you don't want to be held accountable for spending close to $50k for two electronic maps.....maybe don't run for office?   Up until the publication of Imprint‚Äôs expose, FEDs believed that they were negotiating in good faith.    By terminating a lease and then talking to the tenant? That's not even close to good faith.   According the FEDS space audit which collected feedback from 6,142 students in 2014   Small, but crucial, distinction here: FEDS conducted a space survey, not a space audit. The results of that survey do not list any details with respect to square footage, which is what a space audit would do. They merely list the responses given to questions posed.  And, as others have mentioned, the methodology in the survey is flawed: Yes, Imprint has one of the lowest usage rates when compared with other areas....but that's also because it has one of the smallest square footages - meaning that fewer people can actually fit in the space. So using ""number of people who use the space"" as reasoning for arguing that the current space is under-utilized is absurd. Similarly, arguing that it would be more useful to students as study space assumes that more students can use the space than the number who currently do. Which, because the space survey has not been tied to numbers from a space audit, is an impossible claim to either verify or prove false.  Ultimately, the true value of the space survey is marginal, because it doesn't actually consider the sizes of the spaces it's evaluating - making it impossible to compare relative value between one space and another.  (Side note: The GLOW space is ranked lower than the Imprint office on the space survey results with respect to the number of students who use it. And yet FEDS isn't contemplating kicking them out....no doubt because the backlash would be severe and because the survey results don't paint an accurate picture of GLOW's value. Shame the same logic isn't being applied to Imprint's office.)  EDIT: Found some more things to clarify. And also, INB4, yes, of course I have a bias. But I don't think my picking apart a survey methodology - which was used as reasoning behind terminating a tenant - is a function of my bias. YMMV."
uwaterloo,3ddrmb,sbwoodside,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"GLOW   GLOW is also a part of the Feds, whereas Imprint is not."
uwaterloo,3ddrmb,bruvark,3,Fri Jul 17 04:33:42 2015 UTC,That is an excellent point. My reason for bringing GLOW up was more to point out that FEDS hasn't used the survey results to re-evaluate GLOW's space requirements (to the best of my knowledge) because the survey results don't paint an accurate picture of GLOW's value. I'm not convinced that one being part of FEDS and the other not contradicts this reasoning with respect to value to students. But I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

uwaterloo,3ddrmb,feb914,4,Tue Jul 21 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"Waaaiiiiit. FEDS is crying poverty because its own university subsidized (free) rent is raising maintenance costs in the rest of the building?  Somebody has to pay for the maintenance of those FEDS offices, and if it isn't FEDS directly, it's either students through tuition or the rest of the SLC tenants.  If this dramatic raise in maintenance costs in Imprint's space is a product of the current agreement between FEDS and the University, that may be because FEDS is apparently operating in the building rent-free.  This means that:  A) the rest of the SLC tenants (including all non-FEDS student orgs) are paying for that cost.  and  B) FEDS has an incentive to expand its offices into the biggest spaces possible. They don't have to pay rent on it!"

It's almost like an English course with tons of writing. 40-50% of your grade as group work so I recommend taking it with some friends expecting the same mark. Speaking of marks they tend to be quite high for this course. The tests are very easy but the group stuff can be tedious. Tons of poster sessions.   Cs458 varies by professor and can either be a bit dry or very interesting.  some of the assignments require a bit of time (not as bad as Os or concurrency though). We had 3 assignments for the term - it was pretty chillax.   486 is super interesting and usually has awesome profs. Assignments are tedious but are relevant and interesting. More of a breadth to tons of AI topics, not a lot of depth. The average tends to be high since assignments are graded very fairly."

If you're kinda confused by how the entire internet manages to function, you won't be by the time you're done. CS458 feels like a mashup of OS, crypto, and networks?

Waterloo has totally made me feel like theres something wrong with acting as an employee to a company more than just a student. Not sure where it came from.
uwaterloo,3ddpn7,CalNaughtonJunior,2,Thu Jul 16 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"Hell, even CECA recommends asking for salary. Just do it.  Make your last question ""What's the hourly wage?"" or something similar."
uwaterloo,3ddpn7,Tree_Boar,2,Wed Jul 15 14:43:57 2015 UTC,I usually just ask:   What's the compensation for this position?

uwaterloo,3ddpn7,afuture22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"When I started doing interviews for coop, I would sort of preamble and say something like ""well, since the job is in a different city..."" Or something to that effect.  For the last 3 terms, at the end of the interview I generally just ask straight up. It is not awkward. Everyone understands that you want to know. It is also a question that can bring up red flags."
uwaterloo,3ddpn7,Odiwuaac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"all employers will expect you to ask them about the salary. most of them literally have a sheet of paper detailing the different salaries for different levels. I usually just wait until the end of the interview and ask ""and how much is the salary"". don't say something like "" sorry for asking "" because salary is a genuine concern and by saying that you're showing you lack confidence and initiative which might end up badly for your impression."

uwaterloo,3ddpn7,thecule,-2,Sat Jul 18 09:36:07 2015 UTC,"Some employers don't like when you ask for salary. Big companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. think that money should not be a priority for co-op students. if you want to work for the company, you'll take whatever pay they give. - information from many employer mixers and info sessions."
uwaterloo,3ddpn7,Ddaydodger,2,Thu Jul 16 03:29:03 2015 UTC,"Disagree. In the co-op interview for Microsoft I was told in the first five minutes what the comp. package would be, just before the interview began (so I had all of the information I needed, and could focus on the task at hand).  After the interview, we went over what the process would be like should I receive an offer. It was quite calming actually - it's all useful information to have in front of you when the decision comes.  Plus, you remember that -- interviewers who take the time to explain things to you about what the next steps are usually get big points from me."
uwaterloo,3dg87e,aqazwsx1,17,Thu Jul 16 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"Ironically, I'd rank this article up top on my list of ""useless articles"", doesn't go into detail about the method of study whatsoever. But hey people love lists without any reasoning! Shout-out to buzzfeed."
uwaterloo,3dg87e,SterlingAdmiral,17,Thu Jul 16 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"The actual report goes into much greater detail about the study criteria: economic security, leadership, health, personal security, and education.   The report focuses primarily on the gap  between  men and women, rather than their overall levels of well-being. It  does so in order to measure the difference between the access women and men have to the public goods available in their community, not the overall wealth of a community.   Out of the 25 largest cities in Canada, Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge was ranked 25th (i.e. worst) overall, and ranked:   21st in economic security 24th in education 17th in health 16th in leadership 24th in security   Some key takeaways:   The city  has one of the larger wage gaps of the 25 cities measured: women make 66%  of what men make overall. That gap closes only slightly for full-time workers, with women earning 69% of what men bring home working full time.  Women and men have very similar levels of education in Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo; there is less than a 1% difference in the number of men and  women who hold university and high school degrees.  Women are more likely than men to rate their health as very good or excellent (65% compared with 59%), but they are also more likely to report high levels of stress in their lives (25% compared with 18% among men).   The rate of intimate partner violence reported to the police in Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo is higher than average."
uwaterloo,3dg87e,lotuschan,3,Thu Jul 16 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"See this is more informative! How hard is it to link to the actual study in your article, or maybe go into a bit of detail about where your results are from?  Thanks for the link."
uwaterloo,3dg87e,SterlingAdmiral,3,Thu Jul 16 02:43:06 2015 UTC,I wonder where the individual cities would rank when separated from each other.
uwaterloo,3dg87e,twinnedcalcite,3,Thu Jul 16 03:31:17 2015 UTC,Yep. Kitchener and Waterloo are highly separated areas all but geologically. Even Cambridge is three cities in itself that are all really distinctive and different.

uwaterloo,3df1ap,seetons,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"It was not difficult but was incredibly boring (at least my professor was). The material itself is fairly basic (annuities, interests, etc.) and the course textbook was VERY helpful with lots of practice questions and easy-to-follow reading material. There were no proofs, simple concepts (at least for me), and 100% based on calculations."
uwaterloo,3df1ap,mmxox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"The thing I like about the course is that it has bi-weekly quizzes (when I took it in spring 2014) and forces you to keep up to the date with what's going on in class. Also, most of the questions from the quizzes are similar to the textbook which have tons of practice problems. I pretty much just studied the weekend before each quiz and I did fine."

uwaterloo,3des13,coruscatingpotlid,6,Wed Jul 15 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"When I had her CS245 she taught one section when another prof taught two, where the students are divided equally to the three sections, it got so bad to the point where the other sections would have a ton of people standing and sitting in the alleyway, while her section had 10-15 ppl  CS245 is confusing and annoying as it is, you don't need a lecturer whos really shy, speaks quietly with an accent and has small and messy writing."

These are the provincial/federal credit base applicable to students  everyone has a basic amount ($11, 138). then the employment amount (up to $1,127) then tuition (the tuition you pay so per year $6-7k or $11k for eng/cs)  the total is already almost $20k which means that amount of income is tax free. adding the education/books amouts, bus pass etc. pushes this further up. hope that helps"
uwaterloo,3de4rd,Horong,4,Fri Jul 17 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"The tax on a coop position is the same as tax for a full time - the government doesn't discriminate when it comes to employment income.   For coop however, I wouldn't worry about having any tax payable. We typically don't work long enough, and our tuition credits should wipe up any remaining tax liability."
uwaterloo,3de4rd,SoroSuub1,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"At a basic level, your first $12k of income in a year is not taxed. Every dollar after that up to 40k is taxed at a low rate (20.05%) which is usually wiped out by your tuition credits. If you're a student making less than 40k in a year and your employer withheld taxes, you should generally expect a refund."

Often the line between slander and satire is not very clear. The department provides means for critiquing TA's and courses. The department also has an undergraduate chair you can talk to if things are truly bad.

Finding ways to vent and share your experiences, such as through a blog medium, is a good thing. However, the contents of this type of defamatory blog post is particularly bothersome as it is reflective of a rather immature attitude. Everyone has, and is entitled their own opinions, but that doesn't make it appropriate to voice them in this type of manner. There are more mature and civilized approaches for dealing with things like this.

This  course is a joke when it comes to organization. The information, however relavent it maybe is not taught in a competent manner,  with the prof and TAs using vague hand-wavey explanations to most of my questions. I would have to say the labs are especially terrible for anyone who has not done android programm8ng before because nothing is actually explained. We are only taught how to implement the specific bits of code we need for that lab but not taught the logic behind any of it.  We arent even provided the resources to learn this for ourselves. There is no concrete course syllabus syllabus either,  just a stupid line talking about what the student will be able to do after cometing the course. One could argue that I could just go and look this info up for my self, but then why the hell am I paying the University at all? Im extremely disappointed in how the organization of this course was handled as this poor quality of education is not what anyone would expect from any reputable institution and it definitely not worthy of carrying the ECE label."

While I agree that they were not the best in terms of relevance to the course and application of design concepts, along with the fact that 155 is a pretty uninteresting and unneeded course, I do not think that someone should be targeted like they were in this blog post.  Giving criticisms and reflections on a course or experience in school is perfectly fine, but going out of the way to insult or deflame a single person or a group of people like TAs or profs is crossing the line.  It's just straight up disrespectful and unprofessional, not to mention non-constructive.  If the ECE program, or any program, needs improvement, a suggestion to the EngSoc reps, class reps, or blog post about the program/course itself should be made, but calling someone's face idiotic does not help at all.  It makes both parties bitter, and nothing is done to improve the quality of the course."

What else should I complain about?  all of you who got better job don't understand the sinking feeling of getting on jobmine every day after exam, know if I don't start working next two week I would be out of the program . Shame on you whom never consider some  people actually struggling in their program.

Aside from that - totally the right answer."
uwaterloo,3d9veq,Batemanx,22,Tue Jul 14 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"No offense, I mean this in the nicest way: but if you can't achieve an 80 in highschool math you might want to reconsider your idea of transferring. Many computer science students achieve 95+ in their highschool math courses and still struggle considerably (some even fail) at Waterloo. To transfer, you need to be an excellent student. Transferring is a fairly difficult process and I'm fairly certain you wouldn't be able to maintain a coop status at Waterloo without a phenomenal average at Carleton."
uwaterloo,3d9veq,boolgogi,5,Tue Jul 14 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"adding to this, your course workload as a first year CS student will be the basically the same as a first year Honours Math student. You have nearly the same core courses; you can substitute honours math calculus for the science calculus, but you need a 70 instead of a 60 to pass the course. As boolgogi said, not being able to achieve 80 in high school is a good indication that you'll be struggling at UW if you did make it. That isn't to say for sure though, there might have been grade deflation in your high school, and the first year courses aren't hard to pass with hard work. Your main problem would be trying to transfer though; with the crazy high averages you needed to get admitted to cs this year, I wouldn't be surprised if transferring into cs from another school got significantly harder."
uwaterloo,3d9veq,imhappi,4,Tue Jul 14 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for keeping it blunt. I understand and honestly have considered what your advice. I know the chances are slim, but I still would like to try (what do I have to lose right?)"

uwaterloo,3d9veq,uwCsAdvisor,10,Tue Jul 14 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you were really serious about getting into UW you shouldn't try to weasel your way through transfering, you should just do another year of hs and strive to hit high 90s"
uwaterloo,3d9veq,froggy000,6,Tue Jul 14 17:38:58 2015 UTC,This. High school used to take 5 years in Ontario anyway. But if you can't get 90+ in high school math it's unlikely you'll make it.
uwaterloo,3d9veq,greys36,3,Tue Jul 14 18:37:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. I took an extra year of high school, not because I wanted to boost my marks, but some of friends who stayed back was to do so. A few of them actually got into a better program because of that. You definitely need at least a 90 in high school math to be competitive. I went in with a 94 and almost failed first term calculus. I would say that if you're attending Carlton in hopes of transferring to UW, you should reconsider unless you know you will be okay with staying in Carlton if you don't get accepted. Otherwise, you're wasting your time and money."
uwaterloo,3d9veq,scranston,6,Tue Jul 14 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Whatever you decide, make sure you don't spend first year talking about how you plan to transfer to Waterloo. It will alienate you from your peers and you will be very lonely."
uwaterloo,3d9veq,AHolyoke,4,Tue Jul 14 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"I was in a pretty similar situation to yours. I went to UTM CS and transferred to Waterloo CS Coop at the beginning of second year. My grade in HS calc was 78 which is probably why I wasn't accepted to UW the first time around. I was lazy in HS and played video games when I should've been doing homework, so getting rejected from UW was a wakeup call for me. Then I worked like crazy in Calc 1 and 2 (finished every question in Stewart's Calculus) at UTM and got a 94, and high 90s in first year CS, which was enough to get me transferred to Waterloo. If I were you I wouldn't go back to HS because a good mark in a U course looks better than a good mark in a (repeated) HS course. But that's just my opinion.  Don't listen to the others in this thread, you can still make it but you have to seriously commit to working your butt off for a year. I haven't failed a course since coming here (currently 3B) even though my HS average was eighty-somthin-low. I think those who had great marks in HS and struggle in U are just struggling with the different style of learning. And that work ethic and determination are better predictors of academic success in University than raw-intelligence. Because honestly there's nothing particularly hard about University, it's just twice the work load as HS.  I can't exactly remember the admissions process but I think it was basically the same as applying through OUAC from HS, so you should apply near the beginning of 2nd semester. Message me if you have any questions. Best of luck!"

uwaterloo,3d8ojd,WhiteDoorSilver,3,Tue Jul 14 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"As far as upper year CS courses go, I'd say CS454 (Distributed) is a bird course. Especially if you have taken networks."
uwaterloo,3d8ojd,grapeape25,6,Tue Jul 14 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"Upper year courses I took and my opinion on their workload/difficulty:   CS 349 - pretty easy but assignments can be very time consuming CS 370 - Not too time consuming but conceptually challenging, if you are really good at math should be easy for you. Assignments every few weeks CS 360 - Easiest CS course out of the ones I've taken. Assignments are easy and not too time consuming (all written, similar to first year math assignments). Tests are also easy. CS 456 - Light workload, only a few assignments with some programming but they aren't very time consuming. Lot of material to know for exam CS 454 - Similar to CS 456 but last assignment (programming) is pretty big and takes a lot of time (you can have a partner). Lot to know for exam. Aside from the last assignment this course didn't require a big time commitment though CS 466 - Light work load, one short written assignment every week. I found this class to be the most difficult course conceptually but if you are good at math it shouldn't be too bad for you. It was also the most interesting for me. I really recommend this one   None of the courses I took were particularly demanding, if you want a lighter workload then you should avoid programming heavy courses."

Two years of ""technical difficulties"" in a row doesn't exactly inspire confidence.  As for voter turnout, it's a matter of having issues that people care about. Prime example, the UPASS referendum in 2014 had almost a 30% turnout because people care about their subsidized transportation.

uwaterloo,3d62x8,onetruepotato,5,Tue Jul 14 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as many people here have mentioned, make sure the online system works. And also, ensure that you're showing accountability to students and that you take your jobs seriously. I remember seeing the non-working voting site complete with spelling errors and thinking about how little confidence this gave me in the seriousness of Feds members.  An easy way to keep up with Feds activity would be nice as well, perhaps an email list, or a Twitter account that is solely Council/Board/etc activity would be really useful. I know I don't get the normal Feds account on my phone because too much of it is not Feds.  As a side note, to join in the circlejerk, if you're going to run a campaign with a slogan that can easily backfire, make sure everything you're doing seems like a good idea to the students, or at least be sure to present it that way. Imprint (and also the Chevron, for that matter) is a great example, because even with the massive interconnect world of the Internet, a print medium managed to report on the issue before you did, which is completely ridiculous. If you really take your job seriously (and I hope you do), then you guys should have announced AT THE START OF NEGOTIATIONS that negotiations were underway, rather than give students over a week with an ironic hashtag to be upset. I do realize that the executive blog (a really professional, official way to spread announcements, btw) updated the same day, but with the actual bread and butter of the content (the talk about negotiation) being halfway through the blog, and in the middle of a bunch of legalese made it a likely target to be ignored, when it could have simply opened with ""Imprint is not being evicted, we are re-negotiating the lease"", and that would have avoided a huge storm of controversy.  Anyway, that's just my 2 cents."

uwaterloo,3d62x8,sham-w0w,2,Tue Jul 14 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"How would you increase voter turnout?   People don't vote in Feds elections because they don't care about Feds. People don't care about Feds because they don't perceive Feds as adding any value to their university experience, especially when compared to the costs of having to care about student government. This is why nobody voted in the last Feds election: it wasn't worth the time of day.  You can get people to start caring by making Feds more student focused. That can start by actually engaging students actively and regularly about what they'd like to see from their student union. Public opinion polls and market research are a good start. See if there are services, events, or policies students want, then go about making them happen. This is how democracy works in real governments, I don't see why it can't work here. Also, part of student focus means putting the student back in student union. Half of the Feds full time staff list are not students, which I think reflects poorly on Feds claim to care about students. Why would I believe that claim when half the people in Feds aren't affected by their own decisions?  By the time you have actually gathered information from the students, you'll probably get a clear picture about how to increase voter turnout. If you want students to care about their student union, the student union needs to show it cares about students. Do things for the benefit of students and not for the benefit of Feds for once, and maybe people won't be so hostile."

uwaterloo,3d65r6,MrSanToeKnee,4,Mon Jul 13 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I worked in Central Tokyo, for starters. It was extremely challenging at first, especially because I had no idea about the language (No, I didn't even know what arigatou meant).   Why I chose the job? I like adventure.   I worked for a Dutch company and had foreign managers, but that didn't affect many of the usual stereotypes associated with working in Japan. Leaving at 6pm was considered as a 'half-day' by my manager (difficult to tell when he was joking, and when he wasn't)  I was lucky enough to get paid a competitive wage according to Japanese standard (in fact, I got paid higher than many new graduates there!) I was also paid limited overtime, with additional overtime hours going towards paid vacation days. That gave me the license to travel and explore Japan, California, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.   Average work hours: 9:30am - 7:30pm, but occasionally we had to work up till midnight.  Dress code: Most Japanese people love wearing suits even though the job doesn't even remotely require it, but I decided to 'break' the norm. Formals are usually required everywhere though.  Language: English. Even the Japanese staff were required to officially converse in English in my division.   Is it true that people can sleep at work? NO. And in the rare occasion that they are allowed, it's only after they've skipped lunch breaks and worked for a marathon 6-8 hours without getting up. This aspect of their work culture has been taken out of context!   EDIT: I should add that it was legally my right as an employee to leave the office by 5:30pm, but it did feel downright weird to leave on time when everyone else just stayed on till at least 7pm. I did work in a hedge-fund like setting, so the workload was quite a bit as well.  Others I met who worked in Japanese companies were not so lucky...many worked till 10pm everyday, and even weekends without extra pay. Look up 'Japanese salarymen' to get an idea of how they live their lives.  I think I got lucky!"
uwaterloo,3d65r6,anatomyofafart,7,Fri Jul 17 20:46:33 2015 UTC,How did you overcome that language barrier?
uwaterloo,3d65r6,ball-satchel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"Good question. It's one of the most difficult things out there for sure.   It all boils down to how much you want to immerse yourself in the culture and your surroundings. I know people I've worked with who spent the entire year without ever learning the basic writing system (Hiragana) which is very necessary for basic survival there. They remarkably managed this feat despite living in a place where English language skills are extremely poor.  But people like this have similar patterns; they mostly hang out with other foreigners and surround themselves in a sort of bubble where they're essentially mutually exclusive to the Japanese crowd and vice-versa.   On the other hand, if you're going to Japan because you're genuinely interested in being there, then it's a great idea to improve your language skills before going. Even if they're at an extremely shitty level (like mine was), there's still a ton of help you can get after going there. Japanese peeps are extremely kind and friendly (even if they don't like you...it's a part of their etiquette) and really like it when you demonstrate an interest in learning the language. There are tons of meet-ups and events where one can get the chance to practice with locals, and I found out really later on during my stay that some temples, churches and local government offices even offer free classes to the public. That is, of course, if you don't want to simply enrol in one of the numerous language schools over there.   My personal case falls somewhere in between, sadly. I faced a really tough initial few months there because I made no preparations beforehand. I lived in a neighborhood where there were no English signs, no English speakers; all by myself. Unsure whether I was high while deciding this or not. Things improved a lot after I began staying with Japanese people and foreigners like me, but I wish I learned more Japanese overall :/"

One thing you learn in CO 250 you learn how to solve basic linear cases using an algorithm called Simplex.  One topic in combinatorics is using formal power series as a method of counting. For example you can represent the possibilities of rolling a number on a die with a power series. This power series, which would be called the generating function for rolling one die, would be x + x2 +x3 + x4 + x5 + x6. Where the coefficient of xn represents the number of ways you can get the number n. So for example, for 2 dice you would multiply the power series with itself to get x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 + ... + 6x7 + 5x8 + ... + x12 . Where the coefficient of xn represents the number of ways you can get the number n.   Not sure if its clear but just my attempt to give some examples"
uwaterloo,3d7733,Masterpuri,0,Tue Jul 14 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"Roughly, it's sort of like PMATH and sort of like CS. It's a weird program that only exists in UW, mostly for histortical reasons (it was Bill Tutte's program back in the day), and it doesn't have a very clear academic definition.  Combinatorics involves a lot of graph theory, and enumeration (techniques for counting things, like ""how many binary strings are they of length 10, with 5 1s, that do not contain the pattern 1101?"").   Optimization is primarily about solving problems of the form ""minimize f(x) subject to these constraints on x"". There are lots of special cases of this, i.e., linear programming is the case where the function f and the constraints are linear. Techniques in optimization have lots of application to CS; some courses are almost entirely theory based, and others will talk about how to actually implement these techniques with a computer, and how to use them to solve problems.  It's always easier to explain these things in person; you could ask the C&O advisor if you want a better idea of what the program is like"

Luckily, I didn't have to pay for rent, because my parents had a residence there. So it would sound reasonable to save at least 80% of what I made, right?  Wrong. I ended up spending half of my salary on (kind of shitty) food and transportation alone. I didn't end up making enough over the summer to cover for the plane ticket.  Shanghai's living costs are incredible. Most of the people I talked to spent most of their income on basic costs alone. The few who had the luxury of enjoying luxuries were making 300k yuan a year. By comparison, the average graduate salary there was 50k yuan a year.  However, that being said, the experience was one I would never forget. I commuted more than 2.5 hours a day--I lived on the west side of the river, the company was on the east--meaning I had no time for recreation during weekdays. I think it was probably the first time I realized how well Americans had it here.  As for foreign co-ops, I didn't meet any there. There was one guy from Georgia Tech, but his hometown had been Shanghai.  As for travelling, I had already been to Shanghai at least seven times with family, so I didn't really travel last time. But I can recommend some places to see if you're interested (PM me when you're there).  Also, be warned that the Chinese interwebs will be really really really really reallyreallyreally100 bad. The Great Firewall is very good at blocking the things (ie all of them) that it's designed to block. This means no Youtube, no Google, no Gmail, no Facebook, etc. It uses deep packet inspection to find and terminate VPN connections, and slows all encrypted traffic to a crawl. I ended up tunnelling VPN traffic using stunnel over port 443 to my box in the USA to get around it (triple-layering TCP, lol) and even that didn't work too well at times.  But definitely go if you're not interested in pay. You'll gain a valuable, international experience that makes your life more interesting."

uwaterloo,3d5ew2,ball-satchel,3,Mon Jul 13 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"I guess I was trying to say that it could go both ways, depending on your perspective. It was neither strictly bad nor good (except for the internet, that was rotten); it was just a strong experience. It was bad that the pay was abysmal, since I lost money going there--but it was good that I witnessed firsthand how hard many people have had it there than we've had.  At least I didn't work for Foxconn."

At my company there are also employees who graduated from the U.S. who also couldn't find a full-time job there. Seeing them is like a foreshadow of who I'll become if I don't study hard at UW.

It has most certainly broadened my perspective.   Long story short, the experience is definitely worth it if you're willing to dive in head first. Shanghai is very westernized compared to the rest of China, so you don't need to worry too much about culture shock. It will be interesting to observe, but it will mostly likely not shake you to your core.  I'm living in Jing'an, which is central Shanghai. 95% of my salary goes towards my rent. I've pretty much emptied out my Canadian bank account to finance this experience. To me, it's definitely worth it.  It's quite easy to meet other foreigners here, you just need to be ready to socialize. There are several nightlife areas which are dominated by foreigners.  I say go for it. It's a very interesting and stimulating experience.  By the way, there is an international coop scholarship you can apply to. I was accepted and they essentially covered my flight there and back."

You need the consent of both an advisor and the prof of at least one of the classes that overlap.   Your advisor shouldn't have a problem with it if your marks are decent and you say you think you can handle it. Getting one of the profs to sign off really depends on their personality.

Otherwise, if you're with all of your friends the living room is actually great place to chill out and the beds (despite first impressions of it being bad) are really comfy. I don't know what the new contract entails but I had a decent past year here."
uwaterloo,3d5nvt,dahnbi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"I just spoke with a rep from Rez-One today about hydro charges, and according to her it's still included in Preston and Bridgeport, but charged extra at the new one across from UW (which is $750/mo minimum apparently, not including hydro). Whether that's different in the lease is unknown, but I'm going down for a tour sometime soon. 2 questions, if you don't mind: How is the room layout and how is the internet?"
uwaterloo,3d5nvt,LockTheUniverse,2,Tue Jul 14 05:48:51 2015 UTC,"Room layout is fine. I really like it actually. Only shitty thing is the desks are way too small and the chairs aren't the most comfortable (I got used to it though/got my own a little while ago). Other than that there is a LOT of space in your room as I stretch/roll out my muscles over a yoga mat all the time after a workout and I still have plenty of spcae in the room. As for the internet, it's extremely inconsistent.   Fall term - solid connection but mildly slow.   Most of winter term - great connection and fast  Then near the end of the term, they ended their contract with Rogers (I think) and removed all of the TV boxes that was originally inclusive. Internet has been very choppy since. If I'm in the living room the connection will get cut periodically for a short amount of time.   But wow, 750 sure is a lot.. I feel like thats only for the newer Rez-One buildings though and Bridgeport got upped by around 15-20 $. Not sure though."
uwaterloo,3d21nq,manymenwishdeathupon,19,Sun Jul 12 22:02:16 2015 UTC,"No individual job seeker can ever really know how any particular prospective employer has evaluated or will evaluate his past experience.  But in the end, it doesn't really matter: as long as at least one relevant employer considers co-op experience to have value, you're better off in the marketplace than you would have been without it. And it defies belief that there are no such employers. The employers who disregard co-op don't matter; you only need one job.  Personally, I've never had any difficulty getting jobs at tech companies in Ontario, using past co-op jobs as an important element of my r√©sum√©."

I finish the work in 1 and half and ask for feedback. She will always say she's busy even when I see her chatting with others. When the actual deadline comes around, she will say shit like, I'm busy this week, show me at the end of the week. So a work that's supposed to be done in 2 days, gets extended to more than a week. Finally when I start asking around others for work, she will finally look at the stuff I did. She takes one quick look and says, this doesn't have <insert something that was never included in the project>. She turns around to me and continue, this is useless, so what have you done past week?

uwaterloo,3d1axg,uwatdafox,6,Sun Jul 12 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"No, CECA didn't help me out.  For a co-op, I'd secured a sweet gig at a startup company in Toronto in the first round (end of January), that was in the mobile gaming space. Pretty cool, right?  Up until APRIL 1ST. I specifically remember the day because I thought the e-mail I got was an April Fool's Joke. It wasn't.  The employer's HR person e-mailed me telling me something along the lines of ""Oh, we ran out of money, so we can't hire co-op students anymore. Tough luck -- we have to revoke your match, you'll go into JobMine in a few days"". I was already on a co-op term (looking for a second), and it was pretty late in the term - how many jobs are there left?  Turns out, not many. The company didn't even bother to help me find contacts that they knew to try to get me another position, they just wiped their hands clean of me.   Worse yet, a week after they revoked my job, they announced Series B funding for over $100M, valuing them at over $250M. Needless to say, I was pretty livid.  CECA did absolute piss-all, saying ""tough luck, you got rekt, go find another job"". The only three positions that weren't Junior-level (I wasn't taking QA/IT jobs again; been through that loop, wasn't worth the hassle, would rather work on my own startup. In hindsight, that was a mistake) were all telecom companies (you know them all if you're Canadian). Not bad, right?  Well, I got an offer for one. I felt like ""hmm, telecom companies are probably fun, right?"". WORST. CO-OP. EVER. The company had never had co-ops before, so the projects they gave me were the equivalent of ""here's a sandbox, go play while the adults work on stuff"". I received no support, no learning, and no real challenge, so needless to say, I pretty much wasted a co-op term doing nothing.  It was even more unfortunate that I got a ""satisfactory"" rating, simply because I didn't show up to work precisely at the time I was expected to (8:30am - I lived about an hour by train away since transit was a little awkward), by about five minutes both times (train was late)."

So, for my job, I'm going to try to do a side project where I do a report on the complaints we've been getting, to see if there's a pattern between the area manager, area and the complaint, just so I can say on my resume that I did a relevant report. I also create marketing posters for the company on the side, so hopefully it adds to my resume. But yeah this position sucks ass.   Out of curiosity, what's so crappy about your position?

There are still some good companies hiring right now in continuous and due to your seniority you'll likely land at least the interview.  I'm not a grad but I would be worried about finding a job after graduation if I didn't have a job to go back to from coop. This applies to everyone as finding a job outside jobmine is quite a different process.   By silent do you mean you haven't been getting interviews this term? Or do you mean you haven't been able to get the jobs you interviewed for? If it's the former then it's likely your resume isn't descriptive enough about what you did in term.

I applied to around 100 jobs, mostly through indeed.ca or the jobmine summer postings. Considering I had very little relevant experience to put on my resume, it wasn't that hard to land interviews. Pretty sure just ""waterloo cs"" got me most of them. If you really want to get a job you still have to work for it by prepping your resume, acing interviews, gaining experience outside of school, and applying to as many jobs as you can. Start applying as early as possible, so around January or February."

uwaterloo,3d2rcy,GoP-Demon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"I wanted to go back home for the summer, so most of the postings I applied to were in Toronto/Markham, 1.5 hours away by public transit at most. I also applied to a few places in Waterloo because I wanted to keep my options open, and sublets aren't too pricey in spring term."
uwaterloo,3d2rcy,m_ra,2,Mon Jul 13 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you last year and I ended up finding an internship. What I did was check jobmine summer postings every so often to find a suitable summer job, however a lot were unrelated to CS. I ended up applying to some job for marketing and social media and got an interview. But once the employer saw that my background was in math/cs he offered me a web dev job instead so I would say I got pretty lucky tbh. My advice is to do side projects and apply to any job you find interesting/ you're decently qualified for. Don't limit yourself to jobmine and use other resources such as meed, indeed, and even linkedin. Also attend info sessions and go to resume critique sessions. Also utilize any connections you might know. On a side note do not put yourself down or attach your self worth to not being in coop or not getting interviews. You'll notice a lot of your friends and classmates will talk about their interviews and their job offers (some classmates might even have lower marks than you and still be getting interviews). Just keep your head up and make a schedule/ habit of just applying to jobs during your 1B. I'm also still in the process of learning and I'm not saying 'I got applying to CS jobs outside of coop all figured out' so perhaps someone who is more qualified could give better advice. I hope it works out for you and /u/uwc00p. feel free to PM me if you have any questions about this or first year CS life in general"
uwaterloo,3d2rcy,TheLuckyCharm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm also an incoming CS non-coop student. I'm not too worried anymore after reading some great stuff from current students. If you haven't already, use your uwaterloo email to join the Waterloo group.  There are lots of helpful subgroups such as Computer Science, also Jobs & Internships. Here's what CS students said about not having co-op: Part 1, Part 2  My takeaways from this are:   Finding the first job is hard with or without co-op, but after you get that first internship under your belt you should be able to land jobs just as easily as co-op students and save yourself from some of the bureaucracy that comes with the program. You don't have to do internships in the summer only. You can take terms off school to work, essentially crafting your own co-op stream.   Some tips:   Have a friend in co-op show you co-op postings, go on the website of the companies you're interested in and apply directly. If they don't have any listings on their website, just email them and explain your situation Use all the great websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, angel.co or even /r/cscareerquestions. Also companies like Facebook and Google have summer internship programs specifically for first-years/freshman. Get a github and share some code!

The government only penalizes you if you owe taxes and don't file. If you had deductions, then Uncle Sam owes you money - and they're totally cool with not having to pay you back.  Also, I assume you are neither a resident nor American citizen, yes? You do not have to file since you lived there less than 6 months.  Casual language aside, don't worry.  Edit Math: 25/hr x 40hrs/wk x 5 mos = ~$20k-ish?  The way the US taxes withholdings work is that they deduct from you as if you made $25/hr for all 12 months, expecting you to earn more than you actually did, overall. 99% sure you would be getting a refund..."

uwaterloo,3czuup,Toronto215,10,Sun Jul 12 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"Going into 4A engineering next term and have had many difficult times at Waterloo, but they were all related to the amount of coursework. Don't know a single person personally that committed suicide. It sounds like you just had some additional bad luck with mismarked assignments and paperwork other than that. Some profs aren't the best but none of them ever told us we were stupid or put us down. Engineering at Waterloo is definitely not easy, but I still enjoy my time there and have no regrets and am sure that I will look back on this as one of the best times of my life."
uwaterloo,3czuup,kayslay,4,Sun Jul 12 17:15:09 2015 UTC,We have reading week now and I don't recall many suicides during my undergrad but I know the classes that graduated before I started first year said it used to be a major problem.  There is nothing officially published by the word gets around.  They don't let people on to the roof without supervision any more.    First years now have a bit of flexibility with their course load as well.  Counseling services is better funded and the professors work with them and the disability office to help students succeed.    You'll find things are a bit better now for the current students then during your time.  The whole 'suck it up' is replaced with 'go to counseling'.
uwaterloo,3czuup,twinnedcalcite,3,Sun Jul 12 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds rough.  My personal experience has shown the professors, TAs, and everyone else I've interacted with to be pretty kind and reasonable, and I've never seen a staff member insult a student. I don't know much about our suicide rate but I haven't heard about any since I started my undergrad in 2012.  The only explanation I can think of is that maybe mech had/has a few particularly bad staff members. I think the vast majority of students have had a much better experience than what you unfortunately were put through."
uwaterloo,3czuup,uw-student,2,Sun Jul 12 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"Profs putting people down: I don't remember ever seeing that in any of our classes. Plus, if that was really happening, it would be told to the academic reps, which would be relayed to the professors themselves and program advisors.   There have been a couple suicides in the past few years that have been reported, I'm sure there are others that were never reported but like you said, a lot of students at UW mostly just think about themselves and their own work. I have seen students complain about lack of counselling services at UW. Mental health is becoming a more important issue now, esp with the active role of official Twitter accounts and other social media.   I think when you're in engineering, you forget about a lot of the services provided to you by the school because you're so heads down w/ all the shit you have to do that week. When does anyone have time to schedule a counselling appointment given the hectic eng schedules?"
uwaterloo,3czuup,aimango,4,Sun Jul 12 16:18:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty harsh for what you and other students had to go through. I never heard something like this from students that went / are going to uw, but it really makes me think that some profs don't care about their students success and that they enjoy failing people.   Many schools across the world cross suicides. Waterloo is no different. I don't think it's right to withhold this information. UW should really be doing something about these suicides by promoting their mental health services."
uwaterloo,3czuup,xyzplan3,7,Sun Jul 12 13:15:36 2015 UTC,It is correct to withhold the information. Publicising it makes more people more likely to commit suicide. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide

A text, an email, even a post-it note with an initial. You just want to have something that you can point to and say ""told you so"".

KW4Rent told us the same but they have an online payment system where it showed that we didn't have to pay rent until Oct 1st (instead of Sept 1st as we got a 1 month deal).  If it's not on the lease it doesn't mean they are scamming you, their must be a tax or accounting reason for it. Also, vocal contracts are enforceable by law, any contract is also dependent on the things that were promised to you to get you to enter into the contract (even if not written in contract) are enforceable.

I paid 100 times more for Feds fees than for Imprint last term.   As management control changed over to Feds, so did the cost of space in the SLC.   Did Feds change the prices? I don't see why the space would suddenly become more expensive.  Also, a lot of the language used by the author of this makes me feel like they're trying to make Imprint seem culpable and portray Feds as operating mistake-free. I'm not buying it."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,jonhayes37,9,Sat Jul 11 01:05:11 2015 UTC,"Did Feds change the prices? I don't see why the space would suddenly become more expensive   In the renegotiated SLC Agreement, the University is by default responsible for the costs of the old Campus Centre space (the old part of the building including the Great Hall, Feds main offices, and Imprint), but Feds is responsible for the costs of any leased space. As a result, Feds ends up paying the space cost for Imprint's current office but, if there was no tenant and Feds was using the space (whether for offices, as bookable space, or any other internal reason), then the University would pay."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,scshunt,12,Sat Jul 11 02:20:20 2015 UTC,"I paid 100 times more for Feds fees than for Imprint last term.   actually that's incorrect. 13x is more correct. and to be fair, Feds don't only spend money on producing newspapers though.    it's been 4 years since contract expired, that's a lot of time without any increase. adjusted to CPI would have seen ~12% fee increase."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,feb914,0,Sat Jul 11 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to assume most of the administered fees are going directly to feds as well, so I included them as well. You're right though, just counting the one fee. Which, in its own right, is still insane."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,jonhayes37,5,Sat Jul 11 02:07:56 2015 UTC,"nope, it's the other way around. Feds administered fee is collected by Feds (through the university) to be given to the services (e.g. UPASS is included in it and almost all part of it goes to GRT, health and dental insurance mostly goes to Sunlife, etc). Feds administered fees are fees to provide services to students by a third party that is negotiated by Feds.    don't forget that Feds have full time staff (apart from executives), part time workers, and clubs and services that rely on that fee to operate. $54 is among the lowest fee across Canada."

The little information we have received has been contradictory to information the University of Waterloo could provide."" IIRC, it involved Imprint saying that they were being billed for stairwells, etc, that they didn't use.  Would be curious to see how either Feds or Imprint adjusts their stories with respect to that particular issue.  EDIT: Found the source of the stairwell/hallway issue. In it, the Imprint editor says ""...we were given a bizarre explanation with a list of room numbers that were included as belonging to Imprint,‚Äù Kanani said. ‚ÄúStaircases leading to the Feds‚Äô [Federation of Students‚Äô] offices, and a hallway that‚Äôs not even near our entryway.‚Äù"

For me, this is one of the key takeaways in the entire discussion.  Both Feds and Imprint are funded from the same source: student fees. For Imprint to remain in its current space at current rates, Feds would effectively be subsidizing Imprint using student money. This sort of subsidy is, in my view, inappropriate, because it would be better done by Imprint raising their fee to cover it. The net effect for students would be the same, but it's possible that students would balk at the fee increase (especially given what happened with the last one). So I completely agree with Feds on this point.  I don't know if Feds offered a fee transfer to Imprint though."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,scshunt,6,Sat Jul 11 02:14:41 2015 UTC,Subsidizing services for students using student money is Feds' entire mandate.
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,thefringthing,5,Sat Jul 11 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"True! But it doesn't make much sense for them to subsidize Imprint. If they think that students should pay for the space, they should help Imprint up its fee rather than pay themselves."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,scshunt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, Sean. I'd just like to see some numbers to back it up. I've looked through Feds' budgets for the past couple of years, and nowhere does it list either rents received from SLC tenants or rent money remitted to the university. I have a feeling that this is a total CYA move, and I wouldn't be surprised if Feds' GM has ""suddenly come up with new information"", if you catch my drift."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,bruvark,2,Mon Jul 13 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"I spoke to four different members of the Feds board this week. I didn't get a description of anything confidential, but my assessment is that I don't think that the savings were pulled out of their ass. I don't think that Feds planned to lower the fee by however much they saved, though, so that would tend to support the view that it is (or was originally) just a money grab."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,scshunt,2,Mon Jul 13 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"The thing is that none of this information should be confidential. Knowing how much rent is received and how much of what is ultimately remitted to the university should absolutely be on the books. The SLC management agreement isn't confidential, so if this rent situation is legitimate, it shouldn't be something that's hidden.  Students have a right to know how much Feds is subsidizing any business in the SLC - not just Imprint - and hiding that information is suspect. (Nevermind the fact that you're right, it does sound like a cash grab!)"
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,bruvark,2,Mon Jul 13 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"The counterargument is that Feds is, with respect to some of the space, operating a commercial enterprise. If terms like that become available publicly, then that could affect other leases like ""Well, you're giving them a deal; we're not willing to keep our lease up unless you lower the price.""  I'm not sure that justifies all of the secrecy, but it certainly justifies some aspects of it, like how Feds needs to keep salaries confidential (and is small enough that per-department salary numbers could let people work out how much others are making)."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,scshunt,2,Mon Jul 13 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, there is some confidentiality justified here. But I'm not asking for Feds to disclose exactly how much each business is/is not being subsidized - I'd just like Feds to report this information in general.  As it stands, what we now have is a tacit admission from Feds that they've been subsidizing businesses. I'm sure Feds thought that saying this would help justify their position with respect to Imprint - and if it proves to be true, it would provide some justification - but what it also does is establish that they've been spending student money to subsidize businesses. If that's not scandalous, I don't know what is!"
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,bruvark,2,Mon Jul 13 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"Fair! As far as I know, it's Imprint only. I can't think of any other leased space in that half of the building, and any commercial leases to external tenants would not be at cost as Imprint's was."
uwaterloo,3cv1wr,scshunt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"So, new wrinkle, according to a Twitter post by Adam Garcia, the definition of subsidization could be enlarged to include ""not making profit on a space"", rather than just ""paying to make up a difference in rent charges"". Which sounds a lot like, ""we're not making money on it, or using it for our own purposes, so therefore we're not serving students with it"".  By that standard - if indeed that is the standard - they should be looking at themselves first, for letting spaces sit empty! It also suggests that this decision is being driven by a profit motive...that is to say by a profit-motivated department.  Edit: added link"

A few example ones I got were to fetch images from a URL and implement a LRU cache. Another really simple one was to implement a singleton multiple ways. I tend to find iOS devs love digging deeper on your understanding of iOS rather than asking you just one technical algorithm question. I cannot say the same for Android positions as I've never had any Android interviews but that's my experience with iOS positions.

The fundamental premise here seems to be that referring to safety automatically means you're talking about safe spaces, which have a very specific meaning. I've seen nothing from Feds indicating that when they refer to board member safety, they mean it in that context. I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure Feds just means one of the other definitions of safe. The connection is just too tenuous.  We don't expect public safety officials to deal with intolerant people, and we don't criticize an amusement park for advertising that their rides are safe. This hate on Feds is not fair."

I don't know about other fields but in software, you don't really need to finish your curriculum to start being really productive but you still need to finish it to have in-depth knowledge, so if you're in co-op by the time you finish the program you would have already worked 2 entire years so you would be pretty much as productive as someone who took 4 years to finish his/her degree and worked 2 years, you would finish your degree, you would graduate with less or no student debt AND when applying for full-time jobs you wouldn't be competing with employed people who have as much experience as you do but fresh out of college students with no work experience and you would have gone to more interviews than someone who worked for 10 years, so unless they went to MIT or are extremely gifted regular program students have no chance to compete with coop students for jobs.  Going to uni (without co-op) has a huge opportunity cost, working without a degree wouldn't get you so far. So, co-op is actually the best of both worlds !"

uwaterloo,3csz5w,manymenwishdeathupon,2,Fri Jul 10 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"Waterloo might not be UofT when it comes to academia, but it's still really good for CS in Canada and as far as I know we do have a good reputation (not excellent) for research in CS (Math and some disciplines in Physics as well).  Our CS program certainly produces the highest number of high quality software developers in Canada but I've seen that many people did go for research in the top graduate programs worldwide after studying here at Waterloo so it might be not be better than UofT or UBC but it sure is better than most other CS programs in Canada and isn't the kind of program that would make universities overlook you when it comes to graduate studies."

The verification of income form I got for 2013 doesn't show my 2013 income but my 2014 income which I think is the issue.   What I am confused about is I got a form asking me for all my 2013 income sources and it states ""It is important that the income you list in columns 1, 4 and 5 for the 2014 time period add up to the number provided by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)"". So I'm wondering is it just a technical problem where they compared my 2013 reported income against the 2014 number from the CRA? In which case, I'm not surprised that number is significantly different (1 co-op in 2013, 2 in 2014).  That said I'm almost graduating and don't need any more OSAP so I can probably just ignore it as the 5 year thing doesn't have any effect on me."

I struggled with an oxycontin addiction through high school and it turned into a heroin addiction after high school and in my first year of college. To make a long story short I ended up with a horrible GPA on academic probation and then withdrawing to go to resedential treatment. I've been clean and sober for over 4 years now and I recently got into 1st year at waterloo which was a HUGE accomplishment for me. But the poor academic record I had left myself with was a huge deterent, I got rejected from all the other schools I applied except waterloo (I guess they saw a certain drive in me). A point I'm trying to make is that pushing through schooling while I had mental health issues that NEEDED to be addressed only left me with a poor academic record that held me back a lot. My advice would be to deal with whatever issues you have. Talk to family. Talk to friends. Talk to a councelour. Get Help. This will save you much pain in the long run because these issues don't tend to just go away on their own. For me personally treatment saved my life and 12 step programs like NA and AA really helped (everyone is different). Feel free to PM me."

You can tell them as much or as little as you like. And you can build up to it.

uwaterloo,3cr356,ArtisticD,7,Fri Jul 10 02:37:45 2015 UTC,I feel like its worth noting that mentioning suicidal thoughts to a councelour is a potentially much bigger deal than mentioning drug problems.

uwaterloo,3cr356,steelstax,5,Fri Jul 10 02:50:01 2015 UTC,"They won't hospitalize you without being very confident that you pose a very big risk to yourself. Suicidal thoughts alone won't get you hospitalized. If you're cutting and making serious plans, they probably will have you committed."

uwaterloo,3cvai3,runfastjumphigh,9,Sat Jul 11 01:50:11 2015 UTC,Don't Ontario high schools finish first semester in the end of January? Regardless your final first semester marks (first semester midterm marks aren't sent) will be sent to OUAC in the beginning of February which is way too late. Anyways you should enjoy your last year of high school by relaxing and not worrying about university yet. You'll have 4+ years to worry about university.

uwaterloo,3cvai3,mujura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:48:28 2015 UTC,"In the same situation as you, except I'm doing summer school now and taking ILC right after. You should consider finishing your last courses through ILC before the December 1st deadline (probably should finish it by the end of October) or at your local adult high school (if they have 5 terms a year, like st louis in KW).  I searched so much on the winter term for math / cs, and I can't find much. The admission average is definitely not going to look like the fall one because there are less applicants and there may be less spots? But it sort of doesn't make sense because you'll be taking the courses people did a term before you so the classes will be empty.. But anyways I need to get into contact with UW to see if they do accept 340 students for the winter term for CS.  Good luck on admissions, hope we both get accepted!"

Phys 121 for the most part is review up until the second half where you start learning about angular stuff. Some people find Phys 121 really difficult and some find it really easy. It's a real mixed bag, I guess it depends on the prof you get, Epp is a great prof in my opinion, as well as Mann, but some of the others are terrible.  PHYS 131L is pretty difficult, the lab reports are due at the end of class, and a lot of students don't end up finishing them.

I wouldn't be too worried.  Your courseload will definitely be challenging the way you have it - all your courses are technical and will probably require a good deal of time.  If I were you I would take 5 courses in 1A while you get settled into university life, I believe you will be happier.  The time you save by dropping the extra course can be spent socializing, which, imo, will serve you better in your first term so you can find a group of friends whose company you enjoy.  If you are set on taking 6 courses I would suggest swapping one of your courses for an easier elective.  Perhaps delaying taking CS135 or CHEM120 is your best bet."
uwaterloo,3cqj1g,GoP-Demon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely going to drop CS135, and instead of doing chem120 I'm doing earth121. The only thing I'm not sure of is if the lab component of Earth121 is required just like the chem. I suck at labs so I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible.  Do you know by any chance where I can find notes for 147? I want to check out the topics/difficulty"
uwaterloo,3cqj1g,uwlol,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:41:25 2015 UTC,"I do not have any notes for that course, nor unfortunately do I have the assignments since the prof just handed out hard-copies.  Pretty much 147 just builds up all the machinery necessary to prove the three big continuity theorems: IVT, EVT, and MVT.  It doesn't touch integration (at least it didn't when I took it in 2012)."

You can, however, meet people from other faculties too.   My advice is, enjoy this week as much as possible. Make a lot of friends, have tons of fun, and savour the best moments you have.

A knew a few people from my group since we lived in the same floor, and met a couple other. One thing to keep in mind is that these events are NOT  mandatory. By the third day, we were doing some pretty generic activities that you would have done if you've ever been to any summer camp and myself along with the small group of people o was with decided to ditch half way through the event. We spent our time hanging out, playing some smash and drinking, and I have to say that was waaay more fun than some silly dance that the others had to learn. Frosh week is what you make it. Yes are the groups they set up a good way of meeting people, absolutely, but don't think you have to go to every event that they have listed just because 90% of your floor is going as well."

uwaterloo,3cmlxn,SoroSuub1,4,Thu Jul 9 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"$150-$200/month tops.   Use something like smartcanucks to look through flyers (Freshco, Zehrs, Walmart, Sobeys, Food Basics are the main ones) -- find meat, veggies, etc... on sale.   $2-$3/lb is a good price for meat (Chicken thighs, pork and beef roasts). Buy in bulk. Every couple of weeks you can get 10lb potatoes for $2, 5lb carrots for $2, 3-10lb onions for $1-$3. Mushrooms are about $2 for a container and you can get big bags of frozen veggies cheap (look for frozen peppers and broccoli/cauliflower, green beans and peas)  Bulk is better. Chest freezers are amazing investments. This is your foundation for batch meals! Slowcooker meals and quick baking/cooking meals are easy.   Garlic (fresh, minced in water/oil or dehydrated minced) and spices are all cheap. Some must-haves include rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, powdered garlic, powdered onion, cayenne pepper, dehydrated chili pepper thingies, black pepper, salt, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and a couple containers of beef/chicken stock when they're on sale. This is a ""set up cost"" that'll provide you a lot of meals. For a treat, an $9-10 bottle of wine will last to add extra richness into meals. Big bags of rice are super cheap and follow the same principle for making big stir fry's. VH sauces come on sale all the time for $2 if you want to experiment with flavours in a harmless way.   These will be your main meals. Look up slowcooker recipes, etc.... and modify them to what you have in your pantry/fridge. Get tupperware/pyrex/anchor dishes and make 2-6 meals. These are you lunches and dinners! If you're afraid of having to chop/your knife skills are sub-par, look into getting a cheap food processor/hand food processor. Otherwise most of the prep is just peeling and watching and chopping.   You can get bacon on sale for $2/lb (smokehouse) at Zehr's during flash sales. It freezes well! Ziploc bags and ziploc portion bags are your friend. Eggs are pretty cheap and if you like cereal and milk for breakfast, Sally's Cereal comes in bags and tastes great and is incredibly cheap.   This is kind of all over the place but there's lots of advice to give. Eating out is okay, but I limited it to 1-4 times a month or as a post-exam treat if I could help it."

Invest in a well-stocked kitchen (cooking tools and spices/condiments) and from then on you'll be able to make food that is both dirt cheap and way more delicious than what you can buy in the plaza.

I don't eat out at all (except for during exams) and cook fairly elaborate meals most nights.   The trick is cooking enough for dinner one night to have lunch the next day. For breakfast eggs and toast, oatmeal, cottage cheese, and the occasional omelette are a hell of a lot more filling and more filling than the crap you get at time.   Going to a department C&D or bringing a thermos of coffee rather than tims will also cut some dollars off your budget.   Think about it this way, $10 for a crappy lunch at the plaza can buy you 2 days worth of food from the grocery store (if you eat cheap and wait for sales)."

uwaterloo,3clg4j,engineer2015hopeful,12,Wed Jul 8 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"You get to write tests, document, ""qa"", etc....basically boring as fuck. Unless you've never been a Software Developer, why would you pay money to do work you are supposed to be paid for? Take more interesting courses (Compilers, Combinatorics, Cryptography, Computer Graphics, Real Time) instead of boring yourself to death. Or maybe do a co-op term as a Software Developer, you'll probably learn a lot more.  If you are serious about being a programmer, you spend 40 years of your life in the industry. Why waste the only 5 years of your life where you can study whatever the hell you want on ""getting ready"" for those 40 years? Do something more exciting.  QED."
uwaterloo,3clg4j,uwthrowaway39833883,3,Wed Jul 8 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"I contacted enginfo asking what I could do to put more focus on the software aspect of ece, and they proposed that option.    I just want take as much software oriented courses as I can, so would you just recommend sticking without the option, and taking some interesting technical electives instead?"
uwaterloo,3clg4j,asdfq3210,9,Wed Jul 8 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"If your passion is for software, ECE was probably a mistake; at least that's how it seems for me. You will suffer every day for 5 years all so that you can get the same job as a CS student who did half as much work as you in school.   If you haven't started school yet, you should seriously consider working your ass off first term/year so that you can get good enough grades to just switch to CS or software engineering."
uwaterloo,3clg4j,BigJewFingers,6,Wed Jul 8 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"I have considered this. Even though I'm more interested in the software side, I find the hardware aspect interesting as well. I've worked with an arduino and made some cool stuff. In the end, I wouldn't mind a hardware job, but if I do get a software job, I want to be as qualified as possible. I know it's going to be a tough 5 years, but I feel like it's going to be worth it."
uwaterloo,3clg4j,uweceadvisor,2,Wed Jul 8 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in hardware and software, take computer engineering. You'll get the better part of ECE and you can specialize way more in software. If you've worked with arduino you've already got an advantage for some pretty cool computer/electrical jobs. If you're absolutely sure you want to do only software for a living, especially higher level software (as opposed to embedded stuff), then take Soft eng or CS."
uwaterloo,3clg4j,temp722,-6,Thu Jul 9 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"I am an ECE advisor. The ECE is a world class program, you learn more CS than MIT course 6. The ECE 2014 graduates I advised now work at world-class software engineering companies such as Blackberry, Microsoft, Desire2Learn. I don't think the SE or CS program can even compare, do they even know what a binary tree is?  Don't make a mistake, do ECE!"
uwaterloo,3clg4j,KapinKrunch,4,Wed Jul 8 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"This is terrible advice; obviously CS and SE students learn about binary trees very early in the program. In terms of what you will learn about theoretical computer science, CS > SE > ECE."
uwaterloo,3clg4j,temp722,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:53:46 2015 UTC,SE is just as theoretical as CS. Look at the courses we take :P
uwaterloo,3clg4j,KapinKrunch,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:00 2015 UTC,"Depends; IIRC, there are more required algorithms courses in CS than there are in SE. Certainly there are more elective slots in CS, and fewer required non-CS-related courses, so you can pack more theoretical stuff in if you want to. (I actually graduated from SE myself.)"
uwaterloo,3clg4j,SidusKnight,0,Thu Jul 9 00:57:32 2015 UTC,We have the exact same number of algo courses now. The only key difference is the calc courses really.   Our associate director agrees with my assessment :)
uwaterloo,3clg4j,KapinKrunch,2,Thu Jul 9 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"CS has the opportunity to be more theoretical though. You can't really take many math electives, and are more limited in the number of theoretical CS courses you can take than CS students are. Of course, many CS students do not take advantage of this."
uwaterloo,3clg4j,SidusKnight,2,Thu Jul 9 01:31:05 2015 UTC,Functional programming is just a paradigm and has literally nothing to do with being more theoretical than any other language.   EDIT: removed the incorrect first statement about racket.
uwaterloo,3clg4j,uwthrowaway39833883,2,Thu Jul 9 00:55:35 2015 UTC,You realize that racket is an application for running scheme?   DrRacket != Racket. Racket is a programming language.

uwaterloo,3co7z0,TheLuckyCharm,-6,Thu Jul 9 13:17:35 2015 UTC,I checked the course requirements. Since CS is heavy in discrete math and comb and optim is discrete math I thought there would only be small differences between them (aside from programming)
uwaterloo,3co7z0,TheLuckyCharm,3,Thu Jul 9 13:19:37 2015 UTC,The first year for both majors would be similar but aside from that I believe it's going to be very different. Considering comb and optim don't take CS major courses.
uwaterloo,3co7z0,uwCsAdvisor,-4,Thu Jul 9 15:27:37 2015 UTC,Aren't they both very similar since both deal with a lot of discrete math?  As for your question why not both?

They are part of certificate programs that have nothing to do with your degree at UW.  You don't even need a degree from UW to take them, it's like night school at a college.  The only bonus Alumni get is the discount.  They have in class courses but they are not held on campus (about the same cost as a normal course in engineering).

uwaterloo,3chp5e,lotuschan,31,Wed Jul 8 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"Last term in round one I got two interviews, one for a job I was interested in and paid well... The other had mediocre pay and wasn't really related to my program (man eng, 1B).   So for the first one, I put on the suit I wore to prom, prepped for hours, went in and thought I killed it.   Now this was in February if I remember correctly, and it was a pretty bad winter. My second also happened to be a Skype interview, and I really didn't give a shit. So I went out drinking the night before, woke up, threw the top half of my suit on top of some thick track pants and winter boots (it had snowed a lot the night before), and trudged to the Tatham centre without prepping at all.  The whole interview seemed a little awkward, I didn't know anything about anything since it was meant for a Civil, and i knew no background on the employer. Needless to say, I didn't think it went very well, but didn't really mind. It was still round 1 after all.   Rankings come around, I rank the first job a 1 and the second a 9... I was matched with the second.  Funny thing is, I'm halfway through it now and it's an amazing position with some great co-workers. I have my own office, and two weeks into the job they fired the manager of my department and when the new manager discovered how much I was paid, she gave me a $6/hour raise, more than I would have been making in the other job.

uwaterloo,3cm2mw,zero2g,3,Wed Jul 8 23:36:25 2015 UTC,Not rank:  they don't want you.  Ranked:  they want you but someone is higher on their list.  Offer:  you can have the job if you take it.
uwaterloo,3cm2mw,sethnis,3,Thu Jul 9 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"ranked = you have the capability to do the job, they don't mind seeing you taking the position, they just prefer somebody more. it's like you are their back up plan in case their first rank (offered) doesn't take the job, you will do.    employers give offer as many as position they have available or wanting to hire. if they have 3 positions open, they allocate 2 for waterloo students, they will offer 2 people.    whether employers rank all or none, it depends on each employer. rule of thumb is always if you are ranked, means that you are capable and good enough for the job; if you are not ranked means that either you are not capable and/or they don't want to work with you for whatever reason.    you can't do anything for positions that already put up their rankings. you can only hope that the person they offer gets another offer and prefer that offer instead (which rarely happens in continuous round).    for future interviews: try to stand out. being ranked means that you are okay, not too bad, but not the best candidate. you have to show that you are better than the rest of the candidates and it's in their best interest to choose you and not others. you don't control who employers offer, but you can do things on your side to increase likelihood of getting offered.    often time employers can be confusing on their method of choosing who the best candidate is, each have their own criteria. i had a friend who got an offer even though she wasn't very interested and half-ass the interview (showed up in jeans, didn't answer very enthusiastically)."
uwaterloo,3cm2mw,feb914,3,Thu Jul 9 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"It means you suck, but they want to speed up the interview progress because it's costing them a lot of money.  Seriously though, perhaps the company does have a limit on how many interns they can hire because they they have only so much funding. They see a few good candidates, but can only hire so many, so they give offers to the ones they think are most fitted for the job, and rank the ones they believe are suitable (but not the best). Best case for them is that they don't have to continue to advertise their positions.  Yes companies rank people differently, yes they outright reject people if they think you're not a suitable candidate."

And not taking it also locks you out of a lot of the interesting upper-year CO courses.    Plus OP is still unsure of what to major in.

uwaterloo,3cicgq,annihilatron,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"fyi there are other combination deals.   Have you tried the optometry building? We do have an actual optometry program; students/doctors there will give you cheap-ish eye exams and I'm told they have some contact lens/glasses offerings. https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-clinics/ && https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-clinics/services-we-offer/optical-services Lenscrafters will give you 15% off either frames or lenses, or 30% off for both. You need to show CAA membership or a photocopy of a parent's CAA. Depending on whether they have an offer available, they might be able to comp your eye exam. small startup eyeglass stores are hit and miss; usually they can comp your eye exam, but quality is on and off. Check if they have name brand frames and compare pricing with Lenscrafters / Hakim / etc. Lenscrafters is typically the most expensive, followed by the other 'known' stores like Hakim, etc."

There are less applicants during winter/fall, but do remember there are also less jobs. Lots of employers only hire during summer. If you had a hard time finding a job this term, you will find it hard to find a job next term, unless experience changes. Your best bet would be to improve yourself and your experiences. Co-op stream is trivial in my opinion."
uwaterloo,3chx9p,nerdyfag,0,Wed Jul 8 01:43:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it could possibly be a grass is greener situation when the time of year of your co-op varies throughout your academic career.

uwaterloo,3chx9p,MrSanToeKnee,2,Wed Jul 8 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"You can switch your academic/co-op terms as you please (for the most part). Get an 8 month job? Switch to 8 month coop stream. Want to do 8 month school then 8 month coop? Thats possible too.    There are some people who think specific work terms are ""easier"". They make the effort to switch ""streams"" in hopes of getting those first year terms. Or, people who have 8 month school then first coop vs people who have 12 month school then first coop. They might say their first work term (summer) was harder."
uwaterloo,3chx9p,nerdyfag,3,Wed Jul 8 19:30:11 2015 UTC,"I think fall is really easy to get a job compared to summer, as long as your standards aren't super high. Not sure about winter since I haven't had a winter co-op yet. I think math only had a 50% employment this summer for first years, and it's usually not because they aren't smart enough. It's really all about luck (clicking with your interviewer). I also reflect on this quote whenever I tank an interview:   ""You can be the juiciest peach in the world, but there'll also be someone who doesn't like peaches""  - Random English Major   Just take every interview as a learning experience, and don't be afraid to make yolo plays."

uwaterloo,3chx9p,vyke2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:40:45 2015 UTC,I think it's because people from other schools are looking for summer jobs. So there should be less competition for jobs in fall/winter.

He said that Fall term had the highest rate of employed co-op students, followed by Winter, then Spring.   But honestly? Don't sweat it too much since this was your first co-op term. Most people have trouble landing their first placements anyways (some unemployed, so I would consider yourself lucky). Since you're in Math/Farm, maybe try vying for next Winter for your work term because of tax season or whatnot. Summers are generally hard and it's not as busy since most employees are taking vacations at this point.   I would just avoid Spring jobs in general just cause there is so much competition. And tbh, I've never found a strong difference in number of open placements between all my co-op terms. But take my words with a grain of salt because its different for everyone."

uwaterloo,3ci7nb,TheLuckyCharm,3,Wed Jul 8 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Chem 101 is new this year so no one for sure can tell you but as others have said it's basically a how to guide for biochem, so not really a course, it's a seminar.   This being said show up even if there is no consequence to not going, it will help and I wish I had this in my first year. You will to meet others in your program, advisers, profs, upper years - people who can help you be successful. This is even more important since all science basically has a general first year and don't otherwise get to meet any of these people until at least second year when most people have already dropped out. Hopefully this will help curve the insane dropout rate (like 80%+).   For fall you have 5 lectures with 3 labs + seminar. This will total an academic load equal to 6.5 courses (labs count as half a course, and have separate exams). But don't worry in 2B you do get to experience 6 courses with labs on top. Putting it out there right now, biochem is not particularly easy.   Good luck, have fun!"

uwaterloo,3ci7nb,inquirer007,2,Thu Jul 9 20:42:24 2015 UTC,Interesting I never had to take that. I wouldn't worry about it. If you did any calculus in high school then Math 127 is a breeze and most of the other first year science courses are like ~80% review depending on your high school curriculum.
uwaterloo,3ci7nb,grantbenjensen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:40:40 2015 UTC,"In addition to comment above, 5 courses is the usual load but there are some programs that have more than 5 courses scheduled into a term (ex. engineering programs).

I think the biggest thing for me was getting out of the high school mentality where you will have success no matter how little you try. I started to go to help sessions but I think the biggest thing is to do your assignments by yourself! Don't copy friends, don't copy answers, struggle through them and actually learn the material!   Luckily most finals are weighted towards the second half of the term content wise, so if you put some actually effort in you'll be fine, don't worry.  I think I passed 1A with a 62 average, got lucky to be honest. But now I'm usually middle of my class going into 3B so it is possible to turn your marks around, don't give up :)"
uwaterloo,3cdkcj,Chemroo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Mechie here, I also failed all my midterms in 1B, due to being lazy and not really trying just like you. Here are some tips that helped me; btw I ended with a 61 at the end.  - Go over your midterms to see what you did wrong and redo all your midterms! This really helped me a lot.  - Start doing your assignments on a weekly basis (unlike me who didn't really do a lot, except last minute copy-paste). This really helps to clear concepts.  - Go to your TA's, Prof's for extra help. Instead of trying to memorize things try to understand the concepts as to why you do them. This to be honest helped me a lot.  - It will be hard work, but it is definitely possible. Hey I did it and I am not that smart.  - Study Tip: Since I needed to get around 85% + on all my finals to pass the term; I broke everyday into 2 separate subjects and into different concepts. I would not sleep until I got through them + all your everyday school work. This really pushed me to keep a routine. I also hit the gym everyday; so that kept me fresh and keep my stress levels down.   Hope this gives you some ideas to pass your term. Work Hard and you will be rewarded :)"
uwaterloo,3cdkcj,mrualreadyknow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:25:27 2015 UTC,Go over all of your midterms with a TA or Prof. Make sure they were actually graded correctly. If not - you might get some (or a lot) of marks back.  True story: Failed all of my eng midterms. Devastated. Went over them with TAs and Profs. All graded incorrectly and actually passed.  Take a deep breath. You will be ok.  And it doesn't sound like you're lazy. Sounds like you are really trying. Keep trying. You can do it.

Your employer doesn't want to go through the hiring process again and this does nothing to your candidacy for the position. Plus, withdrawing offers for stuff like this is an awful way to treat people.  I don't think they would even find out to begin with."

uwaterloo,3cbhow,forcedobscurity,4,Mon Jul 6 20:54:28 2015 UTC,Think they are pretty much in line with every other stores.  It'll depend on the styles and cut.
uwaterloo,3cbhow,twinnedcalcite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment on the other sizes, but I usually wear medium when I buy clothes from places other than the Waterloo store. I bought a medium crew neck and it fits well. It was a little bit looser than my normal clothes, but not really an issue. So I'd say it's close to the sizes in what you would find at like an American eagle or any other well known clothing store. Maybe expect it to be a little bit bigger. Hope that helped :)"
uwaterloo,3cbhow,zainh96,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:52:59 2015 UTC,There are fitting rooms in the apparel store in south campus hall. You can try the sizes there but there are generally the same as the sizes in other stores.
uwaterloo,3cc9fa,imnotscared11,2,Mon Jul 6 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"Former 111L TA here - 111L and 121L are very similar (131L is the same course as 121L just they put all the physics majors together).  3 of the 5 labs are the exact same experiment but take place on different weeks so equipment can be shared. The main difference is the 111L has more of a fill in the blank style lab report verses 121L where you have to come more prepared with your own outline (or copy the one from 111L) - for both the lab report is handed in at the end of the class.  Since they are so similar I would consider taking 121L just to keep more options open, like pure physics or chem phys - some students find they highly prefer just physics or biology and switch out, to switch to physics you need 121L.  Also most 121L students have a better back ground in physics and this can be a useful quality in a lab partner. As well, more people who take 121L go on to take more upper year physics courses, meeting future classmates could be beneficial."
uwaterloo,3cc9fa,asylum19,0,Mon Jul 6 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds odd, but my program plan dictates that one should take either 111L or 131L (but not 121L) for the 121 lecture course...  https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/SCI-Honours-Life-Physics So, you mentioned that 111L and 121L are similar, but is there a huge difficulty gap between 111L and 131L? Are the finals the same for these courses, or are they different...? Thanks in advance."
uwaterloo,3cc9fa,asylum19,2,Tue Jul 7 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"121L and 131L are exactly the same, the difference between 111L and 121L is the same difference between 111L and 131L.   This does change in second term 122L is different than 132L (132L has twice the number of experiments, 5 from 122L and 5 extra just for 132L)  The only difference for first term is that they divide up who takes 121L vs. 131L by programs. For example people in nano-materials take 121L and people in honours physics take 131L but the content and even lab exam is the same."
uwaterloo,3cc9fa,asylum19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarification. Can I ask you one more question? I do intend to take Phys 122 in the winter; is it possible to take 122L in the winter even when you took 131L in the fall term? Or do lab levels have to stay the same throughout the year(meaning I'll have to take 132L in winter as well?) I'm only asking because I think I'll know whether I want to switch programs after I had my taste of the courses in the fall term (If I decide that I don't want to, 3-level labs would become unnecessary for me) . As for the fall term, I think I'll take your advice and take 131L..."
uwaterloo,3cc9fa,thegreatkim,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"You can almost always drop down to 'easier' courses you can take 132L/122L/112L in the winter provided you take 131L in the fall.  Also as an aside, DO YOUR PRE-LABS! Spend at least 2-4 hours before lab preparing or you won't finish in the scheduled lab time, and the reports are 75% of your final lab grade - they are very important to do well on."

Anyone in CS 145 can drop down at any time before the second midterm to 135, since it's really hard and most people don't know what they're getting into. So if you can get into 145 you'll be able to drop down as soon as the semester starts.  The other thing, is that they raise enrollment caps in all sections in the first week or two of classes, so if you sign up for 115 or something, you could probably snag a spot if you're quick when the caps go up."

The principle states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but‚Äîin the absence of differences in predictive ability‚Äîthe fewer assumptions that are made, the better.    Image i - Andreas Cellarius's illustration of the Copernican system, from the Harmonia Macrocosmica (1708). The motions of the sun, moon and other solar system planets can be calculated using a geocentric model (the earth is at the center) or using a heliocentric model (the sun is at the center). Both work, but the geocentric system requires many more assumptions than the heliocentric system, which has only seven.

This requires basically every budgetary change to require a referendum, which might entail a referendum every few weeks alone. What's the logistics of this referendum? A yes/no answer? If so, who decides what budget to offer for the yes/no response? How do you handle changes, or if it isn't just a yes/no answer, how do you balance different concerns? Do you just only have one budget meeting (in GM format) and then not allow future modifications to it, despite the inconvenience?  How do you form committees if > some small number of people from the 37,000 students at this university want to be on them? Election campaigns for every single minor committee in existence, complete with campaigning and bios?  Once you've delegated a bunch of this work to committees, do you even truly have a direct democracy any more, or are the committee members your new representatives? If you don't have committees, how do you make a decision about literally anything when some nontrivial percentage of those 37,000 people have an opinion they really want you to hear, no matter how little you care?  Most ""direct"" democracy systems support some concept of delegates or committee members etc which are representatives in everything but name. This is pretty clear in your third link.    The issue with student involvement on this campus is considerably deeper than FEDS pissing people off. For instance, I'm not aware of people going around complaining about how MathSoc (which I am involved in) is literally the devil or anything, but we still really struggle to find representatives to fill our seats, despite mathNEWS articles, mass emails which mention elections among other things, posters, various events, and so forth. No matter how much we try, most students don't know or care what we are or do other than handing out free food every now and then and having a stapler in the main office, and everyone's pretty much out of ideas on how to get them to care. In a sense MathSoc is almost de facto a direct democracy in the way that your third link describes in that if anyone puts the effort into getting five signatures from people into their program, odds are they'll be directly acclaimed to council without even needing an election, since there are just so few people that run. Anyone can attend MathSoc council meetings--they need neither be a student nor in Math--and in general can speak whenever they want (technically they need to be granted speaking rights by a councillor, but I can't remember the last time this has been denied). And yet people don't do this. Any plan which requires these people who don't care to start actually contributing and making decisions requires first and foremost some kind of realistic description on how you plan to actually make them care enough to contribute."
uwaterloo,3c8t5q,ubermatt,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"This is a very fair point, and if I actually do end up running with this, I'll continue to hammer out the idea, and find some practical way to make it run. At the very worst, I can push for more student input.  The main reason I bring this stuff up is that I don't want a fairly major decision like the eviction of Imprint (or the Chevron, for that matter), or spending of $45,000 on map machines, to be able to be made seemingly willy-nilly. At least some form of following promises would be nice as well, if you look at the Imprint decision, it happened at a closed board meeting, even after the referendum on opening board meetings to the student body. That sort of thing just screams that the execs know that their decisions are unpopular and are trying to hide them so that students don't try to stop them."
uwaterloo,3c8t5q,DKsan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with any of your points, but I do want to correct some facts here.  The Imprint decision happened in confidential session, which would occur regardless of whether Board was supposed to be open or closed to the public.    And there was no referendum on opening board meetings to the student body."
uwaterloo,3c8t5q,Ne_Oublie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember it came up and was voted on in a general meeting, which is supposed to be a referendum-like event."
uwaterloo,3c8t5q,terminus23,2,Mon Jul 6 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"That did happen, but a general meeting and a referendum are very very different.  That motion only had 51 people vote on it, while the most recent referendum (the U-Pass one in feb 2014) had nearly 30% of the student body vote in it.  Of Council, Board, the Exec, General Meetings, and Referenda, I would probably say a decision made at a General Meeting is the most likely to be undemocratic.  Council, Board, and Exec are elected by students and ""represent"" them (note that I don't necessarily think this is always true). Referenda allow students to directly choose the outcome of the question rather than relying on representatives to do it for them.  This is certainly the most democratic. General meetings are the least democratic in my opinion because they are not representative of students, but just of interest groups that show up to the meeting.  When quorum is only 50 people, a small club could show up to a GM and highly influence the way Feds is run.  If anything, I disliked that a GM was making Board meetings open, and I was the person on Board who put the motion forward.  In my opinion, a general meeting should be nothing more than the necessary corporate stuff for Feds (approving an auditor, electing a Board, ratifying election results) unless we saw a much much much higher percentage of students showing up to it."

uwaterloo,3c9r6c,uwlol,3,Mon Jul 6 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"I used to work in recruitment. Depends on the company. Outdated companies won't pay for it, newer companies will most likely offer you a video conference interview instead if they know you don't have a vehicle and may need to travel for 2 hours for the interview for a one-way trip. Doesn't hurt to ask, but I would bring it up as that you don't own a vehicle and would like to inquire about whether or not their company usually provides travel reimbursement. Also mention that if not, it's not a big deal and you thought you'd just ask in case they do. They won't give you a hard time because they know students are poor. :)"

So its a small (11-50 people) size company. They haven't brought it up yet and neither me and I was nervous if it would be rude to bring it up.

uwaterloo,3c7plh,linksku,12,Sun Jul 5 17:56:14 2015 UTC,"HA good luck, welcome to the pain my friend!   The housing around where you work sucks. Sorry. Its a shitty area.  Theres a place called 'The Tenderloin' in San Francisco and, well, its bad. Not as bad as people make it seem but just avoid it. Seriously, avoid it. Massive population of homeless people, gangs, and general no-gooders.  Expect to pay $1500/mo+. Its just standard. If you live in the Inner/Outer Sunset you can find cheap housing but you'll have 40-45 min commute and its boring as hell over there. Look for housing in Berkeley. Its cheaper, and if your'e by a BART station it takes 30-40 mins for you to get to work.  Things marked as 'SoMA' but are around 7th-10th are really just an extension of the Tenderloin and pretty shitty in terms of housing. Market at 7th-11th down to Bryant.. Yeah, all shitty. You're going to have to be willing to compromise because shit is expensive. Just find housing and stick with it. DO NOT STAY AT THE PARK HOTEL I dont know what it is with Wloo students and that place but they always think 'nah it will be fine' and then they cry to me asking to crash at my place because its so shitty. It's happened 12 times. Just stay the fuck away. Be willing to split a room. The city is great, have fun!"
uwaterloo,3c7plh,Victawr,3,Sun Jul 5 21:12:48 2015 UTC,"Actually I stayed at Park Hotel for 2 terms. It was decent. It's not like a proper hotel but not that bad. It's like living at V1 paying $1400/month for walking to work 5min away, well worth it for the distance and the food near by. It was a super convenient location. The only bad thing about Park Hotel is the internet, but I used a mobile hotspot so it wasn't a problem. Also there is weekly room service and that was awesome for the price. Not to mention a very comfortable bed. I'm curious what drove those uWaterloo students away... Best price for a temporary place to stay."
uwaterloo,3c7plh,simplic12,3,Mon Jul 6 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"When were you there? First off, the prices have increased to about 1600/mo  (maybe just the summer price)  The rooms are just not good compared to what you can find for those prices.   People new to the city are very quickly shaken by the people in that area.   Not to mention plenty of them have things stolen from their rooms.   A lot of them had very very unpleasant neighbours.   But yeah, for the price? Not worth it."
uwaterloo,3c7plh,Victawr,2,Mon Jul 6 01:50:09 2015 UTC,"I was there for Fall 2014 and Winter 2014 and the price was $1400/month. Rodel, the manager of Park Hotel, was very willing to let me go through several rooms until I found one I liked.   Really Stolen? I never had anything stolen for the 2 terms I was there. Everyone was pretty nice.  EDIT: I'm actually surprised by those comments. Never had any trouble with anyone there for 2 terms. It's an old building with an alley way behind the building but it doesn't really matter since your in a tall building and no one can climb and reach your rooms. But it does look sketchy depending on where you are in the building when you look outside. And I totally agree for the price you can find other places but the place was very close (~5min walk away from my workplace) and restaurants for food within seconds in the centre of DT San Fran. The location for that price can't be beat. Besides I just go to my room for sleeping anyway and the bed was pretty good. Didn't really have a bad night except for a few loud drunk people, which is expected for being downtown.

uwaterloo,3c7plh,aqazwsx1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:13:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of the people talking shit about it had stayed there in 2013.   I've heard better now, but people just hate paying ~$1600 to not even get a kitchen.  Its not a terrible area but its not nice at all. And as you may know, a lot of people from Waterloo are really timid. The condition switch from Canada to Park Hotel is insanely jarring to them."
uwaterloo,3c7plh,Victawr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"I lived in Park Hotel last year Summer 2014 and it was $1400/mo also. Rodel who works there was very nice and if you have any troubles with the hotel, he would help you resolve it. Overall I agree with the @simplic12 poster. The rooms was nothing special, bed was quite comfy actually. You get your own sink and fridge, and share the washroom (never ran into any trouble). The maids who clean your place are nice and I'd be very shocked that things would be stolen..."
uwaterloo,3c7plh,aqazwsx1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:10:57 2015 UTC,"How about further Southwest along Market St.? According to Google Maps, Market St. and 16th/17th should take less than 10 minutes to get to work. That should be sufficiently far from Tenderloin right?"
uwaterloo,3c7plh,Graendal,2,Sun Jul 5 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"It does not take 45 minutes to commute from inner sunset to Market & Van Ness. There is a muni metro station right at Market & Van Ness so as long as you live close to any of the muni metro lines it won't be too hard to get to work. You don't need to live right where you work, you can save a lot of money by going a bit further out. Honestly, if you were willing to commute 45 minutes you could live in the east bay and still make it work as long as you were close to a Bart station."
uwaterloo,3c7plh,Victawr,2,Mon Jul 6 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"Oh right, Market & Van ness, not further. Unfortunately, even the N-Judah gets held up before heading underground. 40 minutes is no stretch. Though depending on when you leave I'd say you can definitely make it in 30."
uwaterloo,3c7plh,Victawr,2,Mon Jul 6 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"Market & 16th/17th is the Duboce Triangle area. Typically advertised as being a nice place but it's been going way down hill as of recent.   Not bad though. Not too much around, but close enough to good things."

No matter how great the family might be, your needs are always secondary to their own. This means that they get first dibs on the kitchen, washroom, shower, living room and so on -- it's extremely difficult to function independently."

Hiked their fee for pretty much no reason (more FEDS staff for IT or something)  Are kicking Imprint out of the SLC for FEDS office space   They're also renting 6 segways. Why? Who knows.  Oh and the exec gets paid $50k or $60k a year each.

uwaterloo,3c5j83,adrieitz,57,Wed Jul 8 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"Some of the services FEDS offers have substantial value. Even if I don't use most of them, others (probably) do, and I am fine with paying for them because they add value to the campus community.  FEDS exec, however, is a different story. They are a bunch of petty politicians masquerading themselves as a credible organization. Their arrogance and incompetence is something I would expect out of a small-town local government. Their transparency is laughable. Their bureaucracy is expanding without providing any substantial increase in services (but they still want the students to pony up the cash for it). Hell, they can't even manage to cobble together a decent online election system at a school known for CS. That's how much they suck.  To be frank, they are an embarrassment. UW is one of the top schools in the world for math and engineering. A world-class school deserves world-class student representation, and FEDS isn't offering that. At this point, I simply derive my value from FEDS in the form of entertainment because if I actually decided to care about how they spend my precious dollars, I would be pretty pissed off."
uwaterloo,3c5j83,lotuschan,7,Sun Jul 5 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what do you want out of your student government that FEDS doesn't offer or doesn't do properly? I don't have particularly strong feelings about FEDS since they don't negatively impact me as a student in any significant way that I'm aware of - and not including the fees we pay.   At this point it seems like FEDS has done some things that are actively harmful or illogical, but I'm having trouble figuring out what I would actually want from a competent student government... it seems like the best I can come up with for myself is ""shut up and make me forget you exist."""
uwaterloo,3c5j83,joemama19,9,Sun Jul 5 07:21:53 2015 UTC,"what do you want out of your student government that FEDS doesn't offer or doesn't do properly?   They could at least like...try to not overtly be a joke. You know, the passive aggressive ad campaigns. Evicting the Imprint after they've been there for over 30 years. Spending $45,000 on glorified iPads. That whole thing.  Personally, I'd like to see exec reaching out to the students more. They need to give us a reason to give a shit about them, and a really good way to do that is to give a shit about us."
uwaterloo,3c5j83,lotuschan,3,Sun Jul 5 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"Do you honestly think a bunch of people in their early 20's can run a student government properly?  I sure as hell wouldn't have been too great at that age either.  It's silly and it seems that through the years it gets more out of hand and less students bother to even get involved in student government, let alone even bother voting.

uwaterloo,3c5j83,Tree_Boar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"Considering no one cares to vote and/or run for FEDS exec, is it really worth complaining about? I mean, are we any better for not getting involved and making a difference?"
uwaterloo,3c5j83,lotuschan,15,Sun Jul 5 13:15:50 2015 UTC,"is it really worth complaining about?   I think it is, because their fees are not optional. If I'm forced to financially support their two-bit organization, then I reserve the right to complain.   are we any better for not getting involved and making a difference?    I don't think so, because there is a definitive barrier to participation. Many people don't want to take a year off of school to be part of student government. Many people don't have the time to attend a general meeting. Many people don't go to the SLC because it's out of the way. The students need a better, easier way to have their ideas heard.  It's not that the students don't want to get involved. They just need something to care about. Look at the UPASS referendum. Voter turnout was almost 30%, while the exec turnout in the same election was only 11%.  I have to give credit to Maaz Yasin, because this is the first time in the 4 years I've been here that I've seen a FEDS exec proactively reaching out to students. He came to reddit and asked what we wanted to see in terms of campus safety. And then he went to UW admin and actually got shit done? I mean it's still only speed bumps and stop signs, but it's a start. The point is that he came to us, which is a huge barrier being torn down."

If you're going through university without a credit card (like I was) and you're in charge of requisitioning supplies/books/etc in your budget, that position is supposed to help you because it's going to come from their budget anyways.   It's also helpful when your VPIn comes from a club or service (but not society), because they know the shit that happens on the ground. Hence why Maaz isn't an idiot like the rest of the exec."

I refuse to believe that there's anyone at this university who can't spare three hours or whatever once per term other than people who have scheduling conflicts with unmissable commitments (ie going out with friends doesn't count) during that precise three-hour period.  I definitely agree that FEDS seems to get in the way more often than they help though."

I have classes most days of the week at that time, and I know many others who do. Plus, that's running into exam time to top it all off. They had a livestream set up, but no online voting.  To fix it as is, they could:    Move it to a weekend/evening Expand the online service, allow voting Move it completely online, or allow students to vote online beforehand so that their voice is heard.

Because the president doesn't do jack shit and is mainly a Feds mascot. What's your portfolio, this years Feds prez? How much of it have you even started on?  Because your staff actively shit talks Imprint and other student organizations on Facebook. And then are forced to write a shitty apology when they get called out on it. Can we elect the people who call you out on your shit to office instead?  Because our VPOF is an absolute disgrace when it comes to being interviewed. Watch them fumble through a 4 minute interview when the interviewer wants to go beyond the Feds' official statement.   Because their communications coordinator is so god awful that if you send her an email, you'll be lucky to get her to reply within the week.  Because I had a meeting with a former VPED set at 2pm and I ran around for two hours trying to find him in the fucking SLC. Feds staff were running around trying to find him. Wasn't even doing anything important, said he had ""lost track of time"".   Because they no longer advertise their AGMs and elections like they used to. Remember when you had signs on lawns and in buildings Feds? Everybody who started before 2012 remembers, because once upon a time it seems like at least one of your executives had their shit together.  Because you hire full-time staff members, let them vote in student issues (why on earth is your staff WHO AREN'T STUDENTS and ARE NOT UP TO DATE ON STUDENT NEEDS and some of who are FORMER FEDS EXEC voting on student issues in the AGM? THIS SHOULD BE OVERTURNED), make them offices where student clubs and organizations used to have room, and then provide absolutely no tangible services.  Because your IT staff is so shit, your website ends up being blocked by Google as a malware. Seriously.   Because the accessibility shuttle doesn't run in the summer when students are actively breaking bones and Feds hasn't done anything about it.  Because Feds is one giant cliquey club. Because our President was part of the board of directors (and was pro them being closed to the public), 2 VPs are re-elected, and one was a counsellor who has now proved herself to be grossly incompetent at anything regarding her job. VPOF, please learn how to speak publicly. You're embarrassing all of Waterloo on the radio.  Because a single technicality allowed our former Feds President to once again close Board of Directors meetings. This same president said that she wished that students would be more interested in Feds instead of the board because board was ""boring"". Now we know she wanted us to focus on Feds because board was booting out errybody in the SLC. #Fedsdoesthat  Because #Fedsdoesthat is the stupidest fucking hashtag known to mankind.  Because they took away club space where clubs could hold equipment and did fucking nothing (I mean: nothing that would be student space) with it.  Because they have the most ratchet microwave on the second floor. (Is that thing still there??)  Because they found $40k in the budget to spend on 3 giant iPads. Or you know, you could increase support for the off campus shuttle that transports more people in 1 night than people who have ever used those shitty ass iPads.  Because Feds didn't do jackshit when the 1 Columbia situation happened. Oh what's that, WPIRG ended up being the main resource for students affected? The WPIRG you kicked out of the SLC. #Fedsdoesthat  Because the VPED has not done anything substantial to show UW that increasing international student tuition by the double digits is not okay.  Feds needs a slap on the wrist as an organization. They have gotten progressively worse since I first started at UW.   But seriously, can we fire the VPOF and her communications person? That 570 interview seriously makes our entire school look bad.   Edit: VPIN diverted shuttles to pick up students from mosques during Ramadan. That's the only tangible thing that has happened in the past two months from our Feds exec. Good to see he's helping his voter base.  Edit2: Our current President, when running for Board, made the most insensitive campaign posters where he was pictured as Jesus if I remember correctly. Somehow he found that this was okay.  If you search our VPOF's public Twitter, her statuses include: ""A MAN JUST POINTED TO A PAIR OF MY UNDERWEAR THAT FELL ON THE GROUND AND ASKED IF THEY WERE MINE. I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS"". ""@uwimprint following me on different forms of social media. Sparknotes summary: @Drake and poop jokes"" ""Pls remember that I have other things to worry about during elections. School, donning, surgery, what Mindy is going to do now?!"""

uwaterloo,3c5j83,tellmeyoursowon,4,Mon Jul 6 09:40:24 2015 UTC,Even sadder is that she used her VPOF Twitter to tell 570 News that she would like to comment. She practically set herself up to fail.

uwaterloo,3c5j83,DKsan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"Because you hire full-time staff members, let them vote in student issues (why on earth is your staff WHO AREN'T STUDENTS and ARE NOT UP TO DATE ON STUDENT NEEDS and some of who are FORMER FEDS EXEC voting on student issues in the AGM? THIS SHOULD BE OVERTURNED)   I'm sorry, but I've never encountered a not-for-profit (like Feds and Imprint are) where the staff are not allowed to vote in their general meetings. Must be some not-profit law, or general best practices that most follow.  Maybe there should be some nudging that the general practice is for the staff to not vote, but to abstain on motions. Last I remember, that's how Imprint's EIC voted."
uwaterloo,3c5j83,tellmeyoursowon,2,Mon Jul 6 03:04:32 2015 UTC,It should be overturned because Feds has used their staff to swing the vote from one side to another on at least one occasion in recent history. This is actively using their staff to vote against student sentiment in favour of Feds' agenda.
uwaterloo,3c5j83,DKsan,14,Mon Jul 6 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"I don't want to hate Feds.  A few years ago, because of issues, I transferred to York. I was heavily involved at UW. I was an Imprint volunteer, and then various editors with my final position as News Editor during Winter 2012 (So 2010-2012). I also was a GLOW volunteer and director from 2010-2011.  I don't want to hate Feds because during the time I was at UW, they were getting so many things right. They were open, you could plop into their offices without needing an appointment.   When I was GLOW's peer support and resources director, I didn't have a credit card, so the VP Internal at the time directly used the budget to buy materials, instead of me trying to order things and then dealing with receipts.   When I was doing Imprint stuff, again, the same general friendliness, openness, and transparency was all there. I disagreed with shit that happened, but we didn't have this hostility that seems to have arisen since then.  I transferred to York. When you transfer, or take another undergrad with a student union affiliated with the CFS, you will be thankful for Feds. I had to fight for the budget, and meeting agendas and reports from their student government. I was blocked by executives.   You can walk into a Feds council meeting, and know when and where it's happening months in advance. You can view stuff online. I still CAN see those agendas. The amount of asshattery I've had to deal with over the past few years at York (I ended up being involved with their campus paper, derp), I don't want to hate Feds because they're supposed to be a shining pinnacle.  A conversation with a friend who has gone off to higher ed consulting told me that the Feds and Imprint relationship is supposed to be one of the better ones in the country.  Frankly, it apparently when all downhill when their awesome communications person got a job with the admin and they hired two media people who apparently don't know what they're doing. Apparently you can't just walk into their offices anymore. Apparently last year's president has a reputation as bully.   I also think they got intoxicated with the power of being in total control of the SLC. Other campuses where their student gov't's control their student buildings don't try to go all power crazy and demand only student clubs (under their control) are allowed in. No one kicks out revenue-generating tenants, especially those which are student friendly. It's ridiculous."

uwaterloo,3c5j83,BigWiggly1,5,Sun Jul 5 07:22:37 2015 UTC,"It's a valid question, and I think there are multiple contributors to the answer.   Waterloo students are busy as it is so most students don't have the time to put towards FEDs. Those that are ambitious and want to be involved in a community will put that ambition towards their coop program or towards their faculty and their interests.  School spirit here isn't exactly raging either. For people to want change, they need to care about the ""school community"" which we don't have much of. UW students go off campus in their free time, so they don't care much about what's on campus.  Finally, because most people just don't want to be associated with FEDs. For the average FEDs hater, we don't want to deal with that shit every day. It's bad enough we have to put up with their posters and nonsense. We're more inclined to just ignore what we can and carry on.  FEDs isn't a problem that can be fixed by some people joining. It's a much larger issue to tackle, and would probably require outside consulting and a complete rebuild of their services and business model."
uwaterloo,3c5j83,BigWiggly1,8,Sun Jul 5 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"I hate FEDs because they are out of touch with the student population. They make business mistakes left and right and then expect the students to pitch in the cash to fix it.  5% participation in the election?! Why did they not have an advertising campaign before the election? They should've been running around campus visiting lecture halls, talking to students, putting up posters with election information. They should've worked together with Learn to get the election on there as a survey. There could've been notifications on Learn ahead of time referencing things that FEDs actually does (before their shitty #fedsdoesthat poster campaign). If the election was on Learn, I'd have known about it, I'd have had a chance to take a quick look at some information about it, and I would've voted.  Even using Learn would have been a last-ditch effort.   They should've been hosting campus events throughout the term - every term. Outdoor concerts with food trucks and drink tents like during o-week. Charge cheap admission for students. I'd pay $5 for a concert. If they get up on stage before or between sets, they can actually talk to their student body.  Anything, ANYTHING to get students a reason to hang out on campus and enjoy themselves is something FEDs could do to improve student reception.  Instead they evict Imprint, kick clubs out of the SLC, build map kiosks (which don't help students, and certainly don't give students a reason to stay on campus), host a shitty bus service, and run the most lucrative used book store I've ever seen. Used books that are written in, torn, and beat up around the edges for 10% off their new price.  Serious question: what the hell is the FED hall building up to? I remember in my frosh week there was one event in there that I didn't go to because it was full or something. After that I didn't hear about it until last year when it was being taken over (?) and being renamed or something. The fact that I have no idea what happened is bad enough. If they don't own it anymore, why were they not using it for events? If they were, then they somehow managed to not tell most of the student population."
uwaterloo,3c5j83,DKsan,8,Sun Jul 5 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"Fed Hall was built by Feds decades ago. It's on the university's land, like pretty much everything else. When the lease ran out, the university grabbed it from them, in 2012 I think?"

I've waited 2 hours for the Fedbus to get here before, and tried calling the desk, but they don't have any means of directly contacting drivers. Wtf? How do they not even have control over their own service?"
uwaterloo,3c5j83,starburst0927,6,Sun Jul 5 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"People should get informed of both sides of the argument before making up their mind about it. It's equally important to look at what FEDS has done right as what it has done wrong. Negative things sticks out in our memories more easily than positive things, so it's very easy for the negative attitude against FEDS to perpetuate. This attitude can easily sway those who have never interacted with FEDS that closely before to only look at the negative side.  My personal experience with FEDS is as follows.  I've only interacted with the Internal side of FEDS because I have been volunteering for one of the FEDS services , Sustainable Campus Initiative (SCI), for two years. I have worked with the service coordinators, FEDS services manager, operations manager, and indirectly with the VPIN (Maaz) and I can say that those people gets lots of things done. As a volunteer for SCI, my voice was definitely heard.  I was a project lead for the e-waste recycling station in the lower atrium of the SLC (which you can use now to recycle your printer cartridges, small electronics, and writing utensils without going to three different locations in town and over at ECH) and received great support (administrative, marketing, coordination with Central Stores services and the university) from the FEDS staff I worked with. All projects from the services need to prove its worth to the students before it receives approval and funding. My team of volunteers and I were able to implement the station with a recycling program (pickup, maintenance, etc) in place within a year. This program came at no additional operational cost to the university since UW already has a contracted e-waste collector. It had a soft launch last term with an official launch this term with great uptake by the students (loads of e-waste collected already). The services manager (full time FEDS staff) did everything to help my team and I get this project done. The marketing department was extremely efficient in getting our promotional materials designed and published and were extremely accommodating when we requested changes to the designs.   The FEDS services have recently expanded by adding International and Canadian Student Network. The services include GLOW, Women's centre, Food bank, SCI, Campus Response team, and etc. A volunteer/exec can easily see that the time and funding are effectively used. A large fee decrease is simply not that easy and is detrimental to the services. Not all students may use these services but there are a large portion who do. This is why I don't like it when others complain that they are paying for services they don't use.  I recognize that FEDS has flaws and needs to improve as an organization. However, I DISAGREE that it has done nothing positive for the students and that it is a terribly run organization as a whole. The part I've interacted with has been very run and helped students get their voices heard. I've seen the VPIN countless times speaking to our service and other students. I cannot speak for the other parts of the executive team.   Summary: Get both sides of the argument, go volunteer for a FEDS service to get an inside look, and then decide your opinion.  P.S. To clarify, FEDS DID advertise the elections since the posters and signs were everywhere in the SLC. The other student buildings had them too. University buildings have designated areas for posters so FEDS can't post them everywhere."

Waterloo doesn't offer a similar course so they read over the course outline and determined from there how they would transfer it. In my case I get the credit but the grade I got won't show up.   I had to talk to the department academic advisor to transfer the course (not your faculty advisor, but the advisor for the department that the course falls under). Try contacting the department advisors for the courses you want to transfer and they can give you information about transferring courses and how they will consider it on your transcript.   Edit: whoops, I completely missed where you already contacted them.  From my experience with the course I took, the credit transferred only if I got higher than 60% but they didn't include the grade.

After 5 years here I can honestly say I've seen few reasons to pick up a copy of Imprint, mainly:   Complete a crossword because Imprint ones are easy and good time waster Use to soak up a spill Makeshift umbrella   Moreover, if Imprint is to be independent and openly criticize their lessor, it makes sense to move out anyways. Feds has simply terminated a lease, it can literally be for any reason. Lease a place for less or find some space near campus, why do you need offices to write articles?

Not that you care, but a lot of people and a lot of man-hours are put into making the paper every week, if there was an office off-campus it'd be a big deterrent for new volunteers to want to join, and current volunteers would probably become less active. I'm not exaggerating when I say it'd probably kill the paper, and at the very least we'd have much less resources and a lot less content.  Also, if you were following the spread of the story on social media, you'd know it wasn't just Imprint reacting. Alumni, anyone that dislikes how Feds runs things (i.e. a loooot of current students) student journalism organizations across the country, professional journalists and local news networks are all responding to it pretty actively. It's probably one of the biggest stories we've ever had in terms of how massively it's spread.   But hey, you're entitled to your opinion."

The first few assignments aren't too bad, I spend most of the time on them understanding OpenGL, but I think the main part of the course is the final project. It's open ended and you choose what you'll work on, but you're basically choosing between an OpenGL graphics engine or an enhanced ray tracer, and it can be very time consuming to get a good mark. Part of the problem is if you're interested in graphics, you'll probably be willing to put in long hours into it. I actually hurt my shoulder from bad ergonomics and from working on the project so much, but that's mostly because I was really into the assignment and wanted to make something I could be proud of.

The day before is probably a poor choice. Also 8-12 hours isn't really all that much if you haven't been paying attention in class or keeping up with assignments.   Type summary notes for every chapter (best if done on a weekly basis rather than right before midterm), then rewrite these notes by hand. Reread them again then do practice midterms (sit down and write them, don't just read the answers). Mark yourself, see where you're weak and reread that section of your typed notes. Do more questions.  After you get a midterm back. Go over every question. See where you went wrong. There's generally two/three possibilities:   1) You aren't very good at following instructions. I'm amazed at how many students suck in this category. Use a highlighter if necessary. Questions are generally quite specific: ""Explain this and give an example?"" A lot of students will only either explain or give an example, well there's 50% of the question mark gone.   2) You didn't know the material, that's ok, you can study better, more, differently, whatever you need, just try something different. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results  3) You knew the material, but the marker couldn't understand your writing or the ideas you were trying to convey. Go meet with the TA/Prof and go through the questions together and find out how you can improve your writing skills. This is hard, but improving your writing skills will help with midterms/finals/professional life. Consider that in a lot of arts based courses I have taken (philosophy minor), having strong writing skills can be the difference between 70 and 90.  Almost everything is fixable. Find the issue, propose a solution, try it out. It's the circle of life.  Best of luck!"

I space the studying over a course of a week or so.  Starting a week earlier, I write out all important parts of the material,  and then study that.  Practical application is next,  and that tend continues each day.  In my other classes. I'm getting mid to high 80s on midterms,  but this CS class is really bad for me.  I feel confident explaining the concept and coding it,  but this midterm was a massive curveball.  It was clearly asked in class if there would be coding of sorting algorithms,  and it was statd that you only needed to know how it worked and provide examples,  not code it.  Lo and behold,  you had to code it on the midterm. Is this common?

Contact the grading TA/prof and go through it. Study more - and not just look at the book study. Go through potential problems, problem sets, etc, and get used to doing them. Do every problem in the book.

However if you want to get into electronics, this is where the divergence occurs (if you want to go to California, you'd have to do EE). As for co-op jobs, I chose the electronics route instead of the more traditional route so I've worked with electronic and computer hardware and embedded software. There's a lot less red tape in the field I chose (especially if you end up working for a startup), and that is the driving reason for why I chose it. I really enjoy the quicker iteration cycles and it allows me to be more creative. In terms of companies that I've worked for, I've worked in finance, old-school EE, start up, and bigger electronics companies in california."

The old Apple II salon (SLC 0106) has been empty for a year, and from what I can tell, few companies are interested in leasing the space because FEDS insists that only certain businesses be allowed to open in that space. That space is probably the same size as Imprint and is easy to get to from any other FEDS office in the SLC.  That being said, I'm surprised that they feel the need for more space, considering that they already have offices in three different areas in the building, and offices for ten FEDS services. That's quite a lot of space for an organization that spends most of its time dilly dallying around the SLC doing shit all and making the student experience none the better. Kicking Imprint out of their office would seem justified if FEDS had any justification for it, but given that Imprint actually provides tangible services to all students at the university whereas FEDS hardly does (and has to obnoxiously spam the SLC to make it appear like they do), this move doesn't make sense."

The move is bold and the silence on their part is insulting.  They are supposed to be working for the benefit of students, and they are liable to either ask for our opinion or explain their actions. All I see is a reduction in quality of a service I‚Äôm supposed to be having, as well as giving these guys a hard time."
uwaterloo,3bvsqd,lunrSabr94,33,Thu Jul 2 15:56:02 2015 UTC,I figured it was obvious that feds works for the benefit of feds
uwaterloo,3bvsqd,honhonhonFRFR,21,Thu Jul 2 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"WPIRG was kicked out because they opposed FEDS on one too many issues. I don't agree with their eviction, but I understand why FEDS didn't want them in the same building: because they don't like to be questioned."
uwaterloo,3bvsqd,hippiechan,16,Thu Jul 2 17:37:21 2015 UTC,"WPIRG wasn't even the first. They spent a decade booting clubs out of the SLC, with WatSFiC being the only one stubborn enough to hold on for so long. It was only about a year and a half after WatSFiC lost its last space that FEDS went for WPIRG. There's been a concerted effort to obliterate any sign of student life from the student life centre for as long as some of our frosh have been alive.  I think if the people behind Imprint actually got together, they could seriously turn this around, though. I know first hand that losing a room in the SLC does not spell the end for your campus presence, and I've never led an organization as influential as the official school paper."

This means that the University has the right to veto this eviction.

Say what you want about the local campus rag, but it's always served as an important community resource for UW and Waterloo as a whole.   I know nothing outside of what this article said, but it doesn't look like there's a firm reason why the Feds are kicking Imprint out.   Edit: I would be remiss not to mention that if it wasn't for Imprint, I wouldn't have gone on to bigger things in the journalism world. I've been lucky enough to write for both national papers, a few other major dailies, and now, a very big US newspaper. If Imprint wasn't around, I'd probably be working a very boring desk job somewhere."

It's in a highly trafficked area and visible to the UW student body, which is Imprint's main audience. Moving off-campus will be tough to manage for several reasons, notwithstanding office set-up costs. Imprint isn't really rolling in the money."

uwaterloo,3bvsqd,bruvark,3,Thu Jul 2 20:07:28 2015 UTC,The money was primarily from student fees and ads. It used to be around $300k per year in revenue.

uwaterloo,3bvsqd,itsdgc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"Industry-wide, classified ads used to support almost 50% of the budget. Now they are next to nothing. Meanwhile the traditional ads continue to amount to roughly the same as before.  (My source is Imprint's budgets over the past 15 years. Unfortunately, I don't have a copy handy to share, but if you paid your fee, you can definitely request copies.)"
uwaterloo,3bvsqd,bruvark,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:37:29 2015 UTC,Imprint was never 50% revenue from classifieds (and I'm talking from more than 15 years ago). Pre 2000 the giant colour full page ads were big money. The tech crash and less recruiting certainly helped kill that.
uwaterloo,3bvsqd,NotQuiteSonic,18,Thu Jul 2 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely tragic. Imprint will not find better space, certainly not for the rate that the paper was playing. Plus, being centrally located was a real asset to the organization. Imprint has always tried to address the fact that it can be intimidating to walk-in for the first time (especially due to the layout), could you image a shy first-year having to find some sort of office off-campus?   This is very clearly a political decision by Feds BoD, which is really sad since the majority of the Feds council should be supportive of the organization. It makes their jobs easier. Instead what we get is certain councilors, like one from Eng (who I will not name), practically attempting to spur Feds into a confrontation.  What is worse is that, unless things have changed fairly significantly lately, I know for a fact that the administration will be of absolutely no help, even to the point where I believe they privately support Feds. A few years ago Bud Walker was openly entertaining the idea of attempting to shutdown the paper administratively (and bizarrely attempted to enter into a discussion with Imprint about it).   The bottom-line is that Feds is a totally pathological organization that no longer even attempts to uphold its mandate of representing (not serving, representing) students. This is unfortunate, what is outright disgraceful is that, at least since I was a frosh, the organization has more or less been in bed with the administration. Whereas a regular student union would have threatened to sue over Fed Hall, Feds ""Didn't want to damage the relationship"". Often it seems like the executive and important BoD members are more interested in landing jobs at SSO (or wherever the hell the end up these days) than actually moving the ball downfield or protecting the rights and traditions of students.   Silencing the paper, and that is what they are doing, that office space was a load-bearing wall in the house that was Imprint, is a huge blow to all UW Students. With a broken Student Union more interested in its own internal politics than the students it represents, and with student societies under-equipped to fight anyone larger than their own faculties (something already at the limit of their mandates), Imprint was the last-best method by the mass of students could have their voices heard."

uwaterloo,3bvsqd,mutantlog,7,Fri Jul 3 13:42:09 2015 UTC,"I figure that since the handoff of the SLC to the Feds in exchange for Federation Hall, all those $25/term fees I paid now apply to the operation of the SLC. And while Fed Hall was run by the Feds, they certainly never kept parcelling off more and more space for their offices instead of for providing the intended services to students.   I'm pretty sure the purpose of the SLC is to provide a variety of services to the students on campus, not to slowly become a giant Feds office space, and that's not what I was paying $25/term towards."
uwaterloo,3bvsqd,valryuu,3,Fri Jul 3 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"This.  If they were actually repurposing the space for more student space, such as more study areas, it wouldn't be that big of a problem.   But from past history, we can see that Feds likely won't do that..."

uwaterloo,3by5y8,geleiademocoto,4,Fri Jul 3 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"I can speak for CS 246 because I'm taking it now.  The big prerequisite to CS 246 is CS 136. Here are some things you need to know from 136:   memory management in C and how to not leak memory (most people are still struggling with this part) basic data structures in C, like linked lists, stacks, queues, (binary search) trees, etc basic testing and debugging with print statements   I'm sure you'll be able to pick these up quickly. You're gonna have to, especially if you want to take those other CS courses. 246 is a foundation course for all the other CS courses, and it's taken the earliest of all the ones you've mentioned. I don't know about ECE 254 as I'm not an engineer.  The material in 246 is basically:   tiny intro to Linux and tools, like grep Basic Bash scripting, eg. write a script that conditionally recompiles your C++ files to object files, if the sources are newer than the object files--poor man's makefile C++ stuff like streams  OOP in C++, including different patterns and stuff final project involves X11   If you feel competent enough to take 488 and 458 then 246 should be a breeze.   Also, 241 is known as a ""baby compilers"" course. You're gonna write simple compilers, and apparently the smart people use Racket (dialect of Scheme).  Good luck."
uwaterloo,3by5y8,Gibstick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:37:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is very useful. Those prerequisites are all things I've seen before, but it won't hurt to take a look at them again in preparation. 246 is sounding a little basic, but then again I don't want to overwhelm myself with a bunch of advanced classes, it's better to have a balance, especially in the first term. If I find that classes are not as hard as I expected, I can go heavier on the winter term."
uwaterloo,3by5y8,PPewt,2,Fri Jul 3 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"241 is good: it isn't particularly hard but it's a good introduction to a subject that many people never see. You shouldn't plan to take both 246 and 488 one term apart, since it's highly unlikely that anyone who would benefit from 246 would be ready to take 488 in the next term. 246 is fairly introductory-level programming-wise whereas 488 assumes you know enough to complete a serious and high-workload project with little to no help. CS350 would be a much better preparation for 488 (just because it also involves a significant workload and assumption of competence and independence) but also requires you to be reasonably strong at programming going in to it.  The general assumption in third year courses is that you have a decent amount of programming experience and are ready to take on larger workloads more independently and with less background (for instance, using new languages that you possibly haven't seen before and won't be taught how to use). Second year courses are more or less introductory CS level. Fourth year courses are the beginnings of actual specialization now that students have enough background to think about looking at real problems.  I suggest refreshing yourself on C as well as at least one higher-level language you'll want to work with (may depend on what certain courses require) and refreshing your algorithms."
uwaterloo,3by5y8,PPewt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe I shouldn't take 246 then. I already know the basics of OOP, I thought taking this course would be good for going deeper into it, but if it sticks to the introductory stuff there's not much point.  However, CS350 is Operating Systems, and I've already got ECE 254 lined up for the same term, which is Operating Systems and Systems Programming. Would that work too as preparation for 488, or would I be better off switching to CS350?    I'll take a refresher on C then. As for the higher level, would Ruby suffice? I'll look into the requirements for the courses, but from what I've seen most mention C or C++, so maybe I should pick up C++ again as well."
uwaterloo,3by5y8,PPewt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"I already know the basics of OOP, I thought taking this course would be good for going deeper into it, but if it sticks to the introductory stuff there's not much point.   It talks about classes and inheritance and some simple design patterns and finishes off by briefly touching on the STL. Very C++-centric and introductory.   As for the higher level, would Ruby suffice?   If you're comfortable writing larger programs in it, it might be fine. Some courses allow you to use whatever language. No clue whether you'll end up taking any of them.   However, CS350 is Operating Systems, and I've already got ECE 254 lined up for the same term, which is Operating Systems and Systems Programming. Would that work too as preparation for 488, or would I be better off switching to CS350?   I'm guessing 254 is considerably easier and less work, which is either a good or bad thing depending on what you want out of it. Can't confirm this for sure since I'm not in ECE and haven't taken it, but it's a second year course and in a less software-specialized program. I'm guessing it's also a bit more hardware-focused since it's ECE, although that's not necessarily a bad thing (OSes and hardware go hand in hand)."

On the other hand, I'm not allowed to fail any courses, so if I bite more than I can chew I could get in big trouble. On the third mutant hand, what's considered ""easy"" at UW is probably not the same as what I'm used to calling ""an easy course"". I think I'll play it safe for my first term at least.

uwaterloo,3bxi6b,derpasaur9000,3,Thu Jul 2 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"C&O is good for programming/networking applications, so it might be a good idea to consider minoring in CS or learning computer science at your own pace in conjunction with C&O.  Applied Math will give you a lot of widely applicable skills, and will let you discuss mathematics in a range of sciences (especially physics), social sciences (economics), and finance.  Mathematical finance will specialize on mathematics relevant to finance, and has some overlap with AMATH, but also overlaps with some tough PMATH courses, such as 450 (Lebesgue Integration & Fourier Analysis).  If you aren't quite sure what you want to do yet, start with applied math and go from there. You'll be able to transfer into either mathematical finance or C&O if you keep your marks up. Both C&O and math finance will require the ability to think at highly abstract levels, so be prepared."
uwaterloo,3bxi6b,hippiechan,3,Fri Jul 3 00:44:05 2015 UTC,"There's not much overlap with AMATH for Math Finance, only two courses (ODEs and Intro to Computational Math). The rest are optional.  Also, if you want to take either C&O or Math Finance; the advanced level courses are recommended (especially for Math Finance since you need Math 247 - Calculus 3 advanced level). Taking these advanced courses while doing AMath will just be a headache that's not worth your time.  PMATH 351, 450 and 451 are the monsters in Math Finance in my opinion. If you can handle those, you should be fine otherwise.  I don't know much about C&O, but I took AMath 231 (Calculus 4) and it was ridiculously easy compared to PMath courses. AMath sort of requires an interest in something other than math as well, like Physics or Biology... something to keep in mind."

She was so frustrated whenever I kept telling her it didn't feel right, and in the end, she just pretty much told me to deal with it. I've had lots of fillings in the past, but I've never had one as obvious and smooth as one of the ones she did.

No one is going to drag you out to all the events, you need to do that for yourself or have a friend help you (maybe 1st year dons).  There are girls some programs do suffer from a lack of girls, others from almost having a majority of them.  It depends on what area on campus you generally hang out in.    Co-op loves to throw your schedule off by 'you have an interview tomorrow' which turns your fun night out into making sure you are ready."

And there will be times where you will want to lay off the partying to focus on school. That is a legitimate reason to stop for a while - that doesn't make the school depressing - its just priorities  Campus societies may be a little bland - but thats just what I have had  There are tonnes of smoking hot girls everywhere - if UW isn't ur taste there are always hot girls near Laurier - or just walk down king and uni and there are always hot girls there  The only tip is that you need to find people who say yes. I wasted my frosh year because everybody I hung out with always said no - Do you want to go to a bar, no - Do you want to get coffee, no - Do you want to go get food, no - But after sophmore year I found people who are always down to try new shit out - whether thats food, coffee, drinking whatever.. They are always down - We just recently started to slow down cause finals are next month - but other than that we were smoking drinking and partying every night - regardless of midterms and assignments deadlines - Also because we  all have decent avgs and good coop jobs lined up so that stress isnt there   tl;dr - UW is just as boring/interesting as you are"

You have to go out and try to meet new people. But depending on what kind of person you are, you might pick up a good friend group immediately, or it will take some time. Co-op doesn't help at all with this, since you'll be on campus every other four months. It's been hard for me because I haven't met lots of people with the same interests as me; like you said, lots of students are focused on studies, as opposed to their genuine interests (But I could be wrong about that, as some students are REALLY into Computer Science and the homework). But then again, I wasn't really active in finding friends until the last couple of terms.   If you're really curious go visit the campus and spend time in the city. Decide for yourself if the girls are hot or not. Maybe you'll find the campus is nicer than you think. Unfortunately it's summer now, so there won't be as many students, but you'll still get a general idea of the student life there."
uwaterloo,3by0gj,Saymanyougottajoint,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:57:42 2015 UTC,My UW experience was really bad.  Many of my classmates were diagnosed with depression. There is also a very high suicide rate - at least in engineering. A lot of it will depend on your program.  I would 100% recommend looking into all of your options. Education should be enjoyable right?  No matter where you go - remember that your health and well being is what is most important. I would explain to my parents that this is a concern and to plan for it ahead of time - so they will be able to support you. If you hate your school - transfer.  Also - campus tour guides always lie about how great everything is. Find people who will tell you the truth.

uwaterloo,3bypfu,honhonhonFRFR,5,Fri Jul 3 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"Subs that aren't the major default ones have no overall effect on this reddit protest. This comment at r/CitiesSkyline put it nicely (other than the third point, which doesn't pertain to us).   Not being a default subreddit means not really impacting the greater Reddit community by going dark. This is a niche subreddit that serves a specific audience that may or not even be aware or care about Reddit issues. Taking this community down hurts these users in the name of something unimportant to them.   This protest is mainly affecting the default subs, since those get the most traffic, and the mods there really do need better tools and better communication with reddit admins, even more so than small subreddits like r/uwaterloo. Although it can benefit smaller sub mods, it ultimately has no effect on those small subs, and therefore, it is better to not make these small communities get involved with the drama that doesn't really concern them.   I'm not saying that you shouldn't stand up for causes. But it's better to be smart about standing up for such causes rather than jumping on the bandwagon because everyone else is doing it, even if it's for a legitimate cause that you care about."

uwaterloo,3bqc0q,Victawr,20,Wed Jul 1 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"Most old buildings contain asbestos unless it has been removed already. It used to be a very common building material. Asbestos is only a problem when it's disturbed: it creates asbestos dust particles that become suspended in the air. There is no point in removing it unless it will be disturbed (eg. construction, renovations, etc) There are laws regarding asbestos to protect your health; if asbestos removal wasn't safe enough for this solution to be acceptable, the entire building would be closed down for your safety. If there was some kind of error that caused asbestos particles to travel throughout the building, the building would probably be evacuated. Even in the worst case, it's not too much to worry about; Asbestos isn't much of a problem unless you've had long term exposure to it (think occupational levels of exposure). You will not die or fall ill from inhaling a few particles. Exposure should, however, be minimized because it is a carcinogen. Asbestos is a naturally occurring material. It naturally occurs in our air and drinking water. Most people have tens of thousands of asbestos particles in their lungs already. It's a fact of life. That's not to say, however, that you would be safe to regularly increase your exposure to it."

Honestly, if you are in CS, just take CS 370. I basically taught myself this course from start to finish - assignments were easy; we had a set of theoretical assignments and a set of computational assignments (MATLAB coding). Some of the content was quite interesting but because it was very disorganized, it was not a very enjoyable experience. You are just taught some computation techniques, i.e. error propagation, LU decomp, FFT, integration and interpolation. Personally, I found the exams to be so much harder than the assignments and the class ended up doing very poorly (a failing average grade to be exact)."

I think a lot of people who have problems with them didn't read the entire contract and then come here to complain when Domus expects them to honour the contract that they signed.
uwaterloo,3bmjl8,Ruleof2,6,Tue Jun 30 13:55:08 2015 UTC,Domus is fine except for their support team. They seem to hire new people very often and they're really uninformed. In my case I was able to contact my building owner for maintenance requests instead of Domus (after they tried for a month and then told me to gtfo).  Ensuite bathrooms are a game changer. You can make tea in your room. Never worry about roommates taking the shower. No foreign hair.
uwaterloo,3bmjl8,shellderp,6,Tue Jun 30 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"I was a sublet there for a term from my friend. To be honest, submitting the sublet form and getting a parking pass was very easy to do through Domus. This is my first experience with Domus and it's been pretty positive.   The apartments themselves are decent. Each room has its own ensuite bathroom, which is good. My roommates weren't very clean so having my own private area was good. Overall, I'd say it's not bad for student housing and being this close to UW. The pricing is kind of high though."
uwaterloo,3bmjl8,ProcrastinatingNow,4,Tue Jun 30 14:54:28 2015 UTC,It's nice to have an ensuite wahsroom that you can keep clean in case you live with messy roommates.  I  really haven't heard good things about Domus' business practices though
uwaterloo,3bmjl8,AstulzerRZD,4,Tue Jun 30 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"My friend lives there. It seems great. It has ensuites which are the main reason people live there, decently quiet building, kept clean, and it's nice how there is a bar type area with bar stools to eat at. Nice granite countertops as well. My friend had no horror stories from them."

Domus said students usually don't go over the 25 dollar cap, and the building use gas for heating.    I'm a little bit worried because I had a bad experience with hydro before.  My roommate and I rented a place that uses electric heating, and we ended up paying $400 (in total) per month during the winter."
uwaterloo,3bmjl8,thowing_this_awayyyy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"I only lived there as a sublet for a term and overall had a positive experience. Obvs the ensuite washrooms are nice and you can usually get a good deal as a sublet - I can't imagine paying the price for a lease though. It is fairly close to campus and is in the middle of Uni and Columbia, meaning you have access to more bus lines than most people. The maintenance and cleaning people that I talk to once in awhile in the elevator or lobby are really polite.   The bad things? There were a few theft cases in my suite, but only because my roommates didn't take the ""lock the front door"" thing seriously until they lost important things. Also, because the floors are not carpeted at all, noise travels very easily and with loud roommates, it can get really bothersome despite having fairly private room set ups. Oh, and the routers are pretty bad. Internet can be pretty horrible if your room is at the very corner (depends on suite layout), but if you're close, it's blazing fast."
uwaterloo,3bj9gq,SafariExpress,28,Mon Jun 29 18:01:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. They're fucking snakes. I've had a parking pass there since October and paid through to August. I got a call in Feburary saying I have to return my parking pass but after explaining to them five times in a row that I have the physical receipt + bank receipt they still tell me to bring it in. I go to their manager and give them an earful and all my proof I need. They eventually let it go but now one of their managers decided to print their own parking pass and use up my spot. Highly debating keying them at the end of the term because fuck them.

uwaterloo,3bj9gq,AstulzerRZD,10,Mon Jun 29 20:45:57 2015 UTC,I got the impression that their management was pretty sketchy judging by the presentation of their representatives at the SLC booths that they have.  They also don't disclose prices openly when advertising on Facebook or their website.
uwaterloo,3bj9gq,AstulzerRZD,12,Mon Jun 29 20:46:57 2015 UTC,I feel like this is the same type of situation that has led so many industries (e.g. auto manufacturing) to unionize. There's GOTTA be some sort of organization that will stand up for undergrads. Maybe we can create something like an ISO standard that landlords can advertise on their websites if they meet the criteria through a series of audits or exit surveys.
uwaterloo,3bj9gq,ContinuumPedantics,11,Mon Jun 29 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"Well... Labour laws are so strong now that unions aren't as important any more. It's illegal for an employer not to provide adequate safety training and equipment, for example.  The same is essentially true for tenant laws. Tenant protection laws are so crazy strong that landlords may pay someone to move out. They can't evict you in the winter. You can cancel court dates for eviction notices a certain number of times without penalty. If your hydro is hooked up to any illegal foreign loads, they must pay your whole hydro bill. You can sue them if they enter your unit without 24hrs notice (unless there's water putting into your unit, or whatever). They can't increase your rent too much at the end of your lease...  The problem isn't protection for tenants; the problem is students who are living on their own for the first time don't know their rights. Without knowing the details, it's likely that OP has full recourse under the law to rectify his problems, at least until his/her lease expires. I think there are even situations whereby one can legally withhold rent, if the lease agreement/laws are violated.  Of course, IANAL, but creating a ""renters union"" will solve nothing, and is unnecessary."
uwaterloo,3bj9gq,blindsight,5,Mon Jun 29 22:13:32 2015 UTC,They can't evict you in the winter.    This is false. Source
uwaterloo,3bj9gq,Whete,3,Mon Jun 29 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, a renters union is probably unnecessary. Maybe it's enough to post an article once in a while in Imprint or IW or Mathnews to summarize renters rights.   Also, I think that in a lot of cases, students will rush into leases because they have a million other priorities (coop interviews, exams, living abroad) and simply finding a place is good enough, regardless of quality or hidden details. Happened to me two or three times."

I have highlighted explanations to your statement below. You may also contact me at 519-208-0208 and ask for Nadim or come by the Bridgeport Office to meet with me and voice your concerns and I'll be more than happy to assist you.  In regards to cable, we gave everyone notice that our contract was ending and set up an On-Site Rogers representative to meet with any tenants who wished to continue their Cable TV service. Rez-One guaranteed payment until the end of the current lease. If you have specific questions regarding the cable, please contact me.  ONLY VACANT ROOMS ARE SHOWN, we value the privacy and comfort of every tenant so we do our best to not show other people's room during their tenancy. Every unit is cleaned and inspected by professional cleaners every time new tenants move in. We do our best to ensure that when placing roommates we make the BEST FIT possible. We have personality sheets on every lease as well as a section for the student to discuss what they prioritize in roommates and living i.e. cleanliness, being quiet etc.  HYDRO IS INCLUDED at both Preston and Bridgeport House, this includes all new tenants moving into the buildings for September and our large number of renewing tenants. Any time there is an internet issue we contact the service provider immediately as we have ON-SITE STAFF SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. We also provide free WiFi throughout the lobby, gym and study space accessible to everyone. I am a student and I've lived with 4 different property management companies and worked alongside 3. I understand how frustrating student housing can get and I am more than happy to help you with whatever you need.

uwaterloo,3bkqqv,applewatch334,2,Tue Jun 30 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"^   Over here in the bay area I always make sure to get as many uwaterloo people into the full bay area intern groups just for this (the one open to non-uwaterloo people)  So many events all the time and great people to meet. Granted, they're all overly into the tech industry here, theres quite a few people I've met just going to these events.   After attending so many UWaterloo events over here, I've discovered UWaterloo students are unfortunately rather boring (save for a few), but I think that might be true for most schools.  Either way, wherever you are, go meet people from other schools and host events for everyone! If you host a party, open it up to whoever wants to come! We used to host bi-weekly parties at Pine st and I met so so so many non Waterloo people because of it and its wonderful.   I'm just rambling really. I just like that outside of Waterloo co-ops we have such a wonderful opportunity to meet people from everywhere!"

Whenever we did our parties here we'd only see like 5-10 people from google/fb each, because they have their own community to begin with (like 80-150 interns depending on the term).   Check out the University of Washington stuff too! I've got some friends that go there that I met out here, and they're absolutely wonderful people. They're always around the city so I hear, shouldn't be hard to find events by/for them!"

uwaterloo,3bkqqv,Victawr,12,Wed Jul 1 00:27:36 2015 UTC,"I never went to any of the Ottawa events in the 8 months that I lived there because I was too scared/shy, and I felt that I wouldn't fit in to people constantly meeting in bars and the such.   I would have loved to see free/reduced admission to some events or museums, especially in Ottawa. I also would have liked some help finding housing, whether that would have been recommendations or resources for co-op students. It's possible that they may exist though, and I just never heard of them."
uwaterloo,3bkqqv,Quock,2,Tue Jun 30 02:08:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. We're actually currently trying to work out partnerships with major attractions in big co-op cities like Toronto and Ottawa. This would enable us to run trips to CN Tower/Ottawa museums for a much cheaper price to students than what they would normally pay for admission. Housing support is also on my radar but that might take some more time.
uwaterloo,3bkqqv,Nakji,4,Tue Jun 30 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for everyone, but as a former co-op student who had several terms in Toronto and now works in the city, I would never have gone to an event at the CN Tower - once the novelty wears off, it's boring and largely a tourist trap (also expensive). I feel like co-op events would have appealed to me a lot more if they were more tightly tied to the community they're being held in instead of just being adventures in alcohol or touristy things like a CN Tower visit. I probably would have been more likely to participate in things like group bicycle rides, organized trips to any of the myriad festivals around town (many of which are even free!), cafehopping, frisbee golf on the island (assuming someone in the group is a skilled enough orienteer to figure out that damn course), hiking trips in the Don Valley, trips to some of non-ROM/AGO museums (shoe museum, Aga Khan, and so on), Shakespeare in the park, etc."

uwaterloo,3bkqqv,DSou7h,2,Tue Jun 30 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"I was a Co-op connection coordinator last term and I think the service is super valuable.  I saw many people come out to things who I don't believe normally would have.  I think it is important to keep it casual.  I found people had the most fun on their own events.  Feds sponsored ones are nice for gaining interest but I think the idea should be to encourage the students to pursue their interests with new people.  As the coordinator there was definitely a vibe of overdoing the professionalism for a student run service.  There were required reports, and even a Waterloo banner which seemed a bit much to me.  I think to build the service it would be good to implement some of the recommendations others have suggested.   Connecting with other universities Co-op students in the area would be a great exposure to new people.  Also if possible, connecting with museums or science world type attractions in the majors cities attempting to get discounts for Waterloo students would be cool."

I once bought a used textbook from the FEDs used bookstore for $10 cheaper than a new copy. So when it comes to co-op, there's less that FEDs can do and even less that I want.  Don't look for reasons to charge students for ""services"" they don't need or use. The last thing everyone needs is a FEDs fee tacked on alongside the already existing co-op fee."

uwaterloo,3blqd7,Attria,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"1) Try Kijiji and Waterloo Off Campus Housing. There are also many facebook groups which you can try to join such as this and this subletting group.   2) The average rent + utilities for a place near UW (within 10 minute bus ride) is going to be around $500-$700 depending on where you choose to live. If you sublet, the price will be cheaper. If you sign a lease, it will most likely be closer to the $600 range. Many leases have utilities included, many do not. Some of the main Waterloo housing places are Domus, KW4Rent, Accomod8u, Sage, Luxe, Rez-One, Off Campus Rez, Atlas, Schembri and Hoffaco.  3) I would recommend you start looking now. Most people already have places for September now actually. You can either sign a one year lease and sublet it out during the summer or sublet for both terms. Finding an 8-month lease is difficult, I know some companies do offer it though."

I've had more logic questions and pseudocode based questions, but I've also had more phone and Skype interviews."

Take them out to lunch often.   The office needs to be really open. Lots of useless shit everywhere. Nerf guns. Drones. Whatever.  Have a constantly stocked fridge full of snacks. Have beer to have.  Then, pay them a shit ton.   Suddenly, you'll have extremely good developers start working on things for the school.

I personally prefer the lackadaisical approach, but if you want a more proactive community, there's definitely larger communities in other universities. People definitely won't treat you different if you're gay though. It's like telling everyone your favourite colour is orange. That's great and all, but we all have other things to care about. We'll treat you the same as everyone else; by minding our own business, and expect you to mind your own too."

I also found the student leaders in some residences to be unequipped (understandably) at handling LGBT issues.   At its best, UW's LGBT scene follows a laissez-faire attitude.   At UW, you will also more likely experience stigma based on your academic program, not sexual orientation.   The one redeeming quality about UW is that since it is so large, you can likely find a group of like-minded people (i.e. friends), but that's difficult too.   If LGBT inclusion is a forefront decision for selecting a university, I would not pick UW."

If you're looking for a place where nobody will care about who you love (even if any one), Waterloo's a great place.

Likely your supervisor had to let the GSO know they wanted to take you on as a student and it slipped they're mind and they forgot to. If there's one thing I've learned about professors it's that they're often forgetful and I'm sure if they're going to be your supervisor they wouldn't mind you double checking with them - especially after 6 weeks. Not to mention you can just let them know you're a little concerned about the visa but even without that they shouldn't mind you contacting them.  TL;DR - Email your supervisor! It's been 6 weeks they'll understand your concern.

uwaterloo,3beumb,SidusKnight,10,Sun Jun 28 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"It's more offensive to tip very low than to not tip at all. No tip may mean that you simply don't understand tipping. A very low tip explicitly says that you either found the service to be poor ('fuck you, you suck at your job'), or that you don't value your server's time ('fuck you, I don't care about you peasants' / 'fuck you, I know I'm supposed to give you money, but I don't care enough to know if I'm giving you an appropriate amount').  Besides complaining to a manager, the best way to indicate your displeasure with the service is to leave a single penny on top of the receipt."

uwaterloo,3beumb,Simon_Magnus,15,Sun Jun 28 16:35:31 2015 UTC,This is not exclusive to Waterloo students. Students are known to tip very poorly in general. I've only poor tipped when the service was legitimately bad. Usually I tip 15% minimum.

No, we do it to show respect to others. If you think you're above the typical 15% tip, then you're just disrespecting the waiters. Honestly, I fucking hate people who don't tip or undertip, and I've never been a waiter.   Story time: there's this asian guy that I only met once at Waterloo, and we went to this expensive restaurant in Toronto with a bunch of people. We all tipped, and this person is like ""I don't tip, I don't even care"". What the fuck. I chose to just tip more to compensate for this douchebaggery."
uwaterloo,3beumb,jvi,9,Sun Jun 28 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"If this is a sign of respect then their employers should pay them more out of respect. It shouldn't be our job to compensate for waiters lack luster salaries, especially when waiters don't do much at all. I'm not gonna pay a guy 15% just because they handed me my drink.   Only time I'd tip is if it's an actual restaurant where they actually have to work and come to your table multiple times. But if it's fast food or something where they jsut give me the food once and that's it then I wouldn't tip."
uwaterloo,3beumb,sh4d3,4,Mon Jun 29 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"Well yes don't tip at McDonalds or anything, but you should tip at any non-fast-food sit-down restaurant. It's kind of how the system was setup though. Would you rather pay 10$ more for all food and not have to tip or have the option of tipping. Some would say the latter is a better system, but either way we're kind of stuck with this now. Not tipping is definitely not the answer though."
uwaterloo,3beumb,jvi,4,Mon Jun 29 00:55:13 2015 UTC,Would you rather pay 10$ more for all food and not have to tip or have the option of tipping.    Completely disproportionate number.
uwaterloo,3beumb,logicaltwist,2,Mon Jun 29 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"I would rather them increase the prices and not require tip. I then know exactly how much I have to pay so I can prepare it before-hand as well as know which places to eat are out of my budget.  If a $5 + tip burger increases to $15, that's fine if I have to pay that much if I eat there, I just won't eat there because it's a stupid change. If it was a $5 + tip burger increased to $5.75, I'd gladly pay that amount and still eat there."
uwaterloo,3beumb,SarcasticSarcophagus,4,Mon Jun 29 05:46:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The employer should be paying them a real wage, move the cost into more efficient practices (and also food price, sorry to break it to you), and the consumer should just not tip. There are both economic and social ramifications to the tipping structure.  However, when you don't tip, you're not sending the owner of Mel's Diner a message. If you buy a Bogart Burger for $12.99 and fail to tip, Mel's Diner earns $12.99 and does not register the loss of income in their earnings. The owner still buys a BMW at the end of the year, and your server makes sub-minimum wage. The only way that structure changes is through regulatory reform.  So unless you want to just admit you're cheap, you should probably tip your server."
uwaterloo,3beumb,Simon_Magnus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:54:43 2015 UTC,"Your friend not tipping resulted in you labelling him as a douchebag, this is exactly the result of herd mentality.

The ten cent tippers actually are just straight up being jerks. A lot of people make a point of indicating that the dime they're putting on the table is specifically for the server.

To clarify, I still tip if I dine in but I'd rather not waste my money if I don't need to."
uwaterloo,3beumb,SarcasticSarcophagus,2,Mon Jun 29 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"The servers at Mel's also sprinkle your pancakes with sugar, verify that the kitchen staff produced the order properly, and pay 2.5% of the gross meal cost to the kitchen.

uwaterloo,3beumb,Simon_Magnus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:33:10 2015 UTC,"On a $4.90 meal it's about 13 cents, so paying $5 and dumping my spare small change should be sufficient?"

uwaterloo,3beumb,Simon_Magnus,0,Mon Jun 29 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly rich either, which is why I try to save as much as I can while still paying a suffice amount. I don't mean to be rude to the servers, but you don't have to make it personal without knowing my situation. It's not about morality but rather what money can I spare while keeping within my budget.  Yes I could very well not eat out ever, but don't you think it's alright to treat yourself once in a while?"
uwaterloo,3beumb,SarcasticSarcophagus,2,Mon Jun 29 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think it's alright to treat yourself. Right now, I am the poorest I've ever been. I scrape and scrabble to survive. I gather together every quarter and dime I can find in order to eat.  Sometimes I go to Frat Burger, because I really like the food there. The server has a bigger income than I do right now. I tip.  ""Treating yourself"" also implies splurging a bit, as I do when I spend $12 at Frat Burger. The Mel's Fav is incredibly cheap. Cheaper than a meal at Burger King. It's not cheaper than eating noodles at home, no, but it is, hands down, the cheapest eat within walking distance of campus.  Don't try to justify not tipping as anything other than being cheap. 20% of 4.99 is one dollar. Are you telling me that when you go out to ""treat"" yourself, your budget is smaller than 5.99?"
uwaterloo,3beumb,Simon_Magnus,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:14:10 2015 UTC,I rarely tip at all.  It's not my responsibility to pay your employees.
uwaterloo,3beumb,fruxzak,8,Mon Jun 29 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know about now, but in the mid 90's the only reason to go to Mel's was that it was the only place open at 3am after the bars had closed and you needed a place to go eat and suffer through your hangover.  Still, fond memories."
uwaterloo,3beumb,wildgurularry,5,Mon Jun 29 23:33:11 2015 UTC,Shows how smart the people are who wait there. I get poor tips so I'll give out shitty service.   I tip really well since I graduated but I'll never go back there because of how awful the service was.

Again, it's not my fault you work as a waiter/waitress instead of having a job where you get paid for WORKING instead of hoping that other poor people will pity you enough to give you extra money that they don't have to.... What a stupid premise.  The problem is that waiters and waitresses don't actually do any work (I was a dishwasher, line cook and restaurant manager... I know they do nothing) ... so they get paid less, with the possibility of getting more if they can convince people to give them more. Someone who works at, say, Subway though.. they work, a lot. And consequently, they get paid.   I don't even want you to ask me how my day is and shit. Just take my order, bring me my food and don't come back unless I flag you over because something is wrong. Waiters are borderline useless and so damn annoying in this country; trying to pamper me and cater to my every need when I'm just trying to eat a goddamn burger. And why?

The bad thing(s):    Read the contract before you sign it, cause there is one guy (drives a volkswagon) who shows you around doesn't tell you everything. The day I went to sign my contract, suddenly I was told about a 20$ subletting fee and 15$ fee per month if I brought in a mini fridge (my place was unfurnished). Hes also the guy who sometimes does routine inspections of the unit, and one time he saw that I had an ethernet cable connected to the router (which was in the living room). He then proceeded to tell me that I'm not allowed to have my ethernet cable connected to the living room, because the living room was ""public space"" and I was ""inhibiting"" access to the living room by having my ethernet cord out. I then explained to him that we share the internet, and my roommates were premades (we knew each other before hand) and they had all given me permission to do so. Then he told me that having an ethernet cable could make my roommates trip, and it would be a liability to the rental company. But in the end he didn't do anything and it was basically someone giving me a random lecture on something that should not have even been an issue.   The good things:   I asked the owner/manager, and ultimately decided to waive those charges. Maintanence response time is very quick... WOCH is small compared to giants like KW4rent or domus Sometimes routine maintanence they will find some issues (like old shower heads, dirty filter) and they will REPLACE it for you without you even asking  EVERYONE, with the exception of that one guy who drives the volkswagon, is very, very nice. Also, in MY contract, I wasn't asked to pay a ridiculous key deposit in the beginning (I think mine was $25)  They e-mail you whenever they need to enter your premise, takes off their shoes before entering (not like kw4rent who just walks into lester 203 like their shoes is clean)    TLDR I had good experiences with the WOCH except for that one guy driving a volkwagon. I hope he gets fired."

uwaterloo,3beux5,youreloser,4,Sun Jun 28 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about learning 45 different languages. Just start with one and get really good at that (preferable a popular one. No one's gunna hire someone who only knows Brainfuck). After that, similar languages will probably take you a weekend to learn once you get the hang of a functional/object-oriented/imperative language. I personally am pretty interested in becoming a network engineer, but there's a pretty steep learning curve, and it's definitely not for everyone. Maybe you should do some webdev job/internship first, and learn some IT on the side (or vice versa) to see which you prefer. The difference in pay is often negligible, and definitely not worth your grief of doing something you don't like.  To answer your question, MOOC's are great and all, but I think making some side project is a lot better. It'll force you to apply your knowledge, and you'll definitely learn a lot more than watching some video for hours on end. Maybe even check out hackerrank or /r/dailyprogrammer for some challenge questions and work your way up. Good luck, but more importantly, have fun."

uwaterloo,3bbvd9,iJustWannaGraduate,2,Sun Jun 28 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"Im currently a CM major with an option in stats. Ive taken a good chunk of stats courses. Data science is pretty roughly defined but I have done all of my coop terms in some sort of data science area and some ML research. The courses Ive enjoyed most are STAT 341, STAT 440, STAT 442 and STAT 444. I plan on taking STAT 441 in the fall. Most of the 4th year courses have a project instead of a final exam. Mine focused on: video object recognition, extracting communities from networks, and reviewing a paper which expanded an existing ML algorithm to a more general use-case. The courses are challenging but extremely enjoyable if you're interested in ML stuff. Like most math courses they are very theoretical, and probably not necessary for a career in data science- but they definitely give you a deeper understanding of material compared to the guy who just blindly plugs algorithms into a data set. If you have any questions feel free to ask!"

uwaterloo,3bbvd9,SidusKnight,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:11:18 2015 UTC,Video object recognition was in STAT 442.. it was pretty off topic from the course but we managed to apply some different dimensionality reduction techniques to do it more effectively. STAT 440 my project was on the network stuff and STAT 444 was the last one. In my experience all of the professors for these courses are very passionate about the material and are happy to see students attempt interesting projects... even if it might not always completely overlap with course material
uwaterloo,3bbvd9,cropodile,0,Mon Jun 29 00:36:08 2015 UTC,As a CS major interested in ML and data science? Which stat courses do you recommend to complement my CS courses outside of the required stat courses for CS (stat230 and stat231)
uwaterloo,3bbvd9,TheLuckyCharm,2,Sun Jun 28 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"If you can get into the courses I listed above I think you'd find any of them interesting except for maybe stat 444. I would recommend that you take a look and see if any of them are being offered by Ali Ghodsi, most of the upper year stat profs are great, but he is phenomenal.   Keep in mind the courses are very proof oriented and wont give as much practical knowledge as some of the free online ML courses but you will understand the math behind the algorithms very well, which I think its very valuable long term."
uwaterloo,3bbvd9,cropodile,2,Mon Jun 29 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"I am a fourth year Stat major, minoring in CS and CO, and I beg of you to not base your opinion on Stat off of Stat 230 and Stat 231. Those two introductory courses, in my opinion, weren't taught properly (I had probably the worst prof for Stat 230). Higher level courses are much more interesting and are more relevant to real-life scenarios.   Here's my take on difficulty/interest of higher level Stat courses that I have taken/currently taking:  Stat 330: Difficulty: 2/5, Interest: 3.5/5   This is an extension of Stat 230. You learn more about the different distributions + a couple more you only briefly talked about in Stat 230 (like chi-squared, gamma, and F).   Stat 331: Difficulty: 3/5, Interest: 3.5/5    This is an extension of Stat 231. You learn more about simple linear regression and multilinear regression. You will review how to calculate confidence intervals, estimators, etc. But, instead of just having one parameter B1, you'll deal with p parameters. I suggest taking this alongside Stat 330 as a lot of the content overlap.   Stat 333: Difficulty: 5/5, Interest: 5/5    My favourite third-year Stat course. It is challenging, but fun. You learn about Markov chains and time series. Professor Drekic is a great prof.   Stat 340: Difficulty: 3.5/5, Interest: 4/5   This is computer simulation of complex systems. I feel like it's also an extension of Stat 230 since there is a great emphasis on knowing the distributions. However, you also learn the algorithms on how to generate random variables. A lot of R. Very enjoyable course thanks to Riley Metzger.    Stat 431: Difficulty: 3.5/5, Interest: 4/5   This is generalized linear models. It's an extension of Stat 331 and has an emphasis on regression models and regression methods. Downside: all examples involve death. :(    Stat 443: Difficulty: 4/5, Interest: 5/5   This is forecasting. It's unlike any of the other Stat courses I've taken though overlaps slightly with all of them. You'll learn how to forecast future values based on different methods like regression, estimating trend/seasonality, etc. Prof Banerjee makes this my favourite Stat course to date.   Every thing builds on top of Stat 230 and 231 - which is super unfortunate since those two courses are what deter students from pursuing a Stat major. I also believe that professors make a huge difference. I've mentioned the professors who have made an impact in my Stat courses. They not only taught the courses well but also made learning enjoyable.  If you take even just a little bit of interest in the material of Stat 230/231 though, I really recommend at least trying out a third-year Stat course. :) Whatever major you pursue, the things you learn in them will be beneficial."
uwaterloo,3bbvd9,mmxox,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"Just based on what I've taken, stat 331 is like 231, confidence intervals, some MLE's but less computaiton more theory,lots of R  330 is like 230, probablities (but mroe complex), computations of MLE's and stuff"

uwaterloo,3bcaym,iCanHelpU2,-1,Sun Jun 28 04:08:00 2015 UTC,"Many Options. The fastest I think is to just host something scrappy on Google Sites, but that will be very bad and unprofessional. On the other hand you can head over to wordpress.com, make a free account, and test pilot a template and make it nice. Wordpress looks very nice, and you can have your own url through wordpress as well (good if you are not very comfortable with websites yet). Dropping some cash on a paid template will make your website super fresh, and all the employers will be chasing you.  These are the 'basic' options. Coding up your own website is a whole different ballgame, and I would not be in the best position to tell you how to do that."

CS 136 doesn't cover data structures in detail, so not every student is going to have a full grasp of a lot of data structures. With that in mind, if you do happen to know way more about data structures then your peers, as an employer, that tells me a lot of things about you:  1) You are interested enough in CS to learn outside of class  2) Given that you learned outside of class, you might have some projects that I can use to verify your skills  3)  If you've teaching yourself, you've shown initiative and the ability to get things done on your own.   Ultimately, I would want the students that differentiate themselves from the pack by going above and beyond. For junior CS students, not all the questions would be Dynamic Programming related, but one might get thrown in there as a way to really see if you know what you're doing. While most would fail because most Junior students don't know DP, the ones that pass would have the highest chance of getting the offer."

There's also some places to get free boxes (google it) Multipurpose things. If you can pack things (say, clothes) into cloth grocery bags, great, once you finish unpacking you have grocery bags. Win win. Don't overpack on stupid shit. Figure out the minimum of things you need to live and bring that. 2 plates, 2 bowls, 2 sets of cutlery (I say 2 because a significant other was possible. If not possible than 1). Wash things as you use them, bam, you suddenly save a shitton of space. A good backpack and/or duffel bag.

uwaterloo,3b54nv,ti-linske,5,Fri Jun 26 03:25:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing you need to understand about the co-op system at pretty much every school: The co-op system is not there for you. It is not built in a way that is designed to be good for you, the individual student. Now, you can greatly benefit from co-op. The job experience, education, professional connections, can all very valuable.  But you should be aware at all times that school administrations have precisely one thing at the forefront of their minds, and that the reputation of the school and the program. Their goal is to funnel as many students as possible, in to as many jobs as possible as rapidly as possible, without genuine concern for your well being.  This is done so the school's placement rate and total employment numbers are as high as possible. Co-op programs are used to attract students and donations. You are cog in a prestige-generation machine.   In order to ensure this is the case, the rules in place are draconian and designed to benefit and protect the school and the employers. They do not want you having the freedom to turn down jobs because if you do so, then companies may avoid making offers to students from your school.   Good luck with your meeting. You will need it."

If you received other offers, you have the choice to take those.     Example: Company gave only one person an offer. This person didnt receive receive any other offers (and didnt ""sign off"").

uwaterloo,3b4uz8,hmtinc,4,Fri Jun 26 00:00:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who took the physics based math 137 and payed attention to what my friends in regular took:  Pros of phys based:   Application focused, with real life examples for most problems. Initial course (137) teaches nearly identical material to the math based one, but you don't do nearly as many proofs on assignments If you want to take any physics courses later in your career here, you will have an easier time following the calculus based material Personally, I found it easier to understand and apply concepts when faced with real problems.   Cons:   Assignments are (in my opinion) more challenging, but they are also shorter.  You won't have many people to bum answers off of for assignments, so you will have to do the work yourself (arguable downside) If you didn't either take physics in high school or enroll in one of the first year courses here, it may be difficult to understand the concepts at first glance   Basically, I found it more interesting and easier to apply myself to than any of the stuff I was seeing my friends doing in the regular math course. In the follow up course, 138, you diverge a lot more from regular math stream at first, with more of a focus on differential equations and parametric functions. That said, it was a beneficial experience for me and if you are interested in physics you should at least try it out, as you can switch effortlessly in the first month or two."

WaterlooWorks is undergoing a performance review by Information Systems & Technology (IST) on campus. Initial findings imply that some tweaking of the Orbis software may be required and that we need to purchase new hardware to improve performance before adding many additional users. Our primary concern is maintaining the credibility and reputation of our co-op program, and we aren‚Äôt willing to risk this by launching before we‚Äôre confident we can support all users. Architecture students will continue to use WaterlooWorks and provide us with valuable insight and experience, but until the performance issues are satisfactorily addressed, no additional groups will use WaterlooWorks. We‚Äôre working on figuring out exactly what the implementation timeline looks like, but our goal remains to implement as much functionality as possible as soon as possible. (...)   Emphasis mine.

uwaterloo,3b45xi,Low-monthly-payments,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:50:43 2015 UTC,Hey! Thanks for the reply. I was starting to think no one was gonna answer.   I'm not looking for research with the LS department. I'm more interested in law firm and court room positions. I'm aware I would have to compete with co-op students but I have to try to get some kind of relevant job. I tried to get into co-op a couple months after I got to he university but they wouldn't let me in because I was past 2A (or something to that effect... I'm a transfer student so there were some technicalities there.)  Any ideas where I can look and what kind of positions I would be applying for?
uwaterloo,3b45xi,Low-monthly-payments,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:38:47 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, it is going to be difficult. There are so many people who want to work/volunteer in firms or courtrooms. Your best bet is to ask individual firms for a volunteer opportunity. Write up a letter that will help persuade them and drop it off with your resume in person.   They will remember you and the professional way you applied. You can try courthouses, but they are somewhat different to apply to.  Maybe the first place you contact will it you on, maybe it will take months. Whatever the case is, make sure to keep applying.   Lastly I would like to say that if you are trying to gain experience for law school, then do not worry so much. Law schools care about your average and your LSAT, other things like ""experience"" have a very small bearing on your acceptance."

uwaterloo,3azdod,lavstar,3,Thu Jun 25 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"By the looks of Via's route through the Rockies, you could just fly to Edmonton and bus/train out to Jasper, then take the train to Vancouver. There isn't much to see for 3 days if you train across Canada, but through the Rockies is beautiful no matter how you travel.  Also if you get the chance, check out the Five Lakes Trail while in Jasper. Drive down Township Rd. 405A out of the town until you reach the end of Medicine lake (the long one, you'll know it when you see it) and pull in on the left where you see the parking area. You could probably hike it and back in a day if you left early, but if you only do part of it it's still worth it."

If you're not in Electrical Engineering, there's a big chance you'll have to repeat a term (2A or below).  In terms of the CE-specific workload for 2B, electricals do ECE 224 eventually as well (3B) and ECE 254 can count as a technical elective for EE students. Furthermore, CE students have the option of taking ECE 209 as an NSE (whether it's an intensive or non-intensive NSE depends on your 'calendar' year). All in all, if you're in EE, this means that if you take ECE 209 as your elective, you'll only be one course 'behind' if you choose to switch back to EE after 2B."

I'm asking because I've been away from school for a long time now and my school skills are a bit rusty. So I'm trying to figure out if I should first enrol in ENG4C, then move onto ENG4U; or just go straight into ENG4U and repeat if I don't get that 85%."
uwaterloo,3azkz0,Attria,2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"You're generally penalized for anything abnormal (summer school, night school, private school, repeats etc) by 1% off your overall average per course. You can contact admissions to see if they'd be able to make an exception in your circumstances, but don't count on it.  If you've been away for five years, you'll need to upgrade your math marks, but there's an official way to go about doing that for UW."

uwaterloo,3avynu,zharguy,4,Wed Jun 24 04:17:12 2015 UTC,Taking the 107 is much faster than the 7B since it travels on a dedicated transitway for a large portion. And the Pearson monorail (from Viscount to the terminals) doesn't show up on Google Maps which is why the 107 doesn't show up on there as the fastest route.

uwaterloo,3as4iz,Candalever,8,Tue Jun 23 20:11:41 2015 UTC,You sort of need to have a deep freezer and a lot of fridge/closet space to make a trip to Costco worthwhile over just going to the stores that are in Waterloo. Stuff goes on sale all the time and is generally cheaper.

uwaterloo,3avxwa,djao,7,Tue Jun 23 22:55:57 2015 UTC,"/u/Skellly is correct about the admissions process. I am a math professor here and that is exactly how we do it.  Here's the thing. You wish to do research in graduate school. OK, fine, I believe you. But if you wish to do research in graduate school, why wouldn't you also want to do research now? Preparation and background shouldn't be the main issue; there are lots of undergraduate research programs designed for people with less background. Money (or lack thereof) is a valid reason to do high-paying work instead of research, but graduate school will not pay you lots of money either. And so on. The point is, if someone applies to graduate school with no research experience, then the implication is that they either don't like research, can't do research, or they have some outside factor preventing them from doing research. This is not the sort of message that you want to convey in your application.  Even one summer of research experience helps a lot. I had exactly that much research experience when I applied, and I got in everywhere I applied."
uwaterloo,3avxwa,Skellly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:33:37 2015 UTC,"It's not that I don't want to do research, I'm just preparing for the worst. And in the worst case I will finish with an 80% average and no research experience. I essentially just wanted to get an idea of if in the worst case I still stand a shot at getting into a good (or decent) school for a Master's program in Pure Math."
uwaterloo,3avxwa,Skellly,3,Wed Jun 24 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Do you meet the school's minimum requirements for graduate studies in that field? If no, you're SOL. If yes, proceed to step two.  Step 2: Convince a professor to let you work for him/her. There are many many ways to do this. Obviously having a good academic CV will give you more opportunities, but there are other ways of getting your foot in the door.   If you're thinking about doing your MMath here, start cultivating relationships with your professors. Answer some of the professor's questions in class, and ask some of your own. Attend office hours, even if it's just for small clarifications. Going to office hours doesn't make you look stupid, it helps convey your enthusiasm for the subject (which you'll need in abundance to survive grad school). If there is a specific professor that you want to work with, put extra time into that course and make sure you understand the material well and get a good grade (90+).  If you have the opportunity to do research before you graduate, take it. Be it a URA during the term, or a full term of research during a coop/summer term. The above advice will also help you get these smaller research opportunities, which could springboard you into your Master's. Professors love to test drive students before they sign them on for grad school."

They described it as the 'double door effect'.  It should come as no surprise students interact less at UWP and MKV (compared to REV and V1) - because there's extra doors between people- and are therefore less likely to engage with each other.

If you are aiming for a dev position in SV for your first work term you better be a rock star as you are competing with senior students with much more projects, more experienced with algorithms and have worked in much more relevant positions.  Most likely you aimed too high, most if not all students start off with Canadian companies for their first work terms. I have friends who worked at FB last term that still are in continuous rounds so think about who you are competing with before you apply."
uwaterloo,3asdel,ti-linske,-4,Tue Jun 23 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"All of them were dev.  I was hoping for a dev position in SV but it wasn't really what I aimed for. I know students from other universities (not in Canada) who are not really that good and they're getting FB,Google internships ... so I thought why not. But I also failed with every Canadian company I applied to, so I don't think that's the only problem I have. After all only 50% of the jobs I applied to were in the US."
uwaterloo,3asdel,mooowolf,3,Tue Jun 23 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"usually for first term first years with no work experience will have a hard time looking for actual dev jobs, especially this term since you're competing with the 4th years."

I think the number of apps that were in the 20-30 range was a bit low. If this is your first co-op, it might be better to aim for a smaller company or a job with less competition. Interview wise, soft skills and communication skills matter as well technical skills; this may be a factor. The number of interviews you got seems to indicate your resume is probably okay.  I hope it goes well for you; good luck!"

uwaterloo,3asdel,zodiac12345,9,Tue Jun 23 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"Regardless of your experience, you are still in first year. Most US jobs are not hiring first years. Apply to more Canadian jobs and I think you will have better luck.   Also, if this is your first time doing interviews, it can be tough. You just have to keep at it. From the sounds of it you should have no issues getting a job in the continuous round."
uwaterloo,3asdel,annihilatron,7,Tue Jun 23 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"5 interviews out of 50 applications sounds decent. 5 interviews -> 0 offers sounds really bad, so my guess would be your problem is with the interviews.  One thing I realized after going through interviews in 1B is that for good companies, and for me at least, what to me felt like an OK interview was actually really a bad interview and what felt like a great interview was actually an OK interview. Like every time when had any doubts about how it went, for eg ""oh I could have written my code this way instead, it would be cleaner"" or ""I didn't really understand what he was asking for at the start but I think I did what he asked for"" I never got an offer."
uwaterloo,3asdel,kirawr,2,Tue Jun 23 09:42:03 2015 UTC,i agree with your stats. If you get 5 interviews you should probably have an offers or a very near-offer.
uwaterloo,3asdel,kineticflow,4,Tue Jun 23 13:43:36 2015 UTC,"Well...if you did everything you could at that point, it may as well be that all the jobs you applied for, the majority of other applicants we're either equally or more qualified than you were. So it may be that you did nothing wrong and that you were merely outperformed by other students. I define wrong as in the sense that you screwed up big time on your resume, or you didn't prepare nearly enough, or you said something inappropriate during an interview etc.  It looks like you have good skills, and the proper mindset. Just keep that drive of accepting feedback and continuous self improvement, not a lot of people have those skills well developed. Everyone else here seems to have good advice on what to fix/look at and I can't really say much else apart from contacting the recruiters/interviewers and asking for feedback on your performance. I'm sure they wouldn't mind passing that information over. You have lots of time and lots more opportunities so just keep plugging away!"

uwaterloo,3asdel,uwatstud,3,Sun Jun 28 06:39:15 2015 UTC,5 interviews isn't bad for a first year and how high you applied. You just fucked up the interviews if you only got ranked for 1.

You have to remember that for the jobs you applied for (dev, states-side) you are competing with some of the best uwaterloo has to offer. That bar is extremely high. I'm sure you'll be setting that bar some day, but these people already have previous internships at SV companies, more side projects and more schooling. As for the interviews you didn't get the offer for, a lot of employers also look for a cultural fit for their company. If you nailed those interviews technically, it wouldn't matter if you came off as a bad fit."
uwaterloo,3asdel,Sneakymist,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's probably your interview skills.  Five interviews isn't too bad, but if you only got one ranked from that then maybe you're not as good of a programmer as you thought."

It's obviously better than a double room, as you do get privacy but at the same time, you do have a friend to talk with just outside your door.   The thing we did was my friend and I flipped a coin to see who would get the inner room first, and then after the first semester, we switched rooms. That way, both people experience both rooms equally."
uwaterloo,3apkcl,ruthles726,6,Mon Jun 22 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"I had one and I liked it. They say that being roommates with someone can ruin your friendship but with an interconnecting room that's not really an issue--the door between you two really helps.  Room choice depends on who goes to bed earlier. The one who does should have the inner room, so that the person in the outer room doesn't disturb the other's sleep (eg. when going out and coming back). This should be the only real factor in deciding who gets what room."
uwaterloo,3apkcl,Gibstick,5,Mon Jun 22 13:50:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, when you get assigned to the rooms, they specify who is assigned to which room! If it says 'b' at the end, its typically the inner room."

Which one of us do you think should get the back room? Since they are assigned, would it matter if we just switched rooms to accomodate our needs?"
uwaterloo,3apkcl,adibou25,5,Mon Jun 22 14:20:29 2015 UTC,I think the only reason they assigne rooms is if some furniture is damaged in room 'b' then the one assigned to room 'b' gets in trouble not the one assigned to 'a'

uwaterloo,3akz5w,Quock,28,Sun Jun 21 07:35:01 2015 UTC,I encourage everyone who has been a victim or knows of a victim to contact the Waterloo non-emergency number so the police can put together a strong case and put these guys away for a long time.
uwaterloo,3akz5w,ytismylife,22,Sun Jun 21 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Well, a fake gun is prosecuted the same as a real gun if used in a crime so these guys are pretty fucked."
uwaterloo,3akz5w,names_are_for_losers,7,Sun Jun 21 20:50:44 2015 UTC,TIL.   Apparently the two guys that stole from me were minors (including the one who was holding the gun) - do you know what would happen to them?
uwaterloo,3akz5w,names_are_for_losers,7,Sun Jun 21 21:08:53 2015 UTC,Well there used to be a minimum 3 years in prison for any crime involving a gun no matter what. And people went to prison for things like forgetting to lock their gun cabinet never mind armed robbery. That minimum was removed recently but I don't see them getting any less than 3 years.

That will play a role in how long they are sentenced for.  Also probably don't expect a court case to happen any time soon.  As someone who was mugged before, I sent a guy to jail for 8 months.  He didn't use a fake weapon but he did threaten to kill me if I went to the police."

uwaterloo,3aovha,robotsmakinglove,3,Mon Jun 22 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"As the quote goes: ""Linux is only free if you don't value your time"".   That's just a completely ignorant thing to say, especially for someone in CS. Linux accurately represents most environments you will develop for.  Maybe it was true 15 years ago when you had to compile everything and struggle with driver support but there are many popular Linux distributions today that just work on a great deal of hardware."
uwaterloo,3aovha,grapeape25,6,Mon Jun 22 12:43:55 2015 UTC,"It isn't my quote (Jamie Zawinski). I've graduated and been out of school for a few years - but have a few thoughts:   Linux is a pretty good environment for servers - but in my experience it isn't great one to run your core computing on. It is difficult to setup - has driver support issues - and has lacklustre default tools (Word, Excel, etc). This has gotten better in the past fifteen years but still is not perfect. A big part of university will be spent in other courses that need good word processors and spread sheets. I think it is a bit a fallacy that Linux represents ""most environments you will develop for"". It probably represents most environments that you will deploy a server to, but I think the popularity of mobile has made it so many are writing apps for iOS and Android is fairly popular. Maybe you'll write a desktop app - in which case you'll probably have very few customers. Also, Windows development and IIS servers still hold some ground (although I think it is safe to say Apache / NGINX dominate the server space).   To be honest I felt similar about Macs vs PC / Linux. I thought they were expensive (they are) and that they couldn't play games (they can't). Linux is great - but in my opinion it is still best left on the server. I'd much rather use a Mac for day to day development.   PS: Your arguments come as very ad hominem (i.e. ""ignoring thing to say, especially for someone in...""). I'd recommend Phil 145 if you are interested in different ways of structuring arguments. One of the best classes I took at UW."
uwaterloo,3aovha,robotsmakinglove,-2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure when the last time you used Linux was but driver issues aren't as bad as they used to be. Especially if you just verify the driver support before you purchase (e.g. Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware). The Ubuntu (or other flavours) installer is just as easy to use as Windows, assuming you don't care about any customizations or fancy partitioning schemes.  Google Docs is more than sufficient for any school work that you would need Office for. Not to mention the reliability, portability, and the ability to collaborate it offers. If you needed to produce more complex documents than it supports then you'd probably want LaTeX, not Word. Furthermore, if one insists on a desktop office application then LibreOffice is a solid competitor.  OS debates are futile but I just don't see the killer feature that Macs offer other than a cool looking laptop and being locked into proprietary software/hardware for some extra money."

Testing can be pretty interesting and is definitely a learning experience if you're at a decent company.  Like AgentSQL said, if you decide to work tech support/customer service, there will be TONS of down-time (depending on the job). If you express interest in taking on some extra projects in your spare time early on, then you'll probably get something to do that's somewhat dev-ish. If you don't get a project, then you'll have shown initiative/willingness to do work which is a plus for future references.

If you take the regular sequence, you won't be forced to use Linux until CS 246 in 2A. But nothing is stopping you from using a Unix-like environment before that, and a Mac is a good choice for that. You'll have no trouble with your Mac, and most of the time you'll just be using ssh to connect to their servers anyway.   I wish I had a Mac; then I wouldn't be so tempted to play all my games ;_;"
uwaterloo,3aklhm,Gibstick,4,Sun Jun 21 03:16:51 2015 UTC,"For your assignments, at least for the initial CS courses, you'll be SSHing into the student Linux environment. The Unix-like environment of OS X will certainly help you learn faster (especially if you like to experiment) - I wish I had chosen to invest in my Macbook earlier in my undergrad career.   If you're coding on your Mac, make sure your program runs in the student Linux environment (I remember being rather frustrated with a C++ program I wrote for CS341 (Algorithms) - it was compiling and running perfectly on my Mac, but failing miserably in the student environment - until I realized that the version of my local compiler was compensating for a mistake I made that the different version on the student environment was not)."
uwaterloo,3aklhm,lordoffire,5,Sun Jun 21 05:08:22 2015 UTC,"I used Windows + Cygwin all the way through my undergrad, my master's, and now my PhD. I had absolutely no problems at any point with any of the software stack necessary for courses. Even if I encountered an issue, it was extremely easy to SSH into the undergrad environment or simply fire up VirtualBox running Ubuntu (you can even do this as a background service and then simply SSH into it from Cygwin).  A Mac will give you similar benefits with even less work as Cygwin needs to be installed / configured, whereas Macs come with a lot of the necessary software you need out of the box, for example SSH / bash / gcc / clang. I had plenty of friends who used Macs succesfully in CS.  The reality of the matter is that you can get any of the three platforms working in a perfectly suitable manner. I know people who used Ubuntu / Arch exclusively as well, and they also did very well in CS."

uwaterloo,3ajkwi,sievernich,2,Sat Jun 20 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"It's more of a thing between students so that people know if the job will be filled up or if they have a chance even though they only got ranked. It's also pretty useful for finding roommates, or people who might be working with you. Inevitably though, there will be trolls who change up the spreadsheet or put down false information."
uwaterloo,3ajkwi,presidents_choice,3,Sat Jun 20 21:55:00 2015 UTC,I don't think everyone would want to publicize their rankings results to their entire program. That's also such a hassle because you would have to include every separate interview that everyone in the program did.  That's a lot of interviews.
uwaterloo,3ajkwi,immaculatedx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm really only talking about people putting down what offers they got (different from ranks), and if they plan on accepting. So really, it would only be however many companies there were to apply to, with maybe a bit more for more than 1 opening. Plus, it would be anonymous (unless you wanted to provide your contact info or whatever). And of course, I wouldn't expect everyone to participate.  But I guess it doesn't really matter. After all, everybody will just find out on Monday. I just think it would be good for people who are going to places like Vancouver or Ottawa, and need to find housing, or don't know anyone. Or if you don't know whether to accept a ""not so good"" offer, versus a rank by a great company."

uwaterloo,3ag198,echolocat10n,9,Fri Jun 19 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"First off, discuss it with them while you have a copy of an unsigned lease.  Ask them how much the deposits are. For a rent deposit, make sure it's clear that it is last months rent and that it is not more than the cost of rent. Get it in writing, which might mean requiring them to revise the lease.  If they're in violation of the landlord tenant act, politely inform them. It's possible if they're unaware. Also inform them that if they refuse to adapt their policy or if they cease contact with you that you will not hesitate to file a complaint with the landlord tenant board (not sure if that's the correct name, can't check on mobile). Do this all politely but professionally. It's always important that you maintain a friendly professional relationship with a potential landlord. Do as much of this in email as possible so that you have a record in the event you need to file a complaint.  If it's a key deposit, remind them that they're not supposed to charge you for the cost of rekeying an apartment (locksmith fees) since that is something that they're expected to do whenever tenants change.  If they own multiple properties I believe it's common practice to cycle keys between them, so they still need to replace keys because they need to keep them. I'm not 100% sure how the board considers key deposit values. I may be wrong.  Regardless, make sure the deposit is refundable. Get it in the lease before you sign. Similarly, maintain professional conduct and notify them that they need to respond or you will contact the board. Follow the same course of action I recommended earlier.  It's always best to not strong-arm potential landlords. You might give them sufficient reason to not rent to you (eg not maintaining professional conduct), and if they do go with it you do not want an enemy. If their policy is legal and just not to your liking, ask politely if it can be waived or negotiated. Threatening a false complaint helps nobody."
uwaterloo,3ag198,BigWiggly1,-7,Fri Jun 19 21:40:13 2015 UTC,The way to deal with key and security deposits is to deduct them from the 2nd month's rent and let the landlord know why your doing so. This enables you to still obtain housing from them but not give them the gift of a 1 year interest free loan.
uwaterloo,3ag198,andechs,3,Fri Jun 19 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"No dude, bad advice. That's illegal and the landlord is allowed to evict you for not paying rent if you do this."

uwaterloo,3aeqff,EternityCode,16,Sun Jun 21 00:27:19 2015 UTC,I never wanted any of these jobs anyway. NONE OF THEM!!!!!
uwaterloo,3aeqff,lifesaviour10101,-10,Sun Jun 21 00:49:13 2015 UTC,Not even GOOG/FB/APPL/?
uwaterloo,3aeqff,OccasionallyWeDie,9,Fri Jun 19 15:16:11 2015 UTC,That's the joke.
uwaterloo,3aeqff,terminus23,13,Fri Jun 19 17:55:52 2015 UTC,For some reason it really annoyed me that you referred to those companies by their stock tickers. Not sure why.
uwaterloo,3aeqff,mr-agdgdgwngo,3,Fri Jun 19 21:42:44 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to work for any of those companies tbh.
uwaterloo,3aeqff,Mlex,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:54:15 2015 UTC,...you got AAPL wrong anyway.
uwaterloo,3aeqff,manymenwishdeathupon,6,Sat Jun 20 14:51:03 2015 UTC,Fucking continuous !
uwaterloo,3aeqff,Whinnie,5,Sun Jun 21 02:05:20 2015 UTC,"I've had my G1 for the last five years and now my time is almost up. My license expires this upcoming Thursday and I spent most of yesterday and today struggling to find a time slot before then to take my road test. I got hella lucky because of cancellations and an internet proxy. Now all I have to do is find an instructor for this weekend who will lend me their car ... Heed this as a warning, people. BOOK THIS SHIT WAY AHEAD OF TIME OR YOU WILL SUFFER LIKE ME. T^T"
uwaterloo,3aeqff,averageUsername123,2,Fri Jun 19 19:42:55 2015 UTC,Doesn't your license expire if you don't finish the G test within 5 years? Unless you meant you're taking your G road test.
uwaterloo,3aeqff,Whinnie,3,Sat Jun 20 03:41:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, this is for my G2 LOL ... I believe that if I pass, my license gets renewed as long as I pay the renewal fee, but if I fail then I'm forced to start over from the beginning. :( pray for me please"
uwaterloo,3aeqff,BetaPanda,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"You have five years to finish the whole process, which includes passing two road tests. It may be too late to cancel your test, but could you follow up on which is true?"
uwaterloo,3aeqff,Cainhelm,3,Sat Jun 20 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"Other poster is correct, as long as you pass the G1 exit test you can pay the renewal fee and get your license for another 5 years, I recently did this."
uwaterloo,3aeqff,sh4d3,5,Sat Jun 20 05:19:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! A lot of my friends will be relieved to hear this.
uwaterloo,3aeqff,thatvulcanfucker,9,Sat Jun 20 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"I am going to get a 6th butthole today, thanks midterms"
uwaterloo,3aeqff,AddictedToPokemon,5,Sat Jun 20 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"You'll have atleast 32 more. You'll reach 3A/B and think everything is getting so much easier, then you'll hit 4A and get 10 new buttholes with all the courses requiring major work on top of your 4th year design project. At least the courses are more interesting but it's too much work!!!!!!!1"
uwaterloo,3aeqff,ilovelightfixture,2,Fri Jun 19 16:24:07 2015 UTC,Word homie
uwaterloo,3aeqff,AddictedToPokemon,3,Sat Jun 20 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"What does it mean if I'm able to rank, but the job says ""Scheduled"""
uwaterloo,3aeqff,benzenene,3,Fri Jun 19 22:34:10 2015 UTC,They just haven't ranked yet
uwaterloo,3aeqff,valryuu,2,Fri Jun 19 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"I guess a follow up is, will the jobs with Applications available be reposted automatically, or is there no chance to apply to them."
