Edit: Imagine a mini series with each episode detailing the pasts of one of the crew members, narrated by the characters? Tough sell to anyone who isn't a hardcore firefly fan but damn, would be cool. How to get all the characters into the show with conflicting schedules?

firefly,3drqry,ThereisnoTruth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:24:12 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thanks for replying. How did you see the crew develop after the first episode?
firefly,3drqry,-149597871km-stralia,3,Sat Jul 18 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"I noticed in your table you summarised 'War Stories' as 'overpowers henchmen', leading me to think you weren't paying all that much attention to the development we get for Mal, Zoe, and Wash in particular."
firefly,3drqry,ThereisnoTruth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:16:27 2015 UTC,"I want to just reiterate that that’s not my summary of the episode, but rather my summary of the resolution of climax or central conflict. I’m not trying to claim that Firefly is nothing but fisticuffs, but rather that fisticuffs always seemed to be the solution. Does that make sense?  In “War Stories,” the kidnapping was resolved by a straightforward frontal assault with six-shooters blazing. I would have preferred it if Niska was brought low by his own scheming or somesuch. In the torture episode of ST:TNG, for example, there is a sequence of the Cardassians and Federation bluffing each other and calling each other’s bluffs, until the Federation outwits the Cardassians, all while the tortured psychologically undermines the torturer."
firefly,3drqry,ThereisnoTruth,3,Sun Jul 19 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"How did you see the crew develop after the first episode?   I think your question indicates that you don't understand what 'character development' is.  'Character development' is not measured by changes in the character, but by how fully the character and their motives, fears, goals, and desires are understood by the audience.  How well rounded a character is, is not measured by how often or to what degree the character surprises the audience.  Instead, a well rounded character is one that is thoroughly understood by the audience.    Despite being cut short in the middle of its first season, most of the characters in Firefly are so familiar to careful viewers that we 'know' them better than we know some of our real-life relatives - and we miss them more.  That is a profound measure of how well developed Firefly's characters are."
firefly,3drqry,ThereisnoTruth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:08 2015 UTC,"You’re absolutely correct. Perhaps I should have phrased it, “how did you see the crew developed after the first episode?” What did you learn about the motives, fears, goals, and desires of Mal, Zoë, Wash, Kaylee, or Jayne?"
firefly,3drqry,LoLShoeShine,10,Sun Jul 19 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"Mal was a 'Paladin' - a strong supporter or defender of a cause.  Except Mal was a 'Paladin' without a cause.  He had lost his faith.  Not only his religion but his faith that good would win out over evil - and in his own ability to keep good people, people he cared about, from dying.  He had an extremely strong set of moral and ethical convictions, which reality constantly forced him to compromise.  This left him in constant turmoil, never at peace, and constantly seeking 'Serenity'.  Mal saw 'The Alliance' as fundamentally evil, but he had no faith in his ability to fight it - so he sought to avoid it.  Mal felt that by staying far away from the central control of 'The Alliance' he would be most free to follow the dictates of his own conscience - yet his need to maintain autonomy meant that he constantly had to make compromises - to keep flying he had to deal with people he detested, and keep telling himself that even though he was helping them and working with them, he was somehow not responsible for the evil they did because he did not directly participate in all of their evil actions.  Mal was forced to narrow his horizons, and settle for just doing the minimum of evil that was necessary to protect his people.  To be as little evil as he could be had become Mal's remaining solace.  He surrounded himself with good people, because fighting for good people is easier than fighting for good principles.  His people, his crew, his 'family' were all he had left to fight for.  Right from the start Mal was faced with a terrible decision.  Defending his crew was all he had left - but to keep them safe he was faced with having to do great evil.  Mal was a philogynist, a defender of the weak, and had strong moral convictions about right and wrong - but right from the start Mal's primary duty, to protect his crew, was in direct conflict with everything Mal believed made himself a good person.  To keep his crew safe Mal had to turn over to 'The Alliance' two fugitives, one of them a young innocent and defenseless girl.  This proved too much for Mal.  He just could not live with himself if he did that.  He considered abandoning the fugitives - recognizing that it was beyond his power to protect them, and that in trying, he was putting his crew at great risk.  But when he looked at River sleeping in the sick-bay Mal just could not abandon her, even though it meant putting his beloved Kaylee at risk.  Putting aside Jayne's concerns, Mal convinced himself that the risk was acceptable, that he could both protect these dangerous fugitives and his crew as well.  And so, in this case, Mal compromised his new prime directive of protecting his crew.    Mal's only doubt was his ability to trust Simon - so he tested him.  Mal had already told Simon he would be killed if Kaylee died, and so to test him, Mal went to Simon and told him Kaylee was dead.  Simon did not attack Mal, he did not cower in fear, his only concern when told his patient had died was to rush to the patient and see if he could possibly still save her.  Simon had passed the test.  Mal then went to his crew, and joked at Simon's expense to both humanize Simon, and to make him more palatable to the rest of the crew.  Mal was a capable and intelligent leader, and he knew how to make his decisions acceptable to his crew.  Adopting additional people into the 'family' was a major change in all their worlds.  Serenity was not just a horse, Serenity was their home, and the only way to keep these fugitives safe was to take them into Mal's home.  Mal knew full well that Jayne did not want Simon there, and would deeply resent his presence - primarily because Kaylee favored Simon over Jayne.  Jayne wanted very much to be with Kaylee.  Jayne was content to wait for time and isolation to naturally bring Kaylee's attention to himself - but with Simon there, Jayne's plans were dashed.  Mal was fully aware of this conflict and acted to keep harmony in the crew.  Mal allowed Jayne to think that Mal had a plan to profit from taking in the dangerous fugitives, and at the same time Mal told Simon to keep his hands off Kaylee.  In this way Mal hoped to prevent violence between Jayne and Simon, and also keep Kaylee from becoming attached to Simon and leaving Serenity when and if Simon left.  I could go on - writing books about how deep and complex the relationships between the characters in Firefly were.  I have only just scratched the surface of one character so far - but I think by now you should have begun to realize how much of the content of Firefly you missed - and how much more than an action show Firefly was."
firefly,3drqry,girlunderh2o,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:57:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the exegesis.  My reaction kept changing as I read it. I’ll spare you an itemized response, but most of my thoughts fall into one of two categories.   Most of this we learn or can guess after the pilot. For example, Mal’s crisis of faith we learn episode 1, act 1, scene 1. I don’t recall learning anything more about Mal’s crisis of faith after “Serenity.” (It would have been interesting to this stance evolve – to see Mal regain some of his former Christian faith via Shephard Book, perhaps even as Book lost his own, or to adopt the Buddhist faith via Inara, or to do both and bring them into conflict.) Additionally, after Mal’s conversation with Simon at the conclusion of “Serenity,” I thought it was clear that Mal would never betray the Tams to the Alliance. I would have been genuinely surprised if he had done so later in the series; that would have revealed a new dimension. Some I don’t think is true. For example, you say that Mal “surrounded himself with good people, because fighting for good people is easier than fighting for good principles,” but Jayne is a self-interested, treacherous, cold-blooded murderer. You say that Simon’s only concern was for his “patient,” but I think there was also a healthy dose of concern for the girl who looked at him longingly."
firefly,3drqry,girlunderh2o,2,Sun Jul 19 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"Just as you seem to have pigeon holed Firefly as an action series, so too you have pigeon holed the character of Jayne - and in both cases you seem to have ignored every bit of content that would contradict your hastily conceived first impressions.  It is like you tuned out vast amounts of the content of Firefly.  Whenever something was not what you expected, you just ignored it and waited, looking for the patterns you expected to see - and so you missed what was there.  Jayne is not a thug, not treacherous, not cold-blooded, not merely self-interested, and he does not kill without reason.  Jayne is an extremely intelligent, philosophical man, who spends considerable time thinking about and discussing issues of morality and how a man should live his life.  Jayne grew up poor uneducated and having to compete for everything he got.  Life was not cheap, but it was ephemeral, and only those with courage, skill, and aggression survived and succeeded.  Jayne was very loyal to his family.  And to any others he felt attached to - in particular on Firefly that meant, Mal, Kaylee, and Book.  Jayne's outlook on life was that of a warrior.  The closest analogies we have in modern life would be a gang member, or a prisoner in a U.S. prison.  Men were expected to stand up for themselves, and not back down - and any man who stands against you is an enemy to be dealt with immediately, ruthlessly, and violently.  When someone opposes you it is folly to back down, to show weakness, or to hesitate to strike first and strike hard.  Getting information from a prisoner is not a job a capable leader would give to a brute.  Nor was it a job that Mal had neither the skill nor the time to do himself.  Mal gave Jayne the job because he trusted Jayne's intelligence, his self control, and Jayne was in a better position to pretend 'common-cause' with the prisoner, and thereby get him to talk.  But at the same time, Mal was listening in, he was judging not only Dobson but Jayne as well.  Later when Mal was debriefing Jayne in regard to the prisoner interrogation, Mal was not just talking idly, that was not an empty scene without conflict - that was an important scene where we could see the development of both Mal and Jayne.  Mal knew Jayne well, he knew full well why Jayne had not turned on him.  He was pushing Jayne to admit it - to admit his loyalty.  Jayne on the other hand was reluctant to speak so frankly about his feelings, and he was instinctually reluctant to ever 'back down'.  Hence the lines which led up to ""That'll be an interesting day.""  Jayne had no intention of turning on Mal, but he was not about to admit the weakness of a reluctance to stand up to and fight Mal - that would have gone against his 'warrior code'.  If you could not follow Jayne's skill in getting information from Dobson, at least you should have noticed he managed to get the information quickly, and without burning any bridges with The Alliance, in case Mal decided to turn in the fugitives for a reward.  Results should be at least some measure of Jayne's intelligence and skill.  As for 'self-interested', Jayne was sending significant amounts of money home for the family he had not seen in a long time.  Don't tell me this is a man incapable of loyalty or self-sacrifice.  Time and again Jayne did what Mal ordered despite the risk, despite the fact that Jayne could have switched sides, or walked away.  Despite his reluctance to admit it verbally, Jayne proved his loyalty to Mal over and over.  'Treacherous'?  In 'Out Of Gas' Jayne only turned on those guys because they had been cheating him of his fair share of the loot.  To have failed to deal without someone who cheats you would have been against Jayne's code.  In 'Jaynestown', Jayne threw Stitch Hessian because he expected Hessian to do the same to him.  Jayne felt no loyalty to Hessian, because he felt Hessian was not loyal to him - despite their time together, the two of them had never gotten along.  Jayne was not happy to hear he had been mistaken and Hessian had no intention of throwing Jayne from the air-craft.  None the less, however wrong Jayne may have been, Hessian now stood against him and was now a lethal threat and one to be dealt with by what ever means necessary.  Apology would never have occurred to Jayne - it had no place in his 'warrior's world'.  Even so, Jayne was touched by the sacrifice of the man who shielded Jayne with his own body.  Jayne was disturbed by that because he felt unworthy of that sacrifice, and it was not something he, as a warrior, would have been inclined to do for another he had only just met.  This made Jayne question his own morality and sense of right.  Despite the ruthlessness dictated by Jayne's 'warrior code' he was not cold-blooded.  He did not kill for fun, or without reason.  Jayne killed for profit, for survival, and to serve those he was loyal to ('when he was being paid').  As for turning on Simon and River.  Jayne never accepted them as 'family'.  Jayne saw them as dangerous, and more Jayne saw Simon as competition for Kaylee's affection.  Small wonder then that Jayne felt no loyalty to Simon and River.  Jayne was not merely acting for profit.  Jayne saw himself as getting rid of a problem for the family, one which Mal was unwilling or reluctant to deal with, Jayne never felt he was being disloyal to Mal or Kaylee and would never have put them in danger for money.  If looked at solely as an action series, if you ignore all the rest of the content, then Firefly becomes a rather slow paced action series - of relatively little interest.  What can I say except, it seems clear that in watching Firefly, you saw only what you expected to see - and you ignored the rest."
firefly,3drqry,girlunderh2o,2,Mon Jul 20 03:09:03 2015 UTC,"Dude....    That was so damn perfect... both the Mal and Jayne write ups...    I've seen everything like 6 times through and I still hadn't picked up all of that yet. Thank you for writing this up, it looks like it took a long time but it was extremely insightful, even reading it as a long-time fan. If you have the time and motivation to write a version of these for any more characters, I would love to read them, and I'm sure others would to."
firefly,3drqry,packerken,4,Mon Jul 20 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"I think one thing you're forgetting is that this is a TV show that was canceled astonishingly quickly. There are so few episodes that's it's barely a single season and the movie basically attempted to wrap up a few loose ends they'd had far too little time to develop. Think about watching the first half of the first season of any other show. You get some backstory of characters, how they know each other and their current relationships, and you begin to develop what will be plots dealt with later in the series. So if you want conclusions and massive development, no, you won't find it because they didn't plan for their story telling to be cut so short.   (Contrast it, for example, with another canceled Whedon show, Dollhouse. Two seasons, knew they'd be canceled at the end of the second, so the second season hits plot development, character development, and working towards a conclusion hard and heavy. It moves FAST.)"
firefly,3drqry,packerken,2,Sun Jul 19 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, that’s true. I’d love to have seen more of Preacher Book and River, for example. Their backstories clearly got short shrift. And I hope the other characters, especially Mal, would have had some surprises in store for us.  I think that’s partly why I enjoyed Serenity more. They knew it was their chance to wrap up Firefly – especially with regards to River’s story – and it largely worked.  I do think it’s a shame Firefly was cancelled, because I think later seasons would have improved. At the end of the day, though, I have to take it for what it is, not for what it could have been.  Thank you for your thoughts."
firefly,3drqry,Andyrhyw,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always wanted to know so much more about the shepherd. Still, I did love the characters for what they were in the time they were given. It's sort of like having a passing meeting with someone--they're in and out of your life and you just get to know them for what they are right then. In neither case do you insist on seeing tons of development.   I am curious, though, what you require to consider something science fiction. I understand how you see tons of action and Western coming from Firefly but when you complain that there's more action and Western than science, it seems a bit, to me, like saying Dune is more about philosophy and desert ecology than science fiction and Battlestar Galactica is more like Top Gun than science fiction. I've always seen the science fiction part of things as kind of a background to build the rest of the story around. You modify one or two main things about science (in the case of Firefly you've got the Alliance stuff plus space travel) and you're into the realm of science fiction the same way having magic in a book starts classifying it as fantasy."
firefly,3drqry,Andyrhyw,2,Sun Jul 19 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"I guess for me, science fiction is fiction motivated by a novel idea, that nevertheless takes place within our universe. That can be a future invention, such as how teleportation, time-travel, or AI would shape the world, or an alien civilization or entity, such as how a culture with three genders or non-symbolic language would collide with our own, or how a person who subsists on devouring others’ memories would act.  Let’s take Firefly. You say it has (1) Alliance stuff and (2) space travel. But in what way does the Alliance in Firefly differ from the frontier lawmen and the towns they protect? In what way does travel between planets in the ’Verse differ from travel between settlements?"
firefly,3drqry,Andyrhyw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"Differences do stand out to me. (1) although the Alliance does a lot of enforcement, they are also involved in some hinky human modification or attempts thereof: River (as hinted at in the show and clearly demonstrated in Serenity) and the reavers (as fleshed out in the movie). (2) I'd put traveling between planets on a completely different scale as traveling between settlements. For interplanetary travel as seen here, you're talking small, independently owned space craft which are enabling almost anyone to move throughout the known universe.   I guess the difference is that I see either of those as being substantive enough to feel Firefly is science fiction. They are not main plot points in and of themselves often, but they influence almost all of them consequently moving it into the genre."
firefly,3drqry,Andyrhyw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"Regarding River’s experimentation, absolutely. That’s why in my original post I say   The only science fiction, AFAICT, was the plot around River’s powers and the Academy, which was barely developed in Firefly. (Serenity did better on this score.)   The origin of the Reavers is also very much sci-fi, no question, but it’s not told in Firefly.  Regarding interplanetary travel: all the planets in the ’Verse may as well be terrestrial settlements. Sometimes, interplanetary travel is important because different planets are inhabited by different aliens. There are no aliens in the ’Verse. Sometimes, interplanetary travel is important because it takes years or centuries to travel between them. The planets in the ’Verse are as close as settlements in the West. The fact that there is interplanetary travel in Firefly isn’t used. We’d never know when they fly from one planet to another except that they tell us they do. Distinct planets add flavor, but not substance. Does that make sense?"
firefly,3drqry,askheidi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:22:52 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a view I can understand, but I've always considered Firefly a western in space and not really ""sci fi""  For me it's more about the characters and the way they were portrayed. Then to know that 10+ years after the fact, a show that managed 14 episodes managed to forge friendships that are still strong between a lot of the cast. And a lot of fans that still rewatch the show on a regular basis."

Not that it matters much, as both views are perfectly legitimate.  I do absolutely agree that it’s about the characters and their relationships.

firefly,3drqry,schad501,5,Sat Jul 18 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"A few reasons:   It’s on my mind, since I just spent twelve hours immersed in the ’Verse in the past week, and wanted to record my thoughts. Others might have interesting feedback. I don’t know what this might be, but there’s a whole community of Browncoats out there that have thought about this all much more than I have. Maybe I’ll get an interesting recommendation or something like that. To moderate confirmation bias among fans. (“It seems like everyone loves this show. A reboot would be money in the bank.” “No, not everyone.”) To suggest that when evangelizing Firefly, it might be best to think about how to classify it. To point out some of my favorite parts, and explain why I liked them.   However, your question is exactly why I said upfront that   [b]efore you read the rest of this post, you might want to stop and think whether you want to hear somebody criticizing something you love.

It seemed like everybody’s just crashing into each other. There are long stoppages of play, and people get hurt.” Because I might get an interesting reply. “Actually, a lot of the game happens off the field. These plays are fast, but they’re well rehearsed, and a lot of thought goes into which play should be made when. The long stoppages are useful for planning the next move, and although people get hurt the players all love the game. Maybe you’d prefer rugby. It’s a bit like football but with less stoppage.” And I’d think, “Huh. Well, that’s something to chew on.”"

I expect 90% or more of the denizens of /r/firefly would be best served by ignoring this post.   Also why judge people who watch sports, bit harsh   It was. I did it – and still do it to some extent – because I had thought of professional sports as vapid and tribal. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with judging people based on their taste.

Some people have different values on which they place their political beliefs.  Funny thing is that as much as the left calls the right crazy, the right is calling the left just as crazy and it's just a big clusterfuck that leads nowhere"
firefly,3dmh0k,aggiefanatic95,15,Fri Jul 17 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"I really strenuously disagree (as someone who still secretly wants to propose under the century tree). God help me, now I'm craving those big cups of cheap beer and happiness from the Dixie chicken.   Point being, reddit is not left or center-left or anything of the sort. Reddit is ""brogressive"". You can google it and find more explanation, but it's basically selfishness. I want to smoke weed, so it should be legal. I want to use slurs, so it should be acceptable. I want to pay les for college, so it should cost less. Have you read a thread from r news or r world news or r videos or r advice animals or basically any default? It is straight up clogged with racist, sexist, xenophobic, bigoted, closed minded shit. The stuff is running rampant. I simply cannot agree that opinions right of center are vilified or anything along those lines. That's not the reddit that I see.   But your second point is what is what really disturbs me and works me up. Like, if I wasn't on mobile then this would easily be 5x the length. It bothers me because I've seen it over and over again. ""Both sides do it; both sides disagree and name call; it is now a clusterfuck and waste of time and who can know who is right""  Lord help me, you've stumbled on one of the rare triggers that I'm pretty sure makes my blood pressure spike.   It's like if I stole from you, and you accused me of it. In response I shouted back that you stole from me! Then some passerby comes along and is like ""they're both accusing each other, so both accusations are equally valid"". And I got away with theft whilst tarnishing the entire disagreement resolution process.  Adam Baldwin's Twitter is full of ridiculous hardcore right-wing shit. I don't mean that he's really in favor of a novel use of the Laffer curve; I mean it's full of ridiculous shit with an obvious hardcore right-wing bent. That's just reality.   Someone can manufacture all of the anti-abortion anti- marriage equality anti- Supreme Court justice appointments anti-SNAP and anti- whatever the fuck they want. None of that changes the fact that his Twitter is full of ridiculous uber right-wing shit.   Like, that is a shitty set of beliefs. Set up all the smoke screens that one cares to do, try to change the issue all day long, scream j'accuse until the cows come home, but at the end of the day some beliefs and ideas are just shitty. His political beliefs are ignorant and shitty and writing off acknowledging that because people often disagree is entirely counter productive (in my view).   It's like the Fox News ""fair and balanced"" analysis. Oh, some people say X and some people say Y. It's up to you to decide.   No, it fucking isn't always like that. Some ideas are just fucking shit ideas. You do a disservice when you present shit ideas with legitimacy under the guise of letting people reach their own conclusions. Like, fucking climate change is a real thing. The reality has exactly shit bearing on whether you or I choose to acknowledge it or ""believe"" in it. Presenting it as if it's still being debated is wrong. You wouldn't be like ""oh, is 2 plus 2 5 now? Experts debate; we inform and you decide!""  Like, no, it's fucking been decided already that the correct answer is 4.   What really gets me isn't any particular issue being shit on by the likes of them. What really gets me is the culture of complacency or apathy that it breeds. It makes it seem like all ideas have equal validity and it's all a matter of opinion. Like, excuse the fuck out of me but some ideas are shit and some are better. Reducing everything to ""that's just, like, your opinion, man"" is such a terrible and destructive way to approach issues. It's straight up damaging because it makes people believe that it's all a clusterfuck leading nowhere, so why get involved in something that's ultimately meaningless?  But it's not like that! The decisions affect people's lives in real meaningful ways all of the time. And acting like all outcomes are just a matter of opinion is such a fucking distressing and destructive and widespread perspective.    Which leads me back to: his Twitter is full of shitty hardcore right wing shit. It just is and nothing will change that.   And, yes, the 5x length thing really was not an exaggeration. I would go on a lot more if I had a real keyboard rather than my phone. I also realize that for brevity I sometimes used overly broad statements, but I think it's clear what I meant."
firefly,3dmh0k,NewMerril,7,Fri Jul 17 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your reply fellow aggie! Just to start off I wasn't condoning anything Alec has been tweeting, I only consider myself slightly right of center and some of the things he says are extreme.  And agree with you that reddit is ""brogressive"" (I think it describes it perfectly).  When I said, ""I love reddit, but anyone who has beliefs right of center on here is considered a ""loon""."" I was more talking about people who are considered strongly left leaning, people I see often on reddit.   More of my point was that each extreme attack the other extreme in the same way.  I have quite a few friends who you would consider very right wing people.  And I know and have seen many people who are considered very left wing.  Seeing both extremes makes me see how full of themselves and narrow minded both sides are.  They both insult the same kind of things at each other.  The left attacks Fox News for being biased and wrong, the right attacks CNBC for being the exact same thing.  The left portrays the right as being all bigots and ignorant, the right portrays the left as being all communist, feminazis, and ignorant.  See more of my point?  I understand that you think that Alec just has ""shit ideas"".  But this opens a can of worms that is morality.  To you Alec has ""shit ideas"" because of what you believe is right and wrong, and you have full right to call him out and most everyone might agree with you.  But at the end of the day in a non-theistic society, society dictates what is right and wrong.  And it's up for people to question why a certain thing is considered right and wrong (see women's rights, opinions on gays, etc.).  And it's up to people to question these changes if they are indeed right and wrong.  Just as we need hardcore progressives questioning how things have been done in the past, we need some people arguing why they are there and why they were established in the first place.  With both sides attacking the flaws of the other we can end up with a better society and progress to a better place.  Thanks and Gig 'em"

firefly,3dpsqe,karmak1lls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:09:40 2015 UTC,"I loved Heroes, particularly the first two seasons. 3 was still good, but 4 wasn't my favorite. However, I think this has potential. Especially because it has some of the original cast, and Micah as a teenager (!!!!!!!!!) and Dylan Bruce from Orphan Black is going to be in it. I'm going to watch it. Hopefully it doesn't totally suck. The preview really doesn't look all that bad!"
firefly,3dpsqe,rachiedoubt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:50:33 2015 UTC,"Right there with ya. First 2 were really good. Then the story got muddy and random people started showing up and disappearing.   Idk how I feel about it coming back. To me as heroes stands with 4 seasons, it represents every fanboys nightmare."

firefly,3dmh5b,16bitgamer,17,Fri Jul 17 14:14:09 2015 UTC,And yet shows like CSI get to have a bajillion seasons and spin-offs. Does that seem right to you?
firefly,3dmh5b,nubsauce87,11,Fri Jul 17 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"Jubal has some mental health issues, going all the way back to his childhood."
firefly,3dmh5b,Mutt999,9,Fri Jul 17 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"I love this interaction because it’s one of those awesome ways Joss humanizes his characters.  In real life people mishear or misinterpret and there’s that awkward exchange of figuring out why you’re on different pages.  This is just a funny little example of that, especially when Jubal has mental health issues and keeps on posturing and grandstanding about random thoughts and semi-philosophical questions."
firefly,3dmh5b,cakebatter,4,Fri Jul 17 14:16:21 2015 UTC,Exactly this.  Just your average awkward misunderstanding.  Giving you a peek into how normal these people are.  Reminds me of something from a Tarantino or Coen brothers film.
firefly,3dmh5b,Cyfun06,4,Fri Jul 17 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what everyone has said, it's just Jubal mishearing Simon and each of them confusing the other for a moment. Happens all the time in real life and almost never on film, so Joss added it here as one of the little things to make the 'Verse seem more realistic. Like having parts of the ship just break down due to age/wear and tear, it's something that just happens but usually never shown on film unless there's some deeper meaning behind it. In this case it's just a simple misunderstanding"
firefly,3dmh5b,VegetaLF7,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:52 2015 UTC,I've always wondered why more action heroes and villains don't express difficulty hearing.     Discharging firearms indoors repeatedly over the course of your career has got to have a cumulative impact on the acuity of your hearing.

Wear Scruffy Boots(2nd option in Boots).  For the Shepard, you can wear the Gray Stealth Jacket with Black Suit Pants. Black Work Boots will work.  Simon needs a vest and suit pants.  You can replicate Jayne by wearing any T-shirt and Team Pants.  For Wash, you can just equip any Hawaiian based shirt and pants.  Inara can't be built in-game since she wears dresses only. The dresses in GTA Online are too big.  Mal should wear the new Peacoats(Overcoats) with a brown business shirt and beige chinos. Any Boots will work.  River can wear the knee high boots with an off shoulder top. Black or grey shorts will work.  Zoe is too difficult to replicate. Sorry.   Feel free to check out /r/GTAVFashion and /r/GTAOutfits."

firefly,3degl4,sarautu,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Out of Gas is the one that really made Firefly legendary in my eyes. It proved to me it could do the comedy but Out of Gas showed something a lot more heartfelt, and I loved it. But I always think of episode 2 as my second favourite episode."
firefly,3degl4,BloodChicken,2,Thu Jul 16 05:39:36 2015 UTC,"Not to take away from the message of your post, but I read that message in Nathan Fillion's voice... Even the last bit."
firefly,3degl4,Nollog,8,Thu Jul 16 06:12:59 2015 UTC,She's obviously a sociopath. She has no emotional connection to humanity or you. So definitely a keeper. Think of the adventure!
firefly,3degl4,boochix,3,Thu Jul 16 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. This is the kind of person I like!"
firefly,3degl4,sdp0et,7,Wed Jul 15 21:42:54 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is the type of thing that gets people kicked into a running turbine.  Just saying.
firefly,3degl4,NJNeal17,6,Wed Jul 15 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"There's a line from HIMYM about how much Ted likes Star Wars, and his new GF doesn't. Always think of it cause it's how I feel about Firefly.   Marshall: ""Look, Stella, that is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He... he watches it on Christmas Eve! Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and bad. Do you really think you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?""  Stella Zinman: [pauses] ""Yeah.""  Marshall: ""Well, then Ted's a lucky guy."""
firefly,3degl4,chucktheupchuck,5,Wed Jul 15 19:46:52 2015 UTC,reads title reads subreddit name    This will end well.
firefly,3degl4,Stay-Frosty,6,Wed Jul 15 20:19:52 2015 UTC,It took my girlfriend until Our Mrs. Reynolds for her to fall in love with the show.
firefly,3degl4,subtle_nirvana92,2,Wed Jul 15 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"I've found that, if not by the first episode, the second usually seals the deal. But eh, everyone's different."
firefly,3degl4,existie,5,Wed Jul 15 22:17:56 2015 UTC,Time to find another one...
firefly,3degl4,Theopholus,5,Wed Jul 15 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"It took 5 years of begging to get my husband to watch it, I finally forced him (I pulled the ""it's my birthday wish"") and once we got through episode 4 he was hooked. Now he asks me if we can watch firefly when we're looking for something to watch. He also begged me to make him a jane hat. Don't give up hope!"
firefly,3degl4,Theopholus,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Well, hope is all I have..."
firefly,3degl4,socialpronk,4,Wed Jul 15 21:09:24 2015 UTC,Big deal. My husband doesn't like it either. My love for him is not dependent on his love for a show.
firefly,3degl4,meridianarc,4,Wed Jul 15 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"I will tell you honestly, I am a raging Firefly fan. I've turned countless people on to the show. Love love LOVE Firefly.   That being said...I didn't like it until the 4th episode. There's something about seeing Mal fight for Inara's honor that makes him more of a real character than the first few episodes where he's the smart-mouthed captain and not much else.   Maybe see if you can get her to watch a few more episodes. If she's still resistant to Nathan Fillion's charms...well, I'm sure you had a good run and there's another girl out there for you.   (Kidding, don't break up with your girlfriend over a tv show.)"
firefly,3degl4,meridianarc,5,Wed Jul 15 22:30:06 2015 UTC,"I do hope you're kidding. If not, it helps to think of it from the converse side of things.  Does she mock your love of the show? Does your entire life and world revolve around this TV show? In 40 years, when you're old and grey, is this going to be the defining thing you reflect back on in your life as being pivotal to who you are as an individual? If so, then sure.   On the other hand, if you're someone who defines who they are based on things other than a single pop-culture phenomenon, then I'd say forget about it and don't worry about the superficial things like what movies/tv shows/music you enjoy."
firefly,3degl4,burrbit8b,2,Thu Jul 16 04:38:33 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to make Firefly the main thing that my life revolves around. Because, y'know, it only had one season.  She doesn't mock my love for the show, just shows her disinterest. Says she's mainly into crime shows... I had to try to get her into it as she is getting me into the stuff she likes. But I can forgive her reluctance here. We share plenty of interests anyway and me actually HAVING a girlfriend is a bit of a shock so I won't mess it up over Firefly."
firefly,3degl4,Frozenfishy,5,Wed Jul 15 18:13:48 2015 UTC,There's crime in Firefly. Black market beagles!
firefly,3degl4,NRageTheBeast,3,Wed Jul 15 18:19:51 2015 UTC,Let's be bad guys!
firefly,3degl4,takeshi_kovacs,4,Wed Jul 15 18:44:29 2015 UTC,You could get her to watch Castle if she doesn't already. Maybe Nathan's frequent but (usually) subtle references might slowly indoctrinate her! Besides the fact it's a pretty good crime show.
firefly,3degl4,MaliciousLeigh,3,Wed Jul 15 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"Only watched Castle a little bit and only recently. In fact, I'm pretty sure she has seen more than me as when we were watching Firefly she noted that Fillion ""always has the cocky characters"" or something along those lines, and she used Castle as one of her points of reference."
firefly,3degl4,farmerfound,3,Wed Jul 15 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"She likes crime shows?!   Show her Castle, once shes in love with Fillion she will beg to see a younger version be all actiony and what-not!  Of course, then you will have lost her to the Fillion... guess it could be worse."
firefly,3degl4,Fiend1138,7,Wed Jul 15 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"She wasn't, by any chance, sent off to an ""Academy"" when she was younger, was she?"
firefly,3degl4,DankoJones84,6,Wed Jul 15 20:56:14 2015 UTC,By Jove... I think you've got it...
firefly,3degl4,chnacat,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"What shows does she like? When I first showed it to my GF, I warned her that the first episode was probably the weakest. She fell in love with it anyway."
firefly,3degl4,dr00b,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"She's into mainly crime stuff and she says that sometimes she likes other stuff, like Science Fiction, but Firefly just isn't one of those things. She had seen most of the first episode before and didn't like it but I told her that many struggle with the first one an end up loving the series by the second episode. Still didn't like it."
firefly,3degl4,Kirkayak,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:39 2015 UTC,Fringe?
firefly,3degl4,guywithfro,3,Wed Jul 15 18:37:08 2015 UTC,Yes.
firefly,3degl4,SquireOfFire,3,Thu Jul 16 07:00:37 2015 UTC,"Outraged might be a strong word dude.  My girlfriend wasn't a huge fan of it either, but then again unless she's sleeping or knitting/crocheting (or the occasional video game) she'd rather be up and doing something.    Basically...if you think that's a super pivotal thing that someone HAS to agree on for you to be with them, then yeah.  If it isn't, and you really like her, just let it slide."
firefly,3degl4,ProudTurtle,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"nah.  relationships are all about compromise.  She gives you time to be a firefly fan, you give her time for X.   Give and take."
firefly,3degl4,CastorTyrannus,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"I give her time for X, Y, Z and all the other letters of the alphabet, plus the Greek alphabet. Firefly was my one thing."
firefly,3degl4,CastorTyrannus,3,Wed Jul 15 21:58:43 2015 UTC,A family friend (mother of 3) also didnt like Firefly. Of all things she said the acting was terrible.
firefly,3degl4,Nollog,5,Wed Jul 15 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"She... what? I don't see that. Say many things, but the acting?"
firefly,3degl4,MagisterD,2,Wed Jul 15 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"I could see it, if you're not used to good acting you'll think the stuff in ncis and csi is good acting."
firefly,3degl4,ilais2,3,Wed Jul 15 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"I remember watching it all with a friend and as we finished the season,I looked up at him with my hopeful eyes and said ""Do you have season two?"" I thought he was never going to stop crying.   Then we watched Serenity and I didn't think I was going to stop crying.   If she doesn't love it already and feel an emotional attachment then she is clearly dead inside, and she will probably eat your firstborn. In fact she's probably a reaver."
firefly,3degl4,MagisterD,3,Thu Jul 16 01:20:35 2015 UTC,Yes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-yHSaP0Dyg
firefly,3degl4,blue_wat,4,Thu Jul 16 07:19:05 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who I can't get to watch most of my comedy or music, but we did a trade: I watched a show he wanted me to watch and he would watch the only season of Firefly.  He's now watching it a second time thru on his own and makes Firefly references.  This girl just sounds like pure evil. I hope you know I'm only kidding"
firefly,3degl4,RickHalkyon,6,Thu Jul 16 15:55:22 2015 UTC,Probably part of the Alliance. Better keep her close... see what she's planning...
firefly,3degl4,texasintellectual,5,Wed Jul 15 17:59:10 2015 UTC,Wow.
firefly,3degl4,RickHalkyon,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"Yes.. she's not worth the time.. bet she watches scrubs though, such a power full show"
firefly,3degl4,eadon_rayne,2,Wed Jul 15 18:12:41 2015 UTC,It takes a while for some people. Was she on her phone the whole time?
firefly,3degl4,InadequateUsername,2,Wed Jul 15 19:42:35 2015 UTC,My fiance doesn't care for it either. I don't really mind; I don't like Star Wars or Star Trek or LOTR or super heroes... so he's entitled to one thing he doesn't like. :)
firefly,3degl4,Rutgerman95,2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:33 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how much other stuff you guys have in common. I will always recommend that relationships be built on friendship, which requires you to actually enjoy doing things together. It doesn't have to be a 100% overlap, but a decent amount is preferable. If Firefly is the only thing, it's probably not worth worrying about. But if all she wants to do is shoe shop and you hate shoe shopping, well, you might want to rethink that."
firefly,3degl4,obinice_khenbli,3,Wed Jul 15 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"She certainly isn't a shoe shopper...  We share a fair amount of interests (reading, theatre, Doctor Who, etc.) and we just generally like being in each other's presence. But we all have a lot of differences. She love rock music and my interest in that is fledgling. I love videogames and her idea of a videogame is the Lion the Witch ad the Wardrobe. I think we have the balance. Even if Firefly is a bit of a sore subject now."
firefly,3degl4,obinice_khenbli,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, you have Doctor Who. That can make up for a lot."
firefly,3degl4,95555,3,Wed Jul 15 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but even WITHIN Doctor Who we have disagreements. She didn't like Matt Smith, I did. She likes Capaldi, I think there's something slightly off about his Doctor (although I still like him). So even then we are at odds."
firefly,3degl4,BitchinTechnology,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"My husband isn't even interested enough to watch the entire series. Just past our 7 year mark. We don't have to be into the same movies, shows, and games to make a happy relationship. We have plenty that we both love. Like Star Wars Battlefront and everything LOTR."
firefly,3degl4,kaptainclaudia,2,Wed Jul 15 22:45:10 2015 UTC,My partner really loves Firefly and he wanted me to see it. I finally caved. I didn't really like it.  Then it mysteriously grew on me and I liked it all of a sudden. Very strange.
firefly,3degl4,Nollog,2,Wed Jul 15 21:50:34 2015 UTC,At what point did it start to grow on you?
firefly,3degl4,Xtrap,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:44 2015 UTC,"I watched a few episodes with him and took a while after that. Probably a few weeks. Watched some more on TV when I had it, and the episode where Mal almost dies alone really struck me. I took another break and it was around that time."
firefly,3degl4,Crivens1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:33:14 2015 UTC,"Is that Out of Gas you're talking about? Because if so, that is the best episode. Don't even care what everyone else says."
firefly,3degl4,NotNormalGrandma,2,Wed Jul 15 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"Try battlestar galactica, now if she doesnt like that, you better get on match.com asap."
