breastfeeding,3e2xi4,baby_ham,4,Tue Jul 21 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"Even if you cant fully breastfeed, you can supplement at the breast with an SNS. The medela one is reusable, but its got a hard case. People seem to like the Lact-Aid one more but you have to buy bags for it. My biggest piece of advice is to define your own success. I havent had a reduction myself but I have known women that have through LLL. They all had varying levels of milk, and some needed to supplement, but made it an entire year, and some didnt need to supplement at all."
breastfeeding,3e2xi4,Creepella_the_third,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  What's an SNS?   The stories about the women at your LLL is really encouraging.  The hospital that I plan on delivering with is VERY pro-breastfeeding and supportive of the golden hour, etc, but the LC that I met with last night left me feeling a little discouraged and basically told me that it wasn't going to work.  :("
breastfeeding,3e2xi4,Creepella_the_third,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, its a supplemental nursing system. Its a thin little tube that you tape to your breast. It allows you to supplement at the breast so that you are still getting breast stimulation while supplementing. It has a valve so you can breastfeed first and then top up with formula at the breast. If you have supply issues, you can use it the entire duration so your baby is still getting some breast milk every day. If your remaining ducts are emptied often they should consistently make milk. It may not be enough to fully meet demand, but some breastmilk each day is better than nothing at all."
breastfeeding,3e2xi4,runaway_ducky,4,Tue Jul 21 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the wall of text....  I had a breast reduction four years ago. I had the anchor incision and my nipple was never fully removed. I made it clear that I had the intent of breast feeding in the future so my surgeon was very careful. Despite that, I do have some very minor nerve damage on the right hand side.  Fast forward to this year. My son, Griffin was born at the end of May (5 weeks premature). I never experienced any leaking or anything of the sort (even colostrum) during pregnancy and my breasts did not change size at all. After Griffin was born, we did do skin to skin but due to his prematurity, he was taken to the NICU pretty quick. The next day, the nurses did speak with me about breast feeding and whatnot and we did try. Griffin has a small mouth and a slightly receded bottom jaw so latching was quite difficult. Also, my nipples are short-stemmed, which didn't help anything. They recommended getting a breast shield, which I did do and that helped a lot. They are inexpensive, only about $10-15.  Initially, we got nothing from me. Not a drop. So again, I spoke with the nurses, (the hospital didn't have a lactation consultant) and got their recommendation on a pump. Every one of them recommended Medela and since my insurance covers the full cost so long as it was prescribed, I got the Medela Freestyle (I had prescriptions for a pump from both the pediatrician and my OB, gotta love 'em!) And pump I did! I pumped for 20 minutes every two hours and I will tell you it was the most disheartening experience of my life! All that hard work and I got a TINY amount, they used a syringe to suck up every last drop to give to Griffin. And then after a few days, I was only getting 5-10mL! My milk didn't ""come in"" in the manner everyone elses' seemed to. It was very upsetting and I felt like my biology was failing me or that it was my fault because of the reduction but I kept at it. I started taking Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle herbs and drinking Mothers milk tea and my output increased. I went from 5-10 to 20-30 etc and last week I was pumping 70-100mL every 3 hours, sometimes more. I wanted to increase my output again recently so I tried lactation cookies and BAM! 140mL!!! And that is where I sit now, bearing in mind that prolactin output is highest in the morning, which is when I hit that 140ml. In the evening, it's lower. So drink TONS of water! It helps.  I met with a lactation consultant today and she told me that at 9lbs, 1oz, he should be getting 84ml every 3 hours or 112mL every four hours which mean that after all that hard work, I am FINALLY able to feed my son without having to supplement with formula!! And that is just pumped volumes. Babies are infinitely better at removing milk from a breast than a pump so I know that when he is latched properly, he is getting everything he needs from me. If you are strictly breastfeeding, you can't measure those volumes so you will have to rely on wet diapers and weight checks. If you are pumping and feeding then it is more measurable but don't get hung up on the numbers, it will drive you up the wall! So now, I feed him at the breast whenever he wants it, pump for about 20 minutes immediately after.  In the end, you will get stressed out and frustrated and disheartened. That is normal. Keep at it if you really want to but don't beat yourself up if you do want to change over to formula. There is nothing wrong with formula. It's what kept my boy going when I couldn't give milk to him. Breastfeeding is wonderful but it isn't for everyone. Breastfeeding is worth it in the end. It's the one thing that you can give your child that nobody else can.   And as a final note, the asshole who came up with the phrase ""Don't cry over spilled milk"" has obviously never spilled a bottle of hard-earned pumped breast milk! I spilled 10ml once and I BAWLED!!!  You can do it! Everyone here will cheer you on through your whole adventure, listen to your woes and rants when you are frustrated and upset and most of all, we will support you and your baby!"

If nothing else, it shows there is hope that it CAN be done!  As for the cookies, they are inexpensive to make. Using coconut oil instead of butter makes it more expensive so that change is up to you. I had purchased coconut oil when I was preggo to help with stretchmarks so I had some (didn't do squat for the stretchmarks though!) Any bulk food place should have the ingredients. I couldn't find self-rising wholemeal flour so I used the whole wheat flour and added baking soda.  Best of luck to you on your journey and I hope to read a success story from you in the coming months!"

breastfeeding,3e2xi4,KnitterGrrrl,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:03 2015 UTC,"I had a breast reduction when I was 20. I had my first child when I was 31.   I had GD, and ended up with a c-section. She had low blood sugar because of the GD and was given formula right away to get her blood sugar up. It was an hour or so after birth before I was able to try to nurse her. I was not able to pump well enough to build a supply while we were supplementing in the hospital. I nursed her first thing in the AM and just before bed until about 3 month,  but she was primarily formula fed. I never had milk come in, never felt engorged, so she may have just been comfort nursing.   My second is a month old now. I had another c-section, and was able to to skin to skin in the OR while they finished up. He latched in the OR. I have  been nursing him without out any major issues (split nips suck) and have been able to pump also. I definitely got engorged this time, my milk came in on day 4 when we left the hospital.   Depending on your reduction, you may have different results. I would suggest try to get you baby latched as soon as possible, and keep them there as much as you can to encourage your production. If you have to supplement, make sure you pump. I didn't pump like like I should have with my first, but I don't know if it would have made a difference."
breastfeeding,3e2xi4,KnitterGrrrl,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your story!  Do you know what type of incision you have?  Did you have your nipples reconstructed at all?  I am hoping that the skin to skin and very pro-BF hospital that I am delivering at will help get everything going.

breastfeeding,3e4lyr,woollywhelk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:37 2015 UTC,"50 to 40 by itself is not a big deal. Breastfed babies gain a lot at first and then naturally slow down. It's also completely normal for babies to drift up and down a little as they go through growth spurts and lags. Couple thoughts: was the ENT using the same growth chart? If they used the CDC one (as opposed to WHO) it'll compare your baby to formula babies, who tend to weigh more, artificially dropping his percentile. Is he still making plenty of wet diapers? If so, you are probably just fine."

breastfeeding,3e38d3,cross-bot,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"My office didn't have a fridge for breast milk for a long time, so I bought a reusable ice pack and a small light-weight cooler to keep pumped milk in.

breastfeeding,3e38d3,petrichorpancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:19 2015 UTC,As far as pumping breastmilk is ok at room temp for 4-8 hrs which is really wide range. I've erred on the side of caution and gone with 4 hrs but if you know you're going back to your office within 8 hrs you could finish pumping and just stash your milk in your purse until you got back to your office.
breastfeeding,3e38d3,unclegrassass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"First thought: you don't mention how long you plan on being out on maternity leave, but if it's not much longer than 12 weeks, you will probably need to pump at least 3 times in a day, and quite possibly 4, since you will be away from your baby 10 or 11 hours a day. This is both to be comfortable and avoid clogged ducts and to produce enough milk for the baby, unless he reverse-schedules and nurses a lot at night, you'll need to pump about 10-18 oz a day (1-1.5 oz for every hour you're not together). You can bring a cooler bag and ice packs and keep the milk with your pump (keep your pump parts in the cooler also) but if you will be moving buildings frequently it will get very old shlepping the pump and cooler bag around, in addition to whatever you need to bring for work.   Since you know the new boss from before, I'd set up a meeting and talk to him and tell him you are interested in the job but you intend to breastfeed and will need to take time to pump to do so, and outline what you'll need if he's not familiar. Are some of these meetings such that you can call in and be virtual for them? I pumped through meetings regularly, it took me a little while to not worry about people hearing the noise over the phone when I was off mute, but everyone I worked with was super good about it and never mentioned it. Tell him then that you intend to keep strict office hours and avoid travel, and see if he thinks you'd be a good fit for the job. If that won't work for  him, it's good to know before you apply for it.  If not, go to your current boss and tell him the same thing and see what he says! I would definitely schedule one-on-one meetings with the boss before HR, HR will usually be pretty happy to go with what your manager says as long as it's all within the company rules."
breastfeeding,3e30o0,Yogicj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Adding a pumping session, as in draining both breasts, will signal for more production no matter when you do it. If you want to tame the oversupply feed on demand and hand express in between only when you are uncomfortable and need to relieve some pressure. Just do it until they start to soften, not draining them completely.   Also, even though your storage does increase with each pregnancy that doesn't mean you will have a problem like you did last time. Feed on demand and they should regulate within the first 12 weeks like normal."

breastfeeding,3e3wrk,runaway_ducky,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"I had bad acid reflux as a teenager and was told to lay on my right because that allowed the stomach to 'hang' and not have the fluid compress against the sphincter, thereby preventing acid reflux.  If you look at a picture of human anatomy, you will see that the big side of the stomach is on the right so you want to keep that side down."
breastfeeding,3e3wrk,skunka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:13 2015 UTC,My baby spits up a lot too. He gets really upset with burping/spit up. For me it seems to correlate with dairy consumption (it is much worse when I eat dairy and he spits up through his nose and gets really upset). He doesn't arch his back in pain though - I think that's a sign of reflux/GERD so I would ask your doctor about it...
breastfeeding,3e3wrk,skunka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:47 2015 UTC,"My LO also spits up through his nose! Kind of freaky. Yeah, I've had a few people tell me to cut out dairy...I don't eat a ton but it's worth a shot. I do suspect gerd but from what I've read unless the symptoms are really bad and/or babe isn't gaining they don't really do anything. I'm still going to talk to my pedi about it...in the meantime I'm going to cut out dairy I think. Thanks! It's good to know I'm not alone!"
breastfeeding,3e3wrk,skunka,2,Tue Jul 21 21:59:49 2015 UTC,I know they say you have to cut it out for a few days before you will notice but I notice the day after I eat it. It's not nice spit up either (like normal milk that just comes out of their mouth) - it's like chunky stomach spit up. Thankfully I have a comfy nose sucker (like a nose frida) because it really gets up in there!  I've thought about mentioning it to my doctor too. But I don't think she'll do anything because he's gaining weight okay.   A friend of mine has a daughter with GERD. She would scream and arch her back whenever she was being fed and was REALLY upset.
breastfeeding,3e3wrk,Somethin_cookin,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:06 2015 UTC,Oh also - I have a pretty forceful let down too and he always pulls off and chokes for a sec - then he starts screaming because the boob is gone! Haha. He's always fine though. He will spit up much later too (like right before he feeds again)...
breastfeeding,3e2t2p,endlessblockades,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"I would speak to a La Leche League leader or a professional lactation specialist about the night time nursing. When I went back to work at 3 months my LO did not transition to bottles easily so she was eating 5-7 oz for the 8.5 hours we were apart. To compensate for this I nursed on demand at night. So far it's been working out well for us. Nursing through the night helps maintain supply for the entire day, especially if you have to pump at work. I would definitely speak to someone and get hands on help to increase your supply at night so you can nurse as much as she wants when you're together."
breastfeeding,3e2t2p,icharmmi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've seen multiple LCs and they basically say ""unlimited access to the boob,"" which is well and good unless the baby won't tolerate slow letdown/flow.  I think we're both frustrated.  Tonight I'm going to try block feeding in the hopes that there's always one more ""full"" breast, and see if that makes a difference."
breastfeeding,3e2t2p,icharmmi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"I have only seen block feeding used in the context of reducing supply due to oversupply issues, so I would proceed carefully with your plan. I'd hate to see you accidentally decrease your supply even more.  If baby likes the immediate reward of milkflow you could pump or use manual expression until you see a letdown and then latch her on. When you're bottle feeding, are you using the paced feeding technique so she doesn't get used to the constant stream of milk? For the late night feeding, have you tried dream feeding before her hunger wakes her up?"
breastfeeding,3e2t2p,icharmmi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, using paced feeding, as is my nanny.  She rarely wakes at night from hunger - if she does it's around 3am, when I've had sleep and I don't have a supply issues.  I don't understand what it is about 7-9pm where my body and her needs just don't align.  I""ll try yet another LC but this feels insane."
breastfeeding,3e2t2p,icharmmi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I bet that's frustrating. It's hard not to be in sync with your baby, especially after seeing one specialist after another. One thing I would watch out for is make sure you've seen a IBCLC. The level in training and experience differ vastly between the different certifications. It sounds like you're doing everything right to try to keep her happy and sated. If there's a LLL group near you it might be worth a try to give them a call, especially since they are free."

But they're open to anyone, so there's always randoms in there using the sink, or microwave (for formula babies) to heat their lunch. Or, napping on the couch (who does that at the mall??). Unrelated, it's also always 10 degrees hotter then the actual mall, which sucks for breastfeeding."
breastfeeding,3dztyi,SpikedBladeRunner,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:32 2015 UTC,My mall's nursing room has an intercom you press and security lets you in. It's to keep away people that would misuse it / creepers.
breastfeeding,3dztyi,erisathene,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:16 2015 UTC,I once had to wait about 5 mins outside an in-use family bathroom in an airport with a poopsplosion baby needing to be changed after a flight. Then a 20-something woman came out WITHOUT a kid. She got a massive earful from me!
breastfeeding,3dztyi,bonjourtabby,0,Tue Jul 21 03:10:42 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you had to wait 5 minutes with a baby that was probably crying and very uncomfortable but these family restrooms are not just useful for families or people with wheelchairs. I have a medical condition and use these restrooms to set up a sanitary station next to the sink that I can't do in the regular restrooms. If I came out of the family room you would have no idea why I was in there or that I had a medical condition. I have had to deal with mother's like you before and they are always shocked that someone else could possibly need those rooms as much as you. Shame on you for yelling at the lady when you have no idea why she was in there in the first place.
breastfeeding,3e2gli,MrsCrapnapkin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"The bonus to no shield is that you won't have to pump after nursing like you're supposed to with a shield (shield doesn't allow the same physical stimulation). My boy is 7 weeks as well and just decided about a month ago that he didn't want the shield. We have some latch issues (seeing a LC today!) but otherwise, if he doesn't want it, then I don't need it. That is my perception. I don't think breastfeeding should hurt, period or no so maybe look into meeting with a lactation consultant about it? I haven't gotten my period back so I can't relate to that front."
breastfeeding,3e2gli,runaway_ducky,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished weaning my twins off the shield and went through two weeks of the most hellish pain ever. My daughter has a super strong latch and wasn't used to latching properly. Essentially I had to go back and train her to latch properly (mouth wide open, tongue forward) which was a huge pain but she eventually caught on and now we nurse pain free.  It was worth it for me because now I don't have to juggle a nipple shield on top of tandem feeding but if you are ok with using the shield and your daughter is doing well I don't think there's any reason why you shouldn't just keep using it."
breastfeeding,3e2gli,unclegrassass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:51 2015 UTC,Seconded. When I weaned off the shield it took a good couple of weeks for the awful pain to subside. I thought she was being super aggressive in her latch but I think that my nipples were just bruised from not being used to not having the shield and it took a while for them to get used to it.
breastfeeding,3e2gli,_Betty_Cocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"I didnt wean off the shield until something like 3 months because of the pain while nursing without. Like others have said, it took about 2-3 weeks for there to be absolutely no pain, but it was so worth it. No more fumbling around in the dark at night with it and I finally felt like I could leave the house because I could feed him without having to deal without the ridiculous dribbling issue."

Just tired of always thinking about pumping, wishing I could just go out and about without thinking, oh, gotta be back home soon to pump again!

breastfeeding,3e1h1q,whambat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:53:15 2015 UTC,"IMO, yes.  Some kids transition off the boob to solids more readily and easily than others (mine is still nursing multiple times a day at 18 mo, and I wish I could get her to drink more cow milk/eat more solids).    Sounds like you're following his lead and that is a good thing."
breastfeeding,3e1h1q,tercerero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:38:55 2015 UTC,He did wake up around 2am last night and I fed him then. He usually doesn't wake up at night so he must have been hungry after all. :)
breastfeeding,3e0q62,SundaesAreHappiness,14,Tue Jul 21 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"Umm... don't?  Studies have shown moms that exclusively breastfeed get the most sleep - adding bottles doesn't equate to more sleep, just more work because you've got to spend time pumping (and cleaning pump, and someone has to bottle feed and clean bottle). You'll still wake up with uncomfortable engorgement, or a milk soaked bed.   Here's what my husband did that helped me get sleep in the early weeks: As soon as he got home from work, I went to bed and took a nap, while he did baby care. If baby needed to nurse, he'd bring baby to me, I'd nurse and call him after baby was done and I'd resume my nap.   On weekends, same story, but I got to sleep in as long as I wanted, often until noon. He'd bring baby to me for feedings but otherwise I was in quiet room, empty bed by myself and he'd take baby for a walk, do all diaper changes,  let baby nap on him while he watched tv or whatever.   The first 6 weeks were the most difficult as far as sleep deprivation goes.  Other things my husband did that helped: He prepped/packed lunch/snacks for me and put them in the fridge so it was easy for me to grab food and sit down and nurse baby and have something already to eat. Doing dishes, laundry, vacuuming, etc. Oh, and lots of telling me that I was doing a great job as a mom.   As far as getting ready to return to work - how soon do you need to return? Plan to pump just once a day, and aim for roughly the same time each day because milk supply is affected by time. I found pumping in the morning gave me the biggest output. 1 ounce = 1 hour of food for baby, so it adds up fast if you consistently pump once a day. All you really need, bare minimum, is enough saved milk to last your first day at work. Then on day 1 at work you'll pump what will be fed to baby on day 2."
breastfeeding,3e0q62,sprgtime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I get caught up on sleep if we have a few rough nights during the week. We do ours on the weekends so I can stay in bed as long as I need. He got his babytime which is just as important as my nap. If you really must pump for whatever reason it's best to do it while baby's eating, so you'd be awake and pumping while baby's getting a bottle anyway."
breastfeeding,3e0q62,icharmmi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:05 2015 UTC,"This is what we still do at 5.5 months in.  My husband takes the baby and I sleep.  When the baby needs to eat, he wakes me up, I feed, and then he promptly takes the baby away again.  It's the best situation for everyone.    As far as pumping for returning to work: What I did was start tracking the times of day baby would eat.  Seems easy or simple probably to someone who bottle feeds, but when you feed on demand, it's hard to remember times of feeds (or at least for me).  While you're still home, pump in the morning after baby feeds - the 3am-ish time is the best.  I could feed baby and still pump about 5 oz combined!  This will help build your stash.  Try and pump RIGHT after you're done feeding if you're going to pump.  Pumping between feeds is only going to frustrate you and baby until you make more milk.  I saved up about a month's worth of milk right before I went back (crazy, I know).  Now with pumping 3-4 times during the work day, we still have about a month's supply constantly in the freezer.  This is great for us because if I get caught in meetings or something and have to push back a pump and can only pump twice during the day, I know that we have buffer room"
breastfeeding,3e0q62,rhanding,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"I started pumping when my babe was 10 days old so my husband could feed part of the night and I am so glad I did. I simply pumped before I went to bed. While it is true that I always get more from pumping in the morning I get enough before I go to bed too.  I find it is really impossible to predict how much my baby will eat. So I just make sure to always have enough around if I will not be available.  I also try to pump once or twice a day during my maternity leave so that I can get a freezer stash going for when I go back to work full time. It makes me feel good to have something there for her in case something happens to me or I need to go on in antibiotics that are incompatible with breast-feeding (yes I am a worrier). I have never really had an oversupply from doing that.   The only rule I make sure to follow pretty consistently is that if she has had a bottle I will pump as soon as I can to compensate for that bottle. For example, if your husband is feeding at night you are fine either pumping before you go to bed or when you get up. It really depended on how my breasts felt as to what I would do. Usually it was more comfortable to pump at night because then I wouldn't be as full in the morning. But if she had just breastfed and I wanted to go to bed I would pump in the morning. You really start to get used to how your breasts feel and they will usually tell you what to do :-)"
breastfeeding,3e0q62,MrsCrapnapkin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply!!! This is extremely helpful. I really want to get into a routine of pumping so my husband can help with feeds and also to have milk stashed just in case. I suffer from painful gallstone attacks and I pumped during the last one because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to feed him when it was time. I've nursed him during one and it's utter agony. I really want to get a stash going both for my return to work and for when I inevitably have surgery to remove my gallbladder (I have an appointment with a surgeon in a couple weeks but the surgery doesn't have to be immediate). Plus when I return to work, I'll only be working part time at first and my husband and I will be switching off days so I'd like to get him used to feeding now so he's more confident when he's home all day with the baby.  Thank you so much, again!"
breastfeeding,3e0q62,MrsCrapnapkin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I am so glad I could help!  I am a FTM mom too and no one close to me has ever breastfed so I am totally winging it.  My babe is a little over 7 weeks old and seems to be doing great.  I too was really scared to just willy nilly pump here and there due to potential oversupply and engorgement or undersupply issues for baby but like I said I am so glad I did.  It would be really stressful to me to go back to work with just a little saved up, so having a nice stash is great.  Same for you for your surgery I think!  Hubs really loves feeding her too and I love the break.  My babe started refusing the bottle at night recently due to some wonderweeks stuff I think, and he was pretty bummed about it.  I am really grateful he can bond with her too."
breastfeeding,3e0q62,unclegrassass,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:00 2015 UTC,"When my husband took over a feed I would pump right before I went to bed and he would wash every thing. He would feed our twins what I pumped and then come wake me up when they were hungry for the second time. It worked really well and I have never had any supply issues. As long as you are eating enough and making sure to allow baby plenty of time at the breast one pumping session is not going to cause your supply to drop. Additionally if you wake up and are engorged pump! Even if your baby wakes up right after you are done your breasts will still make milk for her, she just might nurse for 40 min rather than 20. I always pumped until my breasts were drained but a good rule of thumb is to pump for 20 min and I strongly recommend double pumping! It's so much easier."

Reading the how-to and seeing pictures of moms doing it was helpful to me to figure out how to make it work for myself.   ""laid-back"" breastfeeding is also nice. Where you're reclined with every body part relaxed and supported, and baby nurses on top of you, facing down."
breastfeeding,3e0q62,trixsterrabbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:07 2015 UTC,"It gets easier with practice.

breastfeeding,3dyshi,kr15tery,4,Mon Jul 20 18:02:14 2015 UTC,I do the same. I just send the fully assembled and filed bottles. The only time our Tommee Tippee bottles leak is when I misthread the nipple ring.

breastfeeding,3dyshi,KayThere12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"The tip of the nipple presses up against the cap, preventing leaks. Most bottles I've tried work like this, but I forget if the Dr Browns are the same."
breastfeeding,3dyshi,kr15tery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dr. Browns are like that, simply because they devised the disk system.  I can't really tell either because the caps are opaque but they've leaked without the disk, when capped so I'm assuming that they are NOT built like TT bottles.  I have a spare TT bottle that I bought to try back when she was refusing bottles and of course, I just realized that the daycare kept it after I sent it as a backup option today.  I really can't win Lol."
breastfeeding,3dyshi,UnicornToots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:08 2015 UTC,Could you send the nipple and cap separately in like a bag so the caregiver just has to take off the storage lid and screw on the lid with the nipple? Does that make sense? I'm not sure how the Dr brown bottles work
breastfeeding,3dyshi,OrganizedSprinkles,4,Tue Jul 21 14:36:03 2015 UTC,I plan on giving daycare frozen breastmilk in freezer bags. They allow it and will defrost and warm in their restaurant-grade kitchen.  Does your daycare allow frozen milk to be brought in?
breastfeeding,3dyshi,UnicornToots,3,Mon Jul 20 19:01:07 2015 UTC,Second. I send a mixed bag of frozen and fresh with one bottle and day care sorts it out.

breastfeeding,3dyshi,advocatel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:52 2015 UTC,I pump my fresh stuff and put it in bags for the next day. It's easier to warm up in bags as opposed to those thick Dr Brown bottles.

breastfeeding,3dyshi,mrsavatar,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"I send frozen bags. Daycare has a bottle that I leave there (I switch them out when it's time to clean)  At work, I pump and combine my day's milk into a mason jar.

I even fill them a little past the fill line (4.5 oz vs. 4 max recommended to avoid leaks), and they use a bottle warmer at daycare.

To transport it, I just put it in the daycare bag (just a reusable shopping bag) and put that on the floor of the car in front of the car seat (so not enough room for it to fall over there either)."
breastfeeding,3dyshi,sukithefox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"Dr. Brown bottles are great but so finicky. Does daycare have to warm the bottle? I ask because generally for Dr.Brown bottles they need to be warmed with the vent system (and nipple and adapter) either very loosely connected or off (otherwise due to pressure buildup it will start leaking from vent area during feeding. It will also leak if the nipple adapter is screwed too tight). In which case the caregivers need to handle the bottle components anyway. Also, even if they didn't lose the discs, they still need to unscrew the nipple adapter ring to get the disc out, so again they are handling the bottle components still. Sorry don't really have a solution other than what you mentioned, to cap the bottle and have the vent system and nipple separate. And try to trust that the caregivers are hygienic..."

Turn off the mommy brain and try to let yourself completely be present sexually with your husband. Tell him how you're feeling. Be honest, tell him you what to enjoy being touched but to move slow.

I had a preemie (28 weeks--he couldn't nurse directly for almost 7 weeks) and I pumped all.the.time.  By the time he came home (38 weeks) I was making enough to sustain him, though I had a supply drop and had to take Reglan to boost it.  You may want to ask about galactogogues."

breastfeeding,3dzskn,missmae23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"Totally normal! Some babies switch to an infrequent stooling pattern, sometimes going as much as 10 days between pooping.   Exclusively breastfed babies are not constipated, but with infrequent stooling their poop will still be soft and have more of a peanut butter consistency. Also, they may have smelly gas, like grown-man-disgusting gas where you're sure they must have pooped, but it was just a fart.   Enjoy the easy diaper changes! I loved the 3-ish months where I mostly just changed wet diapers. Once we added solid foods he went back to pooping a few times a day, and then it was smelly because food poop is a lot stinkier than breastfed poop."
breastfeeding,3dzskn,sprgtime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:03 2015 UTC,Infrequent pooping is the BEST. I am cherishing every day.
breastfeeding,3dzskn,aerrin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:49 2015 UTC,Yup! My son is 4.5 months and he stopped pooping every day all of a sudden last week. It's nice not to have so many poopy diapers to change but I'm also a little anxious about going out because what if The Poop happens while I'm out? Lol oh well. My pediatrician said he could start going several days without pooping any time and it was normal.
breastfeeding,3dzskn,ummmmmmnope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure if mine is normal or not but wanted to share my almost 4 month old BF baby usually poops every 3-5 days. He stopped pooping every day around 2.5-3 months. Almost every single one is a blowout up his back and around the corner, but I guess that's a trade off for non-daily poops!"
breastfeeding,3e0g8v,lolamcgoo,7,Tue Jul 21 00:24:58 2015 UTC,"Someone else will answer you, but nope! Your supply is regulating. Pumping output is a poor metric to gauge your supply if you are EBF your baby. Keep with it and your output will increase, or add in another session to get your boobs to produce more. Don't stop! If you are EP, the same holds true- keep with it, add more sessions, eat oatmeal everything and avoid mint like the motherfucking plague. And you know, call your LC.   Edit: As long as they are gaining and getting the right number of diapers, you're doing great!"
breastfeeding,3e0g8v,Devea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:47 2015 UTC,Oh no. Does mint decrease supply? I had mint sauce on lamb last night :(
breastfeeding,3e0g8v,Aqua_Lotus,4,Tue Jul 21 03:24:06 2015 UTC,They kiddios might not be staying latched as long because they are getting more efficient at feeding! Try counting diapers or seeing if you can do weighed feeding somewhere so you can see how much they are getting.
breastfeeding,3e0g8v,Omgabluebox,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:14 2015 UTC,Lactation cookies increased my pumping output by a full ounce. Here is the recipe I use. I add choc. chips :)  Give those a shot?
breastfeeding,3e0g8v,runaway_ducky,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:19 2015 UTC,Everyone already said these things but I'll say them again! Pumping is less efficient then babies! Go by diaper counts not by how long they nurse or how much you pump. My guy went from 20 ish min per side to 5 min per side! When I had oversupply he would only eat on one side (he had green poops for a couple weeks) but now he is back to both.
breastfeeding,3dz955,rw0804,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"My baby was cup fed at 2 days old because she needed supplementing and we wanted to avoid nipple confusion. I'd imagine with the not before 5 month thing, they're thinking more about independently drinking from the cup.  A shot glass might seem funny, but the hospital used those little plastic medicine cups that are almost exactly like shot glasses! When we've cup fed her at home, we've actually used the top for bottles as it has measurements on it.   It's messy for sure. And it definitely takes longer than breast or bottle feeding. I guess it depends what you are using it for and for how long. F you're at home currently and it's just for the odd night out or errand then it's totally doable. If you're working and your baby is in daycare or has another caregiver then it's probably not sustainable in the long term."

After giving up trying for about 2 months, we tried again and she had a great time playing with the bottle. She had no idea it was food tho!  I'm hoping that when we start solids next week she might be start to learn that food comes in forms other than boobs and try a sippy cup. No idea if it will work but we'll keep trying different things. I figure she's not the same baby at 5.5 months that she was at 6 weeks so why not?"

breastfeeding,3dyg0d,Truffled,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:59 2015 UTC,"If the band size is too small, meaning its too small around your chest and not the breasts, you can buy extenders. Like this:  http://contentinjection.com/bra-extender/ They are basically an extra row of hook and eyes. You can make your own from old pairs of bras by just cutting them off and stitching it together. That should carry you over until you are closer to your regular or your new size."
breastfeeding,3dyg0d,Catgirllewis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:02 2015 UTC,I would check out r/abrathatfits. They were super helpful in getting me in the right size. My boobs look good!
breastfeeding,3dyg0d,awholelotofbuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:34 2015 UTC,Oh yes great subreddit! I'm more curious from those that have been there before if I need to wait longer before I get myself resized.  I wouldn't want to buy bras (they aren't cheap!) only to find in 6 months they don't fit anymore.
breastfeeding,3dyg0d,awholelotofbuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,Well....technically you are supposed to buy new bras every six months (like that really happens with my budget) if you wear them everyday/have a small rotation. I would still measure per abrathatfits guide to get an idea of your correct size and to see if your old bras will fit. I know I feel a lot better about myself now that my boobs are living higher on my chest.  I don't know how long it takes for the boobs to get back to their nonbreastfeeding size. You may have to buy one or two transitional bras while the change is happening.
breastfeeding,3dyg0d,femalebiohazard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:35:21 2015 UTC,I did not notice a change in my breasts after I weaned my son. Mine settled down a few months after my son was born and never really changed much except if we missed a feeding.  I would say that if your breasts haven't changed much recently then you are probably good if you want to purchase new bras. Extenders would also be a good idea!
breastfeeding,3dyg0d,billandteds69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"I'm at 20 months PP and my breasts have finally settled into the size they'll stay at. I've been utilizing sports bras as I've gotten smaller and it's helped prevent sagging. If you're still breastfeeding, I wouldn't invest in any new bras just yet. Someone mentioned getting extenders for the current bra you have and I want to second that. You'll still be losing baby weight and may fit back into those bras without the extender soon enough."

breastfeeding,3dxskp,kielbasarama,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:12 2015 UTC,Check out the app Kindara. You can track your ovulation so you'll know when to have sex in order to conceive. It takes a few months to see the pattern and night nursing can disrupt the accuracy of your temperature so you should also make a note of cervical fluid. You can get a cheap BBT thermometer at a CVS or pharmacy. Take your vaginal temperature as soon as you wake up and before you stand up.
breastfeeding,3dxskp,annemargaret,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:13 2015 UTC,You can also try the Taking Charge of Your Fertility book if you want more info about tracking your ovulation.

breastfeeding,3dxskp,kielbasarama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Unfortunately he wakes up twice a night (sleeps again only if nursed) and I rarely sleep more than 4 hours so the temperature would not be accurate. I already check cervical fluid often but not methodically. I should do that. Thanks for your advices!
breastfeeding,3dxskp,snshijuptr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:35 2015 UTC,No problem. Cervical fluid is more accurate anyway. Good luck!
breastfeeding,3dxskp,bighardt,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"I used ovulation prediction tests along with mucus and temperature charting on fertility friend. I figured out my Luteal Phase (time between ovulation and period) was too short, like 3-6 days when it should be 10-14. I did some night weaning and after a bit, I started taking Vitex (aka Chasteberry). It took 3 months and my cycle regulated and then soon after I was pregnant.   I wasn't in a big hurry to get pregnant so we took it one cycle at a time. I figured my daughter and my body were telling me I wasn't ready to be pregnant. I got pregnant when she was 3 years 1 month. She is old enough to understand when I say that she has to pop off because the baby is making Mommy feel sick or hungry or tired. I can't really imagine being pregnant before now despite my original plan to have my kids close together."

Definitely doesn't sound like domperidone would be a good fit for you. Have you considered trying herbs fenugreek and blessed thistle? I was supplementing with expressed milk and formula 6 to 8x a day. After dragging my feet, I tried those herbs (best if taking both herbs not just one) and after a week my supply was noticeably better. I was able to decrease supplements and pumping sessions to being able to stop altogether after 6 weeks and my baby boy (now 3 months) is gaining weight just fine.  Hope your appointment goes well and is helpful and encouraging. Good luck mama ☺"
breastfeeding,3dyi0y,mrsavatar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"Poor mama. My heart goes out to you. It's a special kind of heartbreak to struggle with feeding your baby. Some women do have a harder time than others. Before formulas were around we used to live in smaller communities where other mamas can step in and help wetnurse. Nowadays we have to advocate for ourselves and be aggressive if we decide to breastfeed under less than ideal conditions. While it's great to have options to fall back on, well meaning family and friends seem to offer these options sooner than necessary. It sounds like you're doing a great job of persisting in your wish to breastfeed.  I'm glad you're prioritizing taking care of your mental state. A healthier you will be better for your baby. I hope your appointment goes well today."
breastfeeding,3dyi0y,icharmmi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:23 2015 UTC,Could you baby have a posterior tongue tie? My LO had her tongue clipped at 2 days old but actually have a much more severe tongue tie that was not fixed until 8 weeks (laser). I thought I had low milk supply but it was actually a milk transfer issue with the baby not adequately draining the breast.  Can you rent a hospital grade pump? That is what helped me get my supply back up. I also had luck with oatmeal at breakfast and weirdly enough Metamucil (one cup at night)
breastfeeding,3dyi0y,awholelotofbuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"He definitely did. They snipped the first little skin bit and actually had to go a bit further because his tongue was so ""tied"". It is noticeably better now, we have had it checked up on, and his latch is no longer giving my nipples blisters. This was only a week ago though, and I imagine he is still learning how to use his ""new tongue"" the most efficient he can."

They are durable glass, and so can be frozen safely. They take up more room, but that may be worth it.

breastfeeding,3dvxca,ktownkate,20,Sun Jul 19 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"Your supply isn't drained, she is setting it. This cluster feeding is necessary to bring in the milk she will need for the growth spurt that is about to happen. It won't last more than a few days.   Have you tried nursing side lying? If you do it properly you can easily and safely nurse her while you sleep.   Is she putting out at least 6 wet diapers a day? If not she isn't transferring enough milk and you may want to investigate the possibility of a tongue or lip tie.   Unfortunately, if you choose to stop breastfeeding, her needs will still be the same, she still won't sleep and she will still need to be fed, she will still have a need to suck and be constantly soothed. It's just all part of the newborn phase. It's exhausting and stressful and emotionally trying.  The first 12 weeks are the worst. I promise it gets better every day and even if there are hiccups along the way you will figure out a way to solve them creatively to benefit both you and baby."
breastfeeding,3dvxca,kielbasarama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"Her diaper output is good. Neither our lactation consultant or doctor noticed a lip or tongue tie, so I'm not worried about that.  Everything I've read about cluster feeding stated that babies would eat more frequently, but I've never heard of a baby eating for such a long stretch of time.  I'm not at all comfortable with co-sleeping in our bed,  so side nursing is out. I guess I just have another sleepless night ahead of me."
breastfeeding,3dvxca,kielbasarama,11,Mon Jul 20 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"That's good. Those all mean everything is likely going just as it should. I, and a lot of women I have spoken with, experienced the constant cluster feed. It's tough but it won't last long. Take it a day at a time, hour at a time, whatever you can manage. Don't worry about the future right now. Your life will look completely different in a week and different again in another week.   Sleep deprivation is actually much more dangerous than you may have been made to believe cosleeping is. If you want information about how to make cosleeping safe visit www.cosleeping.nd.edu.

I was totally against it, terrified I would somehow suffocate him, but as long as you take the right precautions, it's pretty safe.  Just lay on your arm and leg so you can't roll over without trying really hard. And your Mommy senses are dope. You will pretty much wake up if she breathes differently.

And he's sleeping today too. I must have eaten something he didn't like, because even this morning he spit up what he ate from me. I also noticed today that my stomach hasn't been the happiest either. Today pumping and dumping and hoping tomorrow that everything will be out of my system.

breastfeeding,3dxgmi,lillyOfTheValley,3,Mon Jul 20 09:54:42 2015 UTC,"Not all women are fast responders to the pump, does it take a long time to let down? Sometimes I found hand expressing a little before pumping led to a faster let down.   Some moms find that looking at pictures or videos of their babies helps their out put improve. I always found that watching Netflix and not looking at how much I was pumping helped me relax and have a strong let down.  Also, hands-on pumping helped me when my I had trouble pumping.  200 ml or 7oz is quite a big feed. Is your care provider pacing his feedings?"

breastfeeding,3dxgmi,sukithefox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:59:56 2015 UTC,Also try the massage stroke shake thing between let downs. It helped me a lot with my first. I have not had to with this one yet
breastfeeding,3dxgmi,woollywhelk,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"That's like 6 ounces right? That's half of what I pump at work, but most BF babies never take more than 4 oz or so at a time. 6 seems like quite a bit. Paced bottle feeding may help stretch your pumped milk to 1.5 feedings or even 2. My guy is 3.5 months and only takes 3 oz at a time.  Are you using a double electric pump? Here are things I've found helpful: - do not skip breakfast or lunch  - drink 25 ounces water before first pump, another 25 before 2nd - use a hands free pumping bra (search Amazon for lactamed) and do hand compressions while you pump  - focus on relaxing. Imagine feeding baby. Watch videos of baby on phone, etc. - when your first letdown slows or ends, switch the pump back to fast-suck mode to help trigger another letdown faster. I constantly switch between fast and slow to mimic baby and I get at least 2 ounces more this way. - measure your nipples! Are you using the right size flange? I was having pain after pumping and learned I needed to size down. Once I did the pain went away and output increased.  Good luck!"
breastfeeding,3dxgmi,woollywhelk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:47:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, so much good stuff right here. I knew I had to be hydrated but didn't know I must drink right before pumping.

breastfeeding,3dw0gk,kielbasarama,3,Mon Jul 20 01:55:56 2015 UTC,I think I saw that on Netflix. She is telling you to get comfortable and binge watch tv. It's a good distraction.    Keep practicing side lying. When they're that small it takes lots of practice. Use a rolled up receiving blanket or something under your boob to position the nipple at mouth level.  There's some good info about how to be safe at www.cosleeping.nd.edu. Also look into laid back nursing. This isn't for sleeping in a bed but it's great for getting comfy. Check out some videos on YouTube.
breastfeeding,3dw0gk,kielbasarama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:19:33 2015 UTC,I will have to look into all that.  SO doesn't want to have her sleep in bed with us because he moves around so much and is a very hard sleeper. I will sometimes put her in bed with me in the mornings to have another stretch of sleep after her early morning feed since SO leaves for work at 430
breastfeeding,3dw0gk,ClownHoleMmmagic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:07:59 2015 UTC,My husband was nervous when our daughter was tiny and fresh too but you put a newborn away from the other person so he would have had to roll over me to get to her. Then when she was about 6 months she went in the middle. It helps to put the bed against the wall so you don't feel like they're going to fall off the bed all night.

We didn't supplement. Some kids are just smaller. It freaked me out too- big time. I know this isn't that much but I hope it helps."
breastfeeding,3dv02d,OOmama,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:08 2015 UTC,"I would go by # of wet diapers... how many does she have in a day? Also if her poop is normal and mustardy you know she's getting the good fatty hindmilk. Knowing the # of oz from bottle feeding tends to wig us out because it's visible and measured. But if all signs point to healthy, lots of wet diapers show she is getting enough, you can safely trust your body and your baby.  You could try and form a new habit after feedings to burp her and offer the breast again, repeat until she refuses. When my baby is full he presses his lips together tight and won't latch on."
breastfeeding,3dv02d,ruby_saffron,3,Sun Jul 19 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"she is a pee machine! she can't tolerate being wet for five seconds, so we easily go through 10-12 wet diapers a day."
breastfeeding,3dv02d,ruby_saffron,4,Sun Jul 19 20:24:37 2015 UTC,I think she is getting plenty! She is NOT starving. Your milk is amazing and she is so lucky to have your breastmilk. Did you know your milk content changes with your baby's age to provide for her needs at each stage?  Here is a cool link about the composition of human milk. http://breastfeedingthoughts.com/2015/05/06/the-composition-of-human-milk/
breastfeeding,3dv02d,Ks26739,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously, some babies are just petite. Or take their time getting bigger. I really think that if she is making enough wet diapers then she is likely fine. I would hold off on supplementing, so that you don't end up chasing your tail trying to keep up when you go back to work.  My girl was in the 5th percentile at her 2 month appt. (her 4 month appt is on Friday,can't wait to see what she weighs now, she is still itty bitty but chunky) She is happy, healthy, and has little rolls on her legs, a big belly and a double chin. Lol She is just a little fat baby for whatever reason. It also helps (my peace of mind) that I exclusively pump. So I know she is eating plenty. If I was nursing I think I would be more concerned and doubting myself."
breastfeeding,3dv02d,erisathene,3,Sun Jul 19 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, she might not be taking in enough at the breast. I only say that because you said you can pump 2-4 oz every few hours regardless of nursing her or not. She might not be done, and falling asleep instead of draining your breasts more.  Does she seem to have a cold or anything like that?"
breastfeeding,3dv02d,erisathene,4,Sun Jul 19 19:42:28 2015 UTC,No cold. The ped suggests that she may be cutting her feeds short because of the reflux irritation...if that's the case we should see improvement if the Zantac helps her symptoms.
breastfeeding,3dv02d,pamplemousse2,2,Sun Jul 19 19:48:51 2015 UTC,Hmm well you could try the expressed milk until then. I had to pump after feeds for 15m and then I would give that milk after the next feed. Maybe you could try that for a few days and then get her weighed again? If you're pumping shouldn't mess with your supply.  p.s not trying to worry you or anything but I had some issues that i didn't realize because it seemed normal and tanked my supply >< It's probably better to check and make sure it's not just the baby being petite. Seems like it might just be reflux since she does have it though! I hope the medicine works~~
breastfeeding,3dv02d,Devium92,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a weighted feed is a great idea. In the meantime, go with your gut - what do YOU think is going in?  You might experiment with giving her some supplementing after feeds and seeing what happens over the course of a few days."
breastfeeding,3dv02d,adams_wife,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"I was an EBF baby way back when (23 years) and I was apparently the same. My growth chart was basically a flat line. I was eating,  peeing, pooping and otherwise a happy baby. (I realize your little one had reflux issues but you seem to have those under control)  We were referred to a local pediatrician who actually asked my mom "" if you don't want her,I'll take her for you. She's the most perfect baby I've seen!"". Some babies are chunks and sit in the 90%+ others have to be on the other side of the bell curve and be tiny thin little guys and girls.  My mom found her growth chart from when she was a baby and it was nearly identical to my own growth chart. I hit every milestone on or before when I was supposed to, and I continued to be very small my entire life weight wise. I'm now 23, 5f 3 or so, and I weigh 130 lbs (at 23 weeks pregnant). Only in the last few years did I finally break the 100 lbs threshold. I was stuck hovering between 90-100lbs for nearly 5 years during high school. Didn't matter what I did or what I ate my weight stayed low. Always healthy beyond random things that have no relation to my weight like needing my appendix out."

The health visitor said that it was probably to do with the timing of feeds, wet nappies and poops.   A big nappy could easily be 4 or 5 oz of poop and a  feed a similar amount.  Don't worry too much if its a one off, just keep an eye on the trend!"

breastfeeding,3dvzuq,TillyThyme,2,Mon Jul 20 00:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, he definitely needs to practice on the bottle and it will probably be rough - most EBF babies really prefer to nurse. Luckily, you are right in the time period when introducing a bottle is recommended/easiest, so that's good. Don't be surprised if he never takes a bottle from you - you smell like milk and he may not be willing to eat any other way from you. I gave bottles sometimes to keep him used to it, but we had my husband take over one of the night feedings with a bottle, which was nice for me. Once you do get him used to a bottle, you'll need to do it regularly - like once a day - so that he doesn't stop taking it.   As for pumping, since you don't need to pump for major storage, I recommend a manual pump, and use it on one side while you nurse him on the other. Let him bring on the letdown instead of you trying to do it. Once a day is plenty, to avoid creating an oversupply."
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,ckillgannon,4,Mon Jul 20 05:38:09 2015 UTC,"With the frequent feedings if he is wanting to feed for long periods of time very frequently, just let him - it does sound like cluster feeding. He will boost your supply that way. If he still seems hungry afterwards are you able to keep putting him to the breast rather than giving him donor milk or formula, or does the pediatrician not recommend you attempting to EBF due to your LO's previous weight loss even though the tongue tie is revised?  Ask the hospital LC to do a weighted feeding with you and him so you can see how much milk he is taking in while you breastfeed him now that the tongue tie is revised.  I agree with the other poster that you need to make sure you eat and drink 500 extra calories a day to sustain your breastmilk supply easily. If you are having trouble remembering to eat you need to make sure that your meals are high calorie and nutrient dense. You won't be making 'skim milk' but it's hard for your body to produce enough milk if you aren't getting enough calories to sustain yourself."
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,dalikin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:39:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I'm more than happy to let him nurse as often and as long as he wants! The pain in my nipples is decreasing the more we nurse, so that's helping. If he's still awake, I've started switching sides as often as he wants. He does fall asleep about half the time, though, and I let him (without moving him or shifting him to a tummy time position between my breasts and higher on my chest). The pediatrician said nothing about EBF, so we're just kind of winging it.  A weighted feeding is definitely on the agenda when we meet with the LC. :)"
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,dalikin,2,Mon Jul 20 07:04:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome :) Sounds like you are doing great. Is he having a good number of wet/poo nappies a day, and is he alert while he is awake?"

breastfeeding,3dwy8b,mrsavatar,3,Mon Jul 20 07:27:54 2015 UTC,"Hang in there mama! I experienced something very similar (my baby was jaundiced, underweight, was told by everyone to breastfeed, bottlefeed, pump...did this for 6 weeks, Had been suggested so many different things by doctors and nurses). I can totally understand your frustration.  How do you know your supply is still ""low""? Have you had baby weighed since his 4-day checkup? I'd recommend at least checking weight once a week...an increase of 20-30g/day is standard.  It sounds like clusterfeeding (baby trying to make up for the weight loss) but also a bit of comfort nursing/suckling (baby just wants to suck). Is baby latched well? Do you hear baby drinking the entire breasfeeding session? Indicated by hearing obvious swallows, or quiet swallows (quiet ""kuh"" sound), seeing deep chin movements (example of good drinking http://www.breastfeedinginc.ca/content.php?pagename=vid-reallygood )? If none of the above then could very well just be comfort nursing.  Your baby frequently feeding really is the best thing for your supply and is a much better ""pump"" than any other breast pump out there. And anytime you give a bottle, that will prevent your supply from increasing since your breasts aren't being stimulated. I'd suggest trying to drop bottlefeeds gradually (or completely, even, if you are comfortable) if baby is back to birth weight and is increasing weight. It's also possible that pumping so close to another feeding session is affecting your milk for the next breastfeed session...so if baby is feeding so frequently (like every hour or less), there is no need to pump and that won't harm supply...because baby is stimulating enough. And again if baby is gaining decent weight, you can probably even start dropping some pump sessions which may sound scary but trust your body to do its job.  And try try not to be so hard on yourself. The first couple months are the hardest, but things will get easier and you'll get the hang of things eventually. Stress really affects your milk supply. And I know you probably have heard over and over again that you should sleep when baby sleeps but getting naps in are important for your supply too (so don't think twice about having to decide between napping or pumping), in addition to keeping hydrated (try to have a glass of water with each nursing session) and getting those calories."
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,mrsavatar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :)  I'm just assuming my supply has decreased because I'm not getting as much from pumping as I was. I know that's not really a determining factor and baby is better at getting milk. It's just hard not to get discouraged.   Yes, he's been weighed twice since and is gaining. :) I'm just really scared about starving him and him maybe losing weight even though we're improving. I just want to be as good as possible for him.   His latch is inconsistent right now while he adjusts to his new tongue mobility. He couldn't lift it above his lower gums before, so all movement is really new. I don't necessarily always here his ""kuhs"", but I do see jaw movement while he sucks, then a pause. I can't really see his chin past my breast.   I read in ""The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"" that a baby with clenched fists while sleeping is still hungry. Does that sound right? It's just another bit of information I've never heard elsewhere."
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,awholelotofbuns,2,Mon Jul 20 07:12:20 2015 UTC,"You're right that pumping isn't indicative of your actual supply, but I can definitely understand how you're using that to gauge. When you pump to determine that and compare to what you pumped before, is that before or after breastfeeding? How much do you get?  I don't agree that clenched fists while sleeping means baby is still hungry. Clenched fists is a newborn reflex which they do while awake and sleep and can last a couple months. It's probably true that they clench more often while stressed or hungry, but that's hard to decipher. If baby is hungry, I'd base that on the more telltale hunger cues (and even those can be obscure...my baby was always sucking his hands even after being nursed and a supplemental feed, which I mistook for hunger. I soon realized he just wanted to suck and be soothed to sleep)."
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,RoaringMamaBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:09:09 2015 UTC,"I usually pump after nursing, but it's almost always at least a half hour after (usually ends up being 1.5 hours). I typically get an ounce to an ounce and a half each time I pump, but I'm only pumping 3-5 times a day.   It's taken us a second to figure out baby's hunger cues. He only just started stirring from sleep to eat this past week. I find that fingers in the mouth is ""I'm hungry"" but a fist is more of a soothing effort."
breastfeeding,3dwy8b,RoaringMamaBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:08:45 2015 UTC,"That's actually a pretty normal and decent amount for pumping after breastfeeding! If it was a lot more than that I'd question if maybe baby still needs help latching or if you have a bit of oversupply. I'd caution with pumping an hour after feeding though, since that could affect your next feed (slower let down and/or flow, causing baby to exhibit more hunger signs or frustration, typically leading to unnecessary supplementing). That's great you've been able to decipher some of his cues ☺"

breastfeeding,3dryrq,beanbaconsoup,3,Sun Jul 19 10:04:41 2015 UTC,"Good on her!  I do this.  I have a hard time nursing in a sling, baby just always seems uncomfortable and doesn't latch well.  I've never figured out how a boppy is helpful, it just makes me and baby uncomfortable unless I use it to prop up my head.  Even sitting, my babies and I have preferred a slanted cradle like hold that is easy to carry with.  I use the raise shirt, lower Cami and bra technique for discretion and most people don't even know I'm nursing.  A few times people have started talking to me and then realized what was going on down there and been terribly embarrassed. I just say something like ""It doesn't bother me, keep going!"" Sometimes employees offer me chairs and look confused when I decline.    Now, it is definitely much easier early on. My first was average length and this was cake until about six months.  After that, my son had to be in the right mood for the right hold.  Now my second is 97th percentile in length and I already notice it getting hard sometimes and she isn't quite 3 months.    Pitfalls: I rarely get to claim that husband should run around and get things for me just because I'm nursing.  He got me a stand mixer for my birthday/mother's day and he watched me make bread from scratch while nursing during multiple points in the process.  So he gives me looks when I ask him to do things while I'm nursing because he knows I can usually get it myself, but sometimes a good latch and a happily nursing baby just shouldn't be effed with by moving around. I also sometimes get shoulder, upper back strain when I do it.    I'm also a weirdo who thinks regular bras are easier than the nursing kind that have the clip, I just shove the cup down under my breast.  It probably stretches my straps but it is easier for me than fiddling with the clip.  I am also a weirdo that doesn't use a special hands free bra when I pump at work.  I just keep my cups up, slip the flanges in them, and the cup holds them in place, even a full 4-5 oz bottle in the morning.    But don't think you are doing anything wrong if you need a boppy to get a latch or couldn't live without your sling or cover to nurse while out and about.  We all find our little tips and tricks that work for us and look on in awe at things we never considered or don't quite work for us.  I know I'm extremely jealous of women that can nurse in slings/carriers or get a pass on getting their respective water while nursing!"

The worst part was the exercises to keep it from reattaching, but even that didn't seem to hurt him after a couple days. It did annoy him, but I can't really blame him for that.

breastfeeding,3dvasr,Elaine_dance,3,Sun Jul 19 20:46:35 2015 UTC,"In my experience pediatricians don't really know much about breastfeeding problems and don't offer much support. It can't hurt to ask yours, though.  I have similar problems, nursing has always hurt a little bit, and I'm a bit over a year in now. My daughter has a severe lip tie (as in it it goes down to her gums), but the lactation consultants I've seen have said that it isn't tight enough to cause problems. But, any pain that I had was exclusively during nursing, and didn't feel painful outside of that. You're right, if it's still painful like that while you're not nursing, there is probably something going on.  I'm hesitant to recommend seeing an ENT or pediatric dentist first, because they're likely going to recommend revision even if it isn't necessary. Try a lactation consultant, or a LLL meeting first."

However, given his good weight gain, spitting up, and gassiness, it's possible that there is also an oversupply problem going on there. That can also cause shallow latch and make it difficult to fix it even with a lip or tongue tie correction."

We visited an ENT recently and asked about it to be sure, and now that his weight gain is good, they won't correct it unless it interferes with teeth later."
breastfeeding,3duyv2,Chinasun04,4,Sun Jul 19 18:57:01 2015 UTC,Breastfeeding should be no problem for you. It's a learning process for everyone and it is possible that there will be tenderness or other complications but this isn't for certain and it's something you will be able to work with. There are thousands of stories of women successfully breastfeeding after breast reduction surgery where significant tissue was removed and even transgender men feeding their babies after breast removal.    Your best resource for success will be a support system. Contact your local La Leche League or breastfeeding support group. Find a good IBCLC and get in touch with them.  See if they have any experience similar to yours or know someone who does.

breastfeeding,3duphp,bioengnerd,4,Sun Jul 19 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"Freezing in 2-3 ounce increments helps limit waste. Freezing flat takes up less space. Be sure to label everything with date and amount, since it's impossible to tell how much is in the bag when it's flat!  Pumping into bags can be tricky because it's harder to see how many ounces you're actually getting. If your EBF full time, you may not be able to pump more than an ounce or so at a time, so you might want to consider pumping into bottles first until you know how much you can pump. This will also help you be able to combine multiple pumps into one bag if needed. Use the flange as a funnel to pour the milk into the bags, then you can play with the bag a bit and compare the measurement on bag vs bottle. That will help you judge amount better when pumping straight into bags.  If you do pump right into bags, they don't stand up well on their own, so it's helpful to have a tall glass nearby to put the bag and flange into while you get everything undone. Someone else commented here about that and it's seriously the best tip ever!"

breastfeeding,3duphp,Mp501,3,Mon Jul 20 10:45:55 2015 UTC,"This is what I do but it's worked for me.   I freeze them flat. More freezer space. I do 3 oz bags to limit throwing out any liquid gold. My LO normally drinks 6 oz at a time so I'll grab 2 bags. No advice here - our hospital gave us bags for the first year through the lactation consultant and they are easy to read. Perhaps trying another type? I wish I would have started paying attention from the beginning with just how much my daughter ate. In the beginning, I had to throw out a bag or two which really makes me mad."

You're like 1 week post partum, it's okay to let your body regulate its milk supply right now.   1) Freeze flat (Medela bags are actually the worst at this! I have some other brands that I got that lie a lot flatter and take up less room).  2) I like a variety - usually 4-5 oz bags and 2-3 oz bags so if you only need 2 oz, you're not thawing 5.   3) Guesstimate the oz, the 1/2 - 1 oz that you might be wrong won't kill anything.  4) Label things well (date, # oz, caffeine intake (if you have a sensitive baby, that is))!

breastfeeding,3duphp,Saxetwf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:59:22 2015 UTC,I usually do around 5 oz per bag and label. I use the bottles to pump into so I can see how much I've pumped.  I keep whatever I pumped for the day in the fridge and then move to freezer that night. Don't mix warm/cold milk. I also prefer the target brand bags. They have two snap layers and they lay flatter. I hate the medela bags but that's just me. I tried pumping into bags too and it seemed like I would get splashing outside the bag.  That might just be me too though :) Oh I lay then flat in the freezer and once frozen stand them up and put in shoe boxes or old wipe containers (without lid) to store. Also I didn't worry about pumping for the first couple of weeks. No time!
breastfeeding,3duphp,skunka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:18 2015 UTC,You have better advice then this already. But I pump into the bottle and then pour into the bag. I freeze in 1-3 ounce increments. If I get 2 ounces in one shot then I just freeze that. Sometimes I can't get much (like.5 ounce only). So I switch bottles and combine cooled milk into one bag (I only pump once a day in the morning). I mark the bag based on what the bottle says and freeze it upright. I imagine it's better to freeze flat but I am worried about it leaking and I have excess freezer space so it doesn't matter.
breastfeeding,3duphp,skunka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:54 2015 UTC,I should add that I haven't used any of my frozen milk yet so I'm not sure how much my LO drinks at once.

breastfeeding,3duo0v,pamplemousse3583,4,Sun Jul 19 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"The timing doesn't matter as far as boosting supply. It's always supply and demand so remove more and you will make more. Pump the opposite while he nurses one or pump after nursing sessions. While this is the most effective way to make more milk some women have had success with taking in more water, eating oatmeal, taking fenugreek or using blessed thistle, Brewers yeast or lactation teas.   Do your son have an allergic reaction to the coconut milk? Is he seeing an allergist? Coconut is meant to be the least allergenic although technically it is a tree nut."
breastfeeding,3duo0v,kielbasarama,2,Sun Jul 19 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"He has had multiple reactions to the coconut milk and has blood tested positive (as well as had reactions) to dairy, soy, peanut, tree nut, and egg, which rules out almond milk, coconut milk, and soy milk. He is having a repeat blood test to assess coconut and his allergist expects it to come back positive. He is under the care of a pediatric allergist and it is her recommendation to avoid those foods.  I forgot about fenugreek - thank you for the tips."
breastfeeding,3duo0v,kielbasarama,2,Sun Jul 19 23:34:00 2015 UTC,"This sucks. I'm so sorry. We're in the same boat (with multiple allergies) but we have been okay with coconut. Its also a bit exhausting to have to be on the elimination diet yourself so I feel your pain. We have replaced milk with other food nutritionally. She eats high fat foods (avocado, salmon, chicken thighs etc), calcium rich foods (kale and spinach blended into smoothies), we go outside a lot for vitamin D and she eats a lot of meat for protein. It's not as easy as giving milk but it gives her what she needs.   Do you still hear swallowing when he's nursing and he's putting out wet diapers? Nursing will boost supply before pumping will but you will probably benefit from a power pump or nurse vacation weekend. Also have you replaced your membranes lately?"

breastfeeding,3duo0v,pandadipose,0,Mon Jul 20 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Wheat, barley and rye, dairy, eggs, peanuts and soy... So far.  She's had reactions to other things but nothing EpiPen worthy just more rashy face and a few hives.   I cook everything from scratch now. Reading ingredients and trusting that trace amounts are truly just trace amounts isn't worth it. I try to keep meals simple so I don't go crazy. A meat, two veggies, a fat and an occasional fruit. She sometimes gets rice but it's just filler and makes her act like a lunatic from the sugar so it's not worth it.   I will sometimes check Pinterest for food ideas. I have to write my own recipes so baking has been put on hiatus for the most part (I made ""banana bread"" that looked like blueish oily pudding last week). On Pinterest I search paleo, sometimes keto or low carb, AIP, and vegan recipes.  This is usually just for ideas then I mash something together in my head and we end up with something like a spaghetti squash stuffed with sausage, olives, spinach and mushrooms while the original recipe was like a lasagna stuffed squash.   But like I said, the simpler the better. For us anyway. Grilled meat, grilled veggies, or sautéed veggies with bacon for fat, roasted squash, roasted potatoes. All simple one process cooking techniques. It's even better if its all roasted or all grilled.   Also I always carry a ridiculous amount of food with me. I have snacks for me, snacks for baby and extra snacks for the crazy pregnant me. I use an ice cube tray with a lid to give her lots of little options so she has a good variety and has fun eating. Other than that we just do water and occasionally (less than once a week) a few ounces of milk substitute that often doesn't get finished. Since I'm pregnant my milk is in the process of changing to colostrum so it's a much lower supply than it was and it doesn't satiate her the way it used to. It's much more for comfort and sleep now. So I just try to balance her diet and keep up the fats."

They don't start off eating that much, of course!   But that's the accepted max till they get to 6 months and you begin to add in complementary foods.

breastfeeding,3dvlkt,tlcw7414,2,Sun Jul 19 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"Breathe!  Congrats on your new little girl!   So the best way to build up a good supply for her is to nurse on demand at least 10 times a day in the beginning.  Your supply is hormone driven now, but every bit of breast stimulation and milk removal you do will train your breasts to make the amount of milk she needs.  So.  If you're pumping and you let your husband give her pumped milk, that's a message that is NOT being sent to your breasts.  Feeding a bottle without pumping or nursing at that time tells your breasts that they don't need to make milk right then.    Once in a while it's not a big deal!  But in the beginning I'd only give a bottle if I pumped at the same time while baby was eating.   ETA: what's the reason that you're pumping after you nurse and then feeding it to her?  Do you pump after every nursing session?"
breastfeeding,3dvlkt,raitch,2,Sun Jul 19 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"Oh and I'm only feeding her what's leftover because when we were still in the hospital, she wasn't doing any wet diapers, only stool, and they wanted me to give her everything I could produce in terms of colostrum so that mentally just carried over I guess. :/   I just broke down and had to put what I've pumped into a bottle so that someone else could hold her and I could actually come out of our bedroom for once... we've been home since Friday night and I feel like I've been confined to the bed between the pain and trying to feed her all the time."

Try lightly massaging the breast and remember it's your LO that will regulate your output. She will level you out and the extreme fullness should pass. The first few weeks are definitely challenging. Baby will show you the way"
breastfeeding,3dvlk9,per5picaciou5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:17 2015 UTC,It just depends if you want to totally dry up.  If so you can pump for comfort and just enough to relieve engorgement.  On average milk dries up within 40 days of stopping all pumping & nursing.

breastfeeding,3dugbi,kielbasarama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"I have not replaced my membranes, will that help?  He has maybe 3 or 4 wet diapers per day, and they aren't super wet either."
breastfeeding,3dugbi,kielbasarama,2,Sun Jul 19 16:34:13 2015 UTC,You have to replace them regularly. They break down and stop pulling as much. Run to the store. It should help. If it doesn't let me know and I'll brainstorm some other solutions.   Are you a regular pumper? Or just doing this to check your supply?

breastfeeding,3dsjg5,christinecatherine,8,Sun Jul 19 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"It's common for things to be rough right now. It's new for both of you. Depending on your birth he may be healing still, he might have a sore shoulder or may be sleepy from medication. Keep trying to latch. Try different positions. As hard as it is, keep trying. It won't be like this forever or even for that long but you both have to get on the same page.   You should have no other responsibilities except feeding baby from now on for at least the next 12 weeks. Your partner, support group and family should be taking care of everything else.   Sit skin to skin, like all day and night.  Remember that the first hunger cue is flickering eyes under closed eyelids turning to light movement. So right before they wake up you can latch them.  The next hunger cue is being awake. Don't wait for rooting, fist sucking or crying.   How many wet diapers are you seeing a day? You should have 1 for each day of life up to 6 days and at least 6/day after that. Has he moved all meconium out and is on to poo?  If you aren't seeing adequate diapers you need to feed more. What you described, 3 feedings in 24 hours, is extremely low and not common. The fear is that a very young baby doesn't have the strength to wake up and cue for milk so it's possible for them to get over hungry, stay asleep from weakness and then fail to thrive. Until baby is back to birth weight you need to wake them every 2 hours (timed from the beginning of the last feed) and feed, allowing for one 4 hour stretch at night.  Also work to keep them awake during the feeding to drain the breast completely and ideally move to the second breast.   Look into biological nurturing or laid back breastfeeding. This is the natural way for a newborn to latch. Position baby tummy to tummy upright on your torso. Have baby approach your breast from underneath. You can let baby self latch or sandwich the breast to help him latch on. You may want to express a little milk onto the nipple to entice him.   Check baby for a tongue or lip tie. If he isn't able to transfer the milk effectively he may be getting frustrated and giving up.   Has he has a bottle or pacifier at all? If so discontinue using it. It can cause nipple confusion and prevent them from latching or working to draw milk out.   Are your breasts engorged from your milk coming in? Are they firm to the point where your nipple isn't prominent and easy to latch on to? If so, hand express milk until they are soft (express into a clean glass and feed this to baby with a little spoon if you want to make sure he is getting milk). Once the breast is soft you can try latching again. Hold your breast like a sandwich to help it get into his mouth. You are aiming to have the nipple high in the back of his throat. Run your tongue along the roof of your mouth to see where it turns from hard palate to soft. That's where the nipple should rest. It's way back there. You should also see some of the bottom of your areola in his mouth (so not just the nipple) and his tongue should be sticking out, cupping the bottom side of your breast.   Contact an IBCLC in the morning or look up your local La Leche League and contact (call!) the leader ASAP.  Leave a message if they don't answer. Check llli.org to find them.   Don't leave baby alone tonight if you use a crib. Stay up and keep trying to latch. Practice side lying nursing (on a firm mattress or the floor) so it's safe if you fall asleep. Relax, drink some water, walk around the house with baby, hold him close and work it out. It just takes time to get to know each other. Congratulations and feel free to PM me if you need any other help."
breastfeeding,3dsjg5,kielbasarama,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for your very helpful response. My husband luckily is very supportive and has been trying to help. Unfortunately I had an episiotomy so I can't sit to nurse for very long but might just deal with the pain because he needs to eat. He got checked for a tongue tie and apparently has a small one but the LC at the hospital said it wasn't bad enough to get cut.
breastfeeding,3dsjg5,kielbasarama,2,Sun Jul 19 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty of that laid back position. It takes pressure off of the perineum. Sit slouched and reclined back, comfortable like you're going to watch a movie, not like you're going to take a test.   Also practice laying in the bed and nursing. It's amazing but takes some adjusting when baby is still really fresh and small use rolled up cloths to position the nipple where it needs to be. Are you spending most of your time lying down recovering? Keep baby right there with you and you'll get the hang of it eventually."
breastfeeding,3dsjg5,kielbasarama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:23:27 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've been spending most of my time in bed and baby and I nap together there. We don't have any reclining chairs or anything so if I sit up in bed I use pillows to prop myself up.
breastfeeding,3dsjg5,racerocks,3,Sun Jul 19 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's all you need is a rolled up blanket or pillow behind you. Check YouTube for laid back breastfeeding positions to see what I'm talking about. There are probably also some videos on side lying nursing a newborn."
breastfeeding,3dsjg5,manyvests,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:23 2015 UTC,Maybe try hand expressing a bit so that your breast is a bit soft and smaller for baby to latch onto?
breastfeeding,3dson6,thenamefits,4,Sun Jul 19 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"She will know he is getting enough milk by how much he is putting out. He should have at least 6 wet diapers per day and 1 dirty at least every 10 days.   She can sit reclining to help with a strong letdown or side lying. If she is only comfortable with a traditional cradle hold she needs to make sure baby is tummy to tummy with her and that baby's head is sideways, allowing for excess milk to drop out the side of his mouth.   She can also pump to let down or let baby trigger let down and then unlatch and let it spray into a towel. Then relatch once it stops.   If the green poo is frothy and explosive and there are any other issues like spitting up, a skin rash, a red ring around baby's butt, fussiness and (like you said) fighting the breast it could possibly be a food intolerance. Although this is not common it is still a possibility. She can have baby's poo tested for trace blood to show intestinal irritation and consider an elimination diet."
breastfeeding,3dson6,kielbasarama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"I experienced something very similar to what your cousin is experiencing. It sounds very much like overactive letdown/oversupply. There are many things to try, but this worked for me: I noticed that this mostly was a problem in the evening. My supply was higher during the day, but he handled it better. At night he was so tired and fussy anyway. I fed on one side every time I offered the breast until that side felt empty. Then I offered the other breast multiple times. I did some laid back nursing too, but I feel like the first strategy worked best. It stopped being an issue at all by the time the next growth spurt came and he was so hungry all the time. My oversupply became the amount needed. He also got very efficient and emptied the breast quickly, and began eating on both sides before bed."
breastfeeding,3dsry1,upsidowning,2,Sun Jul 19 02:41:59 2015 UTC,you could pump while your wife feeds him the bottle and then you must pump when you are gone at the pattern...your supply shouldn't suffer.
breastfeeding,3dsry1,lacyjanec,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:24 2015 UTC,"At 11 months old, night feedings are generally non-nutritive. Your supply is probably not going to be affected either way, stop or don't stop. I night weaned LO at 11 months for a similar trip, and it was the best thing ever. And I'm still breastfeeding 2-3 times during the day at 14 months. Also, sometimes the babies act totally different when we aren't around haha. He may not even wake!"

breastfeeding,3dsmo7,mediocrity511,2,Sun Jul 19 09:03:03 2015 UTC,"Reason number 1: Sometimes if a woman's letdown is fast flowing, the baby has to gulp milk fast which makes him or her flail his or her arms about wildly, Sometimes I'll unlatch to let her catch up to the last two or three gulps and continue.  Reason number 2: Baby has had his or her fill and is becoming distracted. Reason number 3: The milk isn't flowing fast enough and baby demonstrates her impatience."
breastfeeding,3dsmo7,Vjaynd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:34:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's between 2 and 3.

My approach is to either redirect her kneading to a less sensitive area by gently moving her hand or atm or to bounce her almost to sleep before trying to nutse. If I'm desperate I will swaddle her.Also nursing while rocking or bouncing sometimes calms her down.

breastfeeding,3dsyvk,bitterespresso,3,Sun Jul 19 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"My daughter only did 10 hours at night for a long time. Those sleep sites just put down an average, if even that. I think what's most important is how she feels during the day - is she happy? waddling around? If so, I think you're good. It sounds like baby is waking up and just looking for a little comfort/warm milk while she falls back to sleep, sounds perfectly normal. I feed my daughter whole milk yogurt or oatmeal right before bed + big nursing session and she would still wake at night while lots of her friends didn't. I think they're all just different. As for 10 hours at night - is your daughter still on 2 naps? When my daughter switched to one nap a day (around 15-16 months), that's when she started going a total of 10.5-11 hours at night + one 1.5 hour nap. Her total sleep is always on the low end of the normal range but she's happy and healthy so I go with it."

Coconut milk is essentially hypoallergenic and easy on the stomach and it's in most grocery stores as a drink now (milk section). Make sure her care giver has high fat and interesting foods to give her while you're gone and you won't need formula or cows milk. We do avocado, high fat meats, veggies with butter or ghee, eggs are good if you've already tested them out, also yogurt if you've tried that, that could replace milk and you could do water and maybe some coconut water (low sugar, high electrolytes)."

breastfeeding,3dr6o1,papertowelboats,2,Sat Jul 18 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"First, a cracked nipple may be COMMON but that doesn't equate to normal. Cracked and bleeding nipples is an indication of a problem. The lipstick shape and sting of latching would suggest that is the issue. It may just take time for babies mouth to grow large enough to latch properly but for now you should keep trying to relatch until you see a good deep latch with no pain or sting.    Look into laid back positioning. This is biologically more natural for the baby and it can help achieve a latch that places the nipple high against the baby's soft palette. If you run your tongue along the roof of your mouth until it goes from hard to soft, that is what you're aiming for. It's way back there.   Are you pumping to avoid more pain? Or to allow it to heal? If you can get a decent latch and you can use lanolin or coconut oil or something to soothe and prevent infection, you may not need to be pumping. Also express a few drops of breastmilk, rub it around and let it air dry. Go topless as often as possible until you heal.   If you are going to pump you probably want to give the expressed milk to baby to keep from confusing your supply. Avoid a bottle if you can. Try spoon feeding or cup feeding (from a small medicine cup). This will avoid nipple confusion and while people sometimes say on here that it's not common there are an equal amount of people who are suffering with it and it's an absolute bitch so wait at least 6 weeks for the bottle or pacifier.   What might make pumping easier is to pump while feeding. Use a small manual pump (an electric would work too but manual is easier in my opinion) and pump the length of time baby is actively nursing. Baby will stimulate the letdown so you will have a higher yield and you won't be using up time in between feeds.   You're approaching cluster feed territory with a growth spurt around the corner. Get comfortable, get that puppy healed and work on that latch but don't stress too much. Congratulations and good luck!"
breastfeeding,3dr6o1,kielbasarama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"No advice other than about the pumped milk.. Keep nursing on the side that you aren't pumping.  Baby is likely satisfied from one side, so you could probably just put the milk into a storage bag and toss it into the freezer. Maybe just keep a bottle in the fridge for in case baby is hungry, and rotate it out each time you pump a new one.    Keep in mind it's easy to overfeed a baby with a Bottle, so if you are offering a bottle after nursing, I wouldn't give more than an ounce at a time."
breastfeeding,3dr6o1,Ks26739,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:52:09 2015 UTC,"Lanolin will help the pain and help you to get a pumping ""seal"" to increase production. Bad latch is likely. Nugget may out grow it, tbh. If it is bleeding, it's a big problem, if it isnt, after 9 days, I'd say it's common, but not GOOD in any way, and try to see an LC in person for latch correction."
breastfeeding,3dr6o1,sukithefox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:19:32 2015 UTC,I'm having the exact same issue. I've tried giving righty a break this weekend by only pumping but I ended up nursing once each morning to try to alleviate the engorgement. It hurt like hell and it's not improving.  I'm calling my OB back tomorrow to have them prescribe me the compounded ointment that's supposed to heal nipple cracks and is safe for breastfeeding.  The right side has hurt from the start probably due to a bad latch that I didn't correct. For some reason the left side is totally fine. Just can't win!
breastfeeding,3dr6o1,Brolee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:09:00 2015 UTC,I'm terrible. My nipples were cracked and bleeding and I just kept breastfeeding. He had a bit of a tongue tie though. Reading the comments here make me feel silly. :)  But he's gained weight like champ (and my breasts healed)!
breastfeeding,3dqfl0,maybebabyg,3,Sat Jul 18 13:18:40 2015 UTC,"Look into laid back positioning. Essentially you lean back, like you would if you were watching tv.  We usually sit upright like we're taking a test to nurse and position babies on a pillow but this is really unnatural and can cause mom to hunch or be stuck holding a boob. Holding two boobs is worse. So try to get comfortable. Then latch baby A on boob A with their body upright running down the length of your tummy. Have baby approach from under your breast so you get a good deep latch (they come at it from the bottom like you would try to chomp down on a hamburger.  If baby needs help you can sandwich your breast for latching and then you should be able to let go, baby just chills along the side of your stomach and your arm would naturally gently support baby.   Now... Hopefully baby B is right next to you on the couch. Depending on your anatomy you may need to put baby B across your opposite leg while positioning baby A. If you sit cross legged, or at least with your opposite leg up and bent, your thigh and calf crate a little cradle to lay baby in. Once baby A is good scoot baby B up to boob B and latch. Now you should be comfortable and both babies are laying down your torso with their tummies against yours.    I hope this explanation makes sense. It takes a little practice but you have to make sure you're comfortable or you won't be happy about breastfeeding. Set yourself up with water, phone charger, a book, snacks, whatever you might need, within hand reach. I put everything in a basket with a handle so I could grab it off the floor without moving. Good luck and congratulations!"
