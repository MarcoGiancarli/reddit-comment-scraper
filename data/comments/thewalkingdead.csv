All his power wouldn't mean anything to the ones he loves; initially he'd fly around non stop trying to save as many people as he could, but for every one he saved, there'd be ten he couldn't. Ultimately he'd start to become jaded and one day there'd be that person he could save, but didn't want to. He's just so tired. Ultimately he'd give in to his inner voice and at the last minute have a change of heart, but by the time he got there it'd be too late. He lives with this guilt, and the guilt of having not been able to save so many others. His decent into madness is punctuated by memories of the better times. Why couldn't he save Lois? He begins to lash out at the Walkers, inventing ever more imaginative ways to kill as many as possible, leaving demolished cities in his wake as he travels the World.

I feel like Walking Dead has been getting better and better while Game of Thrones is falling apart last two seasons. Just my opinion. I feel like GOT can straight up not make sense and do the stupidest crap but the critics will always sing its praises and I really don't understand it.
thewalkingdead,3e021f,K41namor,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:24 2015 UTC,I have seen seasons 1-4 but not 5 yet. I was looking forward to seeing it because of the way people responded to those last 3-4 eps.

thewalkingdead,3e021f,Jason-G169,4,Tue Jul 21 11:43:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that ASOIAF is amazing, but both, GoT & ASOIAF are two different mediums of entertainment. I also wouldn't go as far to say the show has dropped quality in the last 2 season, yes this season past has been lackluster mainly because of the Dornish stuff, aswell as Stannis' stuff, but i think the rest of the show was up to par with seasons 1-4."
thewalkingdead,3e021f,franklinzunge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"I find the show very sub par and its got nothing to do with the medium. After reading the books, the show is really hard for me to stomach, but even my brothers who didn't read it noticed how bad its getting. TWD and the comic are so different and they each play to their strengths. Never felt pissed about a change or anything, I'm happy they are different and enjoy them both. GOT isn't really trying to do its own thing though, it is throwing in big book moments with no context and story to support it. I don't have a serious problem with anything in GOT except the writing, which happens to be the most important aspect. I think the actors are actually so good a lot of times it hides how bad and nonsensical the writing is. I have been a devoted fan of the books for years but this last season turned me off of it completely I am not watching the rest. It'd be like in the Walking Dead, if Michonne sneaks into Woodbury and kills the Governor's living daughter for no discernable reason and then the Governor attacks the prison but is still painted as the bad guy and Michonne as a hero. The Governor tells Rick he must behead Hershel himself and then Rick vows not to do it but then he beheads Hershel and the Governor escapes on a zombie horse having kidnapped Glenn. Just kidding but its shitty writing in my book theres so many plot holes every event can be shown to not make sense within their own established logic and rules of the previous episodes and events."

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,bobsaget0013,38,Tue Jul 21 07:07:09 2015 UTC,"I don't understand people who say that bringing in the Hilltop/Negan now would be rushed. There's barely any material between No Way Out and A Larger World. What little material there is, such as the coup, looks like it'll be done early on in the first few episodes, going by the trailer.  Negan I'm betting will cameo-appear in the very last scene of the finale where he lucilles someone (probably Morgan because of Lennie James' busy schedule). It's the best marketing move they could make by having that be the cliffhanger ending of the season. It'd go down as the biggest finale the show's ever had, the hype going into Season 7 would literally be unbelievable."

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,noktiis,14,Mon Jul 20 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"considering everyone's love for morgan   I love comic!Morgan, and show!Morgan seems interesting, but he's hardly been in the show at all. I'd honestly be pretty pissed if they killed him off this season, since I've been looking forward to getting him back for ages. Hopefully they do something like they did with Tyreese, and introduce him later, but keep him later too. Hershel was sort of the replacement Tyreese, in terms of how he died.  If Glenn doesn't get Lucille'd, I'm thinking it could be Abraham or Eugene."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,dacalpha,5,Mon Jul 20 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"I have always wanted Daryl to get it. I love Daryl, he has made the show richer for being in it, but he is not an invicible Übermensch. It would be a stunningly fucked up and unexpected scenario for Daryl to get the full Lucille treatment. I feel like Glenn still has some interesting growth that could take place. Might change Maggie's future but she has always been pretty different from her comic book version. I don't think I could buy show Maggie being a major leader like that. But they kind of look like she is getting set up for that with being Deanna's apprentice or whatever."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,franklinzunge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"I thought for sure Daryl would get decapitated by the Governor. In the comics, Tyreese was Rick's right-hand man for the early stuff up through the prison, but in the show he wasn't even introduced until the prison stuff, and wasn't made a major character until S4. It would have made sense to replace Tyreese's comic death with Daryl.  At this point I've resigned myself to believe that Daryl has plot armor at least until the last season of the show."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,dacalpha,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:53 2015 UTC,He definitely has had plot armor. Plot armor is far too frequent in the show.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,7V3N,0,Tue Jul 21 04:41:14 2015 UTC,"Eugene is way too important for credibly re-establishing ""civilization"" through his knowledge of technology, which is something they need to better communicate in the show. Negan has to be established as the being much worse and more hated than the governor. He has to kill someone decent and good. It's got to be Glenn, Daryl or an outside chance of Maggie."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Late_Dent_ArthurDent,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:11 2015 UTC,"Not a super common theory, but I think Tara has a chance of getting Lucilled.

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,TZMouk,7,Mon Jul 20 18:50:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't think we'd have casting rumors by now...for Negan at least.

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,anti09,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:56 2015 UTC,My guess is the Wolves and the herd attack will be one in the same.  Apparently the wolves collect walkers and attack communities with herds. That's what they did to Noah's place. They're gonna find Alexandria from the pictures they found in Aaron's bag and launch a herd at the town.

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Jeanpuetz,14,Tue Jul 21 02:40:53 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it would be Daryl but that's a dangerous season finale to have.  With such a gap between seasons they would definitely run the risk of losing viewers by killing off a fan favorite and then making everyone wait so long to see the depressing fallout.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Rubix89,10,Mon Jul 20 20:23:40 2015 UTC,nonono.  it has to be Glenn.  Maggie's pregnant.  They're finally starting to get things together.  BAM!!  Star Trek Red shirt.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,JimmyPellen,4,Tue Jul 21 03:26:28 2015 UTC,"By the looks of it's going to be a community of 20-30 survivors instead of 200  EDIT: I'm not knocking it, I was just making an observation. I can see why it wouldn't be practical to have that many extras on for one small location."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Dahaka97,9,Mon Jul 20 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"It would be a lot of extras to hire to be fair, especially after all the people they had to hire for the horde."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Girafarigging,3,Mon Jul 20 15:48:15 2015 UTC,Maybe CGI?  Not sure if the cost is less than extras or if either are just axed being extra costs.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,demalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"CGI people? Eh, that's kind of gross. I get it for zombies since they're all weird but getting CGI people right would be weird. Idk they can all also be inside for whatever reason, like how we never saw Heath in season 5 yet."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Girafarigging,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:05 2015 UTC,Well I mean you dress up current actors and staff the small amount of extras in different clothes.  You film those of people just standing around on a green screen and then brush them into the final product.  If done right it works pretty well.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,demalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"Oh well yeah that's green screen. I suppose it is CGI, but I personally don't consider green screen part of CGI. I'm talking more about if they made a human model and stuck it in the back lol I'd be complete fine with them green screening a group of people in just to save time or money."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Girafarigging,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:16 2015 UTC,It'd be like the people you see that populate kids cartoons like Team Umizoomi.  For places that are heavily populated where you just need some people in the background doing things that's the easiest way to make things look busy.  Different if they need to be in an area and interact with characters.  I'm almost sure they've already done this with some large zombi hoards.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,demalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:29 2015 UTC,The Wolf of Wallstreet used a lot of CGI for small things and turned out nice.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,rabidnarwhals,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that was also a huge movie that was very funded. I'm not saying it's impossible or would look really bad, but I can't image a TV show getting good CGI to create people unless they were really zoomed out."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Girafarigging,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't say they could do it I was just making an example of how you may not even notice something is CGI unless it's like a big set piece or something, I wasn't even thinking of the costs"
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,rabidnarwhals,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:10 2015 UTC,No...no cgi zombies
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,BenderB-Rodriguez,2,Tue Jul 21 04:44:03 2015 UTC,"I'm talking wide shots that wouldn't hold a lot of detail.  And the zombies themselves wouldn't be CGI, just CGI'd into the scene.  Using green screen one actor could play a couple different zombies just by changing clothes and a wig.  The large shots that have been done on the show had to have been green screen or drawn backgrounds.  The University, the hammer time on the road, the new trailer, terminus explosion.  The show has had decent use of CGI.  I don't see how they couldn't incorporate that into the larger living communities.  If anything it eliminates the need for coordinating large crowds or small independent pockets of action.  If those can be directed off set and then digitally added later I would think it would help decrease the costs just by decreasing the logistics of the shots."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,demalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not knocking it, I understand why it wouldn't be practical."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Dahaka97,5,Mon Jul 20 16:43:01 2015 UTC,I'm not claiming you are! I'm just stating that they are going to have to scale it down considering just how many actors that would actually be.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Girafarigging,5,Mon Jul 20 17:24:40 2015 UTC,I wanted to clear that up just in case :)
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Dahaka97,6,Mon Jul 20 18:09:48 2015 UTC,"They could always expand the walls slightly more eventually. That's what they did with ASZ before season 6 started filming, I felt the same when I saw pictures of the first build of ASZ, I thought it was small. but then They expanded it. so they're making sure it's going like they didn't show all of it.  So they could always do the same with Hilltop."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Acid_Gamer,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:52:08 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a lot more sense for the show. They already changed the dynamic considerably with ASZ (which I love).  To add 200 more people in a relatively safe environment would alter the show too drastically, too quickly.  Makes more sense to have fewer survivors and watch them grow incrementally over time.   Changing from a small group of survivors on the road to a larger group of survivors behind a wall is great. Changing it from a group of survivors behind a wall to an actual small agrarian society really shifts it to an entirely different show.  It worked amazingly well for the comic, but the show has more logistical issues to deal with. It also has a more fickle fan base than comics tend to (they want to have as broad an audience as possible not just the super fans). It's wiser to have a tv show build more slowly IMO"
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,crybannanna,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a shame in my opinion, because that shift you mentioned was done on purpose by Kirkman, as part of the world-building and reconstruction of civilization he has been trying to set up.   Regardless, I'm curious how they're going to handle the additions of two other sets (The Kingdom and The Sanctuay) going forward."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,SimplyMe94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:20 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken I understood it as the sanctuary was supposed to be terminus?

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,ResidentSmartass,20,Tue Jul 21 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"There were only about 30 people in Alexandria at that point of the comics though, right? We didn't see everyone in Alexandria in season 5, in the season 6 trailer, you can see that at least  So my guess is that not everyone showed up at the party or the witch hunt, they were out doing other things or maybe just didn't want to be there, like porchdick. So the number of characters should just about match up to the comics, I think. I'd prefer if they didn't alter the Saviors' population in the transition to TV."

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,VirulentViper,7,Mon Jul 20 22:53:10 2015 UTC,when did they begin the alexandria set?
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,devon000,0,Tue Jul 21 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"More of them stuck in a ""secured"" location. When are they gonna learn (in the books, or the TV show) that there is no ""secure"" location.   This is what I loved about Carl in the earlier books. He grew up in the zombie apocalypse and he was the only one that understood that there was no ""going back"" to a ""life like before""... The zombies will ALWAYS be there, someone will ALWAYS want to take what you have. There is no safety behind walls.   Sure you can band together a big community but something is always going to try to tear it down. And the longer that people are trying to live that ""normal lifestyle"" behind the safety of some walls, the weaker they get in the art of fighting back."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,DoctorDeath,26,Mon Jul 20 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"That's why you need a solid group of soldiers to remain ever vigilant. To allow the rest of the people to live in relative security.   It's a lot like we have now. We have trained soldiers fight to allow us the security to live our peaceful lives. Many of those soldiers have extreme difficulty coming back to ""normal"" society because they know how thin that veil of protection can be. Yet the rest of us can live our peaceful lives free from worry, because we have them.   No reason this couldn't be applied on a smaller scale. Of course, in a small population, everyone needs to be trained and ready to fight in case a larger force is encountered and more soldiers are needed."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,crybannanna,6,Mon Jul 20 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"I dont think that happen in Season 6. Remember about No Way Out, Wolves and Jesus kidnapping, and we have only 16 episodes. ps: C`mon! Downvote me, because thats my opinion."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,HenrykBrodaty,6,Mon Jul 20 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"They have only filmed the first part of the season. Why would they build something for season 7 if season 7 is not even confirmed? (There will be s7 for sure, but it haven't been confirmed yet, so no budget for it)  Gimple likes to move fast with the story, so I think we will have our Jesus in s06e09."

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,mcakez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"The Governor books aren't for the TV series. They're made to tie into the comics, though I think I remember reading recently that they're not canon to the comics anymore. Can't find a source though."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,TheDidact118,6,Mon Jul 20 19:12:47 2015 UTC,With the last two seasons it was announced right at the beginning of October that the show had been renewed for a next season. Season 7 very well could be announced before the season 6 premier.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,GuyOne,4,Mon Jul 20 15:31:11 2015 UTC,It may veer from the comics and we could get a back story of Jesus and others using this set pretty early on.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Goose_Dies,6,Mon Jul 20 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"While I agree that there is much to accomplish in this season, I think the haste with which they are building the whole place gives the impression we'll see it at least a little toward the back few episodes of the season. All speculation of course, but I'm still excited even its only for season 7."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,GuyOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:04 2015 UTC,But remember a lot can happen in a single episode. For example the entire conclusion to No Way Out can be done in 6A finale.  I wouldn't be surprised if Jesus is introduced halfway through 6B like Aaron was. Then we could possibly have simply a shot of Hilltop to end 6B just to tease A Larger World.  EDIT: This potentially could work in line with issue 100 being the 7A finale.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Girafarigging,6,Mon Jul 20 14:32:16 2015 UTC,"Eh, if it was just going to be a shot of the Hilltop, I think they'd just CGI it like the prison at the end of Season 3."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,TZMouk,7,Mon Jul 20 15:46:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it'll end up being Season 7. Possibly the end of Season 6 before Hilltop is introduced.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,GamingTatertot,5,Mon Jul 20 12:47:53 2015 UTC,Hilltop will be introduced early into 6B...calling it now.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,GamingTatertot,3,Mon Jul 20 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"Ready for some wild, entirely spontaneous and based on no real facts, speculation? If I was thinking about where season 6 was going to head (and mind you, we haven't seen even the first episode of this season yet), I'd say that the show would want to avoid a repeat of the way season 5 ended with Rick killing a man. The end of issue 96 (shortly after the group makes it to the Hilltop) of course includes Rick killing someone in cold blood to the shock of most of the Hilltop residents. Now, if the writers wanted to include the Hilltop and not have it end in the same way season 5 did, they could probably go a little further down the line than that and introduce the ""spoken of but not seen"" threat of the Saviors. I know people have been shouting ""Negan! Negan! We want Negan!"" for a while now, but I get the impression he won't really appear until a while into season 7. But seeing as people are speculating about Dwight showing up in the end of the Season 6 trailer, I think the writers could very well speed things up here and get us to the idea of Negan by the last episode this season. Or the other option is that the writers conjure up another ""Slabtown"" story to fill up space the first half and then keep the Wolves around till the very end. I wouldn't vote for that option, but it's a possibility."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,dementiapatient567,2,Mon Jul 20 14:02:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm betting that the last episode ends with a certain sports equipment item. It's obvious Hilltop will be in 6B and in the comics, it's only a few issues between the intro to Hilltop and that sports equipment item. And I don't think anything needs speeding up at all. I think it's going to be moving at the perfect pace so we get the sports equipment item in the very last scene of the very last episode of season 6."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,btsierra,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:02 2015 UTC,"Lucille's big date would be the absolute best way to end a season. You don't want that sort event as the episode 3 of season 7. I think S6 will definitely be what I think is the most brutal character death.  It's really between that and the one in the lastest issue, imo."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,dementiapatient567,3,Mon Jul 20 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"I hadn't kept up with the comics because I knew what was coming with 100 and liked to think that if I didn't read it, it didn't happen. I ended up binging from No Way Out through current this week. The latest issue is a hell of a place to catch up to. I'll have that in my head until the next one."
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,btsierra,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:26 2015 UTC,I binge read the entire series in a week or two.  Something to Fear and All Out War are so damn good. You're in for such a treat.

thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Khaeven04,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:54 2015 UTC,The span between Aaron's arrival to the end of ep16 was ten issues. So if we get the Hilltop around the same time in s6 as we got Aaron is s5 then that would land us just slightly past issue 100.
thewalkingdead,3dxrb6,Vrixc,4,Mon Jul 20 15:25:24 2015 UTC,It could be a good way to open season 7 as well. Sets the whole tone just like season five with Terminus.

With No Way Out on the horizon, and the Saviors followed by All Out War not feasibly happening for a loooooong time, and then who you're referring too after even THAT, we are talking about foreshadowing that would be a good 3 maybe 4 seasons in advance. Highly unlikely when you look at it that way. I've thought for some time that his line about people wearing faces of dead people was probably what inspired the soft spoken ones to be begin with. Not unheard of for TV to inspire a comic. That's how we got Harley Quinn after all."

Between these figures and my Star Wars figures, I enjoy being able to futz with them and appreciate the detail, articulation, accessories, and pose-ability. That's basically the whole point of the hobby for me.  That varies depending on the collector though. It sounds like you're kind of itching to open a few. Especially if you don't intend on re-selling them, I'd say go for it. Life is too short!  A note on the ""rise in value"" you mentioned: yeah, Season 1&2 figures go for huge prices, but keep in mind this was just as the show was gaining popularity. McFarlane had not yet put a lot of stock into this line. Since then, the figures have been produced in much larger quantities and probably won't command higher values, even with the brand's growing popularity. It goes with the whole idea of ""things produced as collectibles aren't really collectible"".  Ultimately it comes down to your preferences though."

I also don't really see a rise in value for any further series except series 3 which has a bit of grown value, but all the other series' are still at the same price and even still available in the McFarlane store, so I don't think they'll go for much anytime. However, I think the 7.5 Daryl and Rick MIGHT rise in value, but I am not so sure about it. I think I'll open up a few more too, but I am also a bit worried about the additional stuff in those packages that the figure won't be able to use. How do you handle that?"

thewalkingdead,3dzblq,boscherville,6,Mon Jul 20 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"The show is guaranteed to end years before the comic does, so does it really matter how fast they're going?"
thewalkingdead,3dzblq,SimplyMe94,4,Mon Jul 20 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"No he's not. Odds are this shows done in about 8 maybe 9 seasons tops. If All Out War isn't the finale in season 8, then they'll do a new show only story arc to wrap it up in season 9. I'm not concerned with the show overlapping he comics. If we get to issue 126 through 8 seasons, the comic will be plenty ahead by then ( issue 180ish in 2018) don't worry.   I think they need to keep the pace they're going at with the coup and ""we Find Ourselves"" stuff combined in 6A while ""a larger world"" and some of ""something to fear"" make up 6B.  This means they'll have gone through one issue of volume 13, all of 14, 15, and 16, with a small amount of 17. That's good pacing. If they end on issue 98 in Season 6, then they'll push Negan to the mid season finale of Season 7, (the first episodes would be build up and fights with Saviors) and then season 7B would be volumes leading up to the War, with Season 8 as All Out War"
thewalkingdead,3dzblq,bobsaget0013,7,Mon Jul 20 21:21:29 2015 UTC,No. They can always expand or make up new stuff for the show to slow it down. Not to mention if they needed to kill time they could just continue the show into the time skip at the end of all out war
thewalkingdead,3dzblq,Shizcake,6,Mon Jul 20 19:45:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll do the time skip in the show. They might show the evolved communities, but I think the dynamic is so different, it'd be a very different show. I think they're better off ending the show after All Out War with a quick nod to ""Things are peaceful and prosperous...But there is still danger.""  I'm totally okay with them making the show include the time jump, but I don't think it's wise. A lot of people are already getting annoyed and bored that it's more people-drama based than walker based. I don't agree with those people, but it's a pretty common complaint I've talked about with people."

thewalkingdead,3dzblq,dan0314,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:10 2015 UTC,I'd really be disappointed if they skipped the Whisperers. It's ten times better of a storyline than the lackluster All Out War.

thewalkingdead,3dzblq,RCTjunkie,3,Mon Jul 20 19:50:02 2015 UTC,Let us say there are 8 seasons before the time skip. We are currently at season 6. So we are ~2.5 real years away from the time skip. And lets say we continue to get 12 issues a year.  That is 2 volumes a year and considering we are starting a new volume next year that is about 5 or 6 volumes to come before the time skip. After the time skip we already have 3 volumes of material. So that is a possible 9 volumes of material to go through. If they are doing 2-3 volumes a television season that gives us roughly 2.5-3 seasons worth of material after the time skip also including the volumes coming out at that time. So this could also add another 2 seasons. Continuing on and on.  This is rough and not including any months with 2 issues (though Kirkman said there isn't another 2 issue month planned right now).  This also doesn't take into account the expanded material they include in the seasons.  I'd say it will be quite some time before we catch up.
thewalkingdead,3dzblq,GuyOne,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:26 2015 UTC,It will never catch up to the comic unless they skip a ton of stuff in the show

thewalkingdead,3dzblq,SnakeInABox7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:35 2015 UTC,"Your timeline for future seasons is stretching things out too far. The hilltop will absolutely be shown in the second half of season 6, probably in a similar manner as to how Alexandria was introduced last season. Also, there is less than 10 issues between the introduction of the hilltop and the introduction of Negan, which makes it a possibility that Negan is shown in the finale, if the hilltop is shown early enough in the second half, although it'll probably be pushed to the beginning of next season."

thewalkingdead,3e103p,NotEvenJail,9,Tue Jul 21 03:08:33 2015 UTC,If he didn't think breaking bad was good there's no hope he will make it.
thewalkingdead,3e103p,JonSchwarz23,4,Tue Jul 21 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. I have TWD memorized but was unable to get into Breaking Bad. While watching Walt's decent into madness/greatness was appealing to me, the whole minutia with the family just turned me off."
thewalkingdead,3e103p,MaestroLogical,2,Tue Jul 21 06:03:21 2015 UTC,"yeah breaking bad had way more dull parts in all 5 seasons than in season 2 of TWD alone! I liked breaking bad but it was a struggle to get through the whole series. once it was over I never watched it again.. I'd say he should watch season 2 but binge watch it so he can knock it out quickly and also season 2 seems to flow a lot better when watching 2 to 3 episodes at a time. I'd say before hershel's farm was fun to watch. also once the episode ""Nebraska"" hits the season gets pretty exciting all the way up to the finale"
thewalkingdead,3e103p,tommy4991,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:31 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Binge watching season 2 makes it much better pacing wise. We have this lingering feeling that season 2 was lackluster because it had us hanging on the edge of our seats waiting for more. When you can watch multiple episodes back to back though, the whole season flows much more smoothly."
thewalkingdead,3e103p,MaestroLogical,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:32:15 2015 UTC,"Same here.  Im on my 3rd viewing of the TWD series.   Don't think I'll ever watch BB again.  Saw it once and that was enough.  The family drama was cringe worthy and Jesse was an annoying little bitch.  Walt is the f'n man, though."

I almost think he decided to not like Breaking Bad, you know, just because it was so popular.  He hadn't really heard of the walking dead much, besides me and the wife, so he may not have the same ""too cool"" approach."
thewalkingdead,3e103p,bombard27,-5,Tue Jul 21 03:23:28 2015 UTC,Why would you watch a series and skip episodes? If this guy can't make it through all of season 2 then he can go back to watching whatever he usually watches. No need to force it on someone so close minded.
thewalkingdead,3e103p,leoooooooooooo,4,Tue Jul 21 03:21:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the series and I barely made it through season 2, and I've watched from the beginning.  I think it's fine to get the highlights from that season and then move on, it wasn't very good (IMO).  I don't know you or your life situation, but not everyone has the time to sit through it.  And I love the show, I would absolutely enjoy it if he could get into it and we could talk about it, because it has gotten so much better over the seasons."
thewalkingdead,3e103p,Ivan_Soloz,3,Tue Jul 21 03:34:08 2015 UTC,Sooooo you have time to watch 54 (season 1 & 3-5) episodes of the walking dead but your life situation doesnt allow you enough time to watch 13 full episodes of season 2 because it wasnt interesting enough for you???
thewalkingdead,3e103p,irburns,2,Tue Jul 21 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend skipping any episodes. It doesn't matter how slow it was, he would be missing parts of the story. If he starts to not like it just keep telling him how much better the show gets from there."
thewalkingdead,3e103p,TACnyc,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:03 2015 UTC,"If he is watching on Netflix, it may be easier to watch slower seasons since you don't have to wait a week in between the ""dull"" episodes. I am currently at the beginning of season 5 and haven't watched an episode that I didn't like one way or another. People told me to skip a few episodes here and there, I am glad I didn't. Love the show."
thewalkingdead,3e103p,6h057,0,Tue Jul 21 14:10:48 2015 UTC,Season 2 is pretty damn good. Not everything needs to be fast-moving plot or zombie killing action.
thewalkingdead,3dyela,RedWhiteStripes,5,Mon Jul 20 15:30:26 2015 UTC,So is Jesus and the original Alexandria leaders related or did Kirkman just give them the same last names because he wanted to confuse me?
thewalkingdead,3dyela,Obamasmanpurse,3,Mon Jul 20 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"Not related, wish I had a source on that and this  but I'm pretty sure Kirkman has made a comment on characters with the same first/last names saying that it's unrealistic to NEVER encounter another human with the same name as you. So that's why it has happened before."
thewalkingdead,3dyela,GoodSpaceFellow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah and RK said in the Letter Hacks of Issue 123 that the only reason why his last name is also ""Monroe"" is because that is actually a common surname in the D.C area."
thewalkingdead,3dyela,dan0314,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"Not related. I know Kirkman says it's unrealistic for characters to never have the same name, this could be just a case of that."

Pisses me off (unreasonably, I know) that some people have full names but other people don't. And sometimes he seems to go to great, stupid lengths to avoid telling us them. Like, when Rick first meets Douglas, he introduces himself with his full name. Andrea's just like, ""Yeah, I'm Andrea."" Pissed me off."
thewalkingdead,3dyela,HodorsGiantDick,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"It would be helpful and smart to tell their full names. But I feel like Rick is the type of person who would be gentlemanly like (there's another word I am looking for here) and introduce himself by his full name rather where Andrea is... well, Andrea. Rick is a police officer/public servant, old-fashioned type of person and that doesn't change too much in the apocalypse. You know what I mean?  You follow me?"

Also if you have a large enough herd of walkers there wouldn't be any kind of settlement that would be considered safe enough.

thewalkingdead,3dzh76,seapiglet,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:42 2015 UTC,Would be pretty cool if they did a flashback in S6 and it turned out it had been the Wolves or some other group we'll see.
thewalkingdead,3dzh76,ShadowSeed,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:00 2015 UTC,It's very unlikely that the Wolves are the ones who ransacked that camp. Keep in mind that was still in Georgia and the Wolves were pillaging around the DC area.

thewalkingdead,3dum2k,amneziac1,35,Sun Jul 19 17:09:11 2015 UTC,Considering that the walking dead is based on the comics and fear the walking dead is a stand alone plot there isn't much to complain about.

thewalkingdead,3dum2k,NotSureIfFunnyOrSad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:04:56 2015 UTC,Neither. I said the S6 trailer was disheartening bc it looked like a lot of melodrama inside Alexandria about power balances without a lot of zombies happening.
thewalkingdead,3dum2k,stophauntingme,2,Mon Jul 20 09:45:26 2015 UTC,"Ok. Don't worry, theyll be a lot this season, the trailer was just focusing more on the plot for the next half season. I think for most people it gets more hype because we know there's going to be walkers already"

thewalkingdead,3dum2k,crackalac,3,Mon Jul 20 00:14:05 2015 UTC,The apocalypse is just a way to create a world for the isolated cast to struggle through. It's never really about the zombies.
thewalkingdead,3dum2k,Reptile449,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:42 2015 UTC,Spot on. They're a constant source of conflict but they aren't always the main source. From a story telling perspective they act as a catalyst for character development.

People who walk as much as they do, live as physical lives as they do and are always on the move without adequate food amd water like they are, would be walking sticks. Tjeu would all be vwry lean and thin. It wouldn't be realistic though to have each character lose weight and be bone thin for the long amount of time the character is on the show nor would it bring viewers in to see people with extraordinarily gross teeth and other hygiene issues. Humans, in general, look to appearance first before anything else when forming their initial impressiins of a person. Many viewers are fans of individual actors and their looks.  So they gloss over things like that to make it more practical for the actors and more appealing to the fans. They do try and dirty them up as much as possible though without going overboard into the icky hygiene realm. No one wants to think of Lauren Cohen with shit stained underwear tjlhat looks like the Daytona 500 was raced there nor do they want to see fur on her teeth that could be made into a winter jacket ."

thewalkingdead,3duoi1,Hibria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"But then again in a zombie apocalypse how common is subsonic ammo?   Fairly common. Every .45 ACP is subsonic, so they find one .45 suppressor and they're good to go. There's also a lot of 9mm and .22 subsonics around, although you wouldn't know unless its still in the box"
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,Captinfucker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Hollywood silencers are very quite. Just of those cases where viewers wouldn't accept realism (sort of like they need that sching sound when people draw swords from scabbards)."
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,Nukemarine,6,Mon Jul 20 07:45:32 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all. A decent suppressor with subsonic ammo can be silly quiet. The loudest thing in such a setup is the slide, which can be about as loud as stepping on a particularly noisy branch or leaves.   Here's a video of an average .22 wet suppressor.  http://youtu.be/2uEy8eV1tAQ  Go to 1:00 to see the suppressed subsonic ammo.   Can't find a suppressor? No problem."
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,HankSpank,5,Sun Jul 19 21:30:13 2015 UTC,.22 is crazy quiet even without subsonic ammo. If you are shooting 9mm cans its not going to be as quiet. Plus where are you going to find subsonic ammo in the ZA. You are going to use any ammo you can possibly find. Also they are probably not using the correct supressors for their guns.
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,Hibria,0,Sun Jul 19 21:46:15 2015 UTC,"I dont need to lol, I shoot with supressors all the time. My buddy has so many stamped items its not even funny."
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,Hibria,4,Sun Jul 19 21:58:02 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, guns are a last resort.  Adding one more thing to go wrong and maintain probably isn't worth taking some sound away.  The difference in sound might be enough to not draw in walkers from a few hundred yards away, but anyone in the nearby area will hear a silenced shot too."

thewalkingdead,3duoi1,magomez96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"they aren't that maintenance intensive if you're only putting a couple rounds through it per week.  If you use it sparingly, only at opportune moments, it should last a while before maintenance is actually needed  its still a great tool to have, able to make shooting in confined places tolerable (without ear pro) and aids in concealing you're firing position from the real threat: people.  Muffling the sound signature and flash reduces the chances of being spotted and taking return fire"
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,fuzzycaterpillar123,5,Sun Jul 19 20:29:22 2015 UTC,"No. So many misconceptions.  GA only needs the standard NFA tax stamp. There is no such thing as a 'class 3 license'.  Subsonic ammo is all around you. ALL 230 grain .45 ammo not marked '+P' is subsonic from a handgun. All 147 grain 9mm. All 'standard velocity' .22, from a pistol.  Suppressors are used on rifles with standard ammo to great effect. In fact, it's a military sniper tactic, as the 'sonic crack' will make the shot appear to have been fired from a different spot.  Police use of suppressors is fairly common. It's a safety tool, as much as earplugs are. They are also handy to prevent flash explosions in environments like a meth lab, as they eliminate muzzle flash. You'll see them in service with SWAT and similar units. They're not seen on the end of Officer Friendly's .38.  /Army weapons instructor, 18 years"

Give me a semi auto .22 with a supressor for range ( you have to place head shots and zombies are squishy), a nice melee weapon like a machete (with a red handle) and a 9mm pistol for backup.  An Ar15 platform would also be an excellent choice for dealing with other survivors."
thewalkingdead,3duoi1,nofork77,2,Sun Jul 19 19:11:13 2015 UTC,Why would they use a supressor? A supressor reduces the noise but it's still a little loud. They should just do it the old fashioned way. Use a melee weapon.

When the Woodbury people were shooting inside the ""tombs"" at walkers (that's the scene I believe you're talking about) they could very easily have hurt their ears but would it really be necessary to show them cringing or something due to the loud noise? The gunshots at Grady everyone was in shock so again did they need to show something? How could it affect what occurred? Plus I rewatched that scene and it seems like the gunshots were very loud. Did they need to yell, ""WHAT?!"" Back and forth while? I'm not trying to sound like an asshole, its just that you brought up an issue and I don't think it's an actual issue at all."

thewalkingdead,3dvqgw,uqor,3,Sun Jul 19 22:50:27 2015 UTC,if ;)  I'd imagine the entirely of AOW would last a single season. I just recently read it again and I couldn't imagine the whole thing spread out through more than a single season. Maybe introduction with a season finale (for example season 7 finale) then season 8 would be AOW part 1 and 2.
thewalkingdead,3dvqgw,GuyOne,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:21 2015 UTC,The majority of the saviors arc happens before AOW. Too much relevant stuff to skip
thewalkingdead,3dvqgw,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, Negan is introduced in volume 18  Something to Fear and it concludes in volume 21 All Out War pt 2 but television trends are usually always one villain per season. This is on traditional shows though. Understandably it changes. TWD had the Governor come back for a few episodes which was fantastic because it was against that grain.  I'd love to see Negan in a number of seasons and that is very possible if it follows the comics with the time jump. We just have to wait and see if they go through with all the material and if the show stays high in popularity and is renewed again and again.  It will be a number of intense seasons with some really brutal scenes coming up that easily out do anything done in the previous seasons. The most recent scenes (for example Noah's death) have been very graphic and I feel the creative team is pushing the envelope so they can show us on screen their rendition of Negan and his actions."
thewalkingdead,3dvqgw,GuyOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:24 2015 UTC,He's introduced in volume 17 actually. Villains can last more than one season it happens all the time. There is also the fact that his role in the story isn't done even now. There is just too much pre AOW material that needs to be covered for AOW to work. They can change it but they have to do something.   I agree some good seasons are coming up
thewalkingdead,3dvqgw,Try_Another_Please,3,Mon Jul 20 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry. Got my numbers mixed up.  That includes one more volume then. Something to Fear, What Comes Next, March To War, AOW 1 and 2. There are so many arcs that include Negan that he has to be in at least 2 or 3 seasons.  The next question is regarding those who do not want to be spoiled by the comics. Would they be able to sit through season after season of Negan? I found the governor to be very interesting in both the comics and show (though not as much) and I know fans of the show that didn't like him coming back in season 4.  If they stay true to the source material Negan will be great to watch on screen for as many seasons as it takes to tell that portion of the story."
thewalkingdead,3dvqgw,GuyOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:12 2015 UTC,it all depends on how the writers adapt him on the show.

She really has no point whatsoever, she's not even in the season six promo, and doesn't hold any purpose. I think it was bullshit that they brought her back and didn't leave her dead at the prison. Rick and Carl went through loss and development as characters, only for them to bring her back, making that development pointless; which is also why I hate the theory of Beth coming back.   Judith needs to go, with a hand full of other characters during the fall of the walls. We have too many in our group to begin with, it's time to cut off some dead weight, and Judith is most definitely dead weight.

Big moments include *Reginald (leader of alexandria but opposite to show) being killed *Jessie and Ron dying *Carl being shot in the eye *Deaths of other characters including Morgan, Tobin.

thewalkingdead,3dtlon,Muggadeedee,7,Mon Jul 20 04:12:20 2015 UTC,No Way Out really is in my top story arcs for the series. I remember being on edge for Glenn every time he was on panel after his discussion about him not seeing a way he survives it. I'd say it's definitely in my top 3 arcs right between the prison battle and Fear The Hunters.
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,chgbfm,4,Sun Jul 19 15:10:23 2015 UTC,I completely agree that No Way Out is the best story line. I've read it over and over...it's just too good.
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,GamingTatertot,2,Sun Jul 19 14:13:10 2015 UTC,I hope Tobin goes out a hero on the show.

thewalkingdead,3dtlon,Obamasmanpurse,3,Sun Jul 19 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"For a long time in the show, the biggest threat really has been other humans, to the point where  walkers are kind of just background scenery. In ""No Way Out"" the walkers become a serious threat again through sheer force of numbers. Even if Rick kills 100, Daryl kills 100, Michonne, Glenn, etc, there will be more walkers to deal with. And the walkers surround Alexandria (""No Way Out"")."
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,firetaucayenne,6,Sun Jul 19 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"Here's how it i going to go down in the show:   The ""wolves"" attack and get slaughtered very easily.  The gunfire draws a herd that surrounds Alexandria. The herd eventually breaks in and people hide in their homes. Morgan dies. Ron gets grabbed by zombies and Jessie won't let go of him. She is also holding onto Carl, who can't get away from her. Rick cuts her arm off and she gets devoured. Deanna gets swarmed and she fires a wild shot which hits Carl in the head, blowing out his eye socket."
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,TheEld,10,Sun Jul 19 16:27:36 2015 UTC,I don't think Morgan is going to die yet since they just gave Tyreese Comic-Morgan's death essentially.
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,lifeofwill,-4,Sun Jul 19 12:45:30 2015 UTC,Tyresse got Donna's death.
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,TheEld,8,Sun Jul 19 13:22:51 2015 UTC,"Mix of both. He died in a similar place to Donna but his death was essentially like Comic-Morgan's (bit on the arm, hallucinated, arm chopped off, too late to chop off the arm though so he died)"
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,GamingTatertot,4,Sun Jul 19 13:26:14 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt Morgan will be killed. Fans have been wanting him back in the show as a mainstay forever. He will be around for a while I'd like to think.
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,EDoftheDEAD,5,Sun Jul 19 14:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think they might kill him because they've always had trouble keeping him on the show, but I don't think it's going to be the same way as the comic. Not necessarily saying Negan, but probably something else that could be big enough."
thewalkingdead,3dtlon,Girafarigging,2,Sun Jul 19 14:28:02 2015 UTC,I think they might keep Morgan around to take the place of Glenn for when Negan  comes into play.

From the comic con trailer it showed a shot of Enid all dirty and walking up to the Alexandria doors.  I think that is a flash back, and whenever the show focuses on a secondary character it results in their death."

I read 50 or 60 chapters and stopped because I just couldn't stand the art anymore, and I didn't really care much what happened to the characters, in comparison to the show.  And some people just don't really care much about spoilers. Especially vague comic ones that may or may not even happen in the show.  Not to seem contrary or anything, just my feelings on it."

So while I can understand not wanting to read the comics, it's hard for me to respect a person who either doesn't know how to use google or finds reading that full synopsis to be too much work.

If the show does the Whisperers, it's not too ridiculous for them to wear fairly new skins to clean and wear. New people are dying all the time, as gross and awesome it would be to wear one of the years old skins, the Whisperers are probably always on the lookout for new skins to wear."
thewalkingdead,3dpt6p,YogurtPuddles,10,Sat Jul 18 07:38:14 2015 UTC,"Do you think the show would have the Whisperers kill the living just for new skins, or only look for fresh walkers?

thewalkingdead,3dpt6p,Oirammario12345,3,Sat Jul 18 08:38:53 2015 UTC,Yeah it could be a possibility. Would also make those characters a little more badass and scary.

thewalkingdead,3dpt6p,VirulentViper,5,Sat Jul 18 21:53:50 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - since the show likes to keep the biggest arcs from the comic fresh and different, I'm sure the Whisperers will be in the show but they'll probably be done a little bit differently    The thing about The Walking Dead - both the comic and the show - is that it's always looking for new ways to reinvent itself so it stays interesting and fresh. Sure for a while it followed the same formula but they realize that and that's why they're trying to reinvent it now. To some extent, the show isn't exactly ""reinventing"" itself since it follows the blueprint of the comic but it still branches off in its own direction to keep itself separate from the comic and still be its own entity. That being said, the Whisperers are such a big and interesting and innovative part of not only this ""new beginning"" but the zombie-genre in general (even though they've always been around and we're just now being introduced to them). I've never seen anything like them before in any form of entertainment that includes zombies. Not having them in the show would be like not having Negan. It'd be an injustice to the comic readers and the show and its audience in general. It's such an interesting and great storyline that really would change the show. They're the first major threat we're facing since Negan and as anybody who's caught up knows, they mean major business so I definitely think they'll be in the show but since the show likes to take things in its own direction, I don't think it'll be an exact adaption from the comic.    Whenever they reach a major arc in the show, they try to stay true to the source material with major events while keeping it fresh and doing something different at the same time so it's not too predictable. When they left the Atlanta camp in the show, they went to the CDC.. Shane had a much longer time on the show, Hershel's farm was entirely different, things at the prison were way different in the show, including the inmates, The Governor was relatively similar to comic Governor when he needed to be but they still made him his own version of the character, the marauders in Season 4 were way different than the ones in the comic, same with the cannibals in the comic and how in the show, they turned them into Terminus. Now we're at Alexandria and things are already being done differently but they're keeping all of these major points in the show, they're just doing them a little bit differently so I can't imagine the show not doing the Whisperers.. it's just a question of what they'll change.    That being said, I was discussing with other people in another thread about how they would do the Whisperers because by the time they get there, at this rate, the walkers should really just be skeletons and someone suggested that the Whisperers might just recruit and surround themselves with people that have just turned and I suggested that maybe they're the ones creating the walkers by killing people they come across and when they turn, adding them to the group. So, I'm not sure how it'll be done in the show but I personally think as great as Negan's arc was and as interested as I am to see what part he'll play in this thing with the Whisperers, I think the Whisperers are the coolest and most interesting threat the group has faced in a long time and I can't wait to see how they do it in the show."

thewalkingdead,3dogxh,ROFLBRYCE,18,Sat Jul 18 03:26:15 2015 UTC,No I like that they did this. It would make no sense for the walkers in s6 to still look fresh and new. The writers are thinking this through thoroughly.
thewalkingdead,3dogxh,zoozema0,3,Sat Jul 18 15:21:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I like it as well. There are just tons of complaints about zombies not looking fresh over time on this sub and I don't get it lol.

thewalkingdead,3dogxh,stophauntingme,8,Fri Jul 17 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"I think they will go for something different just because they've done biters before. In my head they don't call them anything simply because they haven't yet realised that they're not people anymore (at least they didn't in the trailer). They might just refer to them as ""them"" or ""those things"" or something like that."
thewalkingdead,3dogxh,vakda,12,Fri Jul 17 23:38:59 2015 UTC,"I think they will go for something different just because they've done biters before   That'd make sense. And yeah I'm more talking about once they actually start naming them as a group of zombies in FearTWD, not when they're first encountering them. ""Them"" or ""those things"" totally... but even MORE on the initial level, they'll probably be saying the person ""has <insert disease>"" or ""those people have <insert disease>.""  Ghouls is possible but I feel like it sounds too poetic. I still think of biters because it's a real life slang term used to describe people or children who tend to bite a lot. edit: so it'd seem like a natural term to use for zombies if you've never heard of zombies: they seem just like people who're very disturbed and thus likely to bite you if you attempt to help or handle them (& in the real world, the slang for that person's a 'biter')"

thewalkingdead,3dogxh,fourcornerview,6,Sat Jul 18 09:39:07 2015 UTC,It never sat well with me that walkers in large groups are called 'herds'.

There's probably something else about how people find humans who're disfigured (Frankenstein) and/or move unnaturally (zombies; the Ring too though) unsettling. Twilight Zone had a cool ep exploring that with the beautiful woman finding herself hideous in a world full of pig-faced people.

If I recall correctly, it's been a very long time since we've seen a really recently killed/turned walker - most recent walker-related deaths have been totally devoured before they turned, and everyone else gets head punched right after they die so they never turn.  I assume the new guys will be slightly faster and a lot stronger and harder to kill as well, which should be fun to see.  It takes more strength to stab a newly dead person in the skull than a partially rotted one, right?"

thewalkingdead,3dogxh,SuTvVoO,6,Sat Jul 18 04:47:07 2015 UTC,"Totally. Also it really only started in the 90s that horror became self-aware. Wes Craven really brought it to fruition first with how meta New Nightmare was but he really knocked it out of the park with Scream. From there on out everybody was really into post-modern horror where all the characters know the monsters & tropes & yet it manages to be scary anyway (or rather because it ""feels more real"" when the characters already know their own tropes it's scarier-? idk lol).  TWD & FearTWD is just going true traditional horror with the choice to have people be completely unaware the monster exists in their universe until it exists in their universe.  Edit: I read a thing about how CitW reinvented & postmodernized/meta-fied the zombie/cabin subgenre of horror just as Craven's Scream did to the slasher subgenre. Kirkman's not buyin' it though, lol, he doesn't want meta or postmodern. He's solid traditional."

Different groups end up calling them different things but it's always pretty obvious they are talking about zombies. Some other words other groups have used in the show are 'biters' and 'lame-brains', and in the comics they are even referred to as zombies a few times."

thewalkingdead,3do5ft,ShadowApples,32,Sat Jul 18 02:25:46 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to bet that the show will change it up (similar to how it was Herschel being decapitated by the Governor and not Tyreese like in the comics).

thewalkingdead,3do5ft,talontheassassin,3,Sat Jul 18 07:06:29 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this. Recently read issue 100 and immediately thought of Daryl being swapped out with Glenn. This would give a whole new perspective to Hilltop with both Glenn and Maggie there.

Don't get me wrong, love Norman Reedus and liked Daryl at first but he's become such a shit character and created the worst fan base of all time. But if they kept Daryl on to become Dwight and take over the Saviors I feel like that would be a good move and allow me to appreciate Daryl a bit more. Then again I really like Dwight."

Imagine introducing him on the show, the comic readers thinking they know what happens next and the non comic readers scared shitless. THEN, completely out of nowhere, Negan takes them both out. ""Ya know what? You too, just for good measure."" (Or something like that, I don't know.) This would simply turn the show on its head after losing those two characters, and introducing such a villain.

However, I do think that this will be the first time we've seen Carl get close to a girl and experience the feelings that come with that. We saw him and Beth give each other looks in Season 3 but it's not like they had a lot of time to get to know each other either with all that was going on between them, Woodbury and Lori passing and giving birth to Judith. Not only was Beth a little old for Carl but uh.. Hershel wasn't about to let that happen either.

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,mechchic84,15,Fri Jul 17 10:44:07 2015 UTC,Unless a plague of some sort was to come along I agree with you. In a bigger city that could be a huge problem. People not going to the hospital and also hospitals would be packed with people potentially dying in the lobbies. Think about all the bodies in tuberculosis photos. People were dying faster than they could dispose of the bodies. Of course it would take a whole for the population to build up to the point of this becoming an issue.

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,turtmcgirt,4,Fri Jul 17 08:59:31 2015 UTC,"So, If you see something, say something?  Our government is prepping us for zombies..."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rosatter,4,Fri Jul 17 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"But still, you have to worry about old/ill people dying in a crowded area at night. Unless we just start a trend of everyone sleeps alone in a locked room."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Dekar2401,8,Fri Jul 17 08:55:31 2015 UTC,I would have been doing that in the prison just as a matter of course. Keep myself safe and stuff.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,The-Irish-Potato,4,Fri Jul 17 10:07:06 2015 UTC,"I thought they were doing that in the prison? That's why they were sleeping in locked cells, right?"
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Louis_Farizee,8,Fri Jul 17 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"They weren't sleeping in locked cells, though. Except for that one guy, and they made a point of mentioning that he was a sleepwalker so he locked himself in his cell so he didn't go bumping into stuff at night. How a sleepwalker managed to survive even a few months into the outbreak I'll never know."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,falnes,4,Fri Jul 17 13:40:37 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that guy a woodbury resident? He could've been there the whole time and locked the door in his house, issue somewhat solved."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Dekar2401,3,Fri Jul 17 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"Shit, I wouldn't even want to sleep with my wife [if I had one] in case she died in her sleep."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,whitehat511,7,Fri Jul 17 17:59:45 2015 UTC,the one thing that humans are great at doing is dying   We're also really good at killing.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rosatter,4,Fri Jul 17 14:23:06 2015 UTC,But not as good as we are at dying.   Not everyone kills. Everyone dies.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,FailosoRaptor,8,Fri Jul 17 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"I think its clear that humanity is going to survive this Apocalypse. Civilization is already rebuilding and with each passing year walkers are becoming a smaller threat. Yes, there will be a some handful of walkers, but they will never cause another civilization collapse. People understand the threat and how to stop it at this point.   So lets image 40/50 years in the future. There will be organizations with a good amount of order. One of the problems I envisioned in this future is how do you live with someone if when they die they turn into a walker.   The easiest solution is that people wear a wristband that will start ringing when a person dies. Sort of like an alarm for anyone next to the recently deceased. It will also double as a early warning system that a walker is near."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rosatter,7,Fri Jul 17 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"They could cause another collapse...I don't think you can definitively say they wouldn't.   People understand how to live with the threat, not how to stop it. There's a difference.   As for the wrist band--wrist bands can malfunction. People will get comfortable and not check their bands regularly. Some people may get annoyed and take theirs off. Is it water proof? Some may forget to put it back on after showering. They could slip and die in the shower without it on. They could shower with it on and have it break.   Some people may flat out refuse to wear them.   So, it's not actually a simple solution."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Krazinsky,5,Fri Jul 17 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"Even the ""simple"" solutions demand curtailing personal freedoms in favor of public safety, and require eternal vigilance so long as no cure exists.  Curfews, quarantining the sick, walled cities (likely requiring population controls to limit expansion requirements), bedroom doors locked at night (sleep together at your own risk), morning roll calls, etc.  Expand out into the future, transportation of any kind is a substantial safety risk. A bad car crash can lead to a few walkers, a bus/train/plane crash can lead to a significant mob and secondary casualties if public safety procedures aren't in place. Hospitals and nursing homes will require detachments of armed guards at all times and be built functionally as prisons. Police officers will always be armed and ready to use deadly force at any moment.  The future of the walking dead is totalitarianism, regardless of what system of governance is designed or practiced."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rosatter,4,Fri Jul 17 17:32:06 2015 UTC,This guy gets it.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,FailosoRaptor,3,Fri Jul 17 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"I think the collapse happened because of surprise of the virus. It’s like all the sudden there are millions of dead people walking around and eating people. Holy shit it’s the end of days! Everyone RUN.   Governments failed because they did not know how to stop the dead and the people that made up the nations panicked. Order was lost and civilization collapsed. Key word here is PANIC.   In this world any government that forms will be centered on this new reality. There is no more surprise if a herd of walkers come through. Yes a town may succumb to a walker herd, but for a world to collapse by the same thing again is extremely unlikely.   Any outbreak can be contained. There will be walker units and infostructure dedicated to making sure any outbreak will be contained. It’s just a part of life now. You die and you turn into a walker. People know it, children know it, and if there is another outbreak it wouldn’t have the same panic effect the original one had. It went from OMG it’s the rapture to oo its walkers again.   I don't know about you, but I would 100% wear my wristband. Are you kidding? This isn't like brushing your teeth, it’s more like if we don't wear these things I might wake up with you eating my face. If it becomes culture then it’s no big deal. Like everyone wears pants even though it’s hot.   The real question is where did the virus even come from? It definitely isn’t like any life on earth. How did humans even become infected? And what triggered the infection to become active and spread worldwide in almost no time? It sounds suspicious. So maybe once civilization recovers there might be another “surprise”.  And surprises are what cause panic and panic is what leads to chaos."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rosatter,2,Fri Jul 17 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"I would wear mine, sure. But there ARE assholes out there who wouldn't. I imagine their thought process is ""how does wearing my wristband benefit me?""  And the answer is it doesn't. It benefits others. Assholes sometimes don't like that."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,FailosoRaptor,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:05 2015 UTC,Other people in the town would remove you until you put it on. Children who grew up wearing it wouldn't even question it.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,St_Maximus_Gato,5,Fri Jul 17 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"I never thought of that. Kinda makes survive and rebuild a futile effort, unless they come up with a cure. Damn"
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,arrow74,7,Fri Jul 17 08:44:21 2015 UTC,Can't have a cure unless we rebuild.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,skepticalDragon,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"Not really, you just need a widespread internal security mechanism. Everyone gets a room with a simple latch on the door (or something else a human can easily do but a zombie cannot). Shit how about a captcha to open your door in the morning, haha.   It will fail sometimes, but not enough to wipe out the entire population again."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Nazgren,4,Fri Jul 17 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"I would say no, as long as new humans keep becoming infected."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,druuconian,2,Fri Jul 17 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"They sort of addressed this in the comics, when they came across a few walkers that were too weak to get up.  But yeah basic logic suggests that if you don't have any muscle tissue you aren't going to be able to walk around."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,LostAshes,38,Fri Jul 17 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking! They have to become more decomposed and disgusting because they've been roaming for longer and longer. They don't have an anti-decomposing serum that they use daily, right?"
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,raybrant,78,Fri Jul 17 04:08:07 2015 UTC,They use the Neutrogena Anti Aging cream.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,throwupz,15,Fri Jul 17 04:29:07 2015 UTC,Umbrella Co skin cream? IIRC a commercial exists.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rleclair90,4,Fri Jul 17 04:40:58 2015 UTC,"It does, I remember watching it all the time when I was a wee Resident Evil-obsessed lad."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Alienm00se,10,Fri Jul 17 05:50:59 2015 UTC,I wonder if this suggests that eventually the humans will be able to rebound. If enough of them can hunker down for a while behind walls and keep control over their dead then the walkers outside should eventually die off after a few decades.   Until the population evolves an immunity to the virus they'll have to 'take care of' their dead but otherwise theres a good chance civilization could rebuild.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Dekkaz,2,Fri Jul 17 07:25:18 2015 UTC,"I dont know, its nice they are trying. But I feel the opportunity for any sought of realistic zombies has long since passed."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,DocNoob,2,Fri Jul 17 12:43:09 2015 UTC,Also adds to the theories that they won't really be a threat as they are turning into tree moss and goo.  Only fresh outbreaks are exciting sorta why Fear the Walking Dead has been approved instead of the slow burn drama/horror
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,VirulentViper,375,Fri Jul 17 14:12:32 2015 UTC,"I love how rotted and decayed they're getting.. and then I love how totally different the walkers in Fear are looking. It really goes to show what time does to these things. Didn't Milton say that they are slowly starving but at a much slower rate than we do? I could remember that wrong but I thought he said something to that effect. I will say though, seeing walkers like this in Season 6 makes me wonder how in the world they're going to pull off The Whisperers when it happens in the show considering by Season 9, most walkers should probably be skeletons."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,IAMTHEBATMAN123,219,Fri Jul 17 03:19:13 2015 UTC,I sure hope they're not. That'd be just too spooky I probably couldn't watch the show anymore

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Girafarigging,10,Fri Jul 17 08:17:39 2015 UTC,"I don't read the comics--can someone tell me how the zombies are faring now? By now they've got to be skeletons, right?"
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rleclair90,17,Fri Jul 17 04:50:55 2015 UTC,"The comics aren't as active about the decomposition as the show is. I won't spoil much, but eventually, since the comics are much farther in the story than the show is, a LOT of time passes and they haven't really changed that much. They're honestly putting themselves in a bit of a hole by deteriorating them this fast, but they'll figure something out if they need to."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Girafarigging,16,Fri Jul 17 05:42:53 2015 UTC,"They're honestly putting themselves in a bit of a hole by deteriorating them this fast, but they'll figure something out if they need to.   Not necessarily. Not every walker going around has been one since day one of the outbreak. The guy in the OP's probably one of those long-term walkers."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Radi0ActivSquid,7,Fri Jul 17 05:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true but if it's been almost two years in the show, then it'll probably be almost another year (in their world, not our's) before the time skip happens, and then that's another three years. Based off the current scenarios in the comic, there's no way there's that many fresh people to turn and keep their composure. Either way, consistency is one of the things the Walking Dead likes to play with every now and then (not necessarily a bad thing either)."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Girafarigging,3,Fri Jul 17 06:58:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty behind on the comics. How much time has passed since the beginning?
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,tdsfp,4,Fri Jul 17 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"Well, before the time skip, about 623 days passed. Then there was a three year time skip and the current issue is on day 1456. Here's a link from the wikia: http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/Comic_Timeline"
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Raystacksem,2,Fri Jul 17 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"The current arc began with a massive time skip of 3 years. Some things change, but walkers....they really haven't changed much.  Kind of just look like indistinguishable ghouls at this point."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,DushTheGorger,4,Fri Jul 17 13:44:20 2015 UTC,Has it ever occurred to you that the show doesn't need to worry about deteriorating zombies too quickly? There is no way they could film enough seasons to justify zombies dying off because of deterioration?  I think there is way too much story from  comics that needs can be shown through film.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Girafarigging,3,Fri Jul 17 06:21:36 2015 UTC,"A little late, but I remember in one issue Heath found a really messed up walker and called Abraham over to see. It's kind of like they wanted to show that the walkers were decomposing from all this time, but then did away with it."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,PastorWhiskey,3,Fri Jul 17 11:17:23 2015 UTC,"Hm well no offense to the comic, but it's not exactly free from inconsistency either. That being said, cool! I should probably go back and check that out."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,thatsnotatoaster,8,Fri Jul 17 15:49:07 2015 UTC,No but they're close. Comics are about +/-7 years in by now and they're very decayed but not skeletons. I think at one point Eugene had a theory that the more they eat the slower they decay but I can't remember exactly when he said it. In the comics btw not show
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rosatter,9,Fri Jul 17 05:45:03 2015 UTC,Anyone else find it weird that the walkers are really decomposed... and yet their clothes are relatively in tact?

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,ScienceShawn,9,Fri Jul 17 04:13:51 2015 UTC,Max Brooks Zombie Survival Guide discusses this. Basically a worldwide zombie outbreak would last around 5 years before the zombies literally fall to pieces from decomposition. It would go faster in hot wet environments as well.   Not saying the show is following his books or anything but there needs to be an end game at some point...
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,swiftwings88,11,Fri Jul 17 06:18:21 2015 UTC,They'd also decay pretty quickly in northern climates. Over winter they'd freeze and then thaw in spring (and possibly multiple times over the winter depending on the weather) and be really really mushy. When water freezes it expands and bursts cells open. Give it a couple freezes and thawings and you've got big piles of mush where the zombies were.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,GuyOne,7,Fri Jul 17 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"Also true. It's also likely that, while even holding together at this point, any attempted exertion would rip their own limbs off."

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,monsterlynn,3,Fri Jul 17 09:25:07 2015 UTC,"Not ALL of them should be so decomposed though. Logically, there should be a shit ton of zombies from the initial outbreak, that have decomposed to this factor over a period of the last couple of years (show time)... but there has got to be thousands of survivors of the outbreak who have been turned at various times, and shouldn't be decomposed at all (or very little).  Think about this... if it takes two years of a corpse walking around to decompose to a point where he looks like  OP's pic... then someone who was just turned recently, should theoretically look pretty much still human (live).   Case in point: Zombie Merle... I don't think that someone who just was killed and returned minutes earlier should look so... zombified."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,DoctorDeath,2,Fri Jul 17 12:55:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's only been a few months since the prison, right? All those Woodbury and Rick people that got killed in the firefight but not headshot would be turned by now, and pretty fresh.   In other words, any large group of survivors that got infected would provide a source of fresh walkers. Over time there'd be less and less of them, though."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,13ig13oss,2,Fri Jul 17 15:17:48 2015 UTC,"As long as there's people, there'll be walkers."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,jumped-up-pantry-boy,3,Fri Jul 17 15:25:50 2015 UTC,"It's like every season they get a prop zombie head, stick it in some acid for a few seconds, and model the rest after it."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,TattooSnob,5,Fri Jul 17 07:53:02 2015 UTC,"I am a veterinarian and see a shit ton of dogs and cats with teeth barely attached by pus-glue and calculus.  They have living tissue surrounding these teeth.  Now following that logic, why haven't the walkers lost their teeth, at least the front ones that bit everything?  I know TWD isn't a show based on logic, but there should be some sort of consistency between degeneration of various tissues in the body."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,aaronmcd16,5,Fri Jul 17 13:15:54 2015 UTC,So that's the one they spent half the zombie budget on. Keep an eye out for the majority of extras in 20min worth of makeup.

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,rleclair90,3,Fri Jul 17 12:34:23 2015 UTC,It's been like 18 months to 2 years into the outbreak.

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,salmonhelmet,2,Fri Jul 17 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"That's because it's been a long time since the apocalypse started, so they're getting really rotted. In Fear The Walking Dead they look different since it's another time."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,beckoning_cat,2,Fri Jul 17 10:25:52 2015 UTC,Shouldn't their teeth be falling out?
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,salmonhelmet,5,Fri Jul 17 10:30:37 2015 UTC,Teeth are embedded in teh skulls. Which is why you can dig up a 1000 year old skeleton and it will still have its teeth.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,TarzoEzio1,6,Fri Jul 17 12:33:34 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I just find it strange that living people that don't take care of their teeth can lose them. Walkers have pretty poor oral hygiene.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,bigdanrog,2,Fri Jul 17 13:12:31 2015 UTC,This is how I feel when I wake up.

thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,TheCastle,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:27 2015 UTC,Will they just eventually rot and keel over honestly isn't it just a game of waiting for the walkers to just rot so bad that they fall apart
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,SpudgeBoy,3,Fri Jul 17 16:22:07 2015 UTC,Common zombie lore is that the same rules of rotting dont apply to them. For some reason they rot at an extremely slow rate.
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,Callmedory,4,Fri Jul 17 17:28:53 2015 UTC,"Apparently.   This was a question I had earlier when I saw the picture. Doesn't the brain turn to goo faster than the rest of the body? And yet, stabbing the brain/shooting the brain is how we keep them from coming back."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,RicksSon_Coral,2,Sat Jul 18 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"At some point, the cadavers will rot enough that the ligaments holding the bones together will give way.    But there’ll always be some new walkers, as long as there are people left to die."
thewalkingdead,3dkyo8,ShiroHachiRoku,2,Sat Jul 18 00:41:21 2015 UTC,I just wish they would bring back some of the old walker looks. Not everyone became one at the same time.

thewalkingdead,3dpoyv,twomillcities,2,Sat Jul 18 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"The show didn't want to make the Governor this helpless little coward that only gained the courage he needed once he had a group behind him.   I think they wanted to combine both Blake brothers into one interesting character when they were making the show... the cold, callous, impulsiveness of Brian, and the size, strength, and charisma of Philip, combined into one Governor.  show Governor is nowhere near as maniacal as comic Governor."

And I'm only around 1/4 of the way through the second book, but so far it's about how the Governor and a few other characters end up in Woodbury.

thewalkingdead,3dp0co,RCTjunkie,6,Sat Jul 18 04:42:44 2015 UTC,Only a show watcher here:   I honestly don't think Lori did anything wrong. Rick was believed to be dead so she hooked up with a friend and went back to Rick when he returned. Could you really blame her? I don't know so many people dislike her (besides being annoying sometimes).
thewalkingdead,3dp0co,SEAN771177,5,Sat Jul 18 04:47:54 2015 UTC,She made Shane go crazy by just shutting him out and telling him that he does not belong. It could have worked and we could have had two badasses but no Lori and her fucking hormones
thewalkingdead,3dp0co,pedro432,5,Sat Jul 18 04:51:40 2015 UTC,"he lied to her and even said to her ""if you knew Rick was alive for one second would you leave his side?"" He admitted he lured her out to ""save"" her and her boy... you even see in the flash back when he visits Carl's school to break the bad news. His face when he thought carl was going to go over to him but instead just stayed with his mom and hugged her instead. He got a bit of jealousy in his eyes wishing that was his family... Shane was selfish and Lori quickly saw that when Rick showed up. Shane was just putting on a hero act for Lori, like ""I saved you, now you owe me"" just like how dale was kind of selfish to ""save"" Andrea. He was only thinking of his needs, not hers. Because she lived she died way worse off... but yeah I wouldn't be so quick to blame and put hate on Lori."
thewalkingdead,3dp0co,tommy4991,2,Sat Jul 18 08:21:01 2015 UTC,Well it was part Loris fault since she could have forgiven the guy side they live in a world with no laws and people go crazy.
thewalkingdead,3dp0co,pedro432,6,Sat Jul 18 09:15:25 2015 UTC,"she tried to forgive him, then he kept going on about how they were meant to be together and that if he could switch places with Rick, he would in a heartbeat.

The thing is Lori Rick and Shane never talked it out and I believe that is because Lori wanted to keep it a secret for as long as possible. By the time she told Rick, Shane was to far gone."
thewalkingdead,3dp0co,pedro432,2,Sat Jul 18 09:44:45 2015 UTC,"shane could've fessed up to Rick from the get-go. But of course he's not gonna be like, ""Oh Hey man by the way I told your wife you died, and fucked her.  Just like Lori wasn't gonna tell rick right after his long journey to find her "" Hey boo, Shane told me you died. I got sad and He fucked me..""  No one is at fault there Shane Nor Lori... Where things get bad is Shane wont let go. Rick gives him countless chances, Why because that is his High school Buddy!! Face it, Shane snapped as soon as he saw Rick. He knew it was all over. Shane took the situation to where it went not Lori. Shane's anger & Jealousy took over his good intentions. I like Shane, I like Lori They both were wrong for doing the yippy. Shane Obsessed over it way too much... Lori admitted and told the truth to Rick. Shane never fessed up to Rick. To sum it up every one is only human, and in dire situations act purely on instinct."

thewalkingdead,3dmmbs,Robert237,2,Fri Jul 17 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking. AMC has bulked up its summer lineup with Humans, which gives me slight deja vu of TWD, and Humans has been great so far in tiding me over until FTWD and then TWD itself.  I feel like FTWD will eventually just run right alongside Humans on AMC and solidify their summer lineup until their big gun in TWD hits in the Fall and Saul in the Spring."
thewalkingdead,3dmmbs,smackythefrog,2,Sun Jul 19 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"It would definitely start sooner, for sure. The Walking Dead has always had an October premiere and the reason it's premiered earlier in the last few years than it has prior, is because of the episode order. That being said, The Walking Dead will never leave October as its premiere date. It's just too fitting. So, when Fear gets a bigger episode order, it'll start sooner. I don't know what they're doing for Season 2 but I'm guessing it'll probably be 13 episodes like Season 2 of The Walking Dead was but time will tell."

I'm a fan and I'll watch every episode even if it jumps 20 Fonzes, but speaking subjectively, it's not a ""GREAT"" TV show. It has drawn out filler dialog/drama, eyeroll inducing overacting, and the best part of the initial story (zombies) has just become a patronizing jump scare tactic sprinkled in periodically. Day time soap opera with zombies as side dishes. Mic drop."

The others were VERY hit or miss or downright bad. And the ones that were a hit still weren't that great. I'd say season 4 was pretty good, season 3 was meh season 2 was...bad. Season 1 was...bad. Episode 1 of season 1 was great and showed exactly how good the show can be if they follow the comics which they are now doing and look at the quality rise as soon as they start following the comics. The Governor arc was VERY hit or miss again. Their treatment of certain characters like Andrea and Carl (early on) was horrible. For awhile the only good characters were Rick and Daryl. Shane was ok. That arc also went on really long. Shane dies in issue 2 iirc of the comics lol.  The farm in season 2...I mean the farm lasted 1 or 2 issues iirc like the Shane thing.   In short, the show has 1 very good season and 4 other very hit or miss, sometimes downright bad seasons/episodes. And people wanna complain TWD isn't being nominated for an emmy...fucking Hannibal isn't."

thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,caroline_reynolds,2,Fri Jul 17 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"Everything is a matter of opinion of course, since some performances are just going to connect with people more than others.   I think Andy is really exceptional as Rick. I wouldn't want anyone else in the part, and he's made Rick his own. But I also think there are other great actors who could have taken the character and done a good job. If anyone else had been cast as Carol, that character would have been killed off years ago. Carol was slated to die in ""Killer Within"", and the writers and producers gave her a chance to defend why her character deserved to live. And she gave them this whole speech about Carol's back story and the life she used to live and who she could grow to become. And now she's getting these really interesting and dynamic storylines and nailing them. Melissa hasn't been a working actor in years; she was a casting director before TWD. She stumbled onto this guest star role ended up staying with Carol because the character means a lot to her, and she puts so much of herself into the performance. Carol only continues to exist because of Melissa's performance, which is what makes it the most ""outstanding"" to me.  Also realistically speaking, even though Andy's performance is plenty deserving and I would love to see him nominated, since TWD is an ensemble show, it lends itself more to recognizing supporting roles. It's hard to nominate the lead actor of an ensemble who doesn't even appear in some of the episodes over someone like Bryan Cranston or Liev Schreiber, where their shows literally could not exist without them. Rick Grimes is the star of TWD without a doubt, but even he has said in interviews that the show could go on without him. It could go on without any of the current cast members, which makes it harder to recognize ""leads""."

thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,orboth,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"Its apples and oranges though. Silicon Valley is a comedy series not competing against TWD. Drama was stacked this year as always. Lots of really good shows. Comedy was less stacked. It sucks, but it makes no sense comparing the two. That would be like getting mad that South Park got nominations in animated series and TWD didn't get nominated in Drama."
thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,dirtcheapstartup,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"I'm comparing quality content to other quality content.  Of course the scope is different but I don't think the landscape of comedy shows is that far off from that of drama.  Both have other shows deserving.  The American's was not nominated, and again, that show, has been putting out great content.  I understand the difference you're pointing to, but I just think it's minimal."
thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,orboth,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Once again, lots of shows put out great content. As for nominations, you live or die by the category you are submitted under. For example, American Horror Story got 14 nominations this year for arguably its weakest season yet, and that's mainly because its submitted in the much weaker miniseries category. Orange is the New Black was moved from comedy to the drama category for season 2 and got a lot less nominations this year than they did last year because the field is a lot tougher on the drama side. The landscape is pretty different in the different categories. They have the categories for a reson; shows like P&R and Unbreakable Kimmy Shmidt are very different than shows like Mad Men or TWD. The difference isn't as minimal as you are implying."
thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,dirtcheapstartup,2,Fri Jul 17 18:41:01 2015 UTC,"I've had it with your logic.  Allow me to live inside my ignorance hole and continue to bemoan the Emmy's for passing on the most popular show on television, in the last decade.

thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,xxtruthxx,3,Fri Jul 17 18:55:44 2015 UTC,That's surprising. Silicon Valley Season 2 was a complete failure. I wouldn't be surprised if it's cancelled.

There are so many good shows, great writing and wonderful acting performances that I'm not surprised that it didn't get nominated for anything. Now for makeup design, yeah but I think that's in the technical categories Emmys."
thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,mistermartian,3,Sun Jul 19 08:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think the reason we don't see acknowledgement from these kinds of awards shows because there's a glaring consistency in the type of acting that comes from this show. It's really a circle of emotions that the characters go through over and over.  I think once we get into the Hilltop era with Negan, we'll have more challenging dialogue between some characters that (if executed well enough) will warrant attention from the Emmys... but just being sad, scared and exhausted all season long doesn't really show an actors range of ability."
thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,TsarNab,2,Fri Jul 17 02:04:30 2015 UTC,"That's assuming the writers can pull off that ""challenging"" dialogue. My assumption is that they will not, unless they invest in some actually good writers, but let's be honest, this is AMC, they're not expending any more money than absolutely necessary."

I guess it's just because a show like Homeland is on a premium network and is about today's actual political climate.

thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,Eyositer,2,Fri Jul 17 00:09:23 2015 UTC,I enjoy both shows as well but I think it could be said that TWD completed perhaps it's best season while GoT turned in arguably it's worst.
thewalkingdead,3dj1j3,monsterlynn,3,Fri Jul 17 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"I think GOT was slipping this last season writing-wise, while TWD got better.   And the sets I think for TWD are a bit trickier to pull off, though they probably involve less money, because it's a familiar world that has to be believably left to go to shit, where with GOT, while the sets are amazing, it's a world no one has ever actually seen or lived in. Maybe that's more of an art direction type thing, but the way they handle the post-apocalyptic landscape in TWD has always been something I've appreciated very much from the show -- the pains taken to ensure things are properly overgrown, unmaintained looking, rotted from weathering, etc."

Using only facial expressions, he portrayed fear and panic so convincingly that scene kept me on the edge of my seat. I think conveying strong emotion with no words takes talent.   Also agree with yellina. He's very good at getting that crazy light in his eyes that's quite chilling."
thewalkingdead,3dik4u,yellina,178,Thu Jul 16 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"""Me? You mean me?""- that scene made me physically uncomfortable, between the manic look in his eyes and his disbelieving smile.

thewalkingdead,3dik4u,darthstupidious,22,Thu Jul 16 17:44:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's happened because Rick has just become such an interesting character.   Rick from seasons 1-3 was pretty ho-hum, constantly trying to do the good ol' boy act and do the right thing for everyone. It was only when Lori died that he broke down and began to show real human emotion. Following the aftermath of season 4a, he's become such a more well-rounded character: he's a guy that's had to do such barbaric, inhumane things for the sake of his family, and he's desperately trying to hold onto the guy he used to be, but things keep happening that push him further and further away.   It's pretty awesome. I remember the biggest complaint about Rick in seasons 1-3 was that he was the most boring leading man on TV. Now, I don't think anyone is saying that. Dude can swing between ol' Rick Grimes and a heartless murderer in a second."
thewalkingdead,3dik4u,rangda,4,Thu Jul 16 20:23:55 2015 UTC,Is that a nice way of saying that Rick's crazy now so Lincoln can act as crazy as he wants?

thewalkingdead,3dik4u,GamingTatertot,3,Sat Jul 18 19:52:12 2015 UTC,Andrew Lincoln gets my vote. Melissa McBride is 2nd.

Andrew Lincoln is hands-down one of the best actors and most invested actors I've ever seen. So, since you started in Season 3, I'm going to post scenes from episodes from Seasons 4 and 5. Some of these are personal favorites of mine and I don't mean just Rick scenes but.. all-time favorite scenes of the series:    04x08 - Too Far Gone (portion of the speech before the battle) 04x16 - A (vs. Joe's group, especially the way he says ""he's mine"") 05x01 - No Sanctuary (Terminus trough scene) 05x03 - Four Walls and A Roof (RIP Gareth & also, the head tilt at 02:01 is so Michael Myers and awesome) 05x08 - Coda (just.. everything about this scene, his body language and expressions say it all) 05x10 - Them (""We are the walking dead"") 05x15 - Try (of course his post-Pete fight speech) 05x16 - Conquer (of course you have to include this one)  I really wanted to include the scene where Rick ran over Officer Lamson but I wasn't able to find the scene in decent quality. Also, completely unrelated but re-watching these scenes, before Rick slaughters Gareth, Gareth says ""you don't know what it's like to be hungry..."" and that's obviously in the beginning of Season 5. Then, in the back half, Rick and the group literally resort to eating dogs so they can have food.. I can't believe that never stood out to me until now. OMG re-watching these makes me so excited to see what we're going to get from Rick and Morgan."

They go all crazy, and he looks from her to them just enough that you aren't sure whom he's talking to. I thought that scene was great, well acted by everyone.

thewalkingdead,3dik4u,TheLoneWander101,4,Thu Jul 16 21:08:35 2015 UTC,"Of all the problems with the Walking Dead, Andrew Lincoln's acting is far from even bring on the list. His character is really the only character who's been required to constantly be having emotional responses to things around him instead of the other characters basically taking turns and he constantly nails it.   I'm all for different opinions and that, but saying that his acting has been not good, let alone ""terrible"" is simply not true.   Based of what you posted if say he's either trolling or one of those people who thinks that ""I don't like some Thing=it's factually not good""."

The whole scene between Rick and Gareth. Wow. And then after they escape and Gareth and his crew come after Rick in Father Gabriel's church but Rick out smarts Gareth and turned the tables on him. And then Rick keeps his promise. Great stuff.
thewalkingdead,3dik4u,BmoreNiveK,5,Thu Jul 16 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"Tell him to watch ""Love Actually"" then (for a frame of reference not TWD related, obviously) - not the ""Rick"" you're accustomed to seeing; he's also much younger in this movie. Perhaps that will help him see Andrew in a different light. His archetype is going to come to fruition in this next season & then your friend can make a fair assessment on his acting prowess. I agree, there have been moments where the dialogue probably didn't do him any favors (as an actor you've got to work with what you're given), but he has a commanding presence and shit's about to get real in the fall.

His eyes are dialated as fuck I don't even know how you can do that short of taking ecstasy or acid  When he talks to the Governor in Too Far Good you can really see the fear in his eyes and hear it in his voice. I think he is an amazing actor.
thewalkingdead,3dik4u,raysweater,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, his meeting with the Governor. You could feel his tension and unease, could see his not believing, but wanting to believe what Philip was saying. I prefer his more subtle, nuanced scenes."
thewalkingdead,3dik4u,zaphriel,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:10 2015 UTC,I think the scene when he's trying to convince the governor not to kill Hershel and Michonne showcases his ability to get in touch with his emotions.   Another great scene is when he was stuck under the bed with Joe's group in the house (right after the fall of the prison.)  It was done only with a view on his face and his acting kept me on edge.   You could feel how scared he was.

thewalkingdead,3dik4u,kieranthology,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:10:40 2015 UTC,"Have you seen any of his previous work? I have seen a number of TV shows/movies with him in and I always thought he played characters who were a bit soft and pansy-like. Certainly I had never seen him play a tough guy leader.  Needless to say I was pretty surprised when I started watching this show and I was also pretty impressed.  Rick Grimes is nothing like the characters I have seen him play before. He acted just as well in the other work I have seen him in, but this was a completely different role for him to take.   As such it shows how good he is as an actor.  Show your friend some snippets of him as Edgar 'Egg' Cook in This Life (TV Series), as Mark in Love Actually (movie), and as Simon Casey in Teachers (TV Series). Then compare to his performances as Rick Grimes. I think he was good in those previous roles, but they were all sort of similar types of Characters. None of those previous roles was like Rick."

thewalkingdead,3dik4u,cowbellhero81,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"For me the problem is more his accent than anything.  It's always been really dodgy, and sticks out like a sore thumb (also on a related note, why doesn't his son have any accent at all?)    Other than that I think he's done a pretty decent job with the role and towards the end of the last season I think he really took it to another level--he was the closest to the crazed, barely-controlled awesome comic book Rick I've ever seen him."
thewalkingdead,3dik4u,druuconian,3,Thu Jul 16 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"On Carl's lack of accent, I've read that studies show kids pick up accents from their peers and their vocabulary from their parents. The southern twang may just be less prevalent with kids and Carl never inherited it.  At least, it makes sense to me cause few other characters have that heavy an accent anyway. Even unintended it still fits."

It seems weird to me that they are in the south and half of the people have flat midwestern accents."

My dad and I are kind of similar, and my sister kind of takes after my mom, without the peculiar speech pattern. I don't think that Andrew's odd accent is a flaw, as your accent can vary wildly depending on several factors, not to mention the fact that he's trying to convert an English accent to that of the generic American south."

thewalkingdead,3dkekj,kingkoons,33,Sun Jul 19 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"I think Herschel's death, to this day, remains the most powerful and gut-wrenching to me. 1) the fact that he was smiling with pride as he died, and died in front of his loved ones and community, and 2) because it was juxtaposed at the end of a stretch of episodes where he was constantly in danger of dying. It was just so unexpected. Usually when a character comes very very close to death and emerges alive at the end, I assume they're safe for a while... AKA when Carol went missing in the prison in season 3 and turned up alive, I wasn't concerned about her dying during the Governor's attack because we had already used up our ""quota"" for concern for her life, if that makes any sense. With Herschel, everyone thought he was going to die during the flu arc... When he was out of danger, I let out a big breath of relief. PHEW! Okay, he's safe for a little bit, we've spent the entire half season worried about him so now the show will make us worry about someone else now.   Nope. He's dead. Very realistic (surviving through a horrible ordeal only to immediately die after triumphing) but terrible for us."
thewalkingdead,3dkekj,goingawayparty,9,Fri Jul 17 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that his death was traumatic and they did a great job sending him off, but I don't think that it was unexpected. They gave him his moment to shine (""internment"") and then killed him off; that's a pattern they've been doing with characters before they kill them off -- they give them more screen time and more lines (i.e. Shane, Andrea, T-Dog, Lori, Tyreese, Beth, the Governor, etc)."
thewalkingdead,3dkekj,goingawayparty,5,Fri Jul 17 00:41:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'll disagree with you there. I think ""more lines"" does not equal ""prolonged sequence of danger"": Herschel ALWAYS had a very significant role, it wasn't like he was a small side character who suddenly got fleshed out for a few episodes so that his death would be more impactful (looking at you, Beth). His role did not expand significantly in season 4 to the point where that everyone knew he was going to die soon.   Plus, I don't think Shane, Andrea, T-Dog, Lori, or Tyreese all got more screen time or more lines directly before dying, either; it either remained the exact same amount of screen time (Lori, Shane, Andrea, Tyreese) or even less, in T-Dog's case.   I do think there's a pattern, however, of characters who are placed in danger for quite a while and LOOK to be about to get killed off, survive, and then are left alone for a while, which was why it was a surprise that he was killed immediately after surviving an ordeal that was sure to kill him. I'd point at Carol (season 3 disappearance) as well as season 5 (getting hit by the car), Sasha and Glenn after they got the flu and almost died, Andrea after she wanted to commit suicide, etc."
thewalkingdead,3dkekj,Callavar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah you have a point about Hershel. It's just that ""Internment"" was literally about him, so once he went out on the truck into the woods with Michonne I knew something bad was going to happen.  Haha you're right about Beth; like you said, she got her own story arch so because of this I had a strong feeling they would kill her off. But let me show you what I mean for the other characters:  The Governor had his own two episodes and was half the focus of the episode he died in. (although for comic readers the death was predictable) They basically gave the guy a music video and his own mini-series.  Andrea had most of the second half of season 3 focusing on her trying to make peace, then she died.  Shane had the last few episodes before his death focusing on him and Rick. In ""Better Angels,"" I think he has more screen time than anyone else. A lot of time is spent showing how crazy he is becoming and they really focus in on him. But again, for comic readers this death was predictable, so I might be a little biased here.  T-dog has a lot of dialogue in ""The Killer Within,"" defending the prisoners and saying they should give them a chance. That shows us more about his character than any episode before...then they kill him. I noticed how weird it was that they put him in the spotlight, then I wasn't surprised when he got bit a few minutes later.   Tyreese didn't have much character development until Season 5. Then he had all of his screen time talking to Martin, sparing him, then talking to Sasha about how he couldn't kill him. Martin and Sasha kept pointing out how weak he was and that he hasn't changed the way he's supposed to. So I had a good feeling he would be killed off soon after ""Coda.""  I was wrong in mentioning Lori, because to be honest I didn't see that coming. My theory also falls short because Carol had so much screen presence (blowing up Terminus, supply run with Daryl, stealing weapons at ASZ), I was sure she was going to die, but she didn't.  But do you see what I mean by the other characters?"
thewalkingdead,3dkekj,stophauntingme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"Other characters that male your theory ""fall short"" would be Abraham, or Sasha, or Glenn, or Eugene, or Gabriel.

thewalkingdead,3dkekj,Pumpkinpilot,2,Fri Jul 17 14:26:17 2015 UTC,"You're right about Sasha and maybe Glenn, but Eugene and Gabriel and Abraham are still too relatively new to have that much plot development. Yeah of course my theory isn't 100% ""sound""...I went out of my way to point that out. But it has worked for me in predicting the deaths of a lot of characters.

thewalkingdead,3dkekj,ShadowSeed,2,Fri Jul 17 02:43:50 2015 UTC,Ehh. I would've seen it as a massacre if they were just random people that the group had killed. At that point the termites were stupid enough to try and follow and attack Ricks group AGAIN. They got what they deserved.

thewalkingdead,3dkekj,Frusciante_Fucker,15,Mon Jul 20 23:21:21 2015 UTC,Merle's death by far. The way he single handedly killed most of the Governors soldiers and seeing him try to redeem himself was awesome. The only thing I'd change about it is having Merle deeply injure the Governor before dying. Yes he got gang stomped but Merle was a bad MF with military experience/training. Brian was an office geek before all of this so him handling Merle so easily was a bit questionable.

thewalkingdead,3dkekj,Rozuem,5,Fri Jul 17 00:33:26 2015 UTC,"I wanna go with either Jim or Amy. I think Noah's death was extremely brutal, Beth's was... predictable yet shocking at the same time, if that makes sense? It just happened so quick and it was really emotional.. Tyreese's death was really unique and it was really cool to watch him fade in and out and kind of battle his inner demons while trying to fight to stay alive and trying to decide whether or not to give up. However, I'm going with either Amy or Jim. Amy was the first main character that we lost in the series and we didn't know what it was going to be like when someone turned. I remember the following episode when Andrea is just holding her the whole time, waiting for her to turn. I thought it was going to be quick and I kept waiting for a jump scare with Amy popping up and trying to rip Andrea's face off.. but that's not what happened. We watched the life fade from her, we watched her body go limp and become lifeless.. and then quietly and peacefully, she turned. She didn't jump at Andrea, she didn't scream or even make any noises.. she just quietly turned and when her eyes opened and Amy was no longer there.. it was something else, man. Andrea having to put her down after she turned was a bummer and it's incredible how after only knowing this character for 4 or 5 episodes, we felt bad that we lost her and we felt bad for Andrea for having to go through what she did.    Then, we have Jim.. Amy may have been the first time we saw a main character die and watched them reanimate but Jim was the first time we saw the fever hit and that we got to watch what happens when a person suffers from a bite and turns from a bite. Amy died before she turned, Jim didn't. Jim had to suffer through the fever and the quick-cuts with the flashes of walkers tearing through muscle and flesh while Jim was going in and out was really interesting and I wasn't sure what was going on at first but then the wheels start turning and it clicks that this is what he's experiencing as the fever begins to take over. Since the show and the concept was still so fresh to us, I'd say those two are probably the most interesting deaths in the series but as for ones that happen later on in the series, I'd probably go with Tyreese because it was different from what we're used to and it was really cool and nice to see something different happen after 5 years."

Can't beat the 1978 Dawn of the Dead-style zombies that were slow-moving idiots in facepaint though there is something special about the feels you get when some overconfident yahoo gets surrounded by those. :)"
thewalkingdead,3douar,vdau,9,Sat Jul 18 02:39:36 2015 UTC,I'd say they are very close to Romero zombies. They're just more vicious.

thewalkingdead,3douar,ResidentSmartass,4,Sat Jul 18 12:37:37 2015 UTC,"they are a sad, yet terrible thing. They bumble around, barely aware of their surroundings unless they ""catch a scent"" if you know what i mean. they seem brain damaged, but definitely ready to follow what's left of their very diminished senses toward the chum bucket.   I'm convinced FearTWD zombies are going to be more like this than TWD's zombies. In the trailer we mostly only see the zombies just standing there or shuffling/walking very slowly - the punkish one even falls to her knees even though her head hadn't been shot. The released footage of that paramedic was hovering over the zombie before he got bit.  Additionally at SDCC the writers & producers were talking about how you see a shifty ill-looking person on the sidewalk coming towards you, you just cross the street. They were unpacking that general concept a lot at the panel... and so I think for awhile that'll actually be enough to avoid the zombie in the beginning of the series... and in that way, FearTWD's found a way to sort of... calmly leak zombies into LA up until a tipping point where realization & panic sets in upon everybody.  I've got my fingers crossed on this at any rate. :)  PS - inb4 ""but that would be inconsistent with TWD which would be soooooooooo terrible!"""

I think when the governor knocks down the gate in season 3, I hear a brief moan. But, just having rasps is getting old."
thewalkingdead,3douar,matty032,3,Sat Jul 18 14:18:45 2015 UTC,The earliest Romero zombies weren't very colorful.  They were afraid of fire too.  Re-watching Dawn of The Dead (1979) makes me wonder how they got away with so many blue zombies.
thewalkingdead,3douar,Psyqlone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very small distinction overall. I enjoy Romero a whole hell of a lot but I think a lot of the characteristics that you are pointing out are attributable to the fact that the actors playing zombies had no idea what the fuck a zombie was. Romero was probably just fed the fuck up trying to perfect his vision said ""That's cool.... close enough.""  They have the reverse problem with the Walking Dead because there is probably a lot of people who want to be a walker and when they get their chance play the part of random walker roaming the forest play that part like that shit was Shakespeare in the park. I think that TWD has so much more realism and detail to the effects and performance that I can't even think of this as a TWD vs Romero thing. There is no competition... because there is no competition. It's just entertainment."
thewalkingdead,3dl4hd,DBoxy,10,Fri Jul 17 03:46:53 2015 UTC,Mmm.. Deer. And there is a brain..  EDIT: Hershal is walking?! Praise be to the good Lord above!! Amen! Gotta love his mini Santa beard.   EDIT 2: WALKERS IN THE YARD! Carl is a good shot though. Hop Hershel hop!  EDIT 3: Dammit! The big black dude that I have had no interest in since the beginning just got bit! NOOOOO!!!!! Even though I am not as invested in him as the others it is still sad since he is a vital part of the team.  Merle is tryna get get get it with blondie.  EDIT 4: Well I'm not sure where all these zombies came from but these alarms aren't helping. And Carl is a totally badass for as young as he is. I hope he stays a series regular and we can watch him grow up.   Governor is a good shot at golf.   Also.. THE BABY IS COMING!! AHHH!!   Dude. Total respect for the black guy who just sacrificed himself to save Carol.   EDIT 5: What is with the random prisoner attacking Rick?! Oh never mind he is dead. And Daryl is sneaking around the corner lol funny stuff.   Oh I hope Lori doesn't lose the baby but I'm pretty sure she will... :(  EDIT 6: Well so much for Doctor Carol. Nurse Maggy to the rescue!! Wait.. Why is Lori talking like she is going to die?! No. No. No.  EDIT 7: The baby is alive!! But Lori is not.. :(  EDIT 8: Carl.. What are you doing? CARL STAHP! Damn dude. That poor kid. He is gonna have a black heart by the time it's all done with.   EDIT 9: WOW! What a strong ending. Very powerful in many ways and there wasn't even much going on.   MAN I LOVE THIS SHOW!!   Well I'm going to go to bed now but I'll be back hopefully tomorrow with some more commentary. If not tomorrow then maybe Saturday.
thewalkingdead,3dl4hd,tommy4991,2,Fri Jul 17 03:48:28 2015 UTC,Everytime I see this episode I can't help but shed at least one tear for T-Dog and Lori.. :( love your narrative! glad your digging the show!!
thewalkingdead,3dl4hd,bobsaget0013,7,Sat Jul 18 10:30:38 2015 UTC,"Back with more!!   So I am on episode 7 now and the phone call thing was kind of strange. So happy they found Carol! Merle is a dick. Michonne is awesome.   Now that Glen and Maggie were kidnapped I am sad. Poor glen got his ass beat but still managed to do good. And the governor creeping on Maggie was weird and I don't like him at all.  Back to the show!  EDIT: Camp infiltration!! Go guys go!! Take out the governor and his men!   EDIT 2: Wolverine Shane! That was interesting. Oh also I forgot to mention earlier, Carol IS NOT a lesbian. I repeat she IS NOT a lesbian. Mustache prisoner found that out.   EDIT 3: Oh man I forgot about this new group of people. How'd they get into the prison again? Wasn't somebody keeping watch? ...uh oh. Michonne found the zombie head collection...aaaaand the governor's daughter.   EDIT 4: Governor is backing down. Trying to save his daughter. Let's see how this plays out..... Not good for the daughter. Dang. Fight between the governor and Michonne!   EDIT 5: OH DAMN! GLASS IN THE EYE!! He is going to need a big eye wash station for that. Like huge. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.   Andrea don't be nice to him! Oh she sees the zombie heads. This is such a weird situation. The governor holding his dead zombie daughter in his arms, crying with a piece of glass in his eye, in the room of zombie heads.   EDIT 6: Governor you sly dog. How dare you pick on Merle and Daryl. I really hope this governor dude dies sometime soon. He is a jackass. But then again I guess we need a bad guy besides the zombies. So I'm undecided."
thewalkingdead,3dl4hd,lalalakers,3,Sat Jul 18 15:03:33 2015 UTC,I want to hear your opinion on the last 8 of the season... Dont go away OP!
thewalkingdead,3dl4hd,RCTjunkie,7,Sat Jul 18 19:35:00 2015 UTC,Watching a little of the next episode this morning before work and the governor has his zombie daughter and I guess some zombie hostages. They didn't work out very well on the farm. Let's see how it works here. They have more resources in this makeshift town so I'd say they stand a better chance.   EDIT: WHAT IS THIS?! Zombie fight club?! That actually really badass.   EDIT 2: No! The phone rings at random and I gotta go to work so I don't know who Rick is talking to! No! No! No!

thewalkingdead,3dl00h,Try_Another_Please,3,Fri Jul 17 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was going to say just that. A good motorcycle can fit though tighter spaces, can go into the woods, and you can get off of it and run in a hurry if you need to, or spin it around and go the other way. There are definitely disadvantages, but there are some marked advantages too."
thewalkingdead,3dl00h,Wolfman87,21,Sat Jul 18 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Cause Daryl don't give a fuck! Cross bow to the face!  Seriously though, its been one of the things that bug me. Only thing that makes sense for it is good gas mileage. Think a dirt bike would have made more sense... But hey that's television, can't watch a show that doesn't have those moments.  Hell even the preview for fear the walking dead had me scratching my head... ""Hey some disease is killing people and making them into zombies! I know! Let all riot down town and for an all you can eat brain-fet!"""
thewalkingdead,3dl00h,adhal,4,Fri Jul 17 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"Gas mileage isn't even a good argument. You could SQUEEZE 3 people on the back of a motorbike. Safely, and realistically you can fit 2. A car can probably fit 8 safely (4 in back, 2 in front, 2 in boot). I highly doubt a car uses four times the amount of fuel as a motorbike."

thewalkingdead,3dl00h,TsarNab,5,Sat Jul 18 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"Here's my theory.. Daryl is actually from the Evil Dead universe. It's possible that at some point he got sucked into The Walking Deads universe but has kept the laws of his own within his own personal bubble.   This explains why everyone else is extremely susceptible to more ""realistic"" deaths and weapons all while he can skate by driving a motorcycle and using a Crossbow as his primary weapon."

thewalkingdead,3dl00h,VagueSomething,4,Fri Jul 17 20:30:15 2015 UTC,The thing that gets me is that he's supposed to be a scouter. He's supposed to observe people from a distance without making contact. Kind of hard when people can hear you cruising miles away.
thewalkingdead,3dl00h,Wookie_Goldberg,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:23 2015 UTC,Its good for recon since you can go to places where cars can't come

thewalkingdead,3dl00h,phiendster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"There are pros and cons to every vehicle. We saw even an SUV get stuck in the mud for a brief period (""Clear"" with Rick, Carl and Michonne). So while quieter, it's also larger and potentially can get stuck.  A motorcycle is louder, but it's far more maneuverable, especially since I think the bike that Aaron gave to Daryl to restore isn't a chopper but a bit more mobile.  Given the amount of potential stopped traffic on the road, squeezing a motorcycle in between tight places is a lot easier. So when the two of them are out together, Daryl can go ahead as the ""advance"" scout while Aaron stays back a bit with the car (which can be used to transport supplies and additional people).  As far as getting scratches/bitten while riding, I doubt even Daryl would try to plow through a herd on a bike. He'd turn around or go off road."

His character started off as an aggressive jerk but deep down behind that persona was a very loyal brother and a man who literally took out the majority of the Governors troops to save his little bro and friends.

thewalkingdead,3dfsai,ShadowSeed,9,Thu Jul 16 01:52:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Merle. I think under the right circumstances, he might have changed. Not entirely, but enough to get him off the 'bad guy' list and into 'anti-hero'."

In case you were wondering, yes I'm bitter.  Edit: oh I just read the other posts about this. As for whether TWD specifically deserves Emmy recognition, I'm not sure. Personally the acting never comes off terribly bad to me really & the general production quality of the show & plotlines are totally legit.

thewalkingdead,3ddpph,sethx33,4,Wed Jul 15 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"I think there is one or more assumptions that you glossed over that might be very important to that calculation. Here are my top 2.   That everyone got infected with the Z infliction that turns them into a zombie, at the same time uniformity. If it had started in one area then only 30 zombies could have been created on day one. My theory is that the latent Z infection came after the zombies started dying and spread into the water or it could have been an airborne particle that spread, either way it would not be in the entire us on one day unless this was a coordinated attack. so that will lower the amount of natural death created zombies right out if the gate. The rate of zombie caused deaths will not be uniform per area based on total population, density of said population, police/military response and effectiveness, etc. This would be hard to quantify, but it would be easy to assume that the rate in cities was much faster in the beginning and then the last couple percent of living people were in hiding or actually got out of the city. Whereas people in rural (either spread out towns or low population) saw fewer zombies per area and thus there would still be a sharp rise, but also a larger population yet to encounter a zombie or at least an attack.   It is very difficult to come up with any accurate numbers without knowing more specifics about the disease and the latent disease, how it/they were released, and how it/they spread. I have only watched the TV show from this point so maybe the comics goes into further detail or has explained it somewhat. What we need is more information as the two principle parts of your Zombie Deaths result (Death Rate and Zombie Related Deaths) are not fixed and/or hard to estimate. I think you've come to a good start though because this would be the base formula for estimating not only the number of deaths at any given time during the outbreak, but also pattern at which the outbreak spread. Pretty cool stuff."
thewalkingdead,3ddpph,alexinawe,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:33 2015 UTC,I thought i mentioned the fact that cities would be more prevalent simply because some towns will not have any deaths based on their small population. I guess not. But yeah the stats you mentioned are hard to really shownsimply because there i no given statistic thus it's up to educated guessing.
thewalkingdead,3ddpph,Naveb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:10 2015 UTC,I should also mention this is based on the assumption the virus was tandomly triggered at the same time across the us.

A stupid, shambling enemy against fast, intelligent humans with tools and tactics.  I always imagine the only way it would work is if some kind of airborne virus spread into the atmosphere, infected everyone at once.  Then, the majority of people would die from it and turn.  The remaining minority are immune to the aggressive form and so don't die but are left with the dormant version which only reanimates upon death by other means, these people would be our 'survivors.'"
thewalkingdead,3ddpph,MrChetManley,3,Wed Jul 15 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"Exacty, the only way it would work in TWD if it was a spontaneous which means for some unkown reason something triggers the virus to mutate world wide thus taking it by suprise. Even then humans are problem solving animals so im sure we would realise really quick what is happening. With that being said, most major cities would fall because of rioting a looting causing law enforcement to be overstretched and unable to deal with the growing death toll."

The first infected kill/infect everyone they come across.  Infected parents infect their children coming home from school, infected spouse infects spouse after work, infected zombie attacks cabbie, and so forth.  Within the first 24 hours, half the kids at school don't show up, people are missed at work and occasionally someone witnesses a brutal murder (reported on tv as a ""murder spree"").    Strain zombie/vampires are only active at night, so that mitigates their rate of reproduction significantly, but the depiction of people really not understanding what is happening is valid.  By the time the danger is identified and defined there are already thousands (in NYC) of zombies shambling around."

thewalkingdead,3dff2y,IIRodneyX,5,Fri Jul 17 07:08:21 2015 UTC,"They could, technically. But AMC would have to get permission from Telltale. I would also be completely against it, personally. While the game and comics take place in the same universe and are separate from the show, Lee or Clementine could still exist in the television universe. I just don't see any reason to do it though.  Redoing the plots from the games on television would be redundant since we have already seen and heard it play out in real time. Not to mention that the game is almost a year further in the timeline from the show, so it wouldn't be able to do new stories together without some time skipping, and it would feel very shoe-horned in and out of place in the comic based story.   Then, I wouldn't want to see someone try to pull off a live-action version of Clementine. Because they probably couldn't, and personal choices from the games could never really be referenced. No, I would prefer those two mediums to stay apart.   *Edit: But yeah, if they could appear, and if they were done right, I would like to see some minor character show up again, or one who we don't know what happened to.

thewalkingdead,3dff2y,TheEld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"I think it would have to depend on which character would show up. Clementine and Kenny? Unlikely. Molly? Definitely.  A crossover would have to work the same way that the crossovers work between the game and the comics. It would pretty much need to be side characters that Telltale has no intention of using in their stories again. And it would have to make sense now that the location has changed.  So maybe Vernon could make an appearance, or maybe even the 400 days survivors. I would love it if Nate the truck driver returned."
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,Niemand7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:06 2015 UTC,"Some of the people that were staying at the diner in 400 days were from  Just telling you in case you missed that. Of course for your argument's sake, in the show universe anything could be different."
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,Superj561,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:47:42 2015 UTC,"Well its based in the comic universe, buy I suppose its possible"
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,adhal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:17:23 2015 UTC,No.   Show is one universe and the game and comic are canon with each other as another universe.
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,AlphaNeonic,4,Wed Jul 15 21:09:50 2015 UTC,Why can't Clementine exist in the world of the show? Characters from the comic world are in the show world after all.
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,AhTreyYou,3,Wed Jul 15 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose she could, but it wouldn't be the game version of Clementine.   The show is based on the comic, but it's deviated from it so much that at this point it's safe to say they are two different universes.   Nothing has happened in the games that contradicts what's happened in the comics, so at this point they have a shared universe. If they do use Clementine or Kenny or another game character, I don't see how it could be canon with the game. The timelines don't match up."
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,AlphaNeonic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:29 2015 UTC,Wouldn't have to be canon with the game -- just like the comic isn't.
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,DontGetBit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:43:47 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see Clementine or Kenny on the TV show, I'm a huge fan of the game.   I'm just doubtful of it happening since the show seems to kind of doing it's own thing now."
thewalkingdead,3dff2y,AlphaNeonic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:49:52 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be completely canon and fit in with the timeline. Some characters in the show debuted later then the comic book. They can retcon the length of Clem's story and remix pieces and ditch others like every other comic book character on the show.
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,RedWhiteStripes,12,Tue Jul 14 23:25:14 2015 UTC,"I really like this cover. It's kind of eerie in a way. Hopefully the absence of Rick doesn't mean something happened to him. I know his plot armor is at an all time low, or so it seems, but I'm still not ready for his possible death."
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,broncoboots12,3,Wed Jul 15 02:05:05 2015 UTC,There have been dozens of covers without Rick on them.  Doesn't mean anything one way or another.

thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,BleedTheFreak_23,2,Tue Jul 14 23:39:14 2015 UTC,Carl ain't going nowhere! I'm convinced Andrea will go before both Rick and Carl though.

thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,AhTreyYou,4,Tue Jul 14 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"If I had to take a guess, he's back at Alexandria doing his leadering thing. Probably after the events of 144 had to go back and tell the communities about the threat, there's no way you can keep something like that from your people."
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,observantabsurdist,4,Tue Jul 14 23:50:10 2015 UTC,If this is 147 then he's had two issues to do that. I'm just wondering the circumstances that would make Rick separate himself from those 2.
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,DeputyFicus,3,Wed Jul 15 00:41:41 2015 UTC,Rick's probably making plans for how to deal with the Whisperers or he's busy resolving conflict. Or he's just not on the cover
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,TsarNab,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"He may be at the Hilltop (getting punched by Maggie, see cover 146) or possibly telling the crowds at the fair what has happened (then gets punched by Maggie)."

He still needs to continue leading his people, if anything now more than ever. He's not as able bodied as before. Carl and Andrea are much more physically capable than he is outside the walls."

Also, I'm not going to lie I'm impressed that you can deduce from this cover that Carl, Andrea and Lydia are simply messengers. /s :P"

thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,SassySauce516,3,Wed Jul 15 02:41:23 2015 UTC,This has a very Mignola vibe to it. Charlie is killing it.
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,LsawredL,0,Wed Jul 15 06:42:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry,  Charlie SUCKS.  I read because of the great writing, but he's not a good enough artist to me.  I know he's under the gun to churn out these issues, especially when it goes bi-weekly at times, but that's no excuse for the common facial features shared by everyone."
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,Jilly33,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"I think charlie isnt killing it. His art has been lazy.for example, Dwight looks exactly like volume 16-19 Rick"
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,danny-rauger,2,Thu Jul 16 15:46:04 2015 UTC,"This cover is excellent. Dynamic, creepy and the characters are framed by their setting perfectly. Like I said it has a Mignola vibe (probably the strong use of shadow and setting to convey tone) that I think is a fantastic direction for his art. Look at the cover of 144, similarly fantastic."
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,shiny_vinyl,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:00 2015 UTC,Yeah i guess i agree looking at it again more closely. Its good but i does just look like a colored panel alittle
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,HeinsohnsHangover,2,Thu Jul 16 17:51:43 2015 UTC,It looks like Lydia and Carl are carrying guns too.

thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,Darth_Kahuna,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:42 2015 UTC,It should just be skin at this point. It's not an open wound after all this time. I'm sure he'd be dead by now if it hadn't healed.
thewalkingdead,3dbdmh,IsaacBenning,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:32:09 2015 UTC,He probably has a cloth on hand to clean it every now and then.

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,ughalready,25,Wed Jul 15 15:24:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. I almost want Daryl's character to die just to watch the fangirls riot. Spoiler alert: they won't.
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,treblah3,5,Wed Jul 15 15:51:36 2015 UTC,I say this every time someone hates on Daryl. The best thing they can do to make his character interesting again is to turn him in to a bad guy
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,Emalezable,3,Wed Jul 15 17:09:52 2015 UTC,Daryl's still interesting already. He had a pretty great season 5 with picking up Carol's 'fire=growth' theme and his relationship with Aaron/Alexandria as a whole.

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,JudmanDaSuperhero,8,Wed Jul 15 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think Daryl's asexual. Possibly a result of having had to bottle his feelings through a childhood of abuse, tragedy and neglect. I think Daryl's just barely able to accept his brotherhood with Rick and his friendship with Carol and is a while off from being able to feel romantically inclined toward anyone, man or woman."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,Shutupredneckman2,3,Wed Jul 15 19:42:35 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. Never really understood the Daryl being gay speculations but Daryl seems too busy surviving than dealing with bitches and all that love drama shit

I hadn't read the comics at this stage, so when he was added I was massively intrigued by his story, the scratching on the church etc was pretty creepy but it's fizzled out for me.  I'll probably get hate for this but I can't understand why Beth was so popular, sure she was fit and the only 'teenage' girl on the show but her antics on the farm were annoying, I started to like her at the beginning of season 4, when she had the boyfriend, then her actions after that annoyed me as well, the whole wanting a drink, the weird Daryl thing and then"
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,TZMouk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:04 2015 UTC,"That would go against her characterization. The whole point was that she wasn't willing to turn her back and let bad things happen the way that Dawn was, even for a second."

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,RSLee2,10,Wed Jul 15 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"She lectures everyone in every scene she's in. Her character 'arc' (if it could be called such) begins with lecturing Dale in Season 2. She's not wrong, but you hope that she'll have more depth.  Then she lectures Rick and Shane separately, she lectures Lori on the merits of suicide, and in season 3 she lectures Michonne (no wonder Michonne just clams up and says nothing) and when Michonne leaves, she lectures the Governor and Martinez and Milton. When she sees Rick again, she lectures him more. On and on.  When Andrea's around, she acts like the smartest, most reasonable person in the room even though she's made as many mistakes as anyone and worse mistakes than some.  I could never figure out whether it was the way they wrote her character, directed the actress, or was the actresses own portrayal. Sometimes I think the same lines could have been delivered less preachy, other times I think she did the best possible with the material on the page."

He was the complete opposite of Dale, the best character on the show, and I was so annoyed when he opened the barn against Hershel's wishes, especially how he didn't show any remorse. Some people may say that he just wanted to make things safer but he was only ever interested in himself. As long as Shane was fine everyone else could go to Hell. Getting medicine for Carl? Just trying to fool Rick and Lori into thinking he was a good guy. But Dale saw straight through that and knew he killed Otis. Shane was a scumbag and Dale was the only one who could see it."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,PsychoChicken38,4,Wed Jul 15 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"Shane is one of my favorite character, too bad he died so early !"
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,Rna6,3,Thu Jul 16 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"But he was so mean and horrible! When he beat the crap out of Ed I was like yes Shane woop, but ever since Dale saw him aiming his gun at Rick I hated him."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,PsychoChicken38,5,Thu Jul 16 19:23:57 2015 UTC,"I liked Glenn up until season 2. After he sacked-down over the next few seasons,  for me this is a fairly easy choice.  I pray for Maggie to die only so his character can go back to being good again."

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,LordChaosBaelish,3,Fri Jul 17 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"If you consider Judith being a main character (since she has no lines), yeah that baby crying constantly is annoying and whiny (literally)."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,mrshampoo,6,Wed Jul 15 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Definitely Beth. She was poorly acted and it felt like they really tried to shoehorn her in the plot in S4. I guess they wanted people to care about her before she got killed off. I couldn't stand her and her bottle episodes were the worst of the series.
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,kate815,6,Wed Jul 15 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"If you asked me last season, I would've said Glenn, but they gave him back some personality in season 5. In seasons 3 and 4, his only personality trait was that he loved Maggie. It was awful. One of my favorite characters again now though.  Nowadays, Carol would be the worst and Daryl would be a close second. Carol just feels totally cheesy to me and all her scenes where she's supposed to be a badass just come off as lame to me. For Daryl, he was awesome for the first 3.5 seasons, but now he's just fangirl fodder or superman in every scene he's in."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,drmehmetoz,2,Thu Jul 16 00:56:07 2015 UTC,"Easy: Andrea.  Extra infuriating because Andrea Holden would have crushed a strict TV adaptation of the comic Andrea.  Instead, we got a woman of conscience instead of a woman of action. Yes, she was Protagonist #1 in and allowed us to see how an outsider (like Andrea) reacts to the strange and evil place that Woodbury had become under the Gov's rule. Yes, she saw the Governor's softer side (and other sides), and the good in Woodbury's residents. But no, you don't get to witness the evil she saw, and then not take Rick's side fully when they rejoin the group. Her failure to assassinate the Governor cost a lot of lives, and I'm glad they decided to put that character out of her confused misery."

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,drmehmetoz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. I cried so much when he died and he's honestly changed my life for the better. I had so much depression, and then I started watching the show and his character gave me so much hope. Since then, I've written about him in philosophy class and do anything I can to keep his name alive. Not a day has gone by when I haven't thought about Dale."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,PsychoChicken38,2,Sun Jul 19 22:01:36 2015 UTC,To be honest I thought Glenn was slacking a lot but they gave him a good push in season 5. I'd just wish they hadn't put him on the back burner and built his character a lot more along with Rick and Daryl. They had him too attached to Maggie which diluted his character.
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,MrDonaught,2,Fri Jul 17 03:31:31 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about currently alive: I'm not a fan of Sasha at all. I never have been. Her intro to the show (when she was acting all crazy and irrational at the jail) wasn't flattering and I've never had a moment where I genuinely liked and related to her character. All of her scenes have just been ""meh"" for me. And ever since we've gotten to Alexandria, her bouts of PTSD are just annoying to me and are a burden to the group, even though they're logically totally understandable. They're just a chore to watch."

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,TheHypnosloth,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:35 2015 UTC,"I don't find him interesting, that's the problem. It's obvious that he's trying to get the group kicked out, and it's pretty clear that he is either going to die/get kicked out himself. Plus they overuse him a lot, and I don't 1. Like his character 2. Dislike his character, which means I'm uninterested, and I don't care about him.  That's my mentality, not that I dislike his character but rather that I don't have an interest in him. I worded that poorly in my paragraph above."

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,goingawayparty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about the past - I think Andrea is by far the worst main character, though Lori comes in a close second.   Andrea's insufferable whining throughout the second season: ""Why don't I get a gun! I'm a strong independent woman! Give me a gun!""   ""Fuck you, Dale! Stop caring about me!""  ""Oh boy I'm going to prove myself by shooting Daryl! Oh, you all are telling me to not shoot? Fuck you, I'm gonna do it anyway, I'm a strong woman who don't need no man!""  ""Oh you family of Beth, you don't know what's best for her, I do! Let her kill herself, lol!""   And then of course the whole fiasco with fucking Shane, fucking the Governor, turning her back on Michonne, deciding multiple times not to kill the Governor when she had the chance...   Lori is pretty bad as well, though. Even if she thought her husband was dead, she still fucked his best friend like immediately. But the worst part was when she told Rick, ""You need to take care of Shane... He's a threat and he wants to have me and Carl and you need to get rid of him."" And then when he kills Shane she acts like he's a horrible monster. -_-"
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,Yarde,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"Daryl - I don't really understand the hype around him tbh. His story arch's just repeat.   Daryl is a social hermit > He starts to come out (don't read into that) of his shell because of someone (Beth) or something (Prison) > Someone or something is killed or taken away > Daryl is social hermit > Rinse Repeat.   It's boring AF! The only time I found Daryl even remotely interesting was when we started to get a glimpse into his past with Merle and Merle's death.  Another one, TV Andrea. The injustice done to that character is shameful"
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,KeredYojepop,0,Thu Jul 16 08:17:46 2015 UTC,"No one has made me cringe more than Andrea. Laurie Holden's acting when we first meet her in season 1 made me stop watching the show for a while. Even when I got back into the show, I wanted to throw a brick at my TV every time she was on screen. I don't know if it was the poor writing for her character or the delivery. There is something about Laurie Holden that makes me want to punch babies. She ruined The Mist for me was well. As for current characters, I'd have to say Gabriel. Not sure what they're trying to go for there. They bring Seth Gilliam to the show and do that with him? He just seems bored and faded to the side lines. Hopefully they give him some good shit this season."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,TZMouk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"I liked the Mist. I also didn't hate Andrea, but I know I'm in the minority here. I agree on the second part, I thought Gabriel started strong, I was so intrigued with the creepy church and his erratic behaviour, he had me cooked but the church storyline just ended with a bit of a squib imo, I'd have liked to have seen a bit more of The Hunters but oh well, hopefully he comes out more in season 6."
thewalkingdead,3ddmis,KeredYojepop,2,Thu Jul 16 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"I love the Mist, she just takes me out of it at times. I don't really know what it is. She's just one of those actors.

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,AFishBackwards,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"Something everyone needs to keep in mind is that the two sick people she killed she also saved from having to die terribly. She killed them quickly before they could even feel it. They were some of the first infected and if other people died from it after them then Karen and David would have definitely died. They would have slowly choked on their own blood while it flowed out of their eyes mouth and nose. She saved them from that and attempted to save the rest of the group with it.  As for scaring Sam that was her only option at that point. She tried to offer him cookies if he stayed quiet and he said he would still have to tell his mom. THAT is when she had to make up a fake threat for him. She was out of options and if she hadn't scared him her entire group could have been kicked out of Alexandria. Also consider the fact that Sam still talks to her and is not scared of her now at all. Obviously he was not traumatized by it. Remember how she stood in front of him shielding him while Rick and Pete fought? She obviously wants to protect the kid and her group and everything she does is always, ALWAYS to protect other people in her group. She is one of the most caring yet strong characters on the entire show and that is why she is one of the best in the entire group.

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,CreepyClown,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:38 2015 UTC,She is coldhearted when it comes to dealing with bad people or people that can't be trusted. She is incredibly loving when it comes to the relationships within her group. Look at the way she cares for Daryl and the way she tried to protect Lizzie and Mika. She has dealt with a lot of shit but that doesn't make her a bad person for trying to avoid that shit in the future.  Edit: OKAY COOL.

thewalkingdead,3ddmis,desertdudej,0,Wed Jul 15 20:57:01 2015 UTC,"Daryl when having something to actually do on a personality level can bee pretty interesting. The idea that he's s good guy who was raised in an abusive setting and is now in a group of people that genuinely cares for him, basically putting a contrast between him growing up in one way (""good world""/shitty life) and turning it into shitty world/""good"" life could be a great sub plot. Seeing him be socially stunted and trying to adjust and such.   Problem is they don't do this and turn him into some sort of invincible bobba fett meets superman character.   He's almost the biggest contradiction to what TWD is. It's a world where you need to know how to survive smartly and one slip up and boom, your dead. Hell they had it happen twice in season 5 with Tyrees and Beth. It's clearly a message they have.   Yet Daryl is going off being Rambo and falling off horses and shit, getting shot in the head and much more. And he's fine.   Daryl could be great. But they won't let him be."

That's because their article or their picture isn't about them, it's about something else and has nothing to do with them.  People looking at that article or picture don't want to know stuff about the author or what the author looks like.  I don't dislike Mr. Hardwick, I just find him including himself in the main event with the acting cast in so much stuff.  Even though he isn't the main event at all."

Chris is still a big fan of the show even though he's related to it, and even for him I'm sure it's hard to get a picture with this many of the cast members at once.

thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,olivaw_another,11,Tue Jul 14 23:53:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, here is my perfect zombie game.   Dayz survivability and exploration (needing to eat constantly, needing medicine, needing water, needing shelter, ect). the Last of Us controls and combat, a little toned down. And walking dead zombies. Slow, but incredibly dangerous at grappling and strong enough to knock you over. And of course, always traveling in numbers.   I want a zombie game where I can survive solo or build a community, where I can defeat a single zombie reasonably but I can't leeroy Jenkins through a herd like it's nothing.   I don't want it to be silly or over the top like dead rising where I'm clobbering zombies with a barb wire electric weed wacker or whatever other wacky bullshit you can craft in that game.   I don't want special or super zombies (but having some capable of running wouldn't be too bad).   I want to have a chance but I don't want hand holding. Start me off with nothing. Make me scavenge like in DayZ. But make it so I can kill zombies basically. I think a good balance would be that getting bit by a zombie ""infects"" you, guaranteeing your death, but they are relatively easy to kill.   In terms of story, well I know what I would like to see (I'm a writer, I have an awesome zombie survival story that I wrote for fun) but your best bet is making an open world with a lot of exploration, it doesn't have to be as big as Day Z's map (which is insane) but it should be comparable to the GTAV map. Have an open mode where you can play online or offline like GTAV, only you start on a beach with nothing but the clothes on your back (like day Z).   Then just have a good story mode. You can make it linear or open ended and multi-choiced.   Now I know this is a tall order for an indie dev, so I don't expect you to be able to pull this off, but I think you can take some ideas and apply them.   Oh and I think third person shooter/melee would be best for control style. Like I said, I like the Last of Us, and zombie games have a strong melee focus usually so third person works well."
thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,DillonPressStart,4,Wed Jul 15 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"Very much so. Especially with the ""super zombies"". That's my biggest gripe about current zombie games"
thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,IsaacBenning,2,Wed Jul 15 05:53:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you've seen or played it, but State of Decay is a lot like what you described."
thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,lifeofwill,2,Wed Jul 15 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, when people ask for good zombie games that are like TWD I tend to point them to this game. All I've ever wanted is a zombie survival game with cars (basically GTA with zombies) and this game fills that void.  Plus State of Decay has a HUGE array of mods you can add to the game to make it however you like (I removed special zombies and raised the regular zombies spawn rate really high and they now shamble instead of running) so I can get my TWD gameplaying experience."
thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,WillBlaze,0,Wed Jul 15 17:26:44 2015 UTC,"I looked into State of Decay and I would not recommend buying it. The developers abandoned the game and released another version of it, and there's nothing saying they won't do that again. The gameplay itself looked good though.  Edit: If you're downvoting, feel free to offer a counter-arguement because I don't see one myself."
thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,bigfootplays,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"Also, only headshots kills and you can interact with people like find people and either join up with them or kill them and there are several groups out there like imagine a group of Wolves (chaotic bad) and a group like Pre Terminus (good). You start near the beginning of the apocalypse and as the game goes on, you can notice buildings decaying and grass growing. Hunger and weather can kill you. Basically as realistic as possible"

thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,IamEclipse,2,Fri Jul 17 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"I actually made these zombies capable of running/fast walking so keep that in mind. Also some characters have placeholder names borrowed from my other written works since I hadn't decided on their official names yet.   EDIT: sorry, it's confusing. Vince is 16 at the start and Mei is 7.   It opens with Vince's family in the car, 3 months into the apocalypse. A Z makes his car spin out and he crashes. Incoming Z's make Vince grab his sister Mei and run for it. So now it's just the two of them. It's November, it's cold, they have nothing. So they wander into a gas station that's been pillaged. And that's when Vince realizes Mei is sick.   His efforts to save her go nowhere; he can't find any supplies so for 2 days she just gets worse... Until Chase appears. A seasoned survivalist, Chase shares his food and medicine, and tells the kids he's going to the city to find his wife and daughter.   Not wanting to make it alone, they join Chase. Things go well until they get robbed on the train tracks, but they recover and meet other people along the way, finding the city.   The city holds no answers for Chase but they do meet plenty of new people and begin to head north. People die along the way but they eventually meet a new ground lead by an ex military guy named Morgan. Needing a place to hunker down for the winter, they join Morgan's group... But the storms destroy their shelter and they have to leave to find a new place that's not Z infested.   The winter cold claims half of the group, including Morgan's son, before they find a place they can stay. More die on supply runs until it's down to just Vince, Mei, Miranda the love interest, Chase, Morgan, Stanley and Luke.   Winter ends and the group Manages to start moving again, discovering many other survivor camps where people died from the cold or from hunger.   They reach another city, and discover that the college campus has been turned into a fortress. They join this group, Locke's group, only to discover that there's plenty of in fighting. You see the leader, Locke, is a former crime boss. And many people don't like him for it. His old gang runs the group well but they leave something to be desired. More specifically people are not happy with the way he rations supplies and prioritizes certain jobs in the community.   Eventually Chase and Vince work their way into the upper echelon after fooling a murder attempt, and become Locke's close allies. The group unites over a small war again another community, which Locke is able to end peacefully, angering his revenge-minded comrades. Chase also meets a woman and falls in love, and becomes a stepfather to her little boy.   Finally all the tensions boil over into a civil war that costs Locke, Morgan and many others their lives (though Locke's faction wins). Mei is also killed in the ensuing battle. Chase, who takes over the group, ends the civil war peacefully, forgiving the other faction, which pisses Vince off.   The Z's in the city start herding towards the college, while Vince begins stalking and killing the former rebels one by one. Vince is kicked out but he uses his skill and knowledge of the walls to force a breach, and sneak in, using the herd as a distraction while he goes on a killing spree.   He faces off against Chase who is fighting to get his new family out, and realizing what he's becoming, Vince decides to sacrifice himself, creating a distraction and wrecking zombies with his machete while Chase escapes. It ends with Chase and the other survivors finding the other community's camp, and them deciding to take the group in as a favour to Locke, who agreed to end their own conflict.   Obviously it's not perfect but that's the synopsis of all major events start to finish. Hope it helps."

thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,DillonPressStart,6,Sat Jul 18 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"1) Something open, like if GTA had zombies, but also have worlds that you affect as time goes on, like Minecraft.  2) FPS with strategic elements for scavenging and building barriers  3) Open-ended  4) Either, really. I feel like I'd only play multiplayer with friends on something needing this much cooperation, so it'd definitely need a strong singleplayer.   5) I only play on PC. Steam greenlight would probably be your best bet as an indie dev.  This is just my opinion though. I'd buy a game like this if it wasn't too expensive. Good luck in developing."
thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,bigfootplays,5,Wed Jul 15 00:08:09 2015 UTC,"open world with cities,wildlife,and neighborhoods. graphics like dying light, first person. World as large as minecraft or at least GTA5 except you can go in all buildings. make it difficult as far as trying to survive. stealth mechanics similar to ""the last of us"" make objectives in the game, dicision based game. Actions have consequences. Could have a lose story line with seemingly endless side quests to give you a chance to explore the game's world and stay entertained. Maybe the ending of the game is to come across a Negan like character and save your safe zone from his reign... after that is over you can still free roam and just play the survival aspect of the game or finish side quests only difference is survivors look up to you like a hero when you come across them now. (also you can chose your fate) so you can be good or bad. If you turn out bad you are the Negan Character and the whole game is building up your reign and taking over the other safezones you come across. The game can have 4 safezones spread fairly far across the map. when you first start the game you spawn in a random building far far from the safezones. The first half of the game is survival and establishing the fate of your character. later on wether you become good or not is where the story takes a very different turn. (this allows the player to want to play the game a second time to chose the fate differently)  oh a great mechanic to allow zombie hoards roll through randomly would be awesome! like a code that once in a blue moon that spawns a hoard of zombies like maybe 100 yards from your base. the size of the hoard is random.. You can either fend em off and try to kill them all, or you can hide and if unseen you can wait for the hoard to go through."

thewalkingdead,3dbh9d,ThunderstormCloud,2,Wed Jul 15 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"Now I've no idea whether it's already been done but a game where you can create you own sort of settlements as in like barricade up your village or something. But not anything extremely ott like mining for resources. I'd love the ability to be able to create something like ASZ or Woodbury. Maybe a strategy turn based game? Although I'm not overly fond of them as most of them are tap and wait/pay. You'd also have the ability to scavenge but items don't respawn so you actually have to be careful. Also, having an open world similar to DayZ where you can play on a server and people actually have to pay attention and take part in roles such as just sitting in a watch tower"

Does no one else realize that these favorite initial panic outbreak parts of zombie flicks featured in films and/or TV last maybe ten minutes cumulative, if at all-?  Honestly it baffles me how people can be skeptical about this show if the show is literally telling you that its first season is 6 hours of your favorite ten-minute scene in Dawn of the Dead reboot.  Edit: point #5 here for why FearTWD is going to be more original & legit than anything we've seen since like... The first 6 hours of The Stand in 1994.

Your post made me think though, I wonder if they will have some of these early zombies show intelligence.  I know it's mostly attributed to Frank Darabont however the way Robert Kirkman worked it in with a logical answer (the ""fresher"" zombies being smarter than older ones)  For those unfamiliar with what I'm referring to (which is reasonable it's been a long time since season one) Some of the zombies in season one were slightly intelligent some were sitting in a church others were sitting on a bus and one zombie even banged a rock against a door."

In my conception, since they are all already infected with whatever causes you to turn, and they only turn after dying it means that the 'virus'(?) merely takes control of the body when it is already dead. I think it merely uses it as a puppeteer.  That's just my opinion though."
thewalkingdead,3d480v,Zerei,10,Mon Jul 13 13:48:54 2015 UTC,Like it or not the zombies clear as day showed evidence of intelligence in the beginning of the show you can't just wave that kind of thing off.

I'm really worried (but very cautiously optimistic) how this will be portrayed. There is a reason that the beginning of the zombie apocalypse is always skipped - it generally defies logic that such an outbreak would topple civilization. I know that in story lore for all zombie stories inevitably shows that the word and concept of 'zombie' doesn't exist and that obviously makes sense.  However, industrialized countries are generally very good at managing contagion. An obvious exception would be an airborne pathogen, but that doesn't seem to be the case with TWD zombies. I just don't see how they can portray the beginning and hold the suspension of disbelief of the audience (and before the whole, ""It's a show about zombies and you expect realism"" starts; yes, I do. There are certain aspects of story telling that we accept when watching this type of show and an illogical narrative will take me out of it as much as a talking dog or a wizard would. The fall of civilization seems to be the central arc and if it doesn't make sense, the story will fail for me)."

thewalkingdead,3d480v,SuperNoob9000,4,Tue Jul 14 06:09:58 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you TWD adds two things that change everything.  The first being in the show there has never been a zombie movie so they don't know how to deal with them right away.  Secondly being the best part. Anyone who dies turns in the beginning natural deaths alone would be sufficient to cause problems. In the case of America anytime something small happens we have mass looting and chaos.  Heck in my home state our morgues actually commonly overflow with corpses (Detroit in particular)
thewalkingdead,3d480v,lumpy999,3,Mon Jul 13 14:13:48 2015 UTC,"Heck in my home state our morgues actually commonly overflow with corpses (Detroit in particular)   I could argue with you other points, but this makes an interesting plot device. My only quibble is that I don't think that corpse overflow is a regular issue in most areas and that rapid zombie infestations would be somewhat localized, but I think a clever writing team could get around that.  Okay, I'm starting to feel a little better"
thewalkingdead,3d480v,RegressToTheMean,2,Mon Jul 13 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"it generally defies logic that such an outbreak would topple civilization   a good chunk the population thought the world was ending because of ebola. i don't think too many people would argue with the effectiveness of a fictional virus (i agree with you though). the good thing about TWD is that nobody really knows exactly what caused the outbreak or how the virus works so they can just ignore that aspect. however, in FTWD I'd like to see how people try to deal with it at first."
thewalkingdead,3d480v,JDriley,2,Mon Jul 13 20:56:15 2015 UTC,Except it is an airborne pathogen? Everyone is already infected and will turn on death.
thewalkingdead,3d480v,AstralFoam,5,Mon Jul 13 14:06:02 2015 UTC,That is no way of knowing that it is an airborne pathogen. Just that everyone is already infected. It could be on the water source as well as far as we know.
thewalkingdead,3d480v,Zerei,2,Mon Jul 13 14:11:10 2015 UTC,True. I just looked around to see if Kirkman ever confirmed it was airborne and nothing. So that's the big assumption since everyone is so readily infected.
thewalkingdead,3d480v,AstralFoam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's never been defined in TWD, but could get a definition in this show."

I liken the zombie virus to the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s (which I am old enough to remember very well). There was a lot of misinformation going on, but it was misinformation that fell on the side of too safe. Also like AIDS, you don't die from AIDS. You die from another infection that you can't fight off because of the AIDS. The zombie bites are like that. You are already infected; the bites are just a super infection that kills you."
thewalkingdead,3d480v,RegressToTheMean,2,Mon Jul 13 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"To me that's the most important part of why it would spread so quickly. It's not obvious that you're infected until after you're bitten or die some other way, so I would think that it would take a while for anyone to put the two together."
thewalkingdead,3d480v,ubergrog,3,Mon Jul 13 19:18:55 2015 UTC,I heard that the writers were mad at themselves for having that one zombie use a rock against the window. That was the last time it happened.

It's not like surviving a zombie apocalypse would be fun.  Like, if you think it's fun to try to survive without civilization, go camping or something like that. If you think it'd be fun to have to kill and run away from ravenous beings that are actively trying to eat you 24 hours a day, I can assure you, you'll get sick of it when you see your friends, family, and countless others get torn apart, when you can't sleep because you're worried about getting surprise attacked (like at the camp in Season 1), when you have to take turns 'on watch' every night where any mistake or lapse in alertness could get you and your companions killed, when you run out of bullets, when you don't have a GPS and don't know if the direction you're heading has people, safety, or even water (and I imagine you'd be constantly dehydrated)...  I mean I can go on like this for a while. Literally everything about a post-apocalyptic zombie life would suck. I'd probably rather just get hit by a bus."

And spoiler to the web episodes but it seemed as if Rick was being taken care of and that could've gone on for an extended period of time.  IIRC it was on the commentary from season 1 (it's been a while so don't quote me) that Kirkman said the zombies don't run but can get up to a pretty good speed and like I said that was referring to the season 1 zombies.  But at the same time during the same ""walking dead universe"" the web episode about Bicycle Girl I believe shows running zombies that look similar to the ones we'll see in the new series and Bicycle Girl decomposed for a decent amount of time before Rick found her.    Edit: spelling and English"
thewalkingdead,3d480v,call_me_cthulhu_,10,Mon Jul 13 14:12:54 2015 UTC,"Well he simply wouldn't have survived for very long in a coma without care (water/food) so he couldn't have been out for very long.  Not much more then a week maybe two.   That said, the hospital was probably functional for up to a week or two into the outbreak as well (we don't really know) so the total timeframe may have been a month from start of it all to when Rick wakes up.  Bicycle Girl may have already been a corpse for awhile at the start, leading to her appearance."

That was a ""we can finally not hide our banging"" sex. Rick was a nice guy and Shane had known him for years.  I bet before the Apocalypse Shane was the lovable asshole everyone is friends with and is comfortable with their level of assholery but there is an underlying malice to that person, jealousy and entitlement.  Shane wanted Ricks life, his achievements, his family.  He had been working on Lori for a while and was more than likely the wedge that drove them apart.  Shane was driven mad by not being able to lead, still living in ricks shadow.  After the world goes to shit here comes rick to keep you down some more."

thewalkingdead,3d480v,celica18l,3,Mon Jul 13 21:27:50 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for both seasons to start!   Situational dilemma with zombie outbreaks as a whole though.  If you take the Romero route where the zombies are supernatural, then the shit hits the fan everywhere all at once, and i can visualize that.    If it's biolohical/viral/weaponized/whatever, the pragmatist in me says they'd have to unleash it it densely populated areas, hence LA for FTWD.  However, even if you hit every population over 500,000 people, vast areas of the country would be unaffected.    I live in Morgantown, wv, pop 20,000+, 50-60K with the students in town.  The closest place to me that would be afgected would be Pittsburgh.  That's rougly 90 miles.  At a pace of 2 to 3 mph, it would take days for anything to reach us, weeks probably because no Z is going to make a beeline down the interstate.    How do you think this would affect outbreak scenarios.  I'd have time to head deeper into the mtns, family farm, arm and provision myself.  That far back in the middle of nowhere, Wv, it could be possible to not even SEE a zombie."
thewalkingdead,3d480v,wvmtnboy,3,Mon Jul 13 19:03:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting premise, regarding the population hubs. My thoughts go to the thinking that if I were in a city that started to get infested I'd be hightailing it out.  I think it would be at that point, where you are (ninety miles away), that i would stop to let my family stretch their legs.  Get some meds for granny, who has been ill, since we left The Burgh.  Open the back of the minivan and Zombie granny jumps out bites me, the kids, the wife and the frat boys from the University.....ta-dah we have an outbreak in Morgantown.

Even when rick woke up, it was already a while into the outbreak based on the state of cities and some of the walkers we saw.

thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,spwf,18,Tue Jul 14 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your ""unpopular opinion"". If you haven't read the comics then how do you know how much/little it differs from the show?  Most of the show feels ""anything goes"" to me. So many characters are either show-exclusives or completely different from their comic book selves. While the overarching plot tends to find itself back on track with the comics, isn't that what the tv show is about? Do you feel like Game of Thrones shouldn't follow at least the overarching story of ASOIAF?   I'm looking back and sooo much of the major TV arcs were so different from the comics. Season 1 was half comics/half show. The Dixon brothers, Carol, T-dog, and Beth never existed while Andrea and Dale might as well been given new names for how little they reflected the comic. The CDC thing is tv only. Basically all of Season 2 at the farm was TV exclusive. The jail/governor situation played out a LOT differently. Terminus never happened so all of Season 4B was new. Hospital stuff was totally new. The cannibals were a thing but it was handled a lot differently. Now Alexandria is happening and everything still feels really new.   It's a really interesting experience. On the one hand I know ""spoilers"" but on the other the show has proven that they're willing to do their own thing. It's like watching primetime TV fanfics."

thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,Giotar,2,Tue Jul 14 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"Most people are actually praising the shit that is taken almost verbatim from the comics. I know so many show-only fans that hated the TV prison storyline after reading the comics and talk about how much more badass it was. And yeah, the cannibals ended up having a home base where they trapped people which I felt worked a lot better than them just wandering around their neighborhood to find people. But that's the thing most things work when they follow the comics closer and some don't when they don't."

thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,DeepSouthTJ,5,Wed Jul 15 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"I'm stoked for season 6 as well. I watched the trailer five times, lol.  I started reading the comics a few months ago and am now current to #144.  While it's fun reading them, it's taken some of the intensity out of the show for me.  I always have a future glimpse of what might happen, rather than being genuinely surprised or shocked.   It won't stop me from reading the comics though. The story is too good.     That said, the show varies greatly from the comic in many ways.  I believe a few people gave some examples."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,Jilly33,4,Tue Jul 14 10:20:51 2015 UTC,"As a comic fan that thinks the show sucks, I am pretty hyped for the new season. The trailer seems good, and I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Hoping for another S01 quality season."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,exteus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:12 2015 UTC,Why didn't you like the show?  I'm just curious.  I just became a fan this past New Years when they were doing a marathon for the mid season premier.
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,Jilly33,2,Wed Jul 15 10:07:24 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason is that I am comparing it too much to the comics. A lot of the characters are useless, and have little to no character development, and the story arcs move really slow with too many fillers where they are just walking through woods and talking about stuff no one gives a shit about. The comics are fast-paced, without rushing anything, and keeping the characters and the plot consistent at all times. I am not attached in any way to any of the characters in the show, and if one of them were to die, I wouldn't even nudge an eyebrow. Compared to the comics, where there is not a single character I would not feel SOMETHING for when they die. Oh, and then there are the ridiculous zombies in season 5, where their heads are made from paper, and their brains from jello... The main reason I liked season 1 so much was because it seemed to go in a different direction with the zombies, make them still have that tiny aspect of humanity left. After Darabont left, the show started going downwards."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,exteus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:33:35 2015 UTC,"That's so funny because I enjoyed the fillers, lol.  I liked seeing the characters even at boring times and am attached to them.  Zombies are another story though. I could really care less about them and consider them more of a background threat to the larger threat of people.  I like apocalyptic stories set right after the fall of society, so this show has been a winner for me in all respects."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,Jilly33,2,Thu Jul 16 10:19:18 2015 UTC,"Dude, this show is about 12% similar to the comic in terms of story and characters. And you're kidding yourself if you think these writers can pull off anything halfway decent without drawing from Robert Kirkman's story."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,TheEld,10,Tue Jul 14 04:31:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly, just look at the Beth/Hospital arc."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,BleedTheFreak_23,3,Tue Jul 14 05:06:35 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, there is a hint at the Hospital arc in the comics.  In the comics, the beginning of Alexandria was eerily similar.  They even mention that a character named  was killed.  Having rewatched Season 5, I don't think the Hospital Arc is bad when it's watched back to back.  It did feel a little drawn out though while waiting a week in between episodes."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,framauro13,2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:22 2015 UTC,That's funny because the new season deals with flashbacks maybe to Alexandria's finding.
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,CommunityFan_LJ,4,Wed Jul 15 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"Just because they added something new doesn't make it 100% different from the story. That arc didn't change the path of any character other than Beth or the fact that they headed towards DC. Of course it effected characters in a way that didn't happen in the comic through pure emotion but it didn't effect the drive and story.   I do realize the show has many differences I wouldn't agree with the low number of 12% though. But I guess that depends on how deep you go into the aspects. The path and places they go is almost 100% similar, with some added detours. The hospital and Terminus things are just added while still following the main track 100%. Quarry-> farm-> Prison -> Alexandria."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,LookaBox,6,Tue Jul 14 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"His point was that the hospital arc was terrible, not that it's 100% different from the story."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,TsarNab,0,Tue Jul 14 15:58:35 2015 UTC,12%? More like 90%.

Honestly as much as you don't want to, you should read the comics if your going to be comparing them to the show. because your clearly missing out on a lot. ""anything else goes"" the show pretty much already does that, as someone else pointed out. Still doesn't add up to the excitement I felt from reading the comics. The show is Fucking Awesome! don't get me wrong but let me just put it this way... THE COMICS ARE FUCKING INSANE! I wish they showed more than half the stuff in the comics on to the show. sooo yeah when you finally warm up to it I suggest picking up the 1st compendium give it a shot you won't regret it. Easy reading and lots of wonderful art. may i suggest reading it to the walking dead soundtrack(orchestral soundtracks/various artist from show) you can find walking dead music playlist on spotify. Music fits the comics just as good as the show in my opinion, really puts you in the mood of the story."

It's a good story that deserved its own tv spinoff. The best part about being a reader is you know the general outline, but this show is so different that it really keeps you guessing. So I would totally recommend it. That being said season 6 looks awesome. I'm really excited to see the extent of confrontation between Rick and Morgan. I know the trailers are misleading but we know they have two completely different outlooks on Alexandria and this world as a whole. Morgan seems to have taken a lighter tone, but he's been on his own for so long he takes as much company as he can get. Makes me wonder if he'd be more like Rick if he still had his own family to protect."
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,Lehnaru,-3,Wed Jul 15 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, regarding the TV show only, I really preferred what Frank Darabont had in mind for it over what Kirkman and the people at AMC have done with it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great show, but season 2 was pretty patchy with him gone (the beginning in particular coulda been so much better) and the show really didn't recover (imo) until halfway through season 4.  The show and the comics are different mediums, and this is different from the GoT showrunners butchering GRRM's original story, as the TWD tv show actually tells a good story nonetheless... different, but still a good story on its own - and not that it matters much, but this is coming from someone who has read the comics from when they first released and has spent hours arguing and complaining about GoT's differences from ASoIaF. :P"
thewalkingdead,3d7pc5,LookaBox,6,Tue Jul 14 08:01:21 2015 UTC,"Frank Darabont was altering Kirkmans universe. Walkers picking up teddy bears as if they had ties to their previous memories. Walkers using rocks as tools to break glass. Walkers climbing fences being far more in control of their motor systems than they actually are. And, dear god, the CDC. He was changing the physics and universe that Kirkman made for the zombies. Darabont was turning it into a clique zombie world one that everyone was familiar with and he thought they wanted to see. Kirkman didn't and doesn't seem to want to explain anything about the virus/fungus/germ/space joojoo that caused this. And Darbont was already trying to hint at it within the first 6 episodes of the show.  In a zombie universe once you begin to hint at an explanation of the cause you head towards an end. That's why zombie movies do this cause they need to have an end within 3 hours. And that is also why they get boring and predictable as a genre in the movie medium. Clearly zombies are not an ""original"" idea but Kirmans universe was special and unique in the sense that we didn't and still don't have any idea what this is. Instead we can get past our need for closure and reason and enjoy the story. We also don't have to worry about convoluted science based plots. Instead we get to enjoy a world with seemingly no hope that is based off a new primitive way of life that is loosely using the technology that once existed. Not explaining the cause let him get as far as he did with no clear sight of an end, which I am happy about."
thewalkingdead,3d6bfl,mlpiceking,6,Mon Jul 13 21:30:34 2015 UTC,I had no idea they already made this into a show. The casting seems on point along with the location. Kyles house looks straight out of the books. The trailer doesn't seem to say much other than the fact that it looks like it will follow the 1st issue. I'm a sucker for supernatural type stuff and Kirkman churns out some good material so I can say that I'm pretty pumped to catch the pilot considering nothing gets held back from the 1st issue. I highly recommend this comicbook if you have not read it yet.
thewalkingdead,3d6bfl,Piercethedickish,3,Mon Jul 13 22:26:12 2015 UTC,Yeah this was in the works like within the release of the first 2 or 3 issues. Maybe even right off the bat with the first.

Especially an entire episode.    There's been enough issues with filler material in this show, and I get the feeling that's all these flashback sequences are really going to offer.   With the amount of material they currently have at their disposal from the comic books, there is no reason they shouldn't be just pushing the plot forward.    The problem is David Alpert and AMC want to drag the show to be at least 12 seasons.    Maybe I'm wrong and the flashbacks will actually be both entertaining and important to the story, but given the history of show I just see them being used as filler to drag things out more."
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,amphetaminesfailure,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"Thought the flashbacks were to provide back story to events that happened in the comic but were never fully explored, for example Alexandria before they exiled anyone perhaps."
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,reKSanity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"A bigger problem, I think, is that they want to fill up 16 episodes, and that's just a recipe for disaster. The seasons are too long. They need to be shorter, more season 2 length. Only then, I feel, will we be more rid of filler than ever before."
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,TsarNab,4,Mon Jul 13 20:45:57 2015 UTC,Don't they film the two halves of the season separately? It's already kind of like doing two eight-episode seasons.
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,loklanc,0,Mon Jul 13 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"That is a valid point, and I appreciate the input. However, even with the two eight-episode halves, I believe the problem is still existent. You start a point A at the beginning of the season and you need to get to point B by the end of the season (or half season). I think of season 5A as an example. By the end of episode 6, they could've gone straight into the midseason finale. Everything had been wrapped up, as I saw it. We knew why Carol was being wheeled into the hospital in episode 4 (and also in episode 4, we found out where Beth's been all this time in that episode as well). We got Eugene's confession in episode 5. And we know who was with Daryl at the end of episode 3, and now we're headed back to the church for reinforcements. It was the perfect time for the finale. But there was only one problem: We were only on episode 6, and we had two more episodes to fill up (or one more, minus the finale). I don't know about you, but I see ""Crossed"" as filler to hold us over until the finale. The writers needed to fill up 8 episodes the first half and they had already finished their story, before the finale, in 6 episodes, so they threw in a filler for episode 7. Now, if the season were shorter, the midseason finale could have been episode 7, like it was in season 2, without the need for ""Crossed"". That's just how I look at it. Admittedly, they did well with season 5. Every episode in the second half did something to contribute to the story, so that was well done in that regard. On the whole, however, I just can't escape the feeling that things would be tighter with fewer than 16 episodes, more along the lines of Game of Thrones' 10-episode seasons or Breaking Bad's (usual) 13-episode seasons."
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,TsarNab,-1,Tue Jul 14 04:28:09 2015 UTC,"12 seasons?! Seriously!?  I like the show, but they are going to need to up the ante if they want to keep up the quality of the show. This isn't a random sitcom here."
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,RIPN1995,-1,Wed Jul 15 03:47:11 2015 UTC,"I thought the exact same thing when I first read that's what David Alpert and AMC had planned.    It's pretty much unprecedented for these type of show to go on that long.   Here's what I find really scary.    This is the article: http://screenrant.com/walking-dead-plot-season-12/   “I happen to love working from source material, specifically because we have a pretty good idea of what season 10 is gonna be. We know where season 11 and 12…we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we’re lucky enough to get there.”   For them to have seasons 11 and 12 already planned out for the plot, that must mean they plan on dragging out current comic book story lines.  And keep in mind this article is 13 months old, it came out a couple days before issue 128.    So I'm afraid they plan on dragging out the story a fuck ton.

Fuck you, Gimple. That's not what we fucking want. Fuck that Governor shit, man. Move the story forward, don't get it stuck months in the past.  Prediction 1: Enid origin flashback. We see some shots of Enid entering Alexandria all dirty, and one of her hiding underneath a sign. Perhaps we'll learn about her backstory. Now I don't see how that's particularly important in any fucking way whatsoever because I don't care for her character and I don't care for the whole her and Carl thing, but we'll see.  edit 2: On second thought, that's unlikely. He said he was working on that episode at the time of saying that, but at the time of his saying that, the trailer was already released, meaning whatever episode with Enid in it had already been shot. Thank God. That rules out an Enid episode."

thewalkingdead,3d5khs,ColdCutFries,0,Tue Jul 14 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it feels like a waste of an entire episode. She's not important enough to warrant an entire episode. Even the Governor's episodes were dubiously important, at best. It's just a waste of time. The writers need to find better ways of exposition than episode-long flashbacks. It's only a way to fill-up the 16-episode quota. I say this time and time again, but 16 episodes is too long. If we had shorter seasons, there wouldn't be as much of a need for such pointless filler episodes as entire-episode flashbacks."
thewalkingdead,3d5khs,TsarNab,2,Tue Jul 14 08:35:00 2015 UTC,"You're right about Enid not being important enough to have an entire episode to herself. But I think that perhaps later in the season/series, once we know more about her, it might be a good idea to have a short flashback scene for her. Just to get a little more information about her background. But as of right now, you are right"
thewalkingdead,3d4nkm,yellina,10,Mon Jul 13 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Fair, it will be an entirely separate story and show. Personally, I'm more excited for Fear than WD season 6. I sorta think the show needs a new ""kick"", whether it be a fresh look, (in my opinion) stronger character development, etc. I've grown less interested in WD since Season 5, I feel as though I'm much less emotionally connected to the characters. The past few characters that have died (no spoilers), I was more or less feeling ""meh"" about. Much different than previous seasons IMO. Even the drama and struggles seem to happen too quick to be fully emotionally invested.  So Fear presents a new viewpoint, a new cast, and a new shot to getting sucked into the universe again. Ultimately I think people will always compare and contrast, which is somewhat fair since they're the same universe, but I agree it's important to keep in mind they're separate entities.   I still think a level of discussion and contrast between the two is important, though."
thewalkingdead,3d4nkm,Skatinbrad,2,Mon Jul 13 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"I agree OP. It's going to be a completely different show. Different people, different environment. Some people will like it and others won't. If you go into it expecting the walking dead, you'll hate it from the beginning most likely."
thewalkingdead,3d4nkm,FLYyourFREAKflag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:48:08 2015 UTC,"I won't be comparing the two. But I will be comparing FTWD to every other zombie movie I've seen, because it looks just like all of them. They're going to have to do something new with the outbreak-escape formula, or this will be the most pointless show. I have seen every scene from that trailer, in other zombie movies. The trailer even feels like a trailer for another Dawn of the Dead remake. I hope they prove me wrong. I want to love this show."
thewalkingdead,3d4nkm,KeredYojepop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"You just wrote a paragraph comparing the two. Not about why we shouldn't.  Also you said   There is no question that Rick's group is the better at surviving. They're more cohesive. They're better fighters.   You and everyone else haven't seen a single episode from the show how can you say this? Of course they will seem like they suck at surviving, mainly because it will start from the beginning of the outbreak. In these universes everyone is helpless and clueless when it starts. But assuming the show will last longer than 2 season main characters will arise. They will not die. And they will prove to be resourceful and competent."
thewalkingdead,3d4nkm,LookaBox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:25 2015 UTC,Just head over to the True Detective sub to see what lies ahead if you constantly compare two different series. A total shitshow and a middling sub.

Count how many prison issues there are when you finish that run and see how long they're at the prison."
thewalkingdead,3d6w5s,AlphaNeonic,4,Tue Jul 14 00:10:42 2015 UTC,The show also spent a lot of time on the farm due to budget.

They just kept on with the highschool drama bullshit. In the comics it was quick, in and out with more crew, but the show was trying to be all ""we've found a place to live"" which was too soon for season two. Season three and the first half of four were really good though."
thewalkingdead,3d6w5s,TheSlothFather,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"AMC forced them to stay on the farm because it was cheaper to film there.  As for the pacing, the show has to account for seasonal breaks and fill up 16 episodes per season."

thewalkingdead,3d6w5s,Try_Another_Please,2,Tue Jul 14 05:56:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Prison was, if I'm not mistaken around like 13/14/15 all the way to 48. At one a month, that was a LONG time."

Kirkman had a chance to move on from Alexandria after it got destroyed in the war against Negan, but he chose to have the survivors rebuild it instead.

thewalkingdead,3d2sx3,Galp_Nation,23,Mon Jul 13 01:56:02 2015 UTC,They would never show an important person's death that close up in a trailer.  Someone could easily freeze frame it and figure out who it is.
thewalkingdead,3d2sx3,matt-vs-internet,4,Mon Jul 13 11:07:35 2015 UTC,I know they don't really stick with the comics but Maggie is a pretty big character in them so I don't think they'd get rid of her unless she wants to leave the show.

thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,rustyfork87,15,Tue Jul 14 09:01:32 2015 UTC,"I woud disagree.  You've got to look at it from Rick's past and his emotional connection to each.  Glenn and Darryl have been there with Rick since the beginning.  Michonne has become Rick's conscience and an almost second in command.  He trusts them the most out of everyone so it would be reasonable to use them.    Daryl has proven himself worthy to Rick over and over again.   He stuck with Rick even though he had such an emotional attachment to his brother.  Rick was the ""cause"" of Merle losing his hand but Daryl stayed with the group.   Rick is an intuitive guy and knows that Daryl needs this.  Daryl is someone who is emotionally scarred in a lot of ways from his youth and needs stability.  Glenn saved Rick's life in the beginning and got the approval of Hershel to marry Maggie, and Rick valued and respected Hershel, so nothing more needs to be said about Glenn.  Michonne was ""cleared"" first by Carl.  She also saved Rick's life when he was being choked out by the governor.  And no, it's not a dumb thread.  I've been a subscriber to this subreddit for just a short time but it's one of the first I've seen without the same talking points.  Good job :)"

It is Ethan Embry's character trying to get Rick's group out of Alexandria."

thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,nitro1ne,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:55 2015 UTC,Daryl lately has been getting a little too soft but he has done a lot before this point in the show. Michonne proved herself to be trustworthy when she told Rick to keep the gun in the finale. Glenn however has not even killed anyone yet. I would definitely substitute him out for Carol but she is being a CIA agent right now so he can't let people know she is one of the most badass people in the group. Probably Abraham instead of Glenn.
thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,Pumpkinpilot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Unless Carol isn't around anymore at that point in the show... Her exile from the prison was never dealt with by the characters, and there needs to be some backlash to finish the story arc.  ""Saving Rick and the Gang"" seems too cliche for their characters."
thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,bishizzzop,2,Tue Jul 14 21:35:02 2015 UTC,She is around. She has made it to season 6 which is when Rick will be giving that speech.
thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,nitro1ne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"just because Daryl doesn't have to be as hard now as he has been in the past doesn't mean he couldn't turn it on if he had to.  It's a luxury in their world to be soft, and he's embracing it while he can.  I know the question has been,""can you come back?"", but just because you come back doesn't mean you forget, not only what you did but how you did it and what circumstances might call for you to do it again.  Same for Glenn, this is the same guy who killed a walker with his bare hands and ripped the walkers arm bones out to make shivs with.  He was ready to kill, he just got beat to the punch. IMO, Glenn is as hardcore as anybody on the show."
thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,Pumpkinpilot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:38 2015 UTC,I don't buy it. Being soft isn't something you should want or something you should try for when you have a chance. Being strong is something every character should want to be all the time. Remember when Glenn went to try and save that crazy guy at terminus? Remember when he just recently let Nicholas live instead of killing him like he should? Glenn is soft now. Anyone can kill walkers on this show now. That is not badass. Being strong means being able to kill people and not have moral qualms about it when those people are bad.
thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,bear6_1982,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"I guess that's what makes this show a little more realistic.  Anybody who has ever really killed or harmed others wants not to do it anymore (unless they are a sociopath or some kind of sadist).  People get PTSD, even for killing people who are clearly about to kill them(soldiers, police officers, etc).  Much as it might seem badass to be able to kill without a conscience, it isn't real.  Now, nobody is claiming that the zombie apocalypse is real, but what makes the show compelling is that you can imagine yourself in that position, and part of that means wrestling with our consciences.   Coincidentally, I know some very strong people, people who have killed with their bare hands in real life, and I can tell you that they relish a chance to relax.  They are out of the life now, and they have told me that they have never been happier.  They want some sense of normalcy, they want to not have to spend all day up to their elbows in blood, their own or someone else's.  Characters like you are proposing are not characters the audience could connect to because deep down anyone who is honest with themselves knows that determining who is good and bad isn't always that easy. Part of us knows that if we were in that situation we might do what had to be done but we don't pretend that it wouldn't affect us in some way."
thewalkingdead,3d8fcq,Pumpkinpilot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be crazy to not feel bad after killing someone who you know is truly evil. There ARE people who do not feel bad after defending themselves or killing awful people. That doesn't mean those killers are crazy. That means they have a strong mind and a strong will. Not everyone has to be traumatized after killing someone they know is bad. For example murderers and rapists ARE bad people and killing them would not be a bad thing.   I get that in real life it may not be black and white as to who is good and who is bad, but on this show it is pretty much always black and white as to who is the evil one and who is the good.  The characters can still relax in the safe zone of Alexandria while not becoming weak and changing their ideology which is what Daryl seems to have done. For example with the concealed guns thing. You can relax and still be okay with being able to protect people if the time comes. Being in a safe zone does not mean completely letting your guard down and never preparing for the future.   I wouldn't say the show is realistic for that. Not everyone loses their shit after killing people justifiably."

thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,laidbackpk,3,Sun Jul 12 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see why this sub allows discussion for 3 separate venues of content, but there's such a controversy over allowing another.  at least it would dilute the endless clutter of paparazzi/photoshoot shots of the actors."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,SuperBattleFranky37,8,Mon Jul 13 04:19:31 2015 UTC,That's sort of like saying Dany T and Jon Snow should have their own subreddits because their stories are completely different and taking place on different sides of the country.
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,THEcasanova,-3,Sun Jul 12 22:52:36 2015 UTC,Siblings shouldn't have their own subs.

thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Gareth_hornwood,4,Mon Jul 13 11:27:04 2015 UTC,"That could probably be solved with some post flair. I personally have no interest in the comic/graphic novel, but enjoy the show."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,lifefindsuhway,13,Sun Jul 12 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"That's absurd.  Why should we cater to people with no interest in something they have never seen?  That's such a selfish position to take, there are plenty of people willing to give the show a fair chance and we should instead make sure the people who don't want to be ""inconvenienced"" are able to ignore it?  Fuck them."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,The_Iron_Zeppelin,-41,Sun Jul 12 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"If something on Fear has some sort of impact on TWD then post away but I don't see why Fear episode discussions should be here.  We don't post the official comic discussions here, or at least in haven't seen any.  Isn't this sub for the show?  If we had an overall walking dead universe sub then fine but I thought this sub was for the show and should generally stick to that, as far as official posts at least."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Scapone22,45,Sun Jul 12 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"... The comic discussion for the latest issue is literally the top post right now. It's stickied.  No, this isn't the sub for the show. It's the sub for The Walking Dead in its entirety. It's always been the sub for the entire TWD universe. There are posts for the show, comic, game, and any other small TWD thing that one could make a post about."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Neutralgray,-8,Sun Jul 12 19:56:22 2015 UTC,Doesn't show up on my front page despite me subscribing though you're right if I go to the actual sub it's there. Weird.

thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,swishmon,8,Sun Jul 12 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"There are comic discussions on this sub if I'm not mistaken.  A new issue comes out every month, instead of every week like the TV show though.  I've also seen posts about the TellTale Game on here as well.  I'm mot sure if they have their own Sub or not. I think including FearTWD on this Sub gives more content to discuss, which sometimes can be lacking here in the off season of the main show."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,The_Iron_Zeppelin,9,Sun Jul 12 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Its for the show and comics, and FTW is the same universe so why should it be treated as less? It looks great! Why is everyone casting it out before they've even seen it? Sounds so stubborn and selfish, just give it an actual chance.."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,tommy4991,-3,Sun Jul 12 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to watch it, looks awesome, but I'd like it to have its own sub and have the main posts about it stick to that."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Scapone22,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"May I ask why? Honestly why? it just seems unnecessary. That's just my opinion. I honestly want to hear why you think it should be on a separate sub. I just don't see a point, maybe you can help me see otherwise :)"
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,tommy4991,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:33:03 2015 UTC,"Clutter, for one, but mostly it's that I'll regularly unsub and resub to keep spoilers and such away since I am unable to watch stuff live.  It's easier to manage this if everything has a different sub.  I don't frequent subs usually, but use my front page.  I'd rather not lose Fear content if I miss a walking dead episode for a few days.  I feel like a lot of the people giving me shit in this post for wanting to keep the subs separate are the same people who would jump on someone who complains about spoilers.  They'd say don't come on the sub or unsub if you haven't seen it.  I'm just trying to manage my content without seeing spoilers and this whole site is based around breaking up content into subs.    Maybe having a walking dead universe sub (this one) and subs for each show and the comic separate would work. but whatever it isn't a huge deal regardless."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Scapone22,3,Sun Jul 12 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"Fair answer, I would actually prefer a subreddit purely for the comics. unless there is one, I haven't heard of it. I feel there isn't enough comic discussions on this sub, not saying there isn't any(there's a good handful) but I would love to see more. so I hear you dude. And maybe if they were split up, it would give more room to discussion solely on that piece(wether it be the original show,comic,or FTW) you made me see your point :) thanks. I agree with you. My only big concern was respecting them all as one sub since they are in the same universe, But I see your reasoning."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,tommy4991,0,Sun Jul 12 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I don't really feel incredibly strongly in either direction but I defintely meant towards breaking everything up.  It's not like I'm 100% against talking about Fear on these boards all together."

It'll be up to you & everybody else whether they want to submit FearTWD discussions and/or links to /r/thewalkingdead or /r/fearthewalkingdead or both (as far as I know, neither the mods of /r/thewalkingdead or /r/fearthewalkingdead are interested in controlling your preferences on this front)."

thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Rangsk,21,Sun Jul 12 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, there's going to be multiple threads to visit. Just like there's an episode discussion thread for Game of Thrones on /r/gameofthrones, /r/asoiaf, and /r/HBOGameofThrones. I usually go to all 3 (although I don't participate in /r/HBOGameofThrones because I've read the books and I respect their rules)."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,stophauntingme,7,Sun Jul 12 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"/r/Supernatural, /r/Fandomnatural, & /r/SupernaturalTV host episode discussion threads of the same new episodes of Supernatural. Nobody's particularly angsty about it. Not sure why they would be - just more places to talk about stuff :shrug:"
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Rangsk,4,Sun Jul 12 23:21:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I actually find it interesting what the different subreddits talk about and focus on. It's rarely the same things.
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,stophauntingme,5,Sun Jul 12 23:32:14 2015 UTC,I haven't really talked to the mods about it but I think it'd be pretty weird if /r/fearthewalkingdead didn't host new episode discussions of Fear the Walking Dead. It'd make equal sense (imo) for a subreddit that highlights all major news & developments of the entire franchise to host new episode discussion threads too.  Think of it like how a release from JK Rowling on the character of Snape would be legit submissions in both /r/harrypotter and /r/slytherin. /r/thewalkingdead is & will always be the umbrella franchise subreddit; /r/fearthewalkingdead is just more specific (& will probably serve as a supplementary subreddit for most fans). That's how I see it at any rate.
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,JoyousCacophony,5,Sun Jul 12 16:56:01 2015 UTC,Definitely will be discussion threads
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,NeoshadowXC,0,Sun Jul 12 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"if that's the case then the flagship walking dead show should also have its own niche page, right?  I'm being facetious, but also not really"
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,stophauntingme,3,Sun Jul 12 23:57:54 2015 UTC,":shrug: it could - somebody could try it; I don't care  /u/NicholasCajun made a great point about tv subs here - essentially Better Call Saul is a straight spin-off from Breaking Bad featuring many characters from Breaking Bad & it has its own sub. By that logic, FTWD has no connection to TWD besides the universe (doesn't even feature the same characters or location & doesn't follow chronology). So if Better Call Saul has its own sub w/o any problems, FTWD should definitely have its own sub w/o any problems."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,ToxicWaffles4U,5,Mon Jul 13 00:08:56 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why a separate sub-reddit was created for FTWD, everything regarding FTWD is going to be posted here anyway."

thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Espenlaub,23,Mon Jul 13 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"I mean it airs in august, it's not like there is much happening with the regular show during this time so this sub should be fine and as mentioned the mods are ok with it."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,The_Iron_Zeppelin,19,Sun Jul 12 19:05:36 2015 UTC,I think it should stay here to stimulate more discussion.  This sub already has some difficulty staying interesting when tWD is in its off season.  Having more content sources could help.
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,stophauntingme,4,Sun Jul 12 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"I think it should stay here to stimulate more discussion.   There's absolutely no danger /r/TheWalkingDead is going to exclude FearTWD from this subreddit. The sidebar image makes that pretty clear plus all the mods have consistently said this subreddit is for the franchise (which includes FearTWD).  If you don't want to subscribe to /r/fearthewalkingdead, right on: it's not going to ever be a necessary sub to subscribe to in order to converse about the show. That said, if you end up being a super hardcore fan of FearTWD and/or enjoy participating in smaller subreddits, subscribing to /r/fearthewalkingdead might be up your alley.  Nobody's forcing or fracturing anyone or anything anywhere here."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,IsaacBenning,51,Sun Jul 12 20:10:40 2015 UTC,My honest opinion is I think it would be pretty stupid to use a separate sub.
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,stophauntingme,-10,Sun Jul 12 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"Do you mean it'd be stupid if /r/thewalkingdead officially directed people to /r/fearthewalkingdead for FearTWD discussion/links? Because I totally agree -- that really would be fracturing. And actually anyone being nasty about splitting discussion & links from /r/thewalkingdead into /r/fearthewalkingdead would be fucked up imo.  That said, there are probably people who enjoy smaller subs and/or who will prefer FearTWD over any other aspect of TWD's franchise & thus might appreciate the show-only subreddit... and that's not really stupid. It's just a matter of taste/preference. /r/FearTheWalkingDead is likely going to be for those people.  Edit: deleted my edit"
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,cawleycl,4,Sun Jul 12 17:27:03 2015 UTC,So it's pretty clear from the response to comments that Fear will feature on this sub. And things Mods have said in the past.

Where's the trust & loyalty to Kirkman, Erickson, Nicotero, Hurd, Gimple, Alpert, etc. as the creatives backing this project & vouching for its integrity?  I'm pretty shocked by the lack of faith some fans have in the people that created, developed & produced the very comic & series they love so much (& for which they visit this sub for)..."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Dcajunpimp,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly they aren't tied to any previous characters or works.  They don't have to follow the comics in any fashion. Fans wont be upset because 'that' never happened.  They don't have to worry about making plots from the comics fit what's possible or affordable with current effects. They can instead create storylines to fit television better.  They can also kill off whoever, whenever since with a completely wide open story they don't have to worry about keeping character X alive any more episodes or seasons to get to some point in the future to coincide with the comics.  Of course in the current series they don't follow the comics word for word, but its still close."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,stophauntingme,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"My comment about this from this thread:    I just watched the SDCC FearTWD panel & Erickson reported the first season will cover the first 2-3 (maybe 4) weeks of Rick's 4/5-weeklong coma. I sincerely hope the first season will only cover the first 2-3 weeks & the second season covers the following 3-5 weeks of Rick's coma. If that were the case, the third season would be a match in time with TWD's first season.  I don't know what they're planning on doing to differentiate FearTWD with TWD once the timelines match up. Whatever it is, if it's after 2 seasons of watching the FearTWD cast, I'll probably be pretty attached to the characters & interested in their experiences/stories anyway even if they do roughly parallel TWD's."
thewalkingdead,3d0sjg,Tom_Rrr,2,Sun Jul 12 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"You can create a page that contains posts from both subreddits with RES right?

thewalkingdead,3d3ed8,Scienscatologist,4,Mon Jul 13 05:08:50 2015 UTC,"It could go either way.   On the one hand, it could symbolically represent the fact that Father Gabriel is trying to atone for his sins, aka leaving his parish outside to be eaten by walkers while he was safe and cosy in his church. BUT, white is traditionally used to represent purity, and Father Gabriel is anything but pure for the reason I just outlined above.   So, based on the implications of the colour white, you could say it was simple oversight on the producers part."
thewalkingdead,3d3ed8,thespoil,6,Mon Jul 13 10:07:36 2015 UTC,"I sort of see the symbolism of the white shirt as a kind of mocking of the idea of purity in this world, as it was being worn by a man who rejected his vows to the church long before Rick's group ever encountered him. The guy who preaches morality and wears the unblemished white shirt is the same shephard who turned his back on his flock-- who locked his entire parish out of their church and left them to perish. He's a mass murderer masquerading as a man of God. This is why it's an inversion of symbolism to put him in a white shirt in the first place-- he's lacking in the purity for which white usually conveys in a story. (Note also that in addition to the white shirt, Father Gabriel is always also in black. The polar opposite colors of his clothing indicate the duality of his personality.)   As for it not being bloodstained after Gabriel goes out to kill the walkers, I think it's meant to convey that in killing walkers, Gabriel was taking steps to live up to the values of a priest and protect the people of his community. (He goes backwards on all of this not too long afterwards, after he tries to sell them all out to Deanna but, at this moment, he was on a more righteous path.)

thewalkingdead,3d5769,ignoramus012,2,Mon Jul 13 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"Dead: Jessie (sorry Rick) and Ron (but not Sam, who is going to break Carol's facade eventually).   Totally Safe: Rick, Carl, Michonne, Daryl, Sasha (she has tons of places to go, story-wise, as she's barely even adjusted to Alexandria), Tara (they could have killed her last season but didn't because she's awesome), Carol (like Sasha, a lot of plot left before they'd think about killing her, also she's arguably the most interesting female character, if not overall character, on the show),  Rosita (they've barely scratched the surface with her character yet), Aaron (our most likeable Alexandrian and most likely to stick with Rick's group even if things fall apart; plus, his friendship with Daryl means his death would be kind of an unnecessary thing at the moment), Morgan (he just got here).  Surprisingly maybe more safe than not safe: Deanna (you'd think she'd die not long after she cedes power to Rick but I think she might stick around longer than expected-- the actress is great, the character is interesting, and it would be worth watching her attempt to reconcile all she's been through and figure out how to move forward. Plus, she could be Jesus' mom.)  Question Mark: Abraham (with all the buddies for Rick hanging around now, what do they do with Abraham? He could last for a long time or he could be killed off sooner than anyone else from his group, surprisingly); Eugene (on the one hand, he could last forever by being a bit weak and having others save him; on the other hand, he just got a redemption arc in saving Tara, which might indicate that he's walker food... except, well, he seems kind of useful and creative when it comes to tech, so maybe he lasts longer... could go either way), Spencer (he's pretty useless but Deanna did just lose another son and her husband, so he's probably going to stick around for a bit just to keep it from being totally overkill literally... though, if they kill off Deanna, too, then they might as well kill Spencer), Enid (probably will last at least through the first half of S6 and could last a lot longer... Carl's lost enough people and there's a lot to explore here but it kind of depends on what kind of story they give Enid-- whether she's involved with The Wolves or not, etc..), Glenn (baseball bat foreshadowing could have been a huge amount of trolling or it could not have been... part of me thinks that Glenn lives and the big death in the S6 finale is...), Maggie (never, ever burn the last picture a guy has of you. ever. especially when there's a pregnancy arc at stake. Maggie has a lot of potential story left but if they wanted to completely subvert the comics and split up that potential future story of hers into roles for other characters, then they could make her the eventual victim of you-know-who maybe in the 6B finale.)"
thewalkingdead,3d5769,JDriley,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"he seems kind of useful and creative when it comes to tech,   That's what I thought about Noah wanting to help with the architect dude. The way things are going, I think that's evidence that Eugene will die.  I think with the reveal that Eugene was lying already way in the rear view mirror, Abraham doesn't have a lot of story left. And the loss of his tactical acumen could also drive some story elements. Or he might just Daryl his way through the season."

thewalkingdead,3d5769,dangerous_k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:27:16 2015 UTC,I feel Abraham and Sasha should be replaced. Abraham already had like 2 episodes on his own and his backstory explained while Sasha has so much potential. I don't think they'd kill her without some more development.

thewalkingdead,3d5769,ignoramus012,0,Thu Jul 16 16:41:12 2015 UTC,pretty conservative death predictions. It's not just secondary characters that die.

thewalkingdead,3d5769,LoneWords,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"Carol is way more (comic) Andrea than Sasha. On the show the took Andreas comic version and split it into 2. Sasha got her role as the clock tower sniper, and she was in a relationship with bob (who got dales comic death, and dale/andrea were a couple there), but that's really it. Carol got the rest of (comic) Andreas traits. She's smart, strong, isn't afraid to make hard choices, is a leader, ricks 2nd in command. She's also a damn good shot too as we saw at terminus. Carol is way more like comic Andrea than Sasha. I think Carol is safe for quite some time."
thewalkingdead,3d5769,JDriley,0,Tue Jul 14 08:47:31 2015 UTC,I couldn't disagree more. Im not saying Sasha is more important. Im saying Sasha is being set up to take Andrea's role. She is definitely safe for the time being.

thewalkingdead,3d2mci,dan0314,11,Mon Jul 13 00:55:58 2015 UTC,The comic books was first written in 2003 and there has been 4-6 years passed in the comic book time. However Robert Kirkman has stated that he deliberately made the year the outbreak vague in order to prevent the comics frame being dated in later years. Also we don't know how much time has passed since the comics began as that has been vague too. 2 years had passed between issue 1 and issue 126 but the time skip between #126 and #127 people are unsure about because Kirkman has said that Carl is now around 13 (making the tie skip 4 years) whereas judging by Hershal Jr. the time skip can only be a max of 2 years. With that in mind the year #144 is set could be between 2007-2009 if the comic began in 2003 although Kirkman said that it could of started in 1980 or 2020 for all we know (he doesn't care for these sort of things).
thewalkingdead,3d2mci,AFishBackwards,7,Mon Jul 13 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. So in the end, nobody, including Kirkman, really know. Fine by me, I love his stance on his series."

thewalkingdead,3d2mci,RedWhiteStripes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:37:47 2015 UTC,1-126 is roughly two years. In Letter Hacks one of the repliers... I guess it would have been Sean? Said that it was a 2 year skip and that info spread pretty quick although Kirkmans stance on it is that he wanted the time skip to be undetermined. Just an X.
thewalkingdead,3d2mci,Tyranniac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:28:57 2015 UTC,The timeskip is at least 4 years since Carl is a teenager now.
thewalkingdead,3d2mci,RedWhiteStripes,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:27 2015 UTC,Thats what we think. Still it'll always remain 'undetermined' cause Hershel definitely doesn't look like a 4 year old.
thewalkingdead,3d2mci,Tyranniac,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:31 2015 UTC,Carl is specifically referred to as a teenager by Andrea.
thewalkingdead,3d2mci,TeethOrBullets,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, between Carl looking like he's in his mid-teens (no way he's 13) and Herschel Jr. only looking around 2 years old, Kirkman seems to have slipped up."
thewalkingdead,3d2mci,VerySharpCup,4,Tue Jul 14 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I can think of at least one scene in the comics which helps to narrow down the time frame. In this scene it definitely looks like a GBA, so definitely after 2001."

thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,GuyOne,2,Sun Jul 12 15:55:12 2015 UTC,The trailer has to be material all from the first half of the season. Hilltop's construction will probably be ready in time for filming like the last few episodes. After the trailer I'm starting to think we might not even see the Saviors till the last episode of season 6B or even the beginning of season 7 at this rate.
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,bobsaget0013,2,Sun Jul 12 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"The trailer is from episodes 601,602,603,605 and 606. It looks like No Way Out and We Find Ourselves will be the majority of 6A. We'll get introduced to Dwight in the episode that has Daryl getting captured (606) and we'll probably see the reveal of Dwight with a new burn and Daryls crossbow near the end of the season in maybe episode 14 or 15 (after we've seen the Hilltop for a few episodes). Let me just say that they wouldn't have started construction on the Hilltop if we weren't going to see it this season. No way they would build it a year in advance  If I had to guess I'd say they probably will extend Negans arrival till 7A finale as opposed to the 6 finale. That doesn't necessarily mean that we won't see the saviors till Season 7. I'm guessing they'll be the last few episodes of this season.The pacing up until the end of the season should be pretty fast though which is great news"
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,Acid_Gamer,0,Sun Jul 12 22:00:16 2015 UTC,The trailers are usually just the first 3 - 5 episodes.  I think we won't see the Hilltop until the first half of season 7.

thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,CraZMinecraft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:54:30 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks Negan won't be in Season 6? I'm thinking the Season will end with them reaching Hilltop. Maybe we'll get a Negan name drop at best.
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,Jilly33,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:54 2015 UTC,"My prediction:  I think The Saviors will be the major adversary in this season and the Wolves are just the small speed bump on the way to getting there.  I am going to wager that the Wolves will be a small conflict with the Alexandrians in the first three episodes, leading up to what will be the larger conflict with Negan's group The Saviors.  A lot of times, the TV version has added different groups to the show that were not in the comics or not portrayed in the same way as the comics and this shouldn't be any different.   More or less, it seems that they add these things just to fill in story line, to create drama and to keep the TV series going slower and lagging far being then the comics can be written.  The fighting with The Wolves is probably what is going to lead the zombie hoard to Alexandria either by Wolf design or unintentionally.  After Rick and company knock that back, they will kill off the Wolves, deal with some internal issues in the community and we will lead into the second half of season 6 with The Saviors.  The comic story of Negan and the Saviors really has to be brought to the TV series one way or another.  Negan is such a compelling character, a great antagonist to Rick and the fans are desperate to see it brought to the screen.  I can see Scott Gimble changing some things around like he did with the Governor;   like maybe the name of the group, where the group lives, different characters or how they act in their own group but I don't see how he could not include this story as a major plot line in the second half of season 6."
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,Jilly33,4,Sun Jul 12 13:51:40 2015 UTC,I don't know if they'll introduce the Saviors quite yet. I don't think the show will have both the Kingdom and the Hilltop but I think they'll have one and they have to introduce them first. At the very earliest I think the comic #100 thing wouldn't happen until the last episode of the season and then the Saviors would be the big bads for a couple of season ending the show on All Out War.
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,S31A,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:27:34 2015 UTC,"True, introduction of either the Hilltop or Kingdom must come first and that alone will take about three episodes to really delve into, if they are going to give either group a major part of the plot and/or The Savior conflict.    I'm guessing the Hilltop because the Kingdom has a ""corny"" feel to it with all of the Medieval Times dress and talk.  It probably won't translate well to the screen.  Unless of course, you make them look insane, lol.    Re-thinking it, you're probably right that The Saviors won't be introduced until the very end of season 6. If that's the case, the writers are going to have introduce plot lines that are not in the comics that will also eat up space after the mid season break (think flu outbreak in the prison) to avoid stagnation and keep the drama up.  Gimple has stated that the show reinvents every 8 episodes .  Although the amount of episodes for season 6 haven't been announced, the last three seasons had 16 each.  If season 6 follows the path as the last three, we're looking at 16 here.  At the mid season premier they will face a new threat since ""the show reinvents every 8 episode.""  What that is, is what the big question is.   Could you clarify your last sentence?   ""Ending the show on All Out War.""  Did you mean ending the season?  If you meant the show in general, I think it's hard to make that determination at this point.  We have no idea where the story goes in the comics. We have The Whispers right now and that could get really good seeing that Negan is still alive."
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,SimplyMe94,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:10:25 2015 UTC,Yea I was talking about the show ending. I think the show has to end within 2-4 years just because tv shows don't last longer than that without their audience getting tired of it. Shows like Doctor Who or Star Trek get away with it because they basically reboot the show after a while. After a while TV show watchers just want a conclusion to the story and All Out War seems like a really good spot to end it even though the whisperer stuff is really good.
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,chronye,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:30:04 2015 UTC,I don't think they would end it with All Out War. That isn't even halfway through the total comic material. There are lots more interesting stories to tell
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,danny-rauger,3,Sun Jul 12 16:32:01 2015 UTC,All Out War is pretty far into the comics. I'm just looking at it from a tv show story side. They have to end it some time and popular shows tend to run 6-9 seasons. All Out War was huge and ended where there is hope for the future. I'd honestly be shocked if they go any further than that.
thewalkingdead,3d0dz4,ziggurqt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"I hope it doesn't end with All Out War. The Whisperers storyline is easily the best thing the comic has ever did, I'd hate for that to be left out."

In the final scene, a despondent, broken Rick, the last man standing and at his last ebb, finally collapses.  Moments later, he arises as a walker and shuffles off into the herd.  As the theme music swells one last time, the camera pulls back and we see a gargantuan herd, stretching to the horizon.    The end."
thewalkingdead,3d00v6,Pretentious_Rush_Fan,87,Sun Jul 12 14:03:47 2015 UTC,seeing Rick turn into a zombie like that would fuck me up

thewalkingdead,3d00v6,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,15,Sun Jul 12 17:29:03 2015 UTC,The current comic arc is going to determine whether or not that holds true. They're exploring the idea that all their efforts and victories are really pointless and serve to only prolong inevitable decay of civilization.  We'll have to wait and see how the situation is resolved before we can conclude if the point of the whole story is really overcoming disaster or fighting a losing battle and eventually succumbing to it.

thewalkingdead,3d00v6,SenorMcNuggets,-7,Mon Jul 13 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"I like this, but feel that it doesn't need the walls.  Counting only on-screen walker kills (which I feel we can assume are mostly the non-routine ones, as well as the minority), we have several members of the group with over 100 walker kills to date.  If 99% of humanity turned, that means every unturned person needs an average of 99 walker kills to eradicate the threat (assuming precautions taken upon natural death to prevent more).  Let's go to a further extreme where 99.9% of humanity has turned.  That's 999 walkers for each unturned human.  With 137 on-screen kills, and probably many more off-screen, I'd guess that Rick has made a huge dent in his quota for ridding the threat of walkers.  The show so far has covered about 2 years.  I'd guess that by the time Carl is Rick's age (in 25-30 years), survivors will have manged to account for their 99-999 walker quota.  That's assuming only a 0.1-1% chance of no turning initially.  Obviously, there is some wiggle room because there are most deaths than just the initial outbreak.  But I think it's still pretty reasonable to say that Carl's adult life will be spent rebuilding an effectively walker-free society more so than killing walkers and surviving.  TL;DR - Probably no walkers, so no walls."
thewalkingdead,3d00v6,MaiaNyx,8,Sun Jul 12 11:46:52 2015 UTC,"The common accepted ratio is 5000 to 1. At least at the beginning.   Obviously birth rates are going to be very low, if any at all, for a long while while death rate will slowly taper and we'll be left with the most physically/mentally capable humans in leadership roles managing the people that have somehow been able to hang on.   The walkers won't really be an issue when Carl is in his mid-late 20s, sure, but other humans and resources will not only be scarce, but highly sought. Walls will go up. They'll have to, to protect what resources and people a community has.  Also, as far as we know, the walker threat will never completely go away. To return to normalcy, communities will have to settle how to manage the old, sick, and outside meandering, even if lone, walkers and other threats.  Alexandria would have a great setup with some reworking of wall construction and defense, but it's pretty good for a group of people that really have no idea what's going on outside their walls.   It's going to be imperative to protect what children are left, and babies will have to start being born for this to not be a full extinction event for humans.   Rambling now, but tl;dr - still some walkers, internal walker transition will be highest threat though, walls necessary to protect resources and the children."

How did he survive for 2 months alone in the hospital without food or water? He surely would have died of dehydration long before he awoke. Why wasn't he shot by the soldiers who were clearing out the hospital? Did they see him and acknowledge the fact that he was already dead?  Maybe he did die, but for some reason the virus affects him differently. Maybe instead of turning and re animating as one of the dead, it somehow preserved him and allowed him to return to life. If I'm not mistaken, there were other occasions where he seemingly returned from the brink of death. Like after the prison when he was alone with Carl.  I don't know. Maybe I'm just overthinking the whole thing though and we're just supposed to accept the fact that he survived 2 whole months without food or water because TV."

New groups are showing up life is as crazy as usual. The main group starts to move large distances (towards Canada or to South America) And they hit a point where they see a massive wall very high and very long. The people behind the wall allow them through. When they pass the wall they see life as they knew it. Buildings, cars, large groups of living people. The outbreak was only effecting a large portion or all of the US. And the rest of the world walled them off. They were just fiddling around in circles and accepting their life in the infected US. They thought everyone in the world was dealing with what they were. Didn't really come up will all the semantics of how the US was only effected. Something along the lines of, it hit in the US the hardest while other parts of the world had more time to solve the problem. The US was a lost cause due to how the sickness worked so they box them off.  When we were talking about it bouncing things back and forth we also thought that when Rick and/or Carl ( whoever Kirkman want's to be left ) shows up and they are just to far gone. They let everyone who wants that life to go back to it. But Rick/Carl instead say goodbye to those who move on. They are not able to accept it and are not able to get past what they lived through. The doors of the wall close and they head back to live and walk with the dead. The only world they can function in."

They slowly progress up as the horde pursues them from behind. One by one they perish, leaving Carl and Rick alone near the top. Carl is taken, absorbed into the horde like he never existed.  Rick backs into an office door before entering, barricading it with a desk and standing with his back against the window as the horde pushes forward. He is visibly distraught, pacing back and forth. He points his revolver towards his head and squeezes the trigger but there is no sound, no ammo. A blank stare comes over Rick as he moves towards the door, readying to move the desk and become one of them, so he can finally rest.  When looking down on the door handle he sees the sun’s reflection as it begins to rise from the horizon. Rick turns around and walks up to the glass, admiring the view as a single tear falls down his face. He drowns out the sounds of the zombies and walks back towards the doors, still staring at the sun. The door bursts open just as Rick sprints towards the glass, already weakened from bullets, and breaks through. Rick tumbles through the air in slow motion, falling to his death. As the sun covers half his face he looks back at the skyscraper and sees some of his friends, now part of the zombie horde.  He falls for an eternity, coming to terms with his journey that has suffered many losses. He lands on a military tank, the same one he was stuck in during the first episode, breaking his spine and countless other bones. Blood begins to fill his mouth as he struggles to breathe. From within the tank he hears a faint message “Dad, I made it. Where are you?” Rick smiles as he takes his last breath, his teeth covered in blood. The rising sun illuminates zombies that begin to consume him."

Then it shows walker rick in a timelapse of sort walking across the united states, becoming more and more decayed. Talking about how the human form will always decay, that it is just a matter of time. Contrasted with walker rick slowly getting more decayed is human civilization, showing scenes of medieval villages, aztec kingdoms, british ships and american hollywood in the 1940s. Eventually walker Rick is so decayed that he falls down and stops moving, likewise we see evil dictator Carl alone in a battlefield of his fallen soldiers, who falls down and bleeds out, revealing he had been shot."

thewalkingdead,3d00v6,regready,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"Although my ending prediction is a variation of the ""passing the torch"" my version is a bit lot more depressing.  Of course the ending will be focused on Rick Grimes...  primarily the story is his. It began with him, and it shall end with him.  I'll get straight to the point: I think by the time the final season comes around, Rick's metal state will have become so corrupted by the world and 'bad' people around him that the line between friend and foe will begin to blur. He's going to sway, turn, change from the man we all know into the very thing he fears. The change will of course be gradual for believability but I think it will happen. He's been endlessly praised and with good reason, by so many people... more and more people will believe in him over time. It's almost as if he was destined to be a leader, to do great things... and he has done great things for their community. But all good things come to an end and he will slowly turn into an Antagonist.  More specifically, I think we're going to see some pretty brutal and unnecessary stuff from him as time goes on - he's going to get darker and he's going to change. By this point, beating up wife beaters will be absolutely nothing to him, it's barely the tip of the ice-berg. I think the Comic is already going in this direction, as is the show. The brutality of the world in combination with meeting people like The Governor, Negan and others will slowly change his ideals, methods to ultimately transforming him into [from the groups eyes] a threat, a threat to everything the group and he himself as the leader have strived to acheive. I truly believe this is how Rick's story arc will go and climax in the long-run. At the end of the series it'll be clear... clear that while he managed to beat all his enemies, create and maintain community and garner the respect of many... the most powerful force had still beat him... the world. The final antagonist will be the last nail in the coffin, the trigger for this transformation for Rick to go all the way... this ruthless person will push him to this inescapable state. Rick will end up killing the antagonist in the end but not just at several sacrifices but unnecessary sacrifices. He's going to do something which he deems justifiable that the group deem as unforgivable. There won't be no 'cliche' redemption here, the group will have to deal with Rick in some way or another.  This is where the rest of the group will come into play but primarily his son, Carl. Throughout the series in both the show and comic we've seen him make questionable decisions and you would think because of those decisions and how his arc as progressed that he'd be the one to become the ""threat"" - But I actually think he's stronger than Rick in some ways. He will take matters into his own hand, shoulder the burden of the consequences of his Fathers actions and do what should be done.  Here's a analogy for any Star Wars fans. I see Rick as Vader and Carl as Luke Skywalker. Anakin overtime gave in to the hate and became what he feared. It was through the environment and the people around him that triggered this change. Whereas Luke was tempted by the dark side, he never gave in to it, he was stronger than that and stronger than his Father. Carl is the same, while he has and will continue to be tempted by the brutality of the world, while he will continue to show shades of the 'darker' side we all know he has... he won't succumb to it. He'll beat it. He'll become a stronger and smarter Rick, more accustomed to the world as they know it, he'll have the skills he's learned from the group members over the years and ultimately he'll do the very thing his Mother knew he would do.  ""You will beat this world"" - Lori Grimes.  Carl will kill his father, bury him and form a new and stronger council with more suitable rules, stricter consequences and generally just more accustom to the new-world they live in rather than the old-world which the old-council suffered from.  ""Ain't No Grave"" by Johnny Cash plays as the credits roll."

The group of survivors is now a small city, nearly a thousand strong. Carl's son is now the same age Carl was at the beginning of the series.  One lone walker makes it into the city, biting people, who then bite more. in the end its just carl, his son, and rick. Before the zombies close in, the police come and arrest everyone."

thewalkingdead,3d00v6,Finding_True_North,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"I saw this in a thread awhile back but it stuck with me:  Basically we reach a point where Rick is an old man and dying of natural causes, having lived a full life. Carl and Judith are grown up and happy with families. While Rick is on his death bed with his loved ones surrounding him, everyone comes in to say their final goodbyes and such.   As his final moments come close he turns over to his bedside table where there's a vase with fresh flowers (mimicking the beginning of the series). As he's dying Carl and Judith are there holding his hand, all getting very emotional.   Rick then finally dies and Carl steps up to be the one to do the necessary action of stabbing a knife through the side of his head.   The camera pans out of the room and eventually out of the house to show a massive town surrounded by other settlements. It then pans out to a statue of Rick standing ontop of a hilltop. Where there's a plak that says ""we can come back from this"" or ""Never Forget Rick Grimes"" something along those lines.  I think that would be awesome ending.. but lets face it, Rick will probably die at one point, in some gruesome fashion. Its Carls story afterall."

One by one the characters are falling until only Rick remains. Suddenly a loud horn blows and the walkers freeze where they stand. Rick, panting, sweating, looks around nonplussed. Flood lights turn on one by one and a sliding door opens to an applauding audience. Whole thing was an intricate game show. Few years after the outbreak, they figured out how to control the walkers but the population had gotten out of hand so the very few humans left in the world created this heinous game for entertainment."

thewalkingdead,3d2t4p,Giotar,4,Mon Jul 13 02:21:05 2015 UTC,"Season 4, in my personal opinion, is miles ahead of Season 3. I believe Season 3 is the weakest by far.   Season 4, on the other hand, was actually what made me believe in the show again. A new writer took over, and he has been the series' saving grace. Since Season 4, the episodes have been much more consistent, the characters are stronger and for the most part better-written, and the writing in general is leaps and bounds better.   Season 4 is definitely worth watching. It sets the pace for Season 5, introduces a lot of new themes and elements and showcases a lot of outstanding character development, and plus it has some of the greatest episodes of the series ever, and you'll be missing out on some absolutely amazing moments if you skip over it. Episodes 8 and 14 contain some of the greatest moments in television that I've ever seen, but they won't mean nearly as much without watching the entire season.   Do what you wish, but you'll be doing yourself a massive disservice by skipping over it. Season 6 won't be premiering until October, which means you have quite a while to catch up and watch Seasons 4 and 5 before the new season begins."

After watching Clear, I was optimistic about the future of the show, but the fact that the Governor was kept on for season 4 instead of being killed in the s3 finale really rubbed me the wrong way.   I guess I never really got hyped up the same way again and I never watched season 4. I've heard season 5 is fantastic television, so I'll watch s4 for that reason alone.  Hell, I watched 8 full seasons of Dexter. I can make it through anything."

thewalkingdead,3d0e8e,GuyOne,3,Sun Jul 12 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"This is what I'd do if I were you. Buy compendium 1 and 2. Compendium 3 should be out in September (or October, can't remember the exact release date). This is the cheapest route. Then I recommend watching the release dates of the issues and head to your LCBS (local comic book store) and start getting issues from 145 that way you'll have compendium 1, 2, and 3 plus monthly floppies from 145 on. You won't miss an issue.  Just don't read those floppies until compendium 3 comes out."

Unless it's a commonly used abbreviation (e.g. USA or UK) the first time you use it you should type it out in full, with the abbreviation in parentheses afterwards, and then from that point on you can just use the abbreviation.  Sorry, BA in English."

I only became a fan of the TV show this past year during a New Year's Day marathon of TWD that was leading up to the mid season premier.  I've been acquiring and reading these comics at a mindblowing rate and have now caught myself up.    145 will be the first issue after Compendium Three.  At the end of  every comic, they do a Q and A with Robert Kirkman and fans via fan letters.  At the end of 144, during this Q and A, Mr. Kirkman stated that the ending of this comic was the perfect place to stop for the third Compendium.

thewalkingdead,3cz140,AhTreyYou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, play BL1 if you can, I just meant a synopsis would be enough to understand the references in Tales. Still, BL2 is better than 1. More story, more content, more humor, MORE GUNS."
thewalkingdead,3cz140,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:59:57 2015 UTC,Sadly that'll depend if they port the first one to PS4
thewalkingdead,3cz140,AhTreyYou,4,Sun Jul 12 17:14:45 2015 UTC,I just wish telltale would focus on season 3. I probably wont even touch the Michonne game. Telltale does make dank games though. I recommend checking out The Wolf Among Us if you havent already.
thewalkingdead,3cz140,downztiger,5,Sun Jul 12 09:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to it. I love the expansion of the comic universe with the games and novels, and these games can give Michonne some needed characterization. And instead of having her tell us all about her journey, if the story allows it to even be brought up again, we get to see it firsthand alongside her and new characters."
thewalkingdead,3cz140,SpaghettiSnake,2,Sun Jul 12 10:10:43 2015 UTC,I think The Wolf Among Us is right behind season one of The Walking Dead as Telltales best game. I've downloaded the first 4 episodes of Game of Thrones but haven't played it yet. I'm 100% okay with TTG making this Michonne mini-series because I'm a comic reader and because TTG won't disappoint us when season 3 comes.
thewalkingdead,3cz140,AhTreyYou,2,Sun Jul 12 16:17:40 2015 UTC,The game is supposed to tell her story on where she was in the comics for this period she was missing.
thewalkingdead,3cz140,Nathan_Sexplosion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:33:55 2015 UTC,Oh I was thinking it would be the origin but that pretty interesting.
thewalkingdead,3cz140,SpaghettiSnake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"There is a special mini comic (like 8 pages) that shows her right at the beginning of the outbreak and how she acquired the sword. There is also one for the Governor and one for Morgan. I think there was a last one for Tyreese, too. Although I think Michonne's is the only ""origin"" story."
thewalkingdead,3cz140,Webberino,0,Sun Jul 12 18:55:48 2015 UTC,Season 2 was enough I would like to see the game from a different characters perspective

thewalkingdead,3d1qfn,DavidDontDiveNoMore,2,Sun Jul 12 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be Michonne, unless we start seeing more Kingdom characters that are leader material. Not that Michonne is or anything but she would rightfully be next in line after Ezekiel.   I still don't know how I feel about all group becoming leaders... is it corny? Or is it Kirkman just showing us that after what they've all endured that they're the only ones that qualify for the positions?   Regardless I think it'll be cool to see the Sanctuary election."
thewalkingdead,3d1qfn,RedWhiteStripes,2,Sun Jul 12 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"I had always seen it as this:  Rick's group survived this long because each member of the group was absolutely best at what they did. Leading, scavenging, killing, constructing, hunting, etc. So naturally they'd become leaders of each area once entering Alexandria and eventually leaders of the communities."

thewalkingdead,3d4dat,daspaceinvader,5,Mon Jul 13 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"Your theory makes a lot of sense especially if they wanted to line up #100 with Ep 100. But man, that's really drawn out.  We like our post apocalyptic drama... But we don't want to turn it into a soap opera."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GuyOne,-1,Mon Jul 13 13:54:50 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be rushed though.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GuyOne,6,Mon Jul 13 14:58:08 2015 UTC,Never said it should be rushed. The pacing now is almost on par with the comics. A little slower cause the show is expanding on situations that only lasted one or two issues in the comics.   The pacing feels really good right now.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,adhal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying, the way the pacing is now is great and if we keep going at this pace I don't think we'll see Jesus until the cliffhanger of this season/into season 7."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,adhal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping sooner, they would really be drawing it out if that's the case, zombies overrunning Alexandria should be no later than midseason jesus shortly after. I think that Negan would be the final episode of 6. Negans story arc is long at the pace your suggesting they will drag Negan out for 3 seasons...   You could be right though."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,bobsaget0013,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:04:10 2015 UTC,"""No Way Out"" is such a big story arch though, why would they try and cover it in just a couple episodes? Of course everything I'm saying here is just my own opinion, but I'd like to see the first half of six be focused on the wolves and the rebellion and then maybe the mid season finale is the herd starting to get into Alexandria and we'll have No Way Out for the entirety of the second half with the cliffhanger being Jesus.  Everybody wants Negan NOW but they don't take the time to think we still have so much to cover... if waiting until the first episode of season 8 for Negan is ""too slow"", I wouldn't mind his first appearance being the mid season finale of seven but that's ONLY if we have enough time before then to cover the attacks by The Saviors prior to his appearance. I can't stress it enough, we NEED NEED NEED that period of time were people are just talking about Negan and the viewers, ESPECIALLY the more casual ones who don't read the comics, are left to be like ""wait who's Negan?"". It's essential, it's the ONLY way to introduce Negan."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,danny-rauger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"No way out was only 6 issues (79-84), you can only drag something out so long. Literally if they wanted to they could do it in 2-3 issues and drag out some of it....  I'm also confused by why no way out is such a big deal for you, are you confusing it with something else? It literally starts as soon as the season starts and they better not drag 6 issues into 16 episodes. The only real big event is the zombie attack..."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GamingTatertot,4,Wed Jul 15 02:40:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that it shouldn't be rushed, but waiting and stretching Jesus until Season 7 seems like too long to me. No way they wait that long my friend I'm sorry. If that were the case, we'd cover barely 13 or so issues this season. That's like barely any. And no way out takes 6 of them, and this part of the comics would probably translate to two episodes max. And from the looks of the trailer, the rebellion and some of ""We Find Ourselves"" will be in 6A.  I'm sorry man, while I agree that they shouldn't rush Negan, I don't think dragging out this part of the story would happen or work out well for them(fans would be pissed). I honestly could see Jesus appear with his binoculars as early as the mid season premiere   Besides, they've already started construction on the set for the Hilltop, and there's no way they would've started building that already if they were going to reveal the Hilltop in Season 7.  Hilltop will be around sometime in Season 6  And finally, as for Negan, I think the Season 7 mid season finale would be a fitting time to introduce him. Have the first half of the season be the introduction of the Saviors and several skirmishes, then 7B will be ""What Comes After"" and ""March to War"". This leaves Season 8 for All Out War"
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GamingTatertot,0,Mon Jul 13 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think the mid season finale cliffhanger/maybe the end of the 6b premiere would be the ABSOLUTE earliest he should show up. It really depends on how 6b is handled I guess. As for the Hilltop it's very possible that they're building it now in preparation for season 7, I believe they've actually been known to do stuff like that."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GamingTatertot,3,Mon Jul 13 16:39:01 2015 UTC,In the comic con trailer we see Rick giving the speech he gave Nicholas in the comics when he tried to rebel. And the comic con trailers generally only show clips from the first half of the season. And there's still a whole half of a season after that so I think Jesus is coming this season but not until some point in 6B.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GamingTatertot,-1,Mon Jul 13 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"I'm telling ya, season cliffhanger. I'd put money on it if I could."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GamingTatertot,0,Mon Jul 13 13:38:34 2015 UTC,I'd put money on Negan being the cliffhanger.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,GamingTatertot,0,Mon Jul 13 15:46:54 2015 UTC,You think Negan is gonna be the season 6 cliff hanger? No way.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:18 2015 UTC,Unless Gimple REALLY wants to stretch out the story and make fans hate him...then I'd put money on either the Saviors or Negan being in the season finale.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,ItsmeSploorky,-2,Mon Jul 13 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Negan totally will not be in this season, I could see them having The Saviors in the finale the way they had the Terminites and The Wolves at the ends of the past two seasons though depending on how the rest of season six goes. I just don't want any of it to be rushed, that's all. It needs to be handled the right way and Negan shouldn't be rushed in to appease impatient ""fans"" who don't care about the integrity of the story or the characters involved."
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,SomeKrazyGuyUKno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:25:45 2015 UTC,Except it isn't certain to be rushed. Hilltop can totally be done in the 8 episodes that is 6B.
thewalkingdead,3d4dat,CP-Munk,0,Mon Jul 13 17:27:19 2015 UTC,Idk... I think I just have to see how 6A pans out first. Just like all of you I really care about this story and I need it to be done right.
thewalkingdead,3czseq,RuthlessPro,10,Sun Jul 12 07:10:28 2015 UTC,"While the twist you did to have Rick do Walter White's speech to Skylar from Breaking Bad is fitting, the line in the trailer is actually a pretty big one from the comic.  Here's the comic version. Some spoilers: ""You're taking the community back? Really? From Andrea? From Abraham? From Michonne? From Glenn? From ME? Do you have ANY fucking idea who you're talking to?"" - Rick Grimes  I can't wait to see how they reinterpret it here."

It was Dawn trying to ""teach"" Beth a lesson about who matters  now in this world, who's important and who's not.  It went:  Officer Dawn Lerner: Every sacrifice we make needs to be for the greater good. The second it isn't, the second we lose sight of that, it's all over. The thing is, you're not the greater good. You're not strong enough.  Beth Greene: I am strong.  Officer Dawn Lerner: How many people had to risk their lives to save you? In here, you are part of a system. The wards keep my officers happy. The happier my officers are, the harder they word to keep us going. And this hasn't been easy. There have been compromises, but it's working. And after they rescue us, we're gonna help put the world back together. Because we're the ones holding on. That's the good we're doing here. That's the good you're doing here. That makes you worth something. But out there... you are nothing. Except dead or somebody's burden.  Beth Greene: That's bullshit.  Officer Dawn Lerner: Oh, yeah? I saw this the night you came in.  [referring to the cuts on Beth's wrists]  Officer Dawn Lerner: Is this bullshit, too? Some people just aren't made for this life, and that's okay. As long as they go take advantage of the one's who are. 1 of 1 found this interesting | Share this  Officer Dawn Lerner: You know, you shouldn't see this as a sentence. I'm giving you food, clothes, protection. When have those things ever been free?  Beth Greene: I never asked for your help.  Officer Dawn Lerner: But you needed it. Try to look at the good we're doing. Hard as it was, we saved Joan's life. Trevitt's life. We saved your life. I'm keeping us all going here. That is not a small thing. It's taken a lot to get us here, Beth. And I believe what we had before all of this isn't over. And when we're finally rescued, when this nightmare ends, we're gonna need to rebuild.  Beth Greene: You don't really think someone's coming for us?  Officer Dawn Lerner: There's still people like us, Beth. People trying to keep the world alive, to fix it. Until then, we all have to contribute. To compromise. If we take, we give back. It's only fair. So keep working off what you owe and you'll be out of here in no time. If that's what you want.  Beth Greene: It is.  Officer Dawn Lerner: Well, then you have to eat. Otherwise, you'll get weak. You won't heal, you'll require more treatments, and you won't be able to do your job. I know you didn't ask for this. I didn't either.     Beth is saying she gets it now. She's sacrificing herself for the greater good.  She's part of a system that is making this world work.   The ""greater good"" being killing that evil bitch and dying herself if necessary. What set her off was when she said to Noah, ""I knew you'd be back.""  Noah was saving Beth and Dawn took at as if he wanted to be there. It was an insult to him and Beth.  She ""gets it"" that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for that ""greater good"" but also Dawn needed to be gotten rid of for that ""greater good.""  Second question:  It's thought that she was either aiming for the head and Dawn's quick reaction thwarted that or she knew that any act she took would be a chain reaction.  She'd die by Dawn and Dawn would be killed by one of Rick's group."

thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,Jackthastripper,2,Sun Jul 12 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"Huh...  Seems a far cry from the comments six months ago decrying the ""lazy writing"" of that scene.  I guess time is the great equalizer."

thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,Jilly33,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:31:23 2015 UTC,Yep. You should have seen the episode discussion for it on here.
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,Irishman318,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:34:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay.  I just subscribed to r/walking dead recently.  I never had considered that there would be a subreddit for it.  I happened upon it a couple of days ago so I'm new here, lol."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,Jilly33,9,Sun Jul 12 20:14:35 2015 UTC,"Well it is pretty hard to kill someone by stabbing them in the head with scissors that small honestly.  It is one of the more confusing lines.  I have read it described as her realizing that Dawn was in a game about power.  Her garbage about trying to help people and stuff was nonsense.  Dawn wanted to have the leg up, and she could not feel like she lost.  Something akin to that.  People will probably explain it better eventually but that's what I've read.  Honestly, idk."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,HalcyonWind,6,Sat Jul 11 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"I think the same as you. However I don't think Beth was a complete idiot. She knew how to kill someone. How the fuck did she think some baby sized scissors would do anything to Dawn? She knew better, it just felt half-assed to me."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,kombatk,5,Sat Jul 11 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"That's the strange part of it.  Perhaps she knew and realized that this was a world she did not want to be in anymore.  Instead of complying with it she gave up her life knowing how her people are.  I don't think that is a reasonable answer, but it is one I've heard.  The entire scene is just weird."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,HalcyonWind,3,Sun Jul 12 00:26:49 2015 UTC,"She was trying to kill Dawn but didn't realize that it wouldn't work. When she said ""I get it now"", she meant she understood what was needed to be done ie. kill Dawn. That at least is my interpretation of it."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,AFishBackwards,5,Sat Jul 11 20:55:50 2015 UTC,i just watched this and I think she knew she would die. She knew that dawn would shoot her and that would end with her group killing dawn.  She 'get' what she would have to do so the hospital would be a good place again.
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,daysz,2,Sat Jul 11 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"I thought ""I get it now"" had some correlation with when Dawn said that everyone ends up back in the hospital (Noah left but was going to stay and let Beth leave; since Rick's group had been in the hospital, so Dawn might have followed them)"
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,2chainzrules24,2,Sat Jul 11 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"By ""I get it now,"" people are saying that's Beth's response to Dawn saying ""they always come back."" (referring to Noah.)  People are also saying that Beth aimed for the neck with the scissors, but since Dawn is trained in policing and scissor attacks she redirected the stab to her chest.  Pretty dumb scene, anyway.  I wish they would kill off characters with good scenes that make complete sense."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,eyepants,2,Sun Jul 12 00:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah...did anyone else think this entire sequence was dumb? I mean, Dawn bluffed by demanding Noah back. Rick could've simply called her bluff; Dawn was a terrible person but probably wouldn't have opened up a firefight just because an outsider disrespected her.  This video review basically sums up my feelings about the entire thing. To me, the entire hospital plot was pointless considering that Beth's sacrifice is sort of made invalid as soon as Noah was killed off later the season."
thewalkingdead,3cy2a8,TomBonner1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:44:22 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that Beth felt Dawn was using her as her ward because Noah was gone.

Just like this ""90 minutes"" long episode won't be 90 minutes.  People have a right to be disappointed when they advertise falsely like this."
thewalkingdead,3ctx7d,swiper33,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:16:51 2015 UTC,Well then I guess it's a cultural thing.  Any North American (I'm Canadian) with half a brain in their head accepts that a 90 minute episode doesn't actually contain 90 minutes of content.

Probably RED or Sony something, but I believe I've seen canon DSLRs used as well, since I think they only output in 1080p for FullHD TV.  Breaking bad was shot on film, I don't know about Better call saul, but they had to do a lot of night stuff on breaking bad and were able to get it without noise on film, IIRC.  So, No. TWD would be measured in the Terabytes."

thewalkingdead,3ctx7d,ghostbackwards,40,Sat Jul 11 03:30:47 2015 UTC,"No, about an extra 20 minutes of content.   In a normal 1-hour show, there are 42 minutes of content and 18 minutes of commercials. A good way to think of it is in multiples of six. There are six 7-minute chunks of content and six 3-minute chunks of commercials. Obviously that's reworked some for longer intro scenes or a very climactic final sequence, but the math ultimately usually works out to 42/18.  For a 90 minute show, it becomes about nine 7-minute chunks of content (63) and nine 3-minute commercial breaks (27)."

thewalkingdead,3d2m8q,Prof-Professore,2,Mon Jul 13 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"The Fear trailer was awesome. And you have a point with the trailer having some cliche things happen, but that's just the first couple episodes or season. Once the shit hits the fan, we will have a Walking Dead type show in the middle of L.A. instead of rural Georgia. It will be awesome. There won't be so much walking around the woods lonely, it will urban warfare where survivors are plenty. It will be a whole different vibe. I'm hoping it won't be a sad sob story where every finale ends with a character death. It will be interesting to see how the opposite side of the country is experiencing the outbreak."
thewalkingdead,3d2m8q,Tssjr225,7,Mon Jul 13 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I think the difference in the two trailers boils down to the fact that we know the characters and backgrounds of TWD and we know what JUST happened so they are able to make the trailer pop a little more.  With Fear, they are starting with scratch and also trying to build hype for characters that we have no relation with yet.  As such, it requires a softer buildup in the trailer."
thewalkingdead,3d2m8q,chbailey442013,3,Mon Jul 13 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, different strokes, but I'm actually super pumped for FTWD after seeing the trailer for it. I was not looking forward to the spin-off when they first announced it, but the trailer really peaked my interest. It seems really intense, and I'm glad that it's not involved with any other mediums so fans won't always be comparing the two. It'll be its own separate entity, and I'm looking forward to that. I'm not expecting it to be as good as the original TWD, for that would be setting the bar pretty damn high, but I'll be going in with an open mind and hoping for the best."

thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,TZMouk,17,Sat Jul 11 21:34:11 2015 UTC,"No, not really. He's way way way more unstable in the comics (at one point he bashes his head against a building for no reason). He also  in the comics."

When Morgan says ""get out"" and it goes to Rick... Rick is in a different area of ASZ.  These two will be yin and yang. I have a feeling Morgan might personify rick's sympathy and Rick will personify Morgan's anger and they'll be a perfect duo."

thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,VenomTalks,5,Sat Jul 11 07:52:15 2015 UTC,"Damn, I hope you're right.  That trailer bummed me out.  Morgan has always been a special character, because in the beginning you are rooting for him to respond to the radio messages rick sends out, and when he never does it really sets the tone for how the show is going to go.  So I was really excited when we found him (relatively unhinged) in Rick's old town, and then again when he was on the move along the railroad line.  TLDR, I've been rooting for Morgan to show up since the beginning of the show, and I'm hoping he and Rick can get along this season."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,CoffeeNut22,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hope so too. I really think they'll get along because of their history. You gotta remember Rick saw Morgan at his worst in ""clear"", so Morgan can't really hold anything against him, he was a killer too and it wouldn't make sense for him to judge Rick just because he's a Buddhist monk now haha."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,VenomTalks,2,Sun Jul 12 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Also, Morgan should understand that you have to do whatever it takes to defend your family, since when Morgan failed to kill his walker wife, she came back and ate his kid.  Because of that, I feel like Morgan will understand Rick's perspective just fine haha."

thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,dajoeker,8,Sat Jul 11 08:52:07 2015 UTC,I knew it from the beginning They always do this. Of course Rick and Morgan will have some disagreements but not to the point where Rick holds a gun to Morgans head and Morgan is ready to throw Rick out.

thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,Jimmy_Freaking_Page,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:46:12 2015 UTC,It could never have worked long run.  If we essentially turn Rick and Co. into hostages without weaponry.  Throw in some hostages left behind.  Could be interesting.  I never thought it'd be under anything but duress.
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,HalcyonWind,3,Sun Jul 12 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"I never thought it'd be under anything but duress.   I realize that but it would have been really lame writing.  We have the group who has gone through 4 seasons of basically getting fucked over hard for long periods of time until they are finally able to rise up and overtake whoever is trying to kill them.  Finally, at the end of Season 4, we have a new Rick, who is extremely confident that the Termites are ""screwing with the wrong people.""  That means he wants them taken out, and he wants them taken out right now.    After building hype like that over an offseason it would have been lame as hell if it was just, ""Well, we are going to be hostages for half of a season, THEN we are going to show them that they are screwing with the wrong people.""  No.  No negotiating, no temporary alliances, no ""biding our time,"" just all or nothing."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,Jimmy_Freaking_Page,5,Sun Jul 12 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"The big reason it's obvious that the trailer is misleading? If you watch the panel, I think it was Nicotero said ""as all you fans know, we often intentionally make our trailers misleading"" when asked about Rick vs. Morgan. So, there you have it.  Ninja edit: Someone clarified in another comment, it was Gimple, not Nicotero."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,Vindicater,2,Sat Jul 11 16:53:07 2015 UTC,The scene where it looks like Rick is pointing a gun at Morgan is mirrored from earlier in the trailer.  Peep the sign on the wall behind him.
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,ResidentSmartass,2,Sat Jul 11 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"I think he might be talking to one of the wolves because at the end Rick says ""Do you have any idea who you are talking to?"" and Of course morgan knows rick. So it has to be someone else, maybe its that dude Ethan (New character) who is going against rick."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,ethant64,2,Sat Jul 11 20:10:23 2015 UTC,I think it's going to be hilarious when this is the trailer that is not misleading at all and everything they insinuated actually is true.

I have a feeling who Rick was talking to when he said ""You have no idea who you're dealing with"" is a captive from the Wolves.  In the comics, they take a hostage from Negan's group after the first assault on Alexandria.  I think they might be changing the story around a little but trying to keep similar things in play."

Also in S4, they tried to have us think that Darryl and others were going to split from the prison group and go off on their own."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,TerryYockey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:04:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, so many shows do this.  I'm assuming the lines Rick and Morgan said were either directed to someone else in Alexandria or the new main villain.  As a show watcher but not a comic reader (yet), I'm curious who the it will be."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,AdventureArchivesTV,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:47:03 2015 UTC,I still think Rick will be banished. Why else would the trailer start with him running his ass off down a road. They drop him off and he hightails it back just in time to save the town from either the wolves or the herd.
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,DukeofKick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:30:24 2015 UTC,"""You leave and you don't come back"" cuts to similar looking background with Rick, or ""You think you can take this place from Daryl, from Michonne, from Glenn... from me?!"" cuts to similar camera angle of Morgan.  If the show takes its cue from the comic, they're most likely talking to and about Nicholas or someone else who has taken that story line, although I don't see that happening as the show has already put Nicholas on the front lines of being ""anti Ricks group.""  As we all know, in the comics, Nicholas does a half assed ""take back Alexandria from Rick"" campaign."

So, things aren't definitely going to be peachy-keen between them but I don't think we're gonna see them duke it out either. I'm pretty sure I know who Rick is talking to when he gives that short speech while he has his gun drawn. Thanks Issue 89."
thewalkingdead,3cw0b1,VirulentViper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"When he says ""We have to stop Rick"" the ""Rick"" line is obviously added and not said by Morgan originally."

""Clear"" may have a been a few seasons ago, but in ""TWD time"" it probably hasn't been longer than a few months ago (if even that long) that Morgan was for real batshit crazy. I don't think that all of a sudden he's going to magically be some sort of all-wise, all-knowing man with a plan that will be able to convince anyone he knows best. Deanna (who some of the residents listen to and respect) even seemed to side with Rick when she told him to shoot the wife beating doctor in the S5 finale. I think she'd listen to Rick and rally the residents to support his leadership before she would Morgan. She knows nothing about him...."

When they showed the Internet video in the preview I was kinda hoping that was a 3rd episode development.
thewalkingdead,3cx8dm,MikkyfinN,3,Sat Jul 11 17:37:17 2015 UTC,I agree completely.  I'm hoping we see some of the mania/hysteria that would come with such mass confusion and disaster.  The show holds a lot of promise in my opinion.  I'm looking forward to it.
thewalkingdead,3cx8dm,rungirlrun262,14,Sun Jul 12 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the traffic jam scene is the end of episode one and day one. The riots are near toward episode five or six, and that this will take no more than two to four days in-show. By the end of episode eight we'll be caught up to the point either where Shane sealed Rick into the hospital room or Rick waking up."
thewalkingdead,3cx8dm,stophauntingme,11,Sat Jul 11 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"The first season = 6 episodes, not 8. IIRC season two (which is already green lit) will be 12 episodes."
thewalkingdead,3cx8dm,Saratje,10,Sat Jul 11 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"I believe it was supposed to have taken months. First the outbreak was unpredictable, so whole areas of cities got infected. Then the authorities locked these areas down. They probably figured fairly fast that it wasn't so much just sick people, but a case of reanimated corpses and thus they eventually greenlit the systematic sanitation of walkers.  Too many factors were still unknowns, such as that people who were not bitten but those that died of natural causes would also change into walkers, so the authorities kept being hit by pockets of walkers all over the place. Eventually the authorities just left, the army being the last to do so. With so much chaos there may have been plenty of discord within the ranks, possibly even mutiny here and there.  While it's not canon, I tend to predict the following phases would likely happen in such a scenario as the pandemic:  I. Standard protocol - day(s) - Initial reports of a new flu. Patients are quarantained, standard protocol is followed.  II. Extended protocol - 1-2 weeks - New flu spreads faster and further than thought, people seem to go rabid. Declared a super flu, additional measures are taken such as facemasks and advicing people to not leave their home unless nescesary. Airfields and seaports close down except for business/official travel. Drinking water is distributed. All of this to prevent this new flu from turning into a pandemic.  III. Confirmed Pandemic - a month - Super flu gets out of hand, military police is stationed to keep order in the streets. Stores close except for on specific days and times, to prevent looting and exposing people to the flu. People get weekly food supplies from designated stores within their area, likely with foodstamps. Independant stores may still be open but probably ask insane prices for luxury items. Fuel prices skyrocket and becomes sparse. The infected are removed from their homes, possibly subjected to extensive research to find a cure.  IV. Martial Law - month(s) - The walking dead form large mobs, the military calls for martial law. Schools close, stores are shut down, infected mobs are now destroyed as independant governments discover that the infected are actually reanimated dead with no hope of reversing the damage done. Leagues and unions such as the European Union are disbanded as individual countries will prioritize its own citizens over that of neighbouring coutries. Fuel becomes so sparse that governments will ban its sale, black market trade for weapons and fuel will rise all over the world. Countries with a lot of tension may attack eachother, casting blame onto the other. North vs South Korea, Mid-East vs Israel and North-Africa. Dangerous terrorist groups might try to spread the flu even faster, if they haven't already. Someone stupid may launch a nuke at someone  V. Compartmentalizing - weeks to months depending on city size - Cities are quietly divided into areas where survivors can live in the best possible way. Harsh decisions are made on who gets to live and who does not. Care for the disabled will fall directly to family. Elderly may be placed in sanatoria with volunteers taking care of them. To safe food reserves, those who have a limited lifespan may be refused food stamps, having to rely on a sanatorium to provide for them. In reality, this is ice cold separating the wheat from the chaff. Realistic plans are drafted in secrecy on applying extreme measures to contain the pandemic. Margins will be drawn where cities predicted to have infection rates of over 90% may be subjected to firebombing. Inhabitants would be warned by means of flyer drops or radio announcements.  VI. Social Collapse - roughly half a year - Walkers keep coming from within the safety zones, people being oblivious to the fact that all have been infected and simply change upon death. The army starts to thin out, militias are formed but lack of training and discipline may cause serious dissent within the ranks. The most casualties will be families who lose loved ones overnight and fail or refuse to report this in, ending up bitten and tired soldiers who end up bitten when they start running out of ammo and have to fight in hand-to-hand combat. As governments now collapse, state leadership will fall upon mayors, ranking military officers or even respected citizens. Justice is reduced to drumhead trials, to do away with murderers and other malevolent individuals. The last real action of the governments and military may be erecting several tall walls, forcing walker hordes to bottleneck through strategic openings in the wall, giving the survivors the best long-term fighting tactics.  VII. Full Collapse - after a year - Government bodies seize to be, hospitals run out of their last supplies, the army ends up stranded with no fuel or ammo. To prevent a complete mutiny, soldiers may be offered to go home to their families or to stick together trying to help where they can. Gangs and self-proclaimed warlords take charge where the laws fall silent. Large groups watch out for eachother, the only one who will now keep you from being killed or worse is whoever you still consider to be a friend. Military groups may decide to make a last stand around critical complexes, such as laboratories as people try to find a cure. Only places such as Saint Helena or Tristan da Cunha may find themselves free from infection, but pirates will certainly come to raid those places, hoping to find supplies or slaves to sell."

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,KaerMorhen,27,Sat Jul 11 01:03:19 2015 UTC,I agree. I think it will be similar to last season where the trailer made it seem like the Terminus people would be traveling with Rick and Co.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,SwanseaScheme,5,Fri Jul 10 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Rick's authority has been challenged in pretty much every season, but none were really as controversial as that brief moment Michonne took charge and knocked him out last season. Before that, it was just being questioned by the group or attacked by an outsider (The Governor, etc.). But this time it'll be coming from within. I think it'll be more interesting coming from Morgan since a lot of fans wondered where he was and were excited when he finally made a reappearance.   What better way to create drama than to pit two fan favs against each other, even if it is a facade? I doubt much comes of it, but if there's a chance for fans to think Morgan could take over the group, then it's definitely worth exploring by the writers. His ability to survive for so long alone lends to his credibility."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,smackythefrog,6,Fri Jul 10 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"I hope so because Rick vs the head in the clouds idealist storyline is getting old, and Morgan should already be too smart to play that lame role till, as always, shit goes down and everyone realizes the world is fucked and they need Rick for the millionth time."

Looks like Glenn is the one to run into him first.    • A lot more ""urban"" locations are shown in the trailer.  • Rick's speech towards the end is almost exactly from the comics.   •  Budget must have been increased a bunch, because the amount of walkers in the trailer is insane; No Way Out is for sure happening in the first half of this season.   • Not a whole lot of Carl in this trailer...

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Minimalanimalism,14,Sat Jul 11 17:43:01 2015 UTC,Nice
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,bogidyboy,6,Fri Jul 10 22:30:10 2015 UTC,You dirty dog
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,clone56,3,Sat Jul 11 00:14:57 2015 UTC,Oh you!
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,LackingAGoodName,63,Sat Jul 11 01:44:12 2015 UTC,There's really no way to tell you without spoiling it. Just keep one eye open during the season and you'll see.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,420_BonerHitler,11,Fri Jul 10 20:40:01 2015 UTC,Well the fact I now know that something is probably going to happen is a spoiler in itself.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,ForeverAgamer91,31,Fri Jul 10 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, spoilers, in the next season of the Walking Dead, things happen...stuff too"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,giblets24,2,Sat Jul 11 00:26:56 2015 UTC,I heard there were zombies too
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,madhaxor,3,Sat Jul 11 02:33:21 2015 UTC,"No, they have been replaced with muppets."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,EMateos,2,Sat Jul 11 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"Where'd you hear that, son? No one ever mentions the word ""zombie"""
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Trillman_K,11,Sat Jul 11 03:15:55 2015 UTC,Without to much spoilers   might as well ask for the buzzfeed title for the thing.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,bakemonosan,18,Fri Jul 10 21:23:43 2015 UTC,Carl gets injured in a very special way.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,tomkvideo,12,Fri Jul 10 20:11:52 2015 UTC,Not only the balls but the money. If they do CGI it's gonna be expensive.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Sir_Pariah,16,Fri Jul 10 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"They're actually gonna do it to chandler. But for real they don't need cgi for the whole thing just the primary shot, the same way they handled it with another major character that this happened to. Also Hershel's lwg was CGI afaik"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,theMTNdewd,50,Sat Jul 11 00:26:27 2015 UTC,Also Hershel's lwg was CGI afaik   No they cut it off for the show.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,RobFeher,2,Sat Jul 11 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"I really wish you wouldn't say stuff like this, because its still a spoiler"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,EmpireStijx,10,Fri Jul 10 23:24:15 2015 UTC,It looked like Heath and Michonne were definitely carrying someone that didn't look familiar to me...think that's Scott. Also where'd you see Denise?
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,10,Fri Jul 10 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"I'm about 90% sure that's Father Gabriel they're carrying. I'm not sure how to post a screenshot without the 'play' arrow that's in the video, though."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,seapiglet,4,Fri Jul 10 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"No, I just found a screenshot and he's wearing a button down plaid t-shirt...doesn't seem like something Gabriel would wear"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,3,Fri Jul 10 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not, but he has worn 'normal' clothes since throwing away his clerical collar, like when he goes out to speak to the walker."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,seapiglet,8,Fri Jul 10 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"I want  sooooooo badly, it's essential to  character devlopment"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,madhaxor,7,Sat Jul 11 02:32:19 2015 UTC,"ya but they fucked up by not choosing him  to go through with ""ben and billy"" in the show which was huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge to carls development, although it was also huge for carols development for the show....not sure if i liked the trade off"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,SlipS55,2,Sat Jul 11 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"Without spoiling, the character you mentioned is not in the trailer much so I think it's going to happen!"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,go4Ds,3,Sat Jul 11 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"It will have to happen, Gimple has been staying close to the comics and I think he has to realize what an important event that is."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,madhaxor,21,Sat Jul 11 17:38:54 2015 UTC,I'm probably wrong.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,lungleg,48,Fri Jul 10 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"There is no possible way that they would show a major character, no less"

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,use_more_lube,7,Fri Jul 10 23:13:03 2015 UTC,It's not - look at the hair. Second girl has it down the back of the neck - first girl has a pixieish cut
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Hypohamish,4,Fri Jul 10 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"Damnit. You're absolutely right. I totally looked at the face, didn't even consider her hair. SMH.   TL;DR - a sincere thanks!"
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,use_more_lube,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:39 2015 UTC,Also.... the shirt of the woman who gets eaten has a collar and the undershirt has a button or two undone. Not the woman in u/awerm's pic.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Anticipator1234,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:35:52 2015 UTC,could the black guy in that picture be Heath?
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,7,Fri Jul 10 23:14:34 2015 UTC,"It's totally Heath. Ponytailed plaits, black glasses.....if it's not him, then it's one hell of a bit of trolling."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Boiled_Ham,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:11:05 2015 UTC,It is him.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,20,Sat Jul 11 00:15:17 2015 UTC,I don't think it is.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,8,Fri Jul 10 20:05:40 2015 UTC,And the guy yelling while getting eaten squished up against a fence around the 1:17 mark looks like it could be Nicholas.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,seapiglet,7,Fri Jul 10 20:07:05 2015 UTC,It looked like Bruce to me.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,3,Fri Jul 10 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"Has he appeared in the show yet? I need to re-read the comics before this season begins, I'm so confused about who's who in Alexandria."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,seapiglet,6,Fri Jul 10 20:21:59 2015 UTC,Yepp. He appeared in the episode where Abe took control of the construction crew.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,3,Fri Jul 10 20:22:54 2015 UTC,My best guess is that it's Tobin. His role in the comic matches up to what's happening in that scene.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Claywick,9,Fri Jul 10 22:23:01 2015 UTC,I doubt they'd spoil the death of a main character in the trailer. Especially a main character who's death would fuck Glenn up.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Mewzen,2,Fri Jul 10 21:01:20 2015 UTC,It really looked like Tara to me. Which I could honestly see them throwing that in the trailer because there isn't a clear enough shot to determine who it truly is.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,KleenexBandit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:45:33 2015 UTC,That's what my dad said. I paused the video and it kind of looks like her but it probably isn't.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,poopoopadoop1,5,Fri Jul 10 21:39:57 2015 UTC,Do you recall when exactly in the comics Rick gives that speech? I'd like to go back to check it out.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,TheR3PTILE,6,Fri Jul 10 19:57:04 2015 UTC,I saw on another comment that it's issue 89
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,dan0314,5,Fri Jul 10 19:58:49 2015 UTC,How many issues ahead is the comic from the show? I know a lot had changed but just a rough estimate.  What issue is season 6 and how many are after it?
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Wonderweiss56,3,Fri Jul 10 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"Your looking at late 70s for current position I think. There are another 70 after that, lol.  Only half way on TV and the current comic storyline is going very strong and Rick has worked hard at Alexandria too with great infrastructure thanks to Eugene for one.  If AMC makes the effort with the show and it still draws in the numbers I reckon it can easily do a fair number of seasons yet...but they can't keep letting it drift and Gimple has to do better with the dialogue to keep it healthy."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Boiled_Ham,2,Sat Jul 11 00:20:21 2015 UTC,Round about Issue 77. Most recent issue is Issue 144. So a bit more than halfway.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,H-K_47,2,Fri Jul 10 23:53:24 2015 UTC,"About tree fiddy... but seriously, about 70, 75."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,True_Mammoth,3,Fri Jul 10 23:48:22 2015 UTC,What issue is rick's speech from? I just can't remember :(  EDIT: issue 89.

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Owl_You_Need_Is_Love,78,Sat Jul 11 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"I know that I can't speak for everyone but for me personally, this trailer is everything I wanted and then some."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,VirulentViper,12,Fri Jul 10 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"I know. Just from the trailer alone this looks like it could be the best season of the show. I'm putting the cart before the horse, but there's just so much awesome crammed into this trailer, which only constitutes for the first few episodes. That's like a season's worth of action in there. Label me hyped."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Dr_Disaster,66,Sat Jul 11 00:55:33 2015 UTC,There was no Tara or Eugene in the trailer at all :(  I don't think I saw Sasha either...
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,The-Nard-Dog,25,Fri Jul 10 19:57:22 2015 UTC,I only spotted Sasha once. At 2:15 in the background.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,chewties_yum_yum,15,Fri Jul 10 20:24:50 2015 UTC,She's also driving the car that Abe is in
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,GamingTatertot,2,Fri Jul 10 20:36:36 2015 UTC,and she's seen sitting with next to Maggie and Glenn in the house during Rick's speech.

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,VirulentViper,7,Fri Jul 10 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"Looks like Eugene on the left here, definitely Sasha here, and maybe? Tara on the left here but I'm not sure about that one."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,dirtynutsack,2,Sat Jul 11 02:41:13 2015 UTC,"Eugene was at the meeting (left on screen at 0:51)  Sasha was also at the meeting, she was on the couch with Glenn and Maggie (0:51). She was there for the team building exercise scene (1:25). The quarry fight (2:16). She was also at the glass door ""shopping mart"" fight (2:55). Also with Abraham in a car during the RV blockade/ wall building scene (3:02)  Tara was at the ""how many people are out there"" rescuing someone scene (3:15)."

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,pardeerox,3,Fri Jul 10 20:43:02 2015 UTC,I spotted a lot of potential random redshirts at 0:50
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,XBNick,14,Fri Jul 10 21:43:46 2015 UTC,Jessie in the closet with her son...and Walkers in the streets. Leads up to a big comic event.

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,seapiglet,8,Sat Jul 11 19:38:13 2015 UTC,Badass trailer. Looks like the quality we had last season will continue thankfully. I really want this show to be on par with the comics rather than being the hit or miss show it used to be. I'm hyped for this season. And oof the hips on Christian Serratos. Jesus.

If we go by that theory then that means that the we're going to be tackling 2 volumes in season 6a(I highly doubt we saw any 6b footage)

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,BadBadoff,2,Sat Jul 11 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"I'm used to seeing her with her hair down too, seeing it up as a little different. It's like seeing Michonne in normal clothes, it's a little off-putting at first."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,420_BonerHitler,6,Sat Jul 11 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"My guess is that those people who have caught Daryl think he is apart of the Wolves, that burned/killed/ect their place/people."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,BadBadoff,10,Sat Jul 11 04:28:47 2015 UTC,They trick you into thinking Morgan and Rick are aligned.....not so much by the end of the trailer.....unless they being very creative in editing.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,solidusoul,26,Fri Jul 10 20:20:29 2015 UTC,I think it's half and half. There will be some controversy but a lot of their lines in the trailer weren't said to each other.
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,TheChrisDez,3,Fri Jul 10 20:42:28 2015 UTC,I was trying to figure out if at the end of trailer when Rick was pointing his gun and making his speech who he was pointing it at.  They made it look like Morgan.  It also looks like Carl was hiding from Morgan.

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,PatientZeroo,5,Fri Jul 10 22:17:37 2015 UTC,Was that a scene of Morgan smacking father Gabriel with the stick? Maybe Gabriel is the one who Morgan says you leave and don't ever come back?

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,Ivan_Soloz,24,Fri Jul 10 20:32:31 2015 UTC,Don't think Rick would namedrop his mates if it wasn't an Alexandrian
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,FreeDennisReynolds,3,Fri Jul 10 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe one of the Alexandrians is a wolf in sheep's clothing so to speak. That would explain the name dropping, as he could be trying to reason with them or talk them down from something."

thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,rustyfork87,3,Fri Jul 10 21:39:54 2015 UTC,"There's no way they're just gonna kill her off-screen and when they return go ""oh yeah this happened"". Father Gabriel, Eugene and Tara aren't in it either but they're all okay."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,poopoopadoop1,2,Fri Jul 10 21:13:10 2015 UTC,"oh I figured they wouldn't do that, just sad they didn't show her. I thought she was going to be a crucial character this season so we'll just see."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,DrHoenybun,3,Fri Jul 10 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"She will probably still be a crucial character. If I recall, trailers are episode 1-4. Could just mean Sasha isnt crucial in the 4 episodes. When the wolves arc begins, that's when we should see more Sasha.  Hoping because she's my favorite character."
thewalkingdead,3ctxdb,DeadliestSins,2,Fri Jul 10 21:59:11 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I saw Father Gabriel for a second  edit: yeah at 0:30 it's blurry but it looks like him

The trailer is trying to make it seem as if Rick and Morgan go against each other, like last year's trailer where it seemed like Gareth's group and Rick's group were going to work together to go to Washington DC.  Still a great trailer, though. Loved it."

thewalkingdead,3czqyd,Mollaby,3,Sun Jul 12 06:47:49 2015 UTC,"Its been explained by kirkman that reanimation times vary depending on how much fighting spark a character has.   For example;  Amy had no reason to fight, so she took the full 8 hours to turn after death.  Shane, on the other hand, was riled up to the point if no return, thus he turned in a matter of moments after death"
thewalkingdead,3czqyd,IamEclipse,0,Sun Jul 12 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I had never heard that form Kirkman. Do you happen to have a link to that? It still seems unlikely (as likely as a zombie virus can be) that one would immediately come to with suddenly gray/blue/pale skin and red/yellow eyes, such as some quick reanimators."

thewalkingdead,3czqyd,sfdud,2,Mon Jul 13 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"Going by season 1, it should happen a while after death. The body shuts down, then the virus (or whatever) takes over and reanimates the body.  However, it's hardly canon and I guess it's more exciting to watch when reanimation happens at the speed of plot."
thewalkingdead,3czqyd,Blackboyfly72,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:21:43 2015 UTC,"That was what confused me about the show. Jenner said it would take anywhere from a few hours to 24 hours. Yet we saw characters reanimate instantly. The ""reanimation just as bad guy is next to the body"" thing has been over done far too much."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,herpzFTW,193,Fri Jul 10 20:33:00 2015 UTC,I'm a lot more intrigued than I thought I was going to be.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,Sixchr,92,Fri Jul 10 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"yes, this intrigues me much more than the current show. There seems to be more genuine fear in the world falling apart as opposed to survival. The problem is how long can it be dragged out before it just becomes The Walking Dead?           Also, Cliff Curtis is fucking great."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,GoldandBlue,35,Fri Jul 10 21:33:09 2015 UTC,That's what I wanna know. What does season 3 of Fear look like? They have a limited time window to work this in.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,PresidentBoobs,33,Fri Jul 10 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it only goes a few seasons, has a timeskip for the last few episodes and then the crossover begins.  Last scene of the series finale is a shot of whatever character(s) are left walking up to wherever the TWD crew are currently bunkered up before their season begins."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,darkest4,37,Sat Jul 11 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"I want the Ricktatorship to kill them all. Get us invested in this whole new group of people, bring them to the group we already love and Rick just nopes because you can't trust anyone. That would be so good."

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,SemoMuscle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:04:09 2015 UTC,"After me commenting that I've really grown to like that idea as well. It's a thing that Rick doesn't really care for people outside his family so why would he let in some random group of people into his safety zone, whoever that is in season 9...   I don't read past the show in comics just because spoilers and I can wait so I have no idea where this would fit in.   Also however a group would get from the west coast to the east coast is gonna have to be some damn good writing."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,PresidentBoobs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:39:05 2015 UTC,I would be so disappointed if that happened. If Fear the Walking Dead ends in Alexandria after the war that would just not happen. Not with the current Rick.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,Rachet20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:16:01 2015 UTC,"Although they will probably never meet, a confrontation between two separate groups that we love each with their own evolution would be killer.

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,peanutdakidnappa,40,Fri Jul 10 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"Came here to say the same. I didn't start TWD back in 2010 when it began, so I don't remember the trailers for it, but I'm curious as to whether it too felt like a movie trailer, just because so many movies have been done about a zombie apocalypse.   Also, the Walkers look a bit different in the show. They look more in tact and that might be because it's all just beginning, but...."

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,k80_,15,Fri Jul 10 21:00:34 2015 UTC,"Right, and it can't just be about the living vs the dead.  It looks like it'll highlight the conflict between the government trying to contain the dead, and the public not understanding their methods.  The way everyone went wild when they showed the cop shooting the punk rock zombie chick, I don't think anyone understands yet what they're seeing."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,newskul,8,Fri Jul 10 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"Speaking of WWZ, that scene with the guy opening his car door really reminded me of the movie."

That reminded me of the scene in the movie WWZ with the doctor talking about how nature's weaknesses are its strengths or whatever (I actually kinda thought they could've gone for something a little less banal than 'nature' and 'survival' for this trailer -- that's so very... on-the-nose... I would've preferred something a bit more intellectual and/or scientific where he's discussing, say, whether or not viruses are technically alive or not)"
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,stophauntingme,3,Sat Jul 11 00:11:54 2015 UTC,I got a big WWZ feel from this. Fantastic book and I feel like this season of FTWD will probably be a better WWZ than the movie ever will be.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,GamingTatertot,2,Fri Jul 10 23:08:52 2015 UTC,This is the exact same thing i thought after watching the trailer.  I'm beyond hyped for it now
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,LordeofD,57,Fri Jul 10 23:04:16 2015 UTC,I've been a defender of this project since it was announced and I'm glad to say I'm not disappointed by this.  It has a completely different feel from TWD (we get to use acronyms now!) since it takes place in the early days and in a big city. And what's really fun is the air of mystery surrounding the epidemic is still new and exciting to us because we've never had any information about how it all went down.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,Rubix89,8,Fri Jul 10 20:54:09 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if they really delved into the cause too. I know kirkman has said he wants to keep it ambiguous. plus I think FTWD will have an even cooler vibe if all of a sudden all contact cuts out without them ever really learning how everything happened
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,jdol06,3,Sat Jul 11 01:44:13 2015 UTC,"Watching this made me realize that I wanted to see the outbreak, which I never thought about before. I thought it was really cool how TWD did it, don't get me wrong, but I'm pretty stoked to see it go down!"

I like how they changed the scale of this show to feel bigger than TWD.  That being said, it all seems a bit generic. Like nothing we haven't seen in World War Z, Dawn of the Dead, etc.  I'll still tune in though."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,slupo,5,Fri Jul 10 21:09:53 2015 UTC,I seriously did not expect it to look this good. So cinematic and overall just FRESH. I'm really into this. August can't come soon enough.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,HeroOT,5,Fri Jul 10 20:54:17 2015 UTC,I was a little skeptical about this but.. wow  This.. AUGUST NEEDS TO HURRY UP
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,VolterTube,4,Fri Jul 10 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"Now that was a damn good trailer. Music was perfect, IMO. Absolutely hyped!"

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,beepbeepwow,4,Fri Jul 10 21:54:10 2015 UTC,"Liking the title of the series more now after seeing the trailer.   To be in the thick of it when a city explodes with ravenous, newly dead people in huge numbers, along with mass chaos and living people probably trying to take anything of use you have to better their chances would be utterly terrifying.  Fear the Walking Dead indeed !"
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,Boiled_Ham,6,Sat Jul 11 00:36:37 2015 UTC,When the motorcycle hit the mirror it reminded me way too much of world war z
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,rustyfork87,3,Fri Jul 10 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"The overall quality of the trailer boosted hype levels soooo much for me. They gave you just enough to show introduce you to a couple of the characters and a bit of the story, leaving you wanting way more.   Fine, AMC, fine. First you had my curiosity, now you have my attention."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,kaniboo,3,Fri Jul 10 21:14:10 2015 UTC,That was fucking awesome. I am so hyped

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,JoshPerson,3,Fri Jul 10 22:15:48 2015 UTC,Looked a lot better than what I was expecting.  I couldn't help but laugh at the boy waking up in the drug den. Nearly identical to the church scene in 28 days later. Still looked good.

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,KeredYojepop,22,Fri Jul 10 20:39:10 2015 UTC,"It seems like it's standard ""This is a family"" dialogue, establishing relationships etc. So when the girl gets her face ripped off we know to be sad."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,joshkg,4,Fri Jul 10 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"That is a realistic representation of how my sister would react to our mom barging in on her, so it may be standard but a good representation of actual families."

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,A_Privateer,2,Fri Jul 10 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"This looks really, really great. The caveat to that is a great trailer doesn't mean we'll get a great series, but I'm optimistic. I'm predicting that the virus will first be transmitted via intravenous drug use and needle trading, I wonder how far they'll push that storyline/metaphor."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,ch0k3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:31:52 2015 UTC,what makes you think that?
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,A_Privateer,7,Fri Jul 10 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"I'm basing it off of the mom criticizes her son for getting high, and the scene where he wakes up in what looks like a crack den. I'm guessing he went to the crack den, got fucked up and passed out, then some junkie(s) turned. He freaks out, runs, gets hit, but people are skeptical of his story because the world is still very early into the outbreak. Maybe the news will make out like there's a bad batch of drugs turning people rabid."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,stophauntingme,3,Fri Jul 10 23:25:41 2015 UTC,Super possible. Also though junkies are incredibly at-risk for almost all trending strains of flus & illnesses. It wouldn't really have to be IV-specific for the zombie plague to hit that demographic (& others like them) first.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,A_Privateer,2,Sat Jul 11 00:26:18 2015 UTC,"True, but IV-specific drug use seems to fit zombie virus transmission tropes better than anything else."

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,Saratje,2,Sat Jul 11 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"It seems to imply that those who got a flu shot initially were bolstered against the airborne or waterborne infection. Given that many authorities often receive inoculations by default, including options for their families, this makes sense for why certain groups such as the police and the army remained safe from random infection."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,NoGoodIDNames,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I'm still not really enthused.  I feel like the biggest thing that separated The Walking Dead from so many other zombie movies is that it doesn't focus on how it happened. It literally put the main character to sleep while the world ended, so that it didn't have to deal with all the cliches that come with society collapsing.  This is going to have to work so much harder to not fall into the normal stereotypes. Mr. This Can't Be Happening, Mrs. Hide the Zombie Bite, Mr. Middle Management Gone Mad With Power.  I hope they can break these molds in interesting ways, but this trailer didn't really do much to convince me."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,ZombineSoldier,6,Fri Jul 10 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"Uhm, there are not a lot of zombie movies that shows us the beginning of the zombie outbreak. I can think of dawn of the dead and world war Z. And that was only the first 15 minutes or something.  A whole season focussing on that is pretty unique I would say!"
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,CeruleanRuin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:16:44 2015 UTC,"The Way I Live Now isn't a zombie movie, but it does a fantastic job of portraying how the modern world slowly falls apart around the main characters.   If this show can capture the kind of eerie, uncertain atmosphere so well conjured up in that movie, I'll eat it up."
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,KeredYojepop,3,Sun Jul 12 15:18:01 2015 UTC,This is my exact fear. The writing and how they handle the situation is going to have to be pretty unique for it to not be something we've seen in every zombie movie.

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,NerdfaceKillah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:27:32 2015 UTC,What caught my interest is how they will showroom the very beginning how things transpired vs twd where Rick kinda wakes up from the coma and everyone is already evacuated and everyone who died has turned. I guess they had to do that rather than rehash the original story just in a different location.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,doratheora,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Looks great! I'm digging this cinematography  it has a totally different feel from TWD
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,Nateisgreat148,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:47:16 2015 UTC,I'm cautiously optimistic about this. That trailer made me feel like zombies were a threat again. After watching Rick and Co. massacre them for 5 1/2 seasons this new stuff might be what we need.

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,hell_kat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:59:42 2015 UTC,It looks so clean and polished.  I have a hard time reconciling that this is before TWD universe - before humanity devolved.  Walkers videotaped for YouTube on a cellphone!  Clean people everywhere!  TWD is only a few years in and now it even feels darker.  I am very excited to see this.  The trailer completely exceeded my expectations and I liked seeing the basic set up for a plot involving this family.   Initial reports didn't really make it seem that great.

thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,dafood48,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:43:59 2015 UTC,I liked the mystery of not knowing where the virus came from. But I dont mind them for trying to explain it. A lot of the fans are curious so I get it. This trailer just looks very Hollywood horror moviesh to me. I am not a fan of the modern horror movies so I guess I am a bit prejudiced. This trailer reminds me of quarantine for some reason.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,stophauntingme,5,Sat Jul 11 15:19:13 2015 UTC,I liked the mystery of not knowing where the virus came from.   Kirkman has repeatedly told everybody in interviews & whatnot that FearTWD is not going to be exploring the origins of the virus - that this show is rather going to be witnessing the events of the outbreak from the perspectives of the regular main characters.  The trailer definitely featured some very film-cinematic elements to it... but that kind of trailer is appealing to most people (but unfortunately not to you). It's probably worth tuning in to the first couple of episodes even if you didn't like the feel of the trailer.
thewalkingdead,3cu7p3,dafood48,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:09:45 2015 UTC,Dont get me wrong I'm still going watch it and give it a shot. Just the trailer was kind of a turn off for me.

thewalkingdead,3cwli5,dajoeker,26,Sat Jul 11 12:29:43 2015 UTC,Would be tough tho. Everyone who dies turns into a zombie. So one night you are just chilling and suddenly granpa bites you in the neck cause he had a heart attack 10 minutes earlier.
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,PietNederwiet,7,Sat Jul 11 12:54:49 2015 UTC,"Holy s***, that's something that totally slipped my mind. If everyone is infected then how would civilistaion be able to be rebuilt without a cure?!  Everyone would have to sleep in. Everyone would have to sleep in separate and secure bedrooms."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,MichaeljBerry,17,Sat Jul 11 12:57:58 2015 UTC,"Basically, and I'm thinking in a science fiction way here, long term people would have to get some kind of device implanted in them that fries their brain when their heart stops."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,Captainpanda55,10,Sat Jul 11 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"They'd probably spring for a solution like anyone born in the post-infection world has natural immunity to it, like Judith."

thewalkingdead,3cwli5,kickshaw,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:56 2015 UTC,It would just become the new normal for everyone to lock themselves in separate rooms at night.

thewalkingdead,3cwli5,Seth_Krogan,10,Sat Jul 11 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling I know how the comic will end, but since the show will never reach the comics ending that doesn't matter. A cure has always been out of the question for this series.  So I could see the show ending with Rick's death, and Carl picking up the mantle of badass leader. Not a resolution to the apocalypse, not a cure, etc. The Walking Dead has always been about smaller scale human drama"
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,seapiglet,3,Sat Jul 11 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"Out of genuine curiosity, why do you think the show will never reach the comic's ending?"
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,tumbleweedss,7,Sat Jul 11 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Well, we're at issue 79ish in the show. The comics are at 144, and won't end for a long while. Can this show survive until season 12+?"
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,AJockeysBallsack,2,Sun Jul 12 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point, but I don't see it getting completely cancelled, it's just too popular. Maybe it'll eventually move onto just being aired on Netflix, or they might just skip some storylines from the comics to speed things up.  Then again I'm a huge fan so that might be wishful thinking on my behalf..."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,Seth_Krogan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:16:11 2015 UTC,"Just because it's popular now doesn't mean it's always going to be popular. This isn't an animated series, it has a large budget. It won't run forever. We will be lucky to get four more seasons."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,IIRodneyX,2,Sun Jul 12 01:19:32 2015 UTC,They might end up taking bigger shortcuts/story omissions like Game of Thrones.   BUT  That would suck.

thewalkingdead,3cwli5,gilbert_at,2,Sun Jul 12 11:09:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. The final episode should be Rick's death, then Carl putting on Rick's gunbelt and walking into the sunset or whatever with Judith. No real closure."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,TZMouk,2,Sat Jul 11 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"I like it because it embraces the idea of no going back, it would feel exhausting if the comic or show ended in a cure.   ""Welp, I ran out of ideas so might as bring that cure thing back again, hope you liked watching your favorite characters suffer."" - hopefully not future Kirkman"
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,gilbert_at,6,Sat Jul 11 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"Some kind of evolution. Either the walkers become sentient, though very slowly, the series picks up just the beginnings of this, and ends with hints on coexistence. Or the living develop some natural anti bodies over time, and it slowly spreads from one to the other, making them immune to bites etc., and the walkers become extinct (except in zoos and museums.... Jurassic Walker Park)"

thewalkingdead,3cwli5,Blizzardnotasunday,6,Sun Jul 12 07:29:05 2015 UTC,"This depends on a lot that's as-of-yet unanswered in the show's canon, but the virus could've been released into the atmosphere, infected everyone globally, then after like a year it dissipates & the next generation of kids (::coughJudith::) didn't get infected. This would solve the whole ""there must be a cure!"" thing -- if the next generation isn't infected then Rick's generation would basically turn into the ""clean-up"" generation, killing as many zombies as possible so the uninfected kids aren't in danger of getting bitten & can rebuild an uninfected society."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,DesertedPenguin,2,Sat Jul 11 15:38:16 2015 UTC,"As I said somewhere else, this will likely mean a character will have a baby or a be character with one will be introduced. Tha baby would then die and not turn. I do not think they will kill off Judith"
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,fuzzycaterpillar123,7,Sat Jul 11 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"Judith dies, not from a zombie bite, but she does not turn into a zombie. Series ends on a bittersweet note as it is shown babies born after the zombie-vector breakout are immune."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,DavidAMIs,4,Sun Jul 12 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"Well, considering Robert Kirkman has stated emphatically that he will never reveal what caused the apocalypse, there will never be a cure.  I think the most likely scenario is some sort of transition from Rick to Carl. I don't read the comics, though I know the major storylines, and I know Rick's been put through hell there (even more so than TV). So I would imagine some sort of changing of the guard/the king is dead type scenario would be the finale."
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,renegade2point0,2,Sat Jul 11 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"This.  A cure or some type of feel good resolution is how you end a cliche movie.  TWD is a story about growing up and building family in a post-apocalyptic world.  It's a story of what becomes important when society as we know is gone.  Finding a cure is not the point of the show.  It probably will end with Rick dying, Carl taking over, and the audience left wondering about an uncertain future in an older Carl's extremely capable hands"
thewalkingdead,3cwli5,Saratje,7,Sat Jul 11 21:34:38 2015 UTC,I get the sense that the show could only end on a philosophical one-liner and be justified. Would it be entertaining for the audience? Probably not. I know I wouldn't like it. But I know I enjoyed the journey regardless.

thewalkingdead,3cu66j,TheMysteryBlueFlame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:15:54 2015 UTC,You'd have to get a BT package I think. If you're already paying SKY £30 to £100 quid a month it'd be tough to justify even more for BT's services.  I'll be picking FTWD up care of the jolly pirates and BT can get stuffed. SKY will be disappointing many a Walking Dead fan IMO. It'll maybe end up on Channel 5 or 4 a year down the road.

thewalkingdead,3cu2zc,_billthecat,2,Fri Jul 10 20:04:18 2015 UTC,They would never. Especially considering the comics
thewalkingdead,3cu2zc,ChrisGT122,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"This is not Maggie I think, but the comics don't matter here, the TV always took its own course.

thewalkingdead,3cu2zc,SnakeNoir,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:38:48 2015 UTC,Same people who think that  in the season 5 trailer are the same people who think Maggie is getting devoured in this trailer. It's not Maggie. It wasn't him. The creators aren't that stupid. I know I'm right. I'm not wrong. There's no point in arguing.
thewalkingdead,3cu2zc,TsarNab,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"I'm positive that it's not anyone from Alexandria, or anyone important at all. The trailer showed two people dying, this woman and the guy getting devoured against the gates of ASZ. My guess is the woman is just a random person that gets eaten somewhere outside and the guy being eaten up against the gates is trying to get in, possibly one of the wolves. AMC know better than to show known or liked characters dying in their trailers and they emphasised these deaths too well for them to be at all relevant. After the Axel fiasco I just can't see them being stupid enough to do it all over again."

thewalkingdead,3cu5ly,IamEclipse,13,Fri Jul 10 20:17:08 2015 UTC,I think the scene with Enid in the bloody car is a flashback. It connects with the beginning of the trailer where we see her arriving at Alexandria's gates all muddy and shit.
thewalkingdead,3cu5ly,SimplyMe94,7,Fri Jul 10 20:21:13 2015 UTC,Maybe its the death of her mother?
thewalkingdead,3cu5ly,Wangularity,3,Fri Jul 10 20:32:27 2015 UTC,TSDF had pics of her with two adults on set so it's likely it's a flashback to Enid's arrival to the safe zone.

Personally, I wasn't a big fan of season 5, but it seems like a lot of people were. The first three episodes of season 5 are really good, but the rest of 5A just wasn't that great in my opinion. The second half of season 5 had its moments, but it got a little dull. However, my advice might not be the best for you, as I really enjoyed season 4, especially the second half, which is where you quit watching. The finale of season 4, ""A"", is one of, if not the best, espisodes of the series in my opinion. Overall, I would advise you to start watching again, but stuff like this is awfully subjective."

thewalkingdead,3cxk5q,tommy4991,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:52:30 2015 UTC,"Season 5 really picks up, especially the beginning few episodes and the last few.  The middle can run slightly stagnant on occasion but I feel even those stagnant parts are necessary for character development.  The fans cannot really care for the characters if they do not have innate knowledge of them and what they have been through.  You also need those parts for later plot development.  I would get into it more specifically but do not want to ruin it for you.    The dynamic of the show changes in season 5 and Rick finally seems to understand what he needs to do to survive.

A: Chris says they don’t want to meet Rick where he’s at right now in the show. Dave Erickson says there’s no plans for it right now because it’s too geographically complicated at the moment. Chris says Cliff has to grow a beard if he wants to meet Rick; he then jokingly asks if they’ll all meet the cast of Dr. Who and the producers joke “Yes!”

thewalkingdead,3cstjn,Brad_Wesley,9,Fri Jul 10 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"Kinda makes sense. Walkers are fairly new and ""fresh"". Less decayed than we see them now so it makes sense that their muscle hasn't deteriorated so much and they can move faster.    But also, season 2 may be suffering from the Darabont hangover of season 1. Basically he was the show runner and he wanted the walkers to be more human and retain some abilities that zombies aren't known for (picking up rocks, climbing a fence, turning doorknob - all in season 1) But they did away with all that when Darabont left mid way through season 2   I'm assuming you mean Beth, not Maggie, being all suicidal and bed ridden. Yes, it was kinda boring. But the Greenes have been fairly closed off from the world, haven't seen everything Rick and co. have and they still kinda think it's a religious thing, well Herschel does at least.    Then Ricks crowd comes crashing in, destroy their fairly peaceful life, Otis dies, the whole barn scene and firing squad on all the family member/neighbour walkers? You can forgive her having a reaction like ""Fuck this shit, the world is gone to hell, I'm out"". Yes, kinda boring from week to week. But all part of character development"
thewalkingdead,3cstjn,Heroic_Lifesaver,3,Fri Jul 10 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yes I meant Beth."
thewalkingdead,3cstjn,Foundation17s,4,Fri Jul 10 14:42:41 2015 UTC,Season 2 is slow but that doesn't mean it isn't just as good or unimportant in comparison to the rest. It just focuses on different themes that demand a slower pacing. It is basically the aftermath of their initial ptsd.  I see your question has already been answered. I just wanted to defend season 2.

Even the freshly bit Walkers of S3-S5 are slow, so maybe the virus is mutating."

thewalkingdead,3cqw90,KILLROYIII,8,Fri Jul 10 20:26:38 2015 UTC,There should be picture of Rosita's stomach. R. I. P. Baby
thewalkingdead,3cqw90,twomillcities,4,Fri Jul 10 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"appreciate that write up man, i know it helped me at least.   that many deaths at once... it's a lot to take in. reading a brief description of each one like that, it gives you a perspective of how many people each community lost, and the groups of friends who are going to be affected by these losses.  iout of all those deaths, Josh and Rosita hit me the hardest. Rosita was pregnant for Christ's sake, and she was there from before Alexandria, it felt like she was going to stick around and her story with Eugene had my attention.   and Josh was a rare kid, someone who survived the outbreak from early childhood, a boy who was still innocent (unlike Carl, with probably a couple dozen kills under his belt) and hadn't really witnessed the horror outside the walls. it likely didn't take much to lure him away from everyone.  unfortunately w/ this situation... i don't think Rick is going to be able to keep control anymore, the blowback and emotional response of all the people from the loss of these lives is going to be far too severe.   i mean think about it, who the hell will run the Kingdom? I'd say maybe Michonne, but she abandoned that place. If she steps up and shows that she wants to fight back for Ezekiel's death though, I could see the people of the Kingdom rallying to her side. as for the Saviors, they don't really even have a leader at this point, but then again they only lost Amber, so they may stay out of it... and regarding Maggie, she's not on the thickest ice w/ her people after a public execution against a weak idiot who was somewhat respected by his community.  it's scary to think that after everything Rick has built, we might see it all go to ruin within just one volume"
thewalkingdead,3cqw90,Zand_Kilch,5,Fri Jul 10 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this leads to TWD Team Up, where Rick is backed into a corner and has no choice but to free Negan  Who becomes a hero until his death"
thewalkingdead,3cqw90,SpaghettiSnake,3,Fri Jul 10 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of hope it's a spark that leads to something much bigger than just the Whisperers. Absolute chaos that leads to the downfall of the communities. It would be really interesting to see the Hilltop and Alexandria have a civil war of sorts with each other. Maggie and Rick disagreeing over how to handle the Whisperers, people wanting revenge and hearing that the Hilltop knew about them, Rick shaming her over Gregory, Jesus being caught between the two of them. Of course I feel it would probably need another push to really set something like that off, maybe something to do with Rick suggesting to use Negan and Maggie really doesn't like that idea, but I think it would be a cool turn of events to see two of our main characters from over the years be ready to tear each other apart.   Then while that is happening Michonne takes over the Kingdom and ignores the Hilltop and Alexandria's arguing and just leads them in revenge against the Whisperers, who then retaliate by attacking Alexandria and the Hilltop, weakening them further and making the situation worse (and maybe the Kingdom if they figure out where that is).   Then maybe Dwight can't handle the Sanctuary and steps down to someone who stays out of all of it and is violently isolationist, or it falls to in-fighting. The four main communities collapse and some survivors from each group make it out, some die by themselves, some are never seen again and we don't end up ever learning what actually happens to them, and some make it to Oceanside (we still need to see that place) and people regroup there.  Maybe it's the push to get the new main group (whoever that might be composed of) out on a boat in search of somewhere new and more stable for the endgame. I don't know, I love the characters and the communities, but I kind of want to see it all destroyed now in some horrible event that is 10 times worse than the Governor's attack on the prison."
thewalkingdead,3cqw90,Slayer1791,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:56:06 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  I see this as the beginning of the end of the communities.  If they are forced to flee I wonder in which direction they will go.  Maybe to the south via boat?

thewalkingdead,3cqbae,TheEld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 2015 UTC,You should check them out. There are five out so far with another due in October. The first three are all about the Governor. You get to see things from his perspective.
thewalkingdead,3cqbae,rickscarf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll get round to them eventually, I just have a lot of books on my ""to read"" list at the moment. (best I wait until the 1 in october is published anyway i think)"

thewalkingdead,3cqbae,SenseiCB,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"Been reading the comics since the first trade (so about 10 years, I think?) It's my preferred medium, hands down.   I like the show, not as much as say, The Wire or Breaking Bad, but it's very good. First couple seasons took some time to pick up steam, IMO, but once they got to the prison I think it's been great (maybe minus the Governor-Andrea drama).   I haven't played the games, not a fan of the Tell-tale style and I heard the Daryl one was terrible.   I read the first two novels but I didn't think they were that good, so I didn't bother continuing."

thewalkingdead,3cqbae,slipn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"I've recently discovered the world of fanfiction, walking dead fanfiction in particular.  I know people make fun of it in general but I find it completely entertaining.  There's just so much potential for great stories when it comes to the world of the walking dead.  What would have happened if Sophia lived? What would happen if the group didn't find each other on the highway after they lost the farm? What if it took Carol years instead of days to rejoin the group?  What if one of the gang got sent back in time to before the dead rise? And of course Merle! Lots of stories with more interaction between Merle and Daryl.    The spelling is sometimes bad but I'd probably have some typos too if I tried to write a novel length story without assistance.  It's the thought that counts.  I just think the stories are fun.  Many of them really do seem as well written or better than actual published novels I've slogged through.  But yeah, I'm not into comics or gaming.  I like to read.  I feel like you get a lot more depth from prose than any other medium. I would probably enjoy the official novels but I haven't gotten around to them yet.  Just not that interested in the Governor."

She could have lured them one by one into the woods and had Whispers waiting to in ambush. Maybe a combination of luring/luck. Promised Olivia food, told Luke she'd screw him, saw 'Zek charging off, etc. etc."
thewalkingdead,3co25d,Darth_Kahuna,9,Thu Jul 9 12:25:25 2015 UTC,She had to have help. But the timing has been really weird these last couple of issues. In letter hacks they said time skips a lot and they don't always waste dialogue pointing it out. I assume Alpha got to the fair as Rick was leaving to search for Carl.

thewalkingdead,3co25d,AFishBackwards,10,Thu Jul 9 12:47:40 2015 UTC,My question was how good of a fighter is she because i can't imagine Ezekiel to be easy to kill with his cool cane sword and all. I can't imagine Rosita to be that easy to kill either although she may have been unarmed.
thewalkingdead,3co25d,thisismy20,10,Thu Jul 9 12:50:54 2015 UTC,Being a good fighter don't mean shit against a surprise ambush and being outbumbered.
thewalkingdead,3co25d,AFishBackwards,2,Thu Jul 9 15:36:39 2015 UTC,True. All I mean to say is that Alpha is not a person to be messed with.
thewalkingdead,3co25d,treblah3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"I just re-read the All Out War arc and to be fair, Ezekiel wasn't a GREAT fighter. Remember when he wussed out when Shiva got killed? He was also pretty emotional/happy about a possible reunion with Michonne when he left the fair so he was probably distracted."
thewalkingdead,3co25d,fultonmassacre,34,Fri Jul 10 03:22:24 2015 UTC,"I was really thinking that instead of putting their walker heads on poles, they should've skinned them, and planned for Whisperers wearing their skins to walk by Rick and Carl until they noticed. But meh."
thewalkingdead,3co25d,JequalsLplusR,18,Thu Jul 9 15:11:10 2015 UTC,That would be so fucked up.
thewalkingdead,3co25d,bowzerb,5,Thu Jul 9 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome Idea but I got a feeling we will see Rick and others put on  some walker skins and take the whisperers by surprise, I love the idea of the whisperers but they really handicap themselves when you can just look like a walker and blend in. Maybe Carl will become the new ""Alpha"""
thewalkingdead,3co25d,fultonmassacre,3,Thu Jul 9 21:01:05 2015 UTC,That's such a good idea! The original (for the most part) crew would have no problem with slapping on some flesh and blending in!

thewalkingdead,3co25d,MurphyRobocop,2,Thu Jul 9 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"They weren't there long enough for that to happen.   At the Whisperer's camp, they had them hung out to be cleaned and dried and suitable for people to wear.   They were only with Alpha for maybe half a day."
thewalkingdead,3co25d,DeputyFicus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:54 2015 UTC,We know that it takes a lot of effort and time to clean and skin a perfect skin suit. That would've taken forever and would likely needlessly endanger a handful of whisperers.
thewalkingdead,3co25d,reeft,0,Fri Jul 10 00:48:29 2015 UTC,Who said they haven't? Perhaps more were killed.
thewalkingdead,3co25d,Bigoldthrowaway86,21,Thu Jul 9 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"Mad crazy theory here but what if Alpha has a twin that the Whisperers probably aren't exactly fully aware of. Stay with me. It definitely looks like Kirkman has gone out of his way to show Alpha zipping over to Alexandria and back in a crazy short time especially considering she's on foot. It'd be easy if there were two of them.   What if the other twin is 'Omega.' The biblical passage  ""I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord""   Is meant to signify God's eternity or infinity.   Now check out the necklace Alpha wears in Alexandria at the end of #142. Looks like an infinity symbol right? Maybe a hint to the above.   Going further into insane territory... Maybe they share leadership duties equally without anyone realising, ala that popular film I don't wanna spoil... Maybe they communicate info to each other secretly via radio which Eugene is about to discover... Maybe they created this tough woman image and the Alpha that was crying is Lydia's actual mum of the two, forced into a tough decision to protect their secret.   Or maybe the Whisperer's camp just ain't that far away and I'm batshit crazy."
thewalkingdead,3co25d,nosvpg,10,Thu Jul 9 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"kinda a cool thought, i must say. One wears their infinity symbol on her belt and the other on a necklace? They both shave their heads so no one notices different hair lengths or color? BUT wouldnt Lydia know if her mother had a twin before the apocalypse? ALSO wouldnt they have to share a walker skin since Alpha's is pretty recognizable? I like the thought, especially with the Eugene radio thing able to go in any number of directions"
thewalkingdead,3co25d,Bigoldthrowaway86,2,Thu Jul 9 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Ahh man I completely forgot about the infinity belt buckle! And yeah exactly my thinking about the shaved head too.   Yeah, Lydia probably would but I guess the other twins death could easily be faked in the early days of the apocalypse. Hell actually maybe that ties in with her sending Lydia away. She might be the only person to be able to question her mothers ability to be in two places at once.   Good point about the walker skin... Maybe they just swap their skins when they take over playing the leader? Some of those Whisperers don't seem to ever remove their skin so it wouldn't be hard for two twins to be wandering about."
thewalkingdead,3co25d,nosvpg,10,Thu Jul 9 15:07:37 2015 UTC,Maybe they killed another set of twins to make their skins look the same?

thewalkingdead,3co25d,jdmax,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:29:26 2015 UTC,The whisperers have horses too. Plus we don't know what time passed before she got there or how much earlier she was at the fair

thewalkingdead,3co25d,ChildhoodOBCD,2,Thu Jul 9 22:34:09 2015 UTC,There really isn't that much distance between the areas. She didn't take them all the way to the camp. Only the border which is much closer. As for how it would be easy to lure unsuspecting people and there are tone of whisperers.  Everyone also seems to be assuming she walked. The whisperers have horses. They were shown when carl arrived
thewalkingdead,3co25d,Saratje,2,Thu Jul 9 17:49:51 2015 UTC,Maybe it wasn't her.

thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Brad_Wesley,3,Thu Jul 9 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and there are 3 or 4 other good islands to consider as well.  Alternatively (if you can't find a boat, etc.), you can head for the hills. There's a good possibility walkers will, not having much of a plan, tend to take the path of least resistance when wandering around. And climbing a long, step incline isn't it. It might radically reduce the number of walkers you have to deal with. If there are any step dropoffs along the routes to your camp, even better."

thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Harry-Seaward,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"We definitely need to become attached to the characters. I'm just worried what we'll get will be a cliched family drama that could be any other show, that just happens to be set during the outbreak of The Walking Dead. I'm worried it will feel like an episode of 7th Heaven that takes place during the Rapture. Imagine scenes where they're escaping and bickering about their family problems at the same time. ""Look! They're coming! And son, quit doing drugs and yelling at your step mom.""  I'm mostly just keeping my expectations low. That way I'll probably enjoy it no matter how it turns out. I hope the trailer gets rid of my concerns."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,KeredYojepop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer something closer to the book:   A working family in L.A. just casually watching the news as reports of zombies showing up in New York City. Bought a gun a few months ago because the Millers across the street did, but not really worried about having using it. Put the kids on Phalanx, the new drug that's supposed to prevent infection. The next day in school, two more kids aren't there. The parents aren't letting them go to school, rumor is the Randall's are leaving town and heading to Vancouver. That night, Mom's doing laundry, there's soccer practice tomorrow and the uniforms are dirty, and all the sudden to dog starts making a fuss, and a 6'4"" zombie crashes through the screen door.  That'd be a good way to end the last 15 minutes of episode 1."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,tomkvideo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"Oooh... imagine the church scene or the exodus up north being covered. Fuck it, let's just cover WWZ but call it Fear the Walking Dead."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,reasonableposter,78,Sat Jul 11 02:28:54 2015 UTC,All these teasers are telling me is that this spin-off is going to focus more on the initial outbreak instead of surviving the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,SuperPwnerGuy,103,Thu Jul 9 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what it is going to do, and they've stated that. I'm pretty sure the pilot will have no zombies at all, except maybe in the last few moments as the outbreak begins.  I imagine the whole first season will follow a slow growth of the issue with people not believing it, or underestimating it's threat until by the end of the season it's all out of control and full blown societal collapse."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Karjalan,67,Thu Jul 9 01:42:24 2015 UTC,This is why I think I'll love it
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,randomadjective,37,Thu Jul 9 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Most zombie movies skip over it. It will be an awesome angle, and make both the shows more immersive."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Xander_The_Great,13,Thu Jul 9 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"I know right? People will say it won't be as good as the original Walking Dead, but who knows? I'm really hyped for this show and I bet it won't let me down!"
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,randomadjective,14,Thu Jul 9 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"Saying it won't be as good as TWD is pretty weird to me. TWD isn't some masterpiece, it has a lot of problems."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Keiano,3,Thu Jul 9 12:49:30 2015 UTC,Speak on that.
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Ricktron3030,0,Thu Jul 9 14:19:09 2015 UTC,"Speak on that.   Dialogues are pretty bad most of the time, many episodes were worthless, ie. entire season 2 spent on Hershel's farm. No curse words, camera shots are nothing special, just standard stuff, definitely above shows like Arrow, but god I just can't watch TWD right after watching Hannibal/Daredevil/GOT/HOC. I'm bad at expressing my thoughts on a topic like this, but if you call GOT a good tv serie, then in my opinion you can't call TWD a good tv serie, it's just not on the same level.  Basically to me there are few categories of tv series  A - Writing and overall camera and production quality is really good  - GOT/HOC/Hannibal  B - definitely lower overall quality than the A category tv series, but it's definitely watchable - TWD/Daredevil  C - shit tv series where you basically fucking sit like a zombie and watch without giving the serie any thought - Arrow/Flash/ I can't name any more because I simply haven't watched anything close to those tv series."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Keiano,4,Thu Jul 9 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"I actually kinda liked the flash, maybe thats just me though, im like 15 episodes in. I do realize its not special, but i find it quite entertaining"
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,TheDutchTank,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"The Flash is a lot of fun. I am kinda jealous you are just starting, cause in my opinion each episode just keeps getting more fun and escalating in entertainment all the way to the end of the season."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,EtticosLebos,3,Thu Jul 9 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"GoT definitely has it's failures too. I watch both TWD and GoT and personally I am loving TWD way more than GoT. Season 5 of TWD was the best one yet, in my opinion. The nuances in the characters' arcs and stories and symbolism in everything is so deep and just blows my mind sometimes. Also, I can always go back and watch TWD from the beginning, but with GoT I can't because I can't re-live all of the horrors that happen to the characters. Lol I don't think I can take it."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,jg12389,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:24 2015 UTC,"Lol the symbolism is so heavy handed and simple, how can it blow your mind? Have you watched any actual nuanced television? Watch season 1 of True Detective and come back to walking dead and see what you think. Walking Dead aims for mass appeal and is fueled by simple greed"
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Parkermos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:31:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you are saying, but I think Daredevil is on the ""A level""."

thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Keiano,3,Thu Jul 9 20:38:27 2015 UTC,Its the most exciting part for me.
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,ndimoro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"The Stand didn't have any zombies, but pretty much the entire first part focused on that."

thewalkingdead,3clwpe,tomkvideo,3,Fri Jul 10 16:00:32 2015 UTC,I think this show is going to focus more on teasers than actual episodes.
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,EnterTheTragedy,2,Thu Jul 9 08:21:50 2015 UTC,All these teasers are telling me is that this spin-off is going to focus more on the initial outbreak   Didn't they explicitly say that that's exactly what this spinoff is?
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,uh_oh_hotdog,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:01:41 2015 UTC,I guess so
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,DayGrr,3,Thu Jul 9 09:38:23 2015 UTC,Every teaser looks great.  I hope it turns more into survival in the big city and less survival in the wilderness. The potential is there.
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Kree18Madness,14,Thu Jul 9 15:13:18 2015 UTC,Is it wrong that I become sad when a hot chick becomes a zombie?
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Captinfucker,2,Thu Jul 9 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"I mean she's in the middle of the pool, the zombie will end up in the water before it gets to her. I don't think she'll have a hard tome escaping from that one, unless it pulls the season 2 teleport trick of course."
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,Reddumbdancy,9,Thu Jul 9 17:54:40 2015 UTC,no youre not a fresh pair of boobs should never go to waste like that.

thewalkingdead,3clwpe,DamnitLori,2,Thu Jul 9 19:40:06 2015 UTC,Anyone else excited for potential celebrity zombie cameos?

Don't get me wrong, it's my all time favorite show, but they're trying to make another thing with the same potential and I don't see it getting any better. Fingers crossed I am dead wrong!"
thewalkingdead,3clwpe,TerryYockey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"One thing I wonder about the CDC. Since Kirkman has tried to basically retcon that arc out of existence by pretending it never happened, will he ignore it totally in this show?"

thewalkingdead,3conrd,tigerclawhg,2,Thu Jul 9 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot of names you've listed."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,snapalope,7,Thu Jul 9 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in TWD die. The only name on that list matters is Carol and she will be the one that dies either at the mid-season finale or the season finale.    She's going to be this seasons ""shocking"" death."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,Pumpkinpilot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:51:01 2015 UTC,Stop. Stop just stop. Don't say her name when talking about character deaths. Just don't. I love her. She is my walking dead mom.   Edit: ...sorry if i offended you with a joke i guess...if you didn't like it you can just move on but i guess there is no point in being a decent human being as long as you can hide behind a screen.
thewalkingdead,3conrd,tigerclawhg,3,Sun Jul 12 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just don't see any of them actually living past this season and Carol is my favorite character"

thewalkingdead,3conrd,MonkeH13,3,Fri Jul 10 03:28:04 2015 UTC,I think it'll be Glenn or Maggie! Although you can't really go by the comic books because of Andrea and Dale!
thewalkingdead,3conrd,snapalope,2,Thu Jul 9 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"Abraham,Tara  for sure And one of the people in Rick's inner circle"
thewalkingdead,3conrd,Golden_Joker,4,Thu Jul 9 21:15:00 2015 UTC,Anyone think Glen will die next season?
thewalkingdead,3conrd,snapalope,9,Thu Jul 9 15:18:42 2015 UTC,I'm going for Season 7. I'm pretty much certain Season 6 is going to be the end of Daryl...
thewalkingdead,3conrd,Foundation17s,9,Thu Jul 9 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"Daryl has Rick status in terms of safety, he isn't going anywhere because he brings in a large % of female viewers and at the end of the day AMC controls what happens and ratings rules creativity. Dexter's finale is a prime example of that. (they refused to let them kill off Dexter)    The only chance Daryl has at dying is when the ratings drop a LOT and they kill him off for shock value. Shit, Carl has a higher chance of dying than Daryl at this point."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,MonkeH13,2,Fri Jul 10 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"To the % of female argument, I raise you /spoilerJon Snow/spoiler"
thewalkingdead,3conrd,MonkeH13,2,Sat Jul 11 06:28:37 2015 UTC,"You have a flaw in your argument and it's that HBO doesn't strictly care about ratings, AMC? They do. AMC isn't a $10-15 a month premium channel like HBO.    Rick Grimes right now has a better chance of dying than Daryl. I mean, shit. Go into a Hastings or a store that has a Walking Dead section and look for yourself, he has like 10x more merch than any other character on the show. Your character? Same amount as any other."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,bleed_nyliving,6,Sun Jul 12 14:16:56 2015 UTC,"I hope so...  Not because I don't like Daryl, he's great. There are a lot of directions his character could go, death just seems most likely. Like you said, he feels accepted & that was the majority of his character; the outsider.   Truth be told though, I'm just sick to death of his goddamn fan club."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,GamingTatertot,4,Thu Jul 9 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Death is the only way his character can go which won't make him stale. Similar to Carol I think, she's ""helped"" someone in a violent relationship (through Rick). I think she could be on the chopping block too.."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,thatguyad,5,Thu Jul 9 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"But Daryl is so strong and is such a capable survivor, why him?"
thewalkingdead,3conrd,Saratje,4,Thu Jul 9 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong. He's very capable and very strong, so was Shane. I just feel Daryl's story is becoming complete, in the sense he feels accepted and he has an ""outsider"" friend, Aaron.  I just have a small feeling his times up."
thewalkingdead,3conrd,Seth_Krogan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:55:59 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I feel so I was seeing him surviving the whole damn thing. Didn't really take into account story lines but it just doesn't make sense to me that he would die bc it seems like he is too resourceful/strong to actually go down.
