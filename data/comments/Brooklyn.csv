Brooklyn,3duw7z,anniczka,2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I was super excited when I saw it.  I met up with my girlfriend to get pizza after I had a little photoshoot, so I had all my camera gear with me.  We decided to eat the pizza in the park as the sun was going down.  After eating I laid back and looked up at the tree we were under and I go ""is that a real owl you think?""  I was looking at the hawk from behind, so I couldn't tell what it was.  I thought maybe it was a fake owl to keep other pests away, have you ever seen those?  Anyway, I pulled out my camera with a 70-200mm zoom and walked around to the other side.  That's when I realized I was looking at a red tailed hawk!  The sun was going down and the was in the tree so the light was shit.  I wish it had been day time.  I had to do some modest editing to get a good shot.  Some cropping too, heh.  As we were leaving the hawk showed off his wing span and held a pose for a solid 3 seconds.  I was so pissed I missed that.  Can you imagine the photo?  His wings were stretched as far as they could go.  UGH."

I would find myself standing on our radiator with the same lens as you, trying to get a shot of one way up in the trees. I didn't get to see a redtail hawk, but the one visiting us was a Cooper hawk. Hoping it comes back again in the fall and winter when the leaves don't block my view. Really amazing all of the wildlife you see!"
Brooklyn,3duw7z,anniczka,3,Sun Jul 19 21:27:18 2015 UTC,Really amazing all of the wildlife you see!   Right?  I brought my camera to Prospect Park to take pictures of ducks.  Totally wasn't expecting to see swans.

If I could, I'd have a lens that goes up to 600mm and I'd just photograph birds all day.  Too bad those lenses don't dip below the $10k price point.  As it stands, this is my best ""bird in flight"" pictures so far.  I didn't even know bird pictures were an option until recently.   Also, sorry for spamming you with my bird pics.

It was a lot easier in the winter, but I've been able to get some good stuff too for my first time around trying this stuff - on the feeder  And here are two of the hawk I was telling you about - of course it sat on the furthest tree and highest branch, but was really cool to see!

There are plenty of companies that provide wheelchair vehicles.  You can get a van with a lift and anchors to transport you.  If anyone expects that company to provide that service and a ride for the same cost as other livery transport I don't know what to say.  NYC MTA buses provide a lift and wheelchair service for no more fee but that is a government service.  I am all for equal access but expecting private persons to fit the bill is ludicrous."

I'm not handicapped myself, so I dont have any exposure to Access-a-ride or how it works, but even if it is cheaper, it seems like it is only cheaper in the short term. I feel like having more stations, (not all of them obviously) being handicap accessible would be cheaper in the long term than maintaining a seperate fleet of vehicles and drivers for Access-a-ride.  Anyway, I'm no economist and I'm sure someone else has done the math, so I'll concede to agree that the city's budget is limited, but I think we need a long-term solution.

Brooklyn,3dw8ob,Oxyuscan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"Whoa, I think you misunderstood my point. I don't think private companies should be forced by city government to comply with wheelchair accessibility, instead I think the city government should get their own shit together and make public transport better.  In terms of my personal pocket? Yes I believe that there are lots of great public services that are paid for by taxes. The police, libraries, the fire department, public parks. I enjoy all of those, who knows, maybe I or a loved one will be wheelchair bound one day, and I would want those types of accessibility to be widely available without having to wait for it to be profitable to a private company"

Brooklyn,3dwaqd,cojabro,8,Mon Jul 20 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"white,female,young (which I found super rude).   But that's exactly the type of person who would run in to trouble, at night, anywhere.  It's an unfortunate fact.  They're right.  Are you small in stature?  You're easy prey for anyone whether you like it or not.  Is Bushwick safe?  I guess so.  But are you going to completely avoid being a target?  Not by a long shot.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, and I'm not trying to put the fear in you, but that's just how it is.  I can't really speak for the safety of the neighborhood.  I'm a man, 6'7"", 230lbs.  Not a lot of people are going to fuck with me.  But if I were a 5'5"" white girl not old enough to drink?  I'd be on high alert.  My girlfriend is a small, thin, white female and she never had any problems beyond cat calling and she's been in the neighborhood a long time.  However, I do have friends who have been jacked.  Just don't go home so drunk you can't walk straight, don't look too guarded, but don't look to comfortable either.  Just walk like you know what you're doing and generally people won't bother you.  Everyone that I know who has been fucked up it's been because they were very drunk and an easy target.  Take a cab directly home if you get smashed.  TL;DR -  It's not ""dangerous"" but due to your (possibly) size and gender you're unfortunately an easy target for bad people."

Catcalling is more of an issue in Bushwick than other areas but I've never felt ""unsafe"".  One thing to keep in mind: what would YOU do if you worked as the receptionist in the 83rd precinct and a woman called you and was concerned about the safety of the neighborhood that her daughter was moving into? Because if that were me, I'd exaggerate because I'd assume that anyone whose PARENT called the precinct would be really sheltered and couldn't handle themselves in the city, because a parent is handling something that their child should be doing. (I'm not saying you are sheltered, I'm just pointing out that this is how it might look to someone at the police station.)  If you're confident that you can handle yourself in the city, then you're fine. If you have the common sense not to use noise-cancelling headphones when you walk out of the subway at 2am by yourself, then you're fine. If you have the common sense not to talk really loudly outside your bodega about how you have six ipads in your louis vuitton bag, you're fine. Really, anything you should be doing to stay ""safe"" in Bushwick is something you should be doing anywhere in the city."
Brooklyn,3dwaqd,M314M,4,Mon Jul 20 02:59:02 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Bushwick for almost 2 years now. I'm a 28 year old white female, 5'4"", 120lbs, and I'd like to think that I have enough rage in me to fight off any fucker who tried to touch me but who am I kidding? So I don't chance it.  I live two stops east from you on the J (Halsey) but I'm on the other side of Broadway, and past Bushwick Ave too (north). In my experience so far, I do not walk home alone at night. I don't take the train home alone at night. I basically don't go out alone at night. I've read enough news articles in the past two years of living here that I feel like, for me, it's not worth the risk of putting myself out there as a target. Cat calling is pretty heavy in this neighborhood and I've had some very bad experiences with that also so that's been enough for me to nope the fuck out of inviting that possibility late at night.  I think you'll be fine if you're smart about certain things and that goes for no matter where you live here. Don't walk with your headphones in after dark or even super early in the morning (my female roommate sometimes has to walk to the train around 6am and has still encountered some sketchy situations). Always be aware of your surroundings. Carry mase. Don't walk home alone at night. Check your surroundings before you enter your apartment building. Text your roommates if you're going home and know you'll have to walk for a bit.  All of these precautions have unfortunately been presented as necessary as a result of acts of violence that happen to occur around here (and cities in general). I don't necessarily think you need to break your lease. If worse comes to worse and you experience some scary situations where you live and you want out, you can try to explain to your landlord what has happened and maybe figure something out. Until then, just be mindful and smart and realize that taking a cab home late at night is worth it in the long run."

I was mugged once... in Williamsburg blocks from the Bedford stop 3 years ago. I once talked to someone who was mugged at gunpoint in the West Village during the day. Anecdotally I used to hear about more break-ins in Bushwick than other neighborhoods, but this was also years ago. I'd be careful about making sure you have a deadlock and being smart about locks on windows. But I was also the victim of a break-in recently, again in Williamsburg which is is a neighborhood no one would call unsafe.  If I were you I would try to talk to other women your age in the neighborhood to get an idea of how they feel walking around, particularly late at night. But right now in New York crime levels are historically low and it's hard to characterize individual neighborhoods as prone to random low level crime like muggings and break ins. I have friends who are young women who've lived in that neighborhood for years and never complained about it being unsafe."

Brooklyn,3dp9xs,loudasthesun,2,Sat Jul 18 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"They have a smartphone app that lets you deposit checks.   To deposit cash it's a little trickier. I think you have to mail it in an envelope that you can request, send it back, etc. I've had them for 5 years now and have never done that. I have a secondary Chase account that I deposit cash into if I really need to."

Brooklyn,3dp9xs,Gian_Doe,2,Sat Jul 18 04:17:09 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of TD Bank. They are fairly common. They can print debit cards on the spot. They used to reimburse ATM fees a few years back but stopped.

Brooklyn,3dp9xs,ianmac47,2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:52 2015 UTC,"I overdrafted my checking account once with them.  They transferred an amount to cover that check from my credit card account to my checking account.  No over draft fees.  So if you happen to lose your debit card and someone gets a little crazy buying stuff with your card, they don't delay reimbursing you with the money.  So if you have $300 in fraudulent charges, they put that $300 back in your checking account almost immediately."
Brooklyn,3dp9xs,thefranster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure USAA actually developed that technology. They have a lot of members who are deployed, so it makes sense they would need alternative options for deposits.   Navy Federal Credit Union is also a great option. They have a lot of overlap for eligibility but not 100%.  All this being said, they do not have locations in the city. If you really need to visit a physical branch, you'll have to go to West Point for USAA or Kings Point for NFCU, but I've never really had the need."
Brooklyn,3dp9xs,weirdsun,2,Sun Jul 19 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"Chase Bank.   There is an ATM in every Duane Reade, every transportation hub, and branches in most of the business districts."
Brooklyn,3dp9xs,strangebrewfellows,2,Sat Jul 18 21:51:45 2015 UTC,Chase is definitely the best in terms of atms because they're in every Duane Reade too- but it's also worth considering something like simple (online banking)- you can potentially get more flexibility with atms that way- if you're ever leaving new York City Chase isn't actually as popular. Just a thought. Td bank is another NYC east coast friendly bank that may not serve you well if you have a habit of traveling at all.

You might have to catch a short taxi ride to one of the locations, each with a different length.  They pick you up downstream and drive you back, or they drive you to the dropoff location and you float back to where you started, depending on the stretch.  If you start above Port Jervis, there are a few barge rocks to float past, not quite whitewater but it can get exciting.  Below the city, in Dingman's Ferry for example, the water is pretty sedate.  It's more about being out on the water, pulling off on shore for lunch, etc."

Brooklyn,3dm94o,steve_nyc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:25:41 2015 UTC,"Event description from BPL website:   When Samuel Battle broke the color line as New York City’s first African American cop in the second decade of the twentieth century, he had to fear his racist colleagues as much as criminals. He had to be three times better than his white peers, and many times more resilient. His life was threatened. He was displayed like a circus animal. Yet, fearlessly claiming his rights, he prevailed in a four-decade odyssey that is both the story of one man’s courageous dedication to racial progress and a harbinger of the divisions between police and the people they serve that plague twenty-first-century America. Author Arthur Browne, in conversation with Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, tells Battle’s amazing story at the Brooklyn Public Library.  Arthur Browne has written the first-draft history of New York for more than forty years. As a reporter and editor, he has chronicled six mayors, from Abe Beame through Bill de Blasio, and coauthored I, Koch, a biography of Mayor Ed Koch. Browne presently serves as the Daily News editorial page editor. In 2007, he led a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for editorials that documented the epidemic illnesses afflicting thousands of 9/11 rescue and recovery workers."

PLG gets dicier the further east you get but I don't feel unsafe anywhere in the neighborhood, and to be fair some of the blocks right off Flatbush Ave in the Historic District are really nice.   I've lived here since 2012 and haven't had any issues besides one time when a crazy guy walked into the laundromat and yelled about all the white people and a separate incident when a homeless guy started screaming at me unprovoked at the Prospect Park station.   There are shootings and stuff, but the vast majority of these incidents are between people who know each other. Yes I know stray bullets don't discriminate but if you're smart it won't be a problem.    Neighborhood is highly Caribbean (Haiti, Trinidad, Jamaica, Bermuda, I'm sure a few others) with a steady stream of white people moving in, especially in those yuppie spaceship-looking buildings that are popping up east of Nostrand. I guess it's because the Historic District limits development further west. Sometimes the lack of neighborhood amenities bothers me but things are getting better in that respect too.    Basically, if safety is your biggest concern then I'd sign the lease. The Q At Parkside is a local blog that should also give a pretty good idea of what the neighborhood is like."

I haven't been in a while but there are a few locations, and I'd usually go to either Park Slope or Ft. Greene. those bagels RULE. Corner deli for an egg and cheese with salt n pepper, duh I've only been to Champs once but I LOVED it. it's a sit-down place.

Brooklyn,3d9iv0,clientsoup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:02 2015 UTC,"36 therms is a lot.  1 therm can raise the temperature of 555lb of water from 32F to 212F (assuming perfect energy transfer, so, not actually) but that might put it in to perspective how much 36 therms is.  Math: 1 therm = 100,000 BTUs. 1 BTU can raise 1 pound of water by 1F. 32 to 212 degrees is 180F. 100,000 / 180 = 555."

Brooklyn,3d6i6s,crbiker,3,Tue Jul 14 11:47:25 2015 UTC,"""Unlike me, a guy who really knows his stuff! That's why I'm supporting Rick Perry, a Real American.""   Is this some shitty attempt at ad hominem? Assuming that I'm a conservative because I don't like the guy who's offering a free pony to every little kid in this country?  The real issue with Sanders is that he's calling for policies that presume that the government is capable of functionally managing the economy, and further assumes that the government can be trusted with and should have certain powers over the economy that, if when abused, would have horrifying consequences. Again, I do not think Sanders expects or intends such, but if he were to get them implemented horrifying outcomes would be a predictable result. Intentions aren't worth jack shit when reality comes into play.  I mean, his plan to give free college out to everyone. Leaving aside the 'free' part, it doesn't do anything to address the systemic failings and inefficiencies that are plaguing higher education. We see it in Europe (where 'free' college is the norm), the outcomes are simply not living up to the costs. European Youth unemployment, in general, is almost twice that of youth unemployment in the U.S.   Getting people educated is wonderful! But if they're not actually being prepared for the real world and thus aren't actually getting jobs, its functionally a waste. (EDIT: added link to Slate Star Codex. This guy handles it better than I can) Arguably it'd be better to take that money and use it to hire young people directly (no, I'm not advocating this) so at least they'd have some experience and savings to start with. And lets just wonder, for a moment, what kind of control the government might exercise over schools if it has even more power over their funding than it does presently.   Then there's his minimum wage plan. Now I can go all over the place with how bad this is, but mainly I'll point out that once again, minimum wage tends to hurt the youngest and least experienced the most. Basically the only choice for a young person in Sanders' America is to go to college, because they sure as shit won't get work if they aren't valuable enough to meet the minimum wage rate. At least the classes are 'free!'  And his whole shtick about social security and the rest of the 'safety net,' which he wants to expand. Now the thing about SS is that its looking to be 'insolvent' by 2033. There are, if this is true, only two ways to 'fix' this. Decrease payouts (or raising the age for it) or increase pay-ins.   For a 25 year old now, they've got 40 years before they can even think about claiming SS, and the program will be insolvent in 20. So at some point the program will either start demanding more from that once-25 year old (to pay out to current recipients) or it'll cut down on their ability to claim benefits. So guess what young people! Not only will you many of you be unemployed, those of you who do have jobs will be leaned on heavily to support the previous generation with no promise of consummate returns!  Oh, but Sanders has a plan for that. He's gonna Tax the rich to get the money. Which is funny since that's similar to how he claims to want to pay for the college plan. Hes not holding back, either. Sanders wants to Tax the shit out of people.. So guess what kids? Many of you will be unemployed, those who are employed will be carrying the burden for the past generation... and if you happen to make it big you're probably not going to be seeing much of that money reach your pocket since Sanders (who is, incidentally, a member of that previous generation) has pre-emptively decided that you don't get to keep it.  How would this not end in a situation not-dissimilar to Greece?  Suffice it to say that the government has certainly proven its trustworthiness wit your money, right? Lets just go ahead and give 'em more of it!  NOW you can perhaps begin to see why Bernie's popularity amongst the youth would be considered ironic and make him 'terrible.' He's selling young people a panacea that could, with significant likelihood, actually hurt them even more than they've already been hurt. He's instilling the idea that if we just got the right people in government, they'd solve all us Millennial's problems, and that there will be little to no downside. He's not addressing underlying issues as he is layering on more programs to try and fix outcomes to where he'd like them.   It isn't working for Venezuela, it isn't working for France, I have almost no reason to think it would work here.  Truth is there are no great options for millenials this election but Sanders might be the most perversely dangerous, since he is Pied-pipering them deeper into the government trap rather than out of it.  This isn't even touching on his economic nationalism."
Brooklyn,3d6i6s,hbools,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:24:48 2015 UTC,"Did you write a blog at some point and now routinely copy-paste its contents into anything related to Bernie Sanders on this sub-reddit? Crafting a hypothetical comparing the economy of the United States to GREECE really doesn't help your case here.  Also, sourcing the ""EPI"" on minimum wage policy is a fucking joke, do you usually just pass along the first article you agree with as fact?  Since you're so adamantly taking the offensive, albeit with noteworthy cadence, wouldn't it be useful to offer up alternatives in order to better fuel discussion? I find it hard to take you seriously."
Brooklyn,3d6i6s,MrHeuristic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Copy-paste from the other thread that you posted this in.    but if he were to get them implemented horrifying outcomes would be a predictable result   What you're saying is that it's to be expected that socialist policies result in horrifying outcomes. Why is it, then, that social democracies aren't going up in flames? To believe what you're saying, we'd have to accept that Germany, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Greenland are ""horrifying"".   We see it in Europe (where 'free' college is the norm), the outcomes are simply not living up to the costs.   It's already been addressed, but you haven't established a link between youth unemployment and free/low-cost higher education. You haven't even established that the unemployed youth in those countries are college educated. What's the link here?   I'll point out that once again, minimum wage tends to hurt the youngest and least experienced the most. Basically the only choice for a young person in Sanders' America is to go to college, because they sure as shit won't get work if they aren't valuable enough to meet the minimum wage rate.   Your 'source' here is a sponsored piece by EPI, a think tank that was created by a lobbyist organization that represents the restaurant, hotel, alcoholic beverage and tobacco industries. These industries are very interested in keeping the minimum wage low. The authors of the papers within your link have received grant money from EPI. That's about as far from an unbiased source as you can get.  I'll throw in some references here that refute your claim:   New York: ""I re-examine their estimates using data from the full CPS, rather than the smaller CPS-MORG files they use, and find no evidence of a negative employment impact. The full CPS, which is the source of U.S. official labor market statistics, is certainly the more appropriate and reliable data."" United States: ""We find no evidence that these minimum wage increases had an adverse effect on the employment of teens not in college or adults with less than a high school education"" UK: ""Our meta-analysis of 236 estimated minimum-wage elasticities and 710 partial correlation coefficients from sixteen UK studies finds no overall practically significant adverse employment effect.""   I'm sure I can find more.   Hes not holding back, either. Sanders wants to Tax the shit out of people.   Well, yes, that's how this works. You pay more in taxes, you get more social benefits. Again, see: Germany, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and others. What's bad about this, again?   and if you happen to make it big you're probably not going to be seeing much of that money reach your pocket   Oh please.    since he is Pied-pipering them deeper into the government trap rather than out of it.

Midwood Flats and Bluebird are both decent, but neither has a full kitchen, so their menus are limited. Midwood Flats also has a great beer selection. It's always really busy, so it's a good place to meet people if you're looking to do that. Da Hot Pot makes a killer roti. Tugboat, Tip of the Tongue, and Blessings all have decent coffee. My favorite coffeeshop is Pel's Pie over on Rogers, about a 10 minute walk. Living on Parkside and Ocean, I would frequently walk down to the restaurants on Church and Cortelyou.

It's close to Bergn, the Brooklyn Flea, Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and 5 stops on the G from Williamsburg.

Brooklyn,3d1mmo,offlein,2,Sun Jul 12 23:30:06 2015 UTC,Can you change the settings to stop the public broadcast?
Brooklyn,3d1mmo,offlein,3,Mon Jul 13 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"NOPE! They're shitheads. And really the most irritating part is that they have set up the router so you manage it over the Internet. To be clear: that means that there's a device in your living room, and if you want to change a setting on it, your computer connects to the device, goes out to the Internet, bounces around, and then comes back to the device for each packet.  So basically if you're having any sort of network trouble, it is impossible to change your router settings. It's really dumb.  But you can use your own router and that pain point goes away. Otherwise, Optimum was far cheaper for me and notably (but not completely) less evil of a company."
Brooklyn,3d1mmo,achow,3,Mon Jul 13 01:18:47 2015 UTC,"TWC was cheaper for the same speed, at least for me. Also compatible with more modems than Optimum so you don't need to pay the extra $5 per month to rent from them. Not sure if anyone has had a different experience"

Brooklyn,3cyub3,acenoodle,5,Sun Jul 12 03:21:08 2015 UTC,"OP, please don't ignore this comment. Brain bleeds can be fatal or extremely dangerous, and the symptoms may be subtle.  Sometimes you can even start feeling better after hitting your head when things are actually getting worse.   My dad's cousin hit her head, and was evaluated immediately, but they missed a brain bleed. She had some odd symptoms a few days later like nausea and I think imbalance, and she called up her doctor. Her doctor was on top of it, and suggested that she get radiological imaging done, which is how they discovered the bleed. She had to be taken into surgery to have her skull opened up to drain the blood. If it wasn't caught so quickly, she could've suffered some serious brain damage.   If you do not have insurance, you can look into urgent care centers. These are often much more affordable than emergency rooms.   As for dental care, as some other commenters have mentioned, look into dental schools. You can be treated here very cheaply, for free, or sometimes even be PAID I think. Dental students require patients to practice on and to be tested with, I believe. Some schools tend to give better care than others. Their instructors are supposed to check over all the students' work, so you should be okay, but I've heard some great and horrible stories. Do your research! Regarding being paid, sometimes these dental students desperately need a patient and are willing to pay a person to be their patient, but this practice is generally looked down upon because these students have student loans and are in debt. I just mention it to show you that you definitely do have options."

Brooklyn,3cwf0a,imnotthesmartestman,3,Sat Jul 11 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"It's just semantics. The police and other parts of the legal system press charges. Civilians cannot. What the cop actually meant when he said a shorter version to you was ""Do you want me to press charges against him for his crime against you."" A lot of times the police will defer to the victim. Oftentimes they don't want to have to do lots of paperwork, and if the victim isn't interested, it's very unlikely they'll get in any kind of trouble (except for certain types of crimes where victim discretion isn't allowed, such as statutory rape or domestic violence)."

She claimed no one had ever slept on it and I'm definitely inclined to believe her. It was in such immaculate shape that we couldn't pass it up. Why turn your nose up at a ""used"" mattress that's in perfect shape and is clean and an amazing deal? We aren't that snobby and this mattress was a huge upgrade for us and was definitely better than spending 800 on the mattress we initially wanted.   Also - the mattress had the original tags on it. Was originally a $700!"

Brooklyn,3cbb1y,PrettyNeatPerson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"i took the GRE with no prep.  what you need:   be able to write an essay explaining a process or describing something be able to write an essay about an opinion (mine was something like ""is reading fiction important? why or why not?"") know the maths know the reading comprehensions, grammar, and vocab be able to do the essays in limited time with no takebacks, and be able to allot your time in a multiple choice environment so that you don't waste time on questions you simply don't know   i think any half decent prep will help you with the last 3 bullets.  i doubt any prep will help you all that much for the essays.  for the essays, start reading a bunch of fiction and some amount of non-fiction now, and figure out how to test your writing skills and coherency.  maybe argue with people in /r/TMBR or write stories in /r/writingprompts but give yourself time limits.  this will also help with reading comprehension.  if you're not good at tests, i would recommend taking an algebra book, and doing as many examples from a chapter review as you can in an hour.  rinse and repeat."

Start with ""snacks"" which are several one or two bite things and then move into three more substantial items followed by a palate cleanser and dessert.   Beerwise we have a very talented young fellow spearheading our pairings and he's also great at finding what you want to drink if you don't go the pairing route. While our taplist is great people often overlook our bottle list.   Just for fun, what is a style of beer you're very fond of or curious about?  I'm sorry to say that I will be out of town on the 18th, but can I get your name to make a note on the reservation?"

Brooklyn,3c88d7,jchapstick,2,Mon Jul 6 12:22:45 2015 UTC,"The food was fantastic, but I don't recommend the beer pairing.

Brooklyn,3c7gc5,StanishInquisition,-4,Mon Jul 6 02:04:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly if we are composting then using diesel fuel trucks to cart around our waste, we might as well just let that organic waste help break down the contaminants in the dump where they'd be going anyway. IMO it doesn't really make a lot of sense to compost unless you are keeping the product on site. Maybe it has some value as a conceptual/social engineering kind of thing, but it would be nice if it made logistical sense too.  If you want to destroy the fruit flies you can leave large bowls/plates of water out with a small amount of dish soap mixed in. It takes a while to fully control. Refill the bowls when they get too full of dead fruit flies or when they dry out. Took me like 2 months all told when I had the problem, but now they are gone.   If you want to keep the smell down, it comes from having excess nitrogen, which leads to anaerobic conditions in the bin. Add a little wood mulch or other carbon source such as dry leaves, newspaper, etc, that will encourage the aerobic microbes, which don't smell. Turn/mix the bin frequently. You can also try using a worm system (and putting the product on nearby plants instead of shipping them off), but that's a larger learning curve and you may not have the time."
Brooklyn,3c7gc5,ianmac47,4,Sun Jul 5 16:39:16 2015 UTC,"New York City doesn't use open air dumps. We use landfills. Landfills don't allow organic material to break down. By separating out organic materials that can be composted, as well as recyclable materials like paper, plastic, and metal, New York reduces the rate it fills up existing landfills. That reduces the cost of trash removal as well as the distance trash is transported."
Brooklyn,3c7gc5,gg_allins_microphone,-2,Mon Jul 6 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"Agree, if there's value here it's probably in the social engineering. Thanks for your suggestions on the flies and smells.

Probably about $5000 worth of fireworks were shot off by him. He sent a drone up to record it all. Gotta track Down the YouTube video of it.  But thanks for the tip. I had a great time on the roof watching

I ended up getting mine back a strangely long time after it was turned in. They actually mailed a letter to my parents house (the address on my physical license at the time, though I had changed it in DMV records) informing them that it had been turned in.  If it is turned in, it will probably be with the cash emptied, and the cops will cut the debit card in half before giving it to you (but you should already have Chase mailing you a new one ASAP).  Best of luck!"
Brooklyn,3bwk5n,BBnet3000,3,Thu Jul 2 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I once got mine back a few months later, after I'd pretty much forgotten about it -- the cops mailed it to my home address while I was away at school and called them saying (I think tongue-in-cheek) that it took so long because they didn't know which address to mail it to: my NY one (real ID) or Maryland one (fake ID). One day I called my dad one day asking about some health insurance information and he responded ""Why, are you looking into becoming a MD resident?"" He went on to explain the police had mailed my wallet back, fake and all. Good times."

Also don't plan on driving anywhere for an several hours either side of the show.

I really like the actual restaurant and the music is always fun and the waitstaff is great, but I like this method way more than waiting 2 hours for a table.

The owners don't have to give an explanation. Employment laws have eroded to the point where almost everyone is an at-will employee and anyone (even me and even you) can be fired at any minute for any reason, as long as it's not provable as a recognized form of discrimination. The owners have most likely done exactly what is within their legal rights to do, which is, of course, devastating to all of the suddenly-fired employees.   Unfortunately, the employees and the public have no recourse beyond voting for lawmakers who will increase employment protections (who are few and far between) or boycotting any future businesses opened by Bierkraft's former proprietors (who are mentioned by name in the linked article).  This is a systemic problem, and not one linked solely to whatever business used to occupy a slot on 5th Avenue."

Brooklyn,3bs88w,tookamidnighttrain,0,Thu Jul 2 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"i can't tell if this is serious or a troll attempt.  i doubt the owners were sharing their rent, balance sheets, payroll info, etc. with every sandwich maker/bus boy.  bierkraft is always packed.  thats the reason why this story is even newsworthy...because its well liked and it seemed to be doing good business.  do you have a job?  if your boss told you not to show up tomorrow because it closed for good, but didnt give you a reason (and didnt give you a heads up to let you start trying to find another job)...that wouldnt annoy you?  do you live in the real world where these types of things have consequences for people?"

Call them in the morning and find out wtf is going on. Go to landlord tenant court in the morning as well. You need to get an OSC (order to show cause). This will buy you a couple of weeks to figure out what's going on.  Before a Marshall can evict anyone, they have to serve a 72 hour notice. Those notices went somewhere. The Marshalls notice should also have the name of the plaintiff so you will know who initiated the action."

If you don't have a lease, you can be evicted.  But with proper process.  That's one rental period of notice and then an eviction suit in housing court.   Yesterday without warning a Marshall came and evicted two of the six units.   You don't need to be warned about other units' evictions, but the tenants in those units do.  If they were evicted without process (unless it was because the units were illegal and unsafe (and those evictions are usually ordered by the fire marshall)), then those tenants should go to housing court and tell the clerk they had an illegal lockout."

A big part of what their district offices do is to help people with housing problems. They can contact landlords, city agencies, and other authorities on your behalf, they can connect you with resources and information and sometimes even free legal advice. When I was working in an elected official's office, a call like this would have been a priority for us.  Others have pointed out that you can't be evicted without notice, and that's an important point. But I really advise you to get someone on your side."
Brooklyn,3boni8,Chester_Allman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"Similar situation happened to me about 3 years ago. Had a lease through a management company overseeing a foreclosed building. Didn't get officially evicted but the new owners tried to tell us our lease was void and we had to leave. Tried going through proper channels, but to no avail (didn't feel like taking it to court). Ultimately we negotiated with the new owners that since we didn't technically have to leave, they should cover our moving expenses (first month/last month/broker fee on a new place) to which they agreed.   A week after we moved out the whole place was being gut renovated. So ultimately we felt kind of shafted.

Instead of Capulets and Montagues, the feud exists between North and Central Richmond. Amongst the tension stands a young poet named Donté Clark . Armed with passion and intellect he survives the madness of the cities’ violence and revenge (all over dispute few can remember) with words. Inspired by Shakespeare and encouraged by his mentor and counterparts at RAW (Richmond Artists With) Talent, Donté adapts Romeo and Juliet for the modern day strife around him. Using hip-hop metaphors, Donté and his collaborators dismantle the prevailing turmoil with the art of spoken word. Even if only performed once for the community, the artistry and action of RAW Talent and Donté in the film will inspire long after the curtain has fallen.

Brooklyn,3bmhcd,holyfruits,8,Tue Jun 30 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen that comparison between the Confederate flag and the US flag before. It misses a fundamental point: the US flag represents a nation founded on the premise that all men are created equal; the struggle has always been to expand the meaning of ""all men."" The Confederate flag represents a nation founded on the premise that some men had a God-given right to own other men.  Whatever the (many) sins of our nation, the US flag is redeemable. The Confederate flag is not.  That said, burning the flag is their right, as stupid and distasteful as it might be. I'll just be glad to steer clear of the whole scene."

However, your argument is sound.  I'd say, if you HAVE to burn a flag, burn the Confederate one.  At least it is logical!  And you could go one step further and say that burning the U.S. flag cancels out the very symbolism of the act.  When you burn the U.S. flag you are exercising the core right the flag symbolizes.  It's like fish protesting water.  Instead you need to burn a symbol of something that should change like, I don't know, the use of the Confederate flag on government property."

Agree with you re: the symbolism of burning the US flag.

Despite the narrative the media has decided to run with, the vast majority of people in the South do not actually believe it is a white person's right to massacre innocent black people.

Brooklyn,3bhwbs,robblatt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"The comments about how the place is run down are quite true, but it really is (to me) such an interesting building.  The huge basement that used to be baths, I think.  Massive upper story space.  It really would need a ridiculous amount of work, but would be perfect for some BAM-like institution.  Not going to happen.  But still."

RIGHT outside my window. Along with a surly skater neighbor who did not care to compromise in any way about time of use, insane music/noise level, or her partying habits. My landlord, I soon found out, is a slum lord. It took til January to get them to have her move the ramp... And of course she put it right back up this year with no recourse... So we are moving (not soon enough... August 1!). There is also a shit ton of miscellaneous garbage (scrap material, empty bottles, a Home Depot shopping cart??) in the back yard... My bike was recently stolen and my bf's bike wheel was stolen a few weeks ago. Had we been able to keep them in the yard, this probably wouldn't have been an issue. We literally had no idea moving in because the yard was empty/clean and we thought we would be able to lounge/BBQ like normal people. Hope you have better luck than we did. If you have a legit landlord you should have no problem... But it seems to me that if people are audacious enough to build a skate ramp, it's probably not the case (but maybe your neighbors are just really really stupid?)..."

Cons - I can't think of any right now, I guess occasionally walking home late at night you'll see a few drunks but never the violent types  Overall it's not the nicest Brooklyn neighborhood but it's affordable, strong sense of community and enjoyable diverse foods  Plus it's near Atlantic terminal so transfers to other parts of NYC are simple"

It's very much a residential and family oriented place, there are a couple bars but not a whole lot of nightlife. You'll see drunks vomiting, and a lot of public drinking and marijuana smoking, but violent crime is highly uncommon. Check out http://maps.nyc.gov/crime/ - Sunset Park and the 72 Pct are some of the safest neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Even robberies per capita are lower here than in Park Slope. I think we have only had one shooting this year and no homicides, in a precinct of almost 130,000 people.  On 4th and 5th Avenues it seems like people are walking at all hours of the day and night - it can definitely seem desolate and creepy on the quieter industrial blocks of 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Avenues, but I have gone on runs there at night with no problems. I don't think there are really any ""problem locations"" inside the neighborhood, exercise the same amount of caution you would in any urban setting. I've loved my time here, super cheap and only a quick bus or train from the bars in South Slope or Bay Ridge."

It was quiet and uneventful for five years or so, and then seemingly overnight the rents shot up and the neighborhood changed visually. Developers, landlords and real estate agents just got crazy busy on this incoming wave of demand.  I actually just moved out and into Lefferts a few months ago, so I guess I'm part of the change you're referring to. A ton of the apartments down here are rent stabilized unlike in Bed-Stuy where very few are, so hopefully that keeps prices resistant to explosive change and keeps the neighborhood's culture practical."

I also don't remember seeing high prices when I was looking for apartments in Ditmas Park.

By 'new phenomenon' I'm referring to my personal experience having lived in the area for a long time and not seen this jump in population here in Ditmas Park before. So, instead of ""new phenomenon,"" please read ""new activity that I've not yet seen in this particular neighborhood, which I expected, but want more information now.""

Brooklyn,3b7pr9,dominicunt212,10,Fri Jun 26 22:35:46 2015 UTC,The article fails to mention that Lee Avenue is where his house is located (I believe it's currently used as officer housing). So the name makes sense from that perspective.
Brooklyn,3b7pr9,lampbane,9,Fri Jun 26 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"This is stupid. Lee was also a decorated veteran of the US army from the Mexican American war. Also how can you differentiate a street named after Robert E. Lee vs Charles Lee, the general in the continental army."
Brooklyn,3b7pr9,Human_Robot,10,Fri Jun 26 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"In fairness, a few years after I moved there, they changed the signs from ""Lee Avenue"" to ""General Robert E. Lee Avenue,"" which I think is pretty horrendous just on the legibility front. So I don't object to just changing it back to ""Lee Avenue."" Which, as you point out, becomes more ambiguous."
Brooklyn,3b7pr9,lampbane,2,Fri Jun 26 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"Also how can you differentiate a street named after Robert E. Lee vs Charles Lee, the general in the continental army.   Because we know who the street was named after, and it wasn't Charles Lee.  Context matters."
Brooklyn,3b7pr9,CydeWeys,4,Sat Jun 27 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily for the idea in the article but I think your argument is a bit flawed--your point is that history and context are absolute, which they aren't. A lot of history has happened since General Lee was a respected figure.  I also don't think it's relevant that JUST NOW people care.

Brooklyn,3b7pr9,elliok7,4,Sun Jun 28 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"No, he wasn't. He said that even if slavery was wrong, God had allowed slavery and it was up to God to decide when it would end, not abolitionists."
Brooklyn,3b7pr9,blackbeansandrice,5,Sat Jun 27 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"Right, and then during the war he was in favor of the plan to set all the slaves free, in a last ditch effort to win the war and have a slave-free CSA.   It's complicated - but he certainly didn't like slavery or having slaves, he inherited them and had to work them to pay off inherited debts. He then set them free during the war as per his father-in-law's will.   But he supported his family opening an illegal school on the plantation after he inherited it, and the raising of funds to free slaves and send them to Liberia if they so chose."

Brooklyn,3b2t42,phstoven,12,Thu Jun 25 15:11:20 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree with the high ratings this place gets. I found the food to be mediocre and lacking, and have heard from others that, while Tom's used to be good in the past, it's not really that great anymore.   Keep in mind this is coming from a gal who has very low standards for food. I literally will eat plain canned beans, without anything, and find it delicious. My meals often consist of unsalted, boiled rice and lentils, and I'll find it pretty tasty. But wow, I found the food at Tom's bland, dry, overdone. I couldn't even fathom that I would ever have such a negative opinion about food at any restaurant, given that my standards are so low, I don't even salt or season my foods at home over 50% of the time.   Combine mediocre food with crazy crowds + subpar service due to said crazy crowds, I would highly recommend that you go elsewhere."
Brooklyn,3b2t42,nopooq,9,Thu Jun 25 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but I agree. I used to go to Tom's quite a bit, then one day just sort of realized... the food's not really that good - even for a diner. ""Bland, dry, overdone"" pretty much captures it. The atmosphere is awesome and the waiters are friendly, but really the only good food I've had there is the pancakes.  I like Purity Diner on 7th Avenue and 7th Street. And Dizzy's is a little hipper than a typical diner, but it's pretty good too. In downtown Brooklyn, New Apollo is perfectly competent."

I'm in Williamsburg and we have a good relationship with the precinct here. There are definitely officers dealing with bike theft (same cops that deal with burglaries) and they do have usual suspects. They do take it seriously, that doesn't mean they're going to catch the guy, but I've definitely had conversations about it with the officers, get mug shots, stolen bike reports and other things by email"

Brooklyn,3aypqp,applegingerbrandy,8,Wed Jun 24 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"Living alone in DUMBO at your budget is definitely out of the question. Living with roommates is unlikely unless you get super lucky. However, since DUMBO is at the edge of both Brooklyn and Manhattan, you have a lot of options.  The main subway lines in DUMBO are the A, C, and F. Further down the F line into Brooklyn is Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens. These neighborhoods are all also pricey but you're more likely to find a shared apartment there. Down the A/C line, there's Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, Clinton Hill and Bed-Stuy. The further you go down the line, the more likely you will find a place that fits your budget. FYI I lived in Bed-Stuy last year and rent was around $900 for 1 room in a 2 bedroom. I wouldn't go further east than Bed-Stuy if you want to keep your commute short, or up north to Williamsburg/Bushwick/Greenpoint because there's no direct subway lines to DUMBO there. Although those neighborhoods are an option if you keep your car.   If you go across the bridge, you'll be on the Lower East Side/Chinatown in Manhattan. These aren't the nicest neighborhoods but you can probably find something that fits your budget there if you share with at least one person. Further north you'll be in Soho, and then the East/West Village. Those areas are popular because that's where a large chunk of NYU's campus is, so it's pricey and packed. And it only gets pricier the further into Midtown you go, so I would cut off my search there.   Search listings constantly and keep your area options open because renting in NYC can be kind of a nightmare. You'll find something if you're persistent. Good luck"
Brooklyn,3aypqp,eatingbread,9,Wed Jun 24 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"if the job's in DUMBO, you can live literally anywhere in Brooklyn.  1100/mo is not your own apartment in most places, get used to living with someone else until you make decent money.  Also, get used to a longer than 30 minute commute, again until you make more money or are willing to sacrifice dignity and adulthood in generous amounts.   Decide for yourself which is more important, your privacy, your time, or your money.   You don't get it all straight out of college in NYC without a trust fund."
Brooklyn,3aypqp,MasterDave,3,Wed Jun 24 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"Bedstuy is a good bet...i lived there for awhile right by the koszciozizizizzko pool or however you spell it. There are lots of new apartment buildings going up with prices in your range. Youre 30 minutes from Dumbo and about the same from the LES and West Village. Bushwick is cheapish and there are tons of young people out there and many more bars than Bedstuy. dont sell the car, keep that sucker and you will love being able to drive out to the rockaways or to the pocanos on the weekends to escape the city. There are a lot of great places to live on $1,100/mo but like others said DUMBO wont be one of them.   edit: You will have to live with a roommate or 2. Never live with more than 2 roommates tho...its an absolute nightmare and i wouldn't wish it on anyone."
Brooklyn,3aypqp,someguyinbk,2,Wed Jun 24 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"I work in DUMBO and live in BedStuy. 30 minutes by public transit and 20 on a bike (to work is all downhill as well). Living off the A is a quick subway to DUMBO and Manhattan. I'm on Putnam and Tompkins and there is always parking on Putnam, you just have to deal with moving your car twice a week.   Also, BedStuy is a great neighborhood."

Brooklyn,3aypqp,someguyinbk,3,Thu Jun 25 21:58:39 2015 UTC,DUMBO is insanely expensive [and might be the most boring neighborhood in the city at its price point IMHO].  If you want more space or your own place take a ride towards the deeper Brooklyn ends of the F or the A/C and you'll have an easy commute to work. Finding a studio anywhere is going to be tight on 1100 unless you want to live in Jersey or the Bronx and even then.  1100 a month will get you a room almost anywhere in Brooklyn (except DUMBO).
Brooklyn,3aypqp,InfiniteGist,3,Wed Jun 24 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"I live in Ridgewood and work in Dumbo, and it's about a 30 minute commute. Like everyone else is saying, pretty much anywhere west of Ridgewood will get you there in 30 or less."

(plus many more!) A 30 minute trip in NYC is usually like 2-4 miles away. In Chicago, Houston, LA or whatever - a 30 minute trip is like 10-20 miles away, i.e. cars.

DUMBO is probably impossible, there are some apartments in Vinegar Hill that might work if you are willing to share with some rando.  Have you thought about Crown Heights?  Sort of the edge of gentrified Brooklyn and you can easily bike / take the AC to the area.  You'll probably still need a roommate unless you can go up to about $1,7500 - $2,000.

Brooklyn,3aunu1,BBnet3000,3,Tue Jun 23 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"Street parking is generally free. It's alternate side parking, which tends to mean you have to move your car 2-4 times per week, depending on the neighborhood (ie: cannot be parked on the left side of the street from 9am-11am on X day(s) of the week, cannot be parked on the right side of the street from 9am-11am on Y day(s) of the week). For most streets it is only on weekdays, though I occasionally catch a Saturday or Sunday sign.  As long as you plan in advance it's usually not bad. If you are busy during the days then move it in the early evening beforehand (late at night is impossible)."

This is an opinion, however.  There's a spectrum of circle pie in NYC. It's part of an evolution from the classic italian pie, neapolitan pizza, which is what you find at Emily and Paulie Gee's, to the NY slice, served by Joe's in the village. Old NY institutions, Lombardi's, Grimaldi's (now Juliana's), and Lucali serve the predecessor to the NY slice, with John's on Bleecker really bridging the gap there, almost NY slice style, but only served as a pie. The NY slice is what Williamsburg pizza serves and is frankly the best example of this left in NYC. The NY slice is in a decline.   Franny's serves a pie between neapolitan and old NY style. Wheated serves a hybrid neapolitan/old-NY/NY. Emily serves a modern take on Neapolitan which is a bit doughier than classic Neapolitan, which is closer to what Paulie Gee's serves.   Di Fara's is good, but not worth the 5 hours it takes to get a pie. If you're in the neighborhood and you can get a square slice quickly it might be worth it. Lucali pies are almost copies of Di Fara circle pies. Di Fara's square pies are better than his circles."

Brooklyn,3aksx1,holla171,7,Sun Jun 21 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly, it fosters dependency since they expect you to keep giving when you see them again. Not to mention the fact that the money is probably going towards drugs or alcohol."
Brooklyn,3aksx1,989490,3,Sun Jun 21 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"How come? Serious question...i live in london and have spent a while in NYC(about to move there) - i sometimes give to the homeless, i know it's going to drugs and booze or what have you but hey, whom am i to judge, many of them have very complex problems of mind and body - it doesn't take much to end of the streets. The beggars in NYC are a LOT more proactive than most of them in london - but most seem to go away and are pleasant about a pretty shitty situation. With the welfare system being the way it is in the states surly giving the occasional bit of loose change isnt going to do too much harm, hey it might do some good. (yea i now there are a lot of scams)"
Brooklyn,3aksx1,bottom,15,Sun Jun 21 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"Giving to the homeless in this manner actually does more harm than good. Almost none of the homeless in NYC need the money for food or shelter- there are SO MANY programs in effect to make sure they are provided for in those areas (though the shelters aren't always a good option). They usually will only use that money for booze or drugs (there's a possibility some of hem are trying to save up to get out but very unlikely).  You can offer to buy them groceries or a nice meal instead psince the quality of food at soup kitchens is pretty darn low. The problem is that, by giving money, you're feeding into the problems of Career Homeless, who get everything they need through government assistance and begging so they don't get jobs/help/etc. Also, a significant number of those beggars on the street are scammers. They have homes and could easily get jobs or even have jobs but make a living off handouts instead.  Granted, there are definitely some homeless with serious mental issues or other concerns who really are in dire straits, but you can help them by giving to a reputable organization instead. Most mentally ill street-livers actually choose to be there and have social workers who help them out through a variety of organizations."

Brooklyn,3aksx1,bottom,2,Sun Jun 21 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"I'm completely on board with the conclusions from your first link (The Atlantic article) but don't think their reasoning is sound.  Harassing people with lots of strings tied to their benefits isn't the answer but tying benefits to positive programs is.  In other words, you want to give the homeless person a bank account to accumulate money rather than giving them an EBT card where they trade it for 50 cents on the dollar."
Brooklyn,3aksx1,gagaoolala,2,Sun Jun 21 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. There are definitely a lot of ways to help and I think some of this stuff you can take with a grain of salt- it's hard to lump a whole group of people under one solution or another. But yes, if you really want to help individuals, you can definitely do a lot to get someone on their feet!"
Brooklyn,3aksx1,WithLinesOfInk,0,Sun Jun 21 20:45:40 2015 UTC,"If you have no problem with it going to drugs, booze, or lining the pockets of a scammer then go ahead. That's pretty much the precise reason why most New Yorkers don't give.  Despite the piss-poor reputation of the US welfare system, there are a ton of programs available for those who truly want to be off the streets and don't have a debilitating mental/drug/alcohol issue."

He approached me and my wife and daughter after yelling at someone else in our car. I just looked him dead in the eye in an effort to communicate ""if you fucking dare raise your voice to my wife and daughter, you are going to have a very bad day."" Apparently he got the message because he passed us by.  They guy is a menace and appears to harass mainly older people and women.  I usually pay no attention to people asking for money, but when they get aggressive, it really pisses me off. I don't owe you shit. And that includes acknowledgement. I ignore everyone on the subway, not just you ass hole."
Brooklyn,3aksx1,mars357,7,Sun Jun 21 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"My husband was talking about some aggressive panhandler on the R who got in his face about ignoring him while he was playing a game on his DS. Friday a guy got on the D who was saying things like ""I don't LIKE being ignored, just give me your change, it's not a lot to ask"" and ""It's not like I enjoy this, I hate being ignored folks, don't be that person, just help me out"" in a very loud voice. I dunno- this seems like a common occurrence. The problem is, these people could easily be unstable, so confronting them could become violent and I think suffering through a little yelling is probably he best you can do. You can try saying ""Sorry, I don't want to upset you, please leave me alone"" but who knows how that will go. Sorry."

A Taller, slender man with very indecipherable speech and maybe mental issues? From what I can gather, his opening spiel seems genuine and sincere but then he turns all dick-ish when people don't give him anything. He seems to be more annoyed when people ignore him. He's overworked the area, and the same people are turning him down every other day perhaps making him more aggressive because he seems to be taking it up a notch recently by getting more verbal and getting all up in people's faces. I don't see this getting any better for the guy, especially the area of the R he's working."

Brooklyn,3aer4o,vaginal_sores,2,Fri Jun 19 15:09:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I assumed getting there early is a must. Not aiming for this particular Saturday but yeah. Good luck with the sores btw.
Brooklyn,3aer4o,redpanda_phantomette,3,Fri Jun 19 15:15:37 2015 UTC,I would be concerned about getting a spot.  These tables/ grills fill up starting at noon and people seem to stay all day. I have never walked by the picnic area after memorial day and seen empty tables. So you might want to have a 'plan b' in case you can't get in.
Brooklyn,3aer4o,balthus1880,3,Fri Jun 19 15:18:22 2015 UTC,Highly recommend a team of people to hold down your table. I think if you arrive at 3pm and have people staking out the area you MIGHT be able to get a table. People really do hangout all day and all night.   When I had a party there last year I arrived at 11am and then had my brother meet me there at 12pm and we traded off watching the table and running to the bathroom etc. the party started at 1pm and by 2pm or 3pm the whole park was full. And that was a random Saturday in August.
Brooklyn,3aer4o,wingsta,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"On the weekends on a day with nice weather, you might have to get there by 7 or 8am to be assured getting a grill.  Last time I did a BBQ there, I got there right before 9am and got the very last one.  Everyone else that came after was standing there waiting for one for hours.  Spots seem to start opening up around 3 or 4 pm so since you are interested in doing it around 5 or 6 it is possible.  If you go during Sunday, besides worrying about getting a grill, just getting a table would be hard because of Smorgasburg right next to it.  The people buy food from there and go look for spots by the BBQ tables although by 6 Smorgasburg would be done.  I would suggest going there at least an hour or so earlier to grab any open spot so your guests don't need to wait when they all arrive.  If you plan on bringing your own grill, don't.  My friend that did a few weeks ago was told personal grills wasn't allowed by the park workers multiple times.  Luckily he arrived before 9 am and also got one of the park grills."

Brooklyn,3ac12j,newuser13,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:27:55 2015 UTC,You will have to take the F to Jay Street Metro Tech. Then the A is across the platform going in the same direction (Manhattan)... so you will need to go across to the other side. But it's not a far walk through tunnels or anything.
Brooklyn,3ac12j,localjargon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:48:52 2015 UTC,Getting to the F would take too much time.  At that point I will probably just take the B to Prospect and take the shuttle to the A.

Brooklyn,3ac12j,yallcat,3,Thu Jun 18 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"Jay Street is one stop from Dekalb on the R. The A stops at Jay Street.  Franklin is three stops from Prospect Park on the shuttle. The A does not stop at Franklin, so you would then need to take the C one or two stops to the A."
Brooklyn,3ac12j,derpoftheirish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:32:12 2015 UTC,"Ugh, thanks for pointing that out.  Just looked on the map to confirm.  It still may be quicker than transferring at Atlantic to take the R to Jay St. which is technically the opposite direction that I need to go. Either that or I would end up taking the same A train."
Brooklyn,3ac12j,ggsacks,5,Thu Jun 18 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"The best way is to take LIRR from Atlantic to Jamaica and hop the AirTrain there. It's $10 peak / $7.25 off peak (plus $5 for the AirTrain). They run 2-5 trains per hour depending on the time of day and you will be at JFK about 30-35 min from when you leave Atlantic. It's much simpler, less crowded than the A train, and will take less time.  Edit: to answer your question, it is an error. There is no connection from Dekalb to Hoyt. It's not even a free above ground transfer. The walk would be a solid 15-20 min too."
Brooklyn,3ac12j,playaspec,2,Fri Jun 19 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"^ Yeah, totally do this. I live off the A and the LIRR and I always opt for the latter. It's so much quicker and so much less crowded. Totally worth the extra cost for a speedy 2-stop ride to Jamaica in seated comfort.  P.s. the walk from Dekalb to Hoyt is definitely not 20 minutes. More like 5."

Brooklyn,3a19r2,evohans,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"Other people have mentioned AC&C, but I went to one of the Best Friends Animal Society events and adopted my beautiful kitty for $120, spayed and microchipped. They have a bunch of different shelters and rescues there so costs vary, but there were definitely lower options. I'm pretty sure they hold the events monthly."
Brooklyn,3a19r2,helenaglory,2,Wed Jun 17 03:36:11 2015 UTC,"I adopted a kitten off the street and we paid way more for spay/neutering, FIV and FLV testing, and vaccines than that adoption fee. A lot of shelters will run specials on older cats because they have a harder time finding a home, so that might be more affordable for you."
Brooklyn,3a19r2,ModestMalka,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:25:11 2015 UTC,Do you have any recommendations?
Brooklyn,3a19r2,evohans,2,Tue Jun 16 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"Sean Casey Animal Rescue often reduce or remove fees for older cats, and we got our first for a reasonable fee from KittyKind's setup in the Union Square Petco. Animal Care and Control might be affordable because they are a kill shelter.   You may also want to look into pet insurance if you adopt a cat - the vet will always be your biggest expense.  If that is still not possible for you, consider fostering. The shelter will take care of the costs, and you will still be helping solve the kitten deluge."

It does get sketchy past Nostrand Ave but only south of Eastern Parkway and north of Fulton St. If you stay between those two streets, look anywhere up to Utica Ave and it's fine. As for price, it'll get more expensive the closer you are to Franklin Ave but I've seen apartments for your range (maybe +/- 200) on Rogers Ave. 4/5 on Franklin gets you to FiDi in 30 minutes, UES in 40-45."

I was behind a guy refilling a growler one day and as the owner opened the growler to fill it the glass on the top broke.  Instead of saying 'well that one is done' and giving the guy a new one he was like 'well they break sometimes' and charged a new deposit. I know we're only talking about $4 but that really left me with a terrible impression since it was in the owners hand when it broke."

Brooklyn,3a34j6,ShadowBanBrigade,4,Tue Jun 16 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't see how a building of that size with 5 stories and five residences, even with the first floor being retail, makes the units small enough to be affordable. This is likely more condominiums."

Brooklyn,39xs8f,alanrumblings,6,Mon Jun 15 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Search around 15th Street - Prospect Park stop on the F line. Still the F, so gets you to 6th Avenue and work. Still adjacent to Park Slope and South Slope. Still close to Prospect Park. Gowanus is awesome, but not at all leafy or quiet in the way you seem to want. Otherwise, I'd look into Crown Heights (2/3/4/5 stop at Franklin). Use Streeteasy.com, there's some by owner rentals on that that are less likely to be scams, whereas nearly all on Craigslist are.  Edit: I live off Franklin Ave in Crown Heights. We're very happy here and prices are about 75% of PS."
Brooklyn,39xs8f,mtomny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:25:39 2015 UTC,"I second this (the 15 St part)!  My roommate and I both live off the 15 St Prospect Park stop and our apartment is 2BR, 2 floors, exposed brick, washer and dryer in the apt, and access to back area for (I'm not kidding) $2200.  We had always shied away from brokers in the past but this deal came up through a friend of the broker and we had to take it.  Apparently the whole area of South Slope/ Windsor Terrace is full of good apartments for rent but they all go to brokers.  The cheap apts in Bed Stuy are more available on Craigslist because the commission isn't good enough to warrant a broker's time but in this area (where I totally encourage you to look), brokers are the way to go.  They have access to the best apts at the best prices obviously but around here they have ALL the good listings and there are a considerable number of them.  Take a walk around and stop by a local realty office - I'd bet that's your best way to a cheap awesome apartment.  Now, a few things about the neighborhood.  My roommate and I have each lived here for about 7-8 years and are both pretty laid back so we weren't looking for an apartment in the middle of a busy area - more something quiet to go back to each night.  It's certainly that - lots of young parents/ kids.  Despite that, there are actually some great bars and restaurants out here!  Because it's mostly young parents and people our age (also mid-20s), there's always a good crowd at bars but you'll never have to push to order a drink.  If this all sounds like your kind of thing, then no question - look over here.  However, if you're new to New York or are looking to experience the nightlife and be in the middle of things, you might want to look elsewhere.  As for Crown Heights, that's a very different area.  Can definitely be dicey at night and the constant police presence patrolling/ on street corners somehow makes it seem even more seedy.  That being said, I have lots of friends living out there that are happy."

There's a project out by Brooklyn Ave and south of Eastern Parkway on Rogers there's a project. There have been some shootings and stabbings lately, like 3 this year? Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Teenagers. It's sad. There's violence all around the city though, but I don't think you're a part of the affected community (gang kids). PS is a bubble, everybody seems to be white but the help. Crown Heights is a diverse neighborhood. A lot of your neighbors will be families of Caribbean dissent and young professionals or english major types (not as artsy as Bushwick). Take a trip to Franklin Ave on a Saturday and have brunch at Mayfield or Barboncino at tell me then if you think it's a rough neighborhood."

If that doesn't sound like a problem for that neighborhood, then I'll definitely check it out. Thanks!"

I live off the Franklin stop (actually quite far up the avenue, about 8 blocks) and I have never felt unsafe coming home late at night (usually by myself, drunk). Just my two cents. I would surely check out any block before you commit to it, though. I personally live on a very nice tree-lined street full of brownstones, where the neighbors say hi and I see kids walking to school all the time. Said neighbors and kids just aren't white, for the most part.  Poster above you is correct that any violence is committed by gang kids being stupid with each other."

Brooklyn,39qpra,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"Sardinian nationalism:       Sardinian nationalism is a social, cultural and political movement in Sardinia promoting the protection of the island's environment and the re-discovery of Sardinian culture. It also calls for more autonomy, or even independence, from Italy.  The Sardinian movement has its origins on the left of the political spectrum,  as attempts for Sardinian self-determination countered Rome-centric Italian nationalism and fascism. Over the years Sardist parties from different ideological backgrounds have emerged. The first two Sardist parties, the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az) and the Sardinian League (LS), were launched between the two world wars. The PSd'Az, which was pretty strong in the 1920s (e.g. 36% of the popular vote in 1921 regional election ) as well as in the 1940s (e.g. 14.9% in the 1946 general election), establishing itself as the most important nationalist movement in Sardinia, experienced a comeback in the 1980s. In the 1984 regional election the party peaked at over 20% of the vote in the two major cities and gained overall 13.8%: therefore, due to its pivotal role in the newly elected Regional Council, Sardist Mario Melis was President of Sardinia from 1984 to 1989.  Ever since, that result has not been repeated yet by any nationalist party.

Wireless routers can sometimes broadcast two types of networks (both N and wireless AC but as separately named networks). If your laptop has a wireless N card in it and you connect to the wireless AC network, your speeds will suffer.  I have optimum and its been great for two plus years.   Call them.

Brooklyn,39r0xn,pappycack,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"I'm near the wilson stop on the L,  and I just got FIOS on our block. optimum was terrible. It was dropping out every night at the same time, and frequently wouldn't stream a 720 video on YouTube. Optimum maintained that the issue was inside the house, but the optimumwifi hotspot would go down at the same time.   Fios has trouble getting in because they have to get access to every single persons property, and in the 90s, Verizon really fucked property owners over while rolling out their previous infrastructure. In fact, when we got fios installed, we had to go into the next door neighbors back yard, and the lady yelled at us for about 15 minutes before we were allowed to go back there and run the hook up.   If you are using wifi, test file-sharing between computers when your Internet drops out to make sure it's not a problem with the wifi. You could change the channel the wifi is on, and you should definitely have it secured with WPA/wpa2. If the wifi is the problem, the Asus rt-ac68 is a great router."
Brooklyn,39r0xn,ThelemaAndLouise,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"I might try upgrading my router as well. The problem is my apartment is narrow and the router is located in the very front and doesn't reach to the back rooms at all. I'm using an extender in one of the back rooms, but the difference is pretty much unnoticeable.  The wifi is definitely secured. I'll try the file-sharing next time it drops out. I did a broadband test while hardwired into the router at off peak times and I still wasn't even getting 50/25 mbps."
Brooklyn,39r0xn,ThelemaAndLouise,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"if you get a good multi-antenna router, that can really do a lot.  you might try running an ethernet cable from the modem in the front and mounting the router in the middle of the apartment.  i would also try logging into optimumwifi if your internet drops out or is crawling, and see if the behavior is the same, which would imply an area outage (optimumwifi is a mesh network of optimum clients, afaik)  if you have trouble getting online in the back, and you walk to the front and it works, then the problem is wifi.  consumer grade wireless extenders are hit or miss.  it definitely could be a combination of poor internet performance and poor wifi performance, which makes it harder to troubleshoot."
Brooklyn,39r0xn,ShatteringFast,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:01:39 2015 UTC,"Your WiFi problems are from your internal setup, not your backbone provider. I think most neighborhoods should dream of having Optimum, as my home network's performance is amazing.  Wireless extenders are bullshit and do nothing but cause further interference. Run cat5 and add an access point if you want good WiFi at home. My apartment isn't very large but I run a second for the back of my apartment and it makes quite a difference."

Brooklyn,39ij01,brewtality,7,Fri Jun 12 11:12:44 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Background of article  Chabad messianism:       During Menachem M. Schneerson's life a large number of Jews thought that he could be revealed as the Messiah. There were many Chabad Hasidim who proclaimed this very passionately. This concept, that a righteous Jewish leader may be revealed as the Messiah, was believed by many rabbis and scholars regarding their own leaders throughout Jewish history.   This idea finds its earliest roots in an early 4th century discussion in the Talmud: After schools of various prominent rabbis each cite proof-texts that the name of the Messiah is indeed that of their very own teacher, Rabbi Nachman says, ""If he [the Messiah] is among the living, he is someone like me."" The Talmud then cites the sage Rav: ""If the Messiah is among the living, then he is someone like our holy Rabbi [i.e., Rabbi Judah, the editor of the Mishnah]. [And] if he is from among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.""   Maimonides ruled the following as the definitive criteria for identifying the mashiach: If we see a Jewish leader who (a) toils in the study of Torah and is meticulous about the observance of the mitzvot, (b) influences the Jews to follow the ways of the Torah and (c) wages the ""battles of God""—such a person is the ""presumed mashiach"". If the person succeeded in all these endeavors, and then rebuilds the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and facilitates the in-gathering of the Jews to the Land of Israel—then we are certain that he is the ""actual mashiach"".

I would try contacting Sean Casey Animal Rescue and asking them if they can help you find the owner to a lost cat. They might be able to check for a microchip. I often see them posting on their facebook page about how they are holding dogs that people found, waiting for them to be claimed.  If you live in the neighborhood, you can ask your mailmen, Fedex/UPS workers, and garbagemen if they have seen any signs about a lost cat. These people usually cover a decent area, so they would probably be the people to ask, because they might have seen a lost cat sign. Additionally, some people who have lost their pet will give their mailman or garbagemen flyers and ask them to help distribute the flyers because such workers cover such a large area.   How do you know it was a lost cat as opposed to an outdoor cat who was let out for a walk? I'm wondering if it is possible that it wasn't actually lost, and maybe just friendly.

It's basically Brooklyn Heights South, which is the highest rental in Brooklyn.  Edit:  On further (street maps) inspection, I understand.  Red Hook is a shithole and there are no trains even remotely near it that would engender rehabilitation.  Jeez, it's amazing how something like Red Hook could even happen.  It's like its own isolated shithole in the midst of all of these gentrified neighborhoods."
Brooklyn,39ghqp,callmesnake13,6,Thu Jun 11 17:32:31 2015 UTC,There's white Red Hook and then there's the rest of Red Hook. When people say they live there they generally mean a few streets by the water.
Brooklyn,39ghqp,ianmac47,7,Thu Jun 11 21:29:12 2015 UTC,"There had been a street car that connected Red Hook with downtown Brooklyn and I think also that looped over the bridge. That was removed, and the largest public housing project in Brooklyn was built. That's how it happens.

They are basically doing what MTV was doing back in the 90s, luring in suckers who want to work at a ""cool"" brand and pay them under market rate. I suppose they figure bragging rites can somehow pay the bills."

Brooklyn,39aawq,DC25NYC,2,Wed Jun 10 16:08:44 2015 UTC,Yep- they got the old bus depot when they took over Beacons. Knocked down the walls too- so it goes from the old space (was that a indoor skate park ages ago?) all the way to Wythe. Not 100% sure- but they co-own the Kinfolk bar across the street too.

When I was going to school I interned at a high end restaurant in Brooklyn and I worked along side students from Peter Klump, The Culinary Institute of America and The New York Restaurant School. When the chef found out I had line experience he used me to replace the guy working the pasta station for one night a week. The other interns then on hated me because they were still chopping onions, scaling fish and doing all the other prep work that a restaurant needs for a dinner service.

I work in public relations in art, and the intersection of Bushwick Open Studios and all the tech money that is coming into the neighborhood is creating some really weird ideas and proposals that sound exactly like when South By Southwest moved from being primarily about film and music and turned into a huge trade fair.

This one had some interior rust on the bolts that attached the seats to the body. The brake disc also had what looked like noticeable rust to my untrained eye, although I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if it was actually just a lot of grime. I could have sworn I smelled a funky ocean smell when I got in, and it was a leather interior.     I don't know much about cars but everything about this screams that it was probably flooded during Sandy and the original owner traded it in or something.    It drove fine as far as I could tell. Electronics and AC worked.    I would normally walk away but I recently started a job that's a 90-minute commute by subway + bus, and at <$3000 it's tempting, especially the idea of trips to the beach and Costco.

That's the cover for the engine ECU. If that metal plate is rusted/corroded, the car was flooded. If it's clean then it's probably ok. FWIW the seat rail bolts being rusty is not uncommon and doesn't necessarily mean anything wrong. It's just something that happens. Rust on the rotors is also normal for 90% of cars on the road.   I would check to make sure the head gasket isn't leaking as is very common on these engines. Usually it's an external leak that leaks coolant right into the ground. Drive it and make tight u-turns and see you feel anything ""binding"" (the 4wd transfer clutch has a tendency to go bad on Subies of this vintage. It's not a terribly expensive thing to fix and could be lived with or bypassed easily. Also listen for loud growling sounds that change with speed coming from the rear while driving. Rear wheel bearings are a common repair on these. If all of that checks out this is a pretty good deal. They're pretty solid cars and run forever.   Oh and BTW this car has a timing belt. Ask if it's been serviced or not. It's due at 105k miles and must be done. No ifs, ands or butts. If this service is neglected it can result in severe engine damage if the belt does let go. This is common for many cars, not just Subarus.   Source: I was a Subaru tech for a number of years."

Then you look at the mechanicals, the negine, any shaking, smoking, vibration, noise.  No different than buying any car.  Forget about the fact that the guy is reselling these cars.  He probably got it at a dealer auction anyway and you'd need to pay even to bid on those cars.  Besides, he's also taking a risk buying a car he can't inspect, hoping he can resell it, which would be figured in the extra he's looking for.  Even if he fixed the side window mechanism or sealed up the sunroof so that it doesn't leak is a benefit to you."

Brooklyn,383ygy,electric_sandwich,2,Fri Jun 5 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"Very hard to find these days. First of all, any landlord with even a cursory knowledge of the market realizes that people are paying $5k+ for 1,000 sq foot spaces in Williamsburg these days so they adjust the rent accordingly. $850 or so per room is pretty common even in sketchy areas these days, and a 1,000 square foot space can be built out to 4 bedrooms... They realize this.   The other problem is the loft law which passed in 2010. This is sort of an amnesty program for people living in commercial spaces in certain areas that have been zoned as ""mixed use"" which allows for a remediation process to bring spaces up to residential code and then eventually rent stabilization between the DOB, the landlord, and the loft tenants. Pretty amazing if you lived in one of these spaces at the time, but the deadline has long passed and it is doubtful they will extend it again.  A very large number of loft tenants took advantage of this program and as a result are now effectively locked in to some stage of the legalization process and it is VERY unlikely that they will up and leave with so much at stake. The tenants who have stayed have generally speaking invested in lawyers, architects, etc. etc. and are looking at a potentially very under market and rent stabilized loft space once they finish the process which can take years.   You also need to realize that if you do happen to find a space that you can build out, this is going to cost you quite a bit of money, as in at least $500 or so per room. Are you prepared to lose that investment if/when the DOB or FDNY comes knocking?"
Brooklyn,383ygy,warmlikecoffee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) Yeah, we currently have a space on the border of Crown Heights and Bed Stuy. I'd love to stay in this area, but for what we want to do (small gallery) some people think it's a bit of a trek. Navy Yard doesn't sound bad, but I like the culture in BedStuy/Crown Heights, its much livelier."
Brooklyn,383ygy,CLSosa,2,Tue Jun 2 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"No, I get it. But I know they're out there. I know people that have them (granted, they're illegal). I lived in a HUGE (~2000 sq ft) live work space off of Myrtle and Broadway, it was an old car garage that was built out to have hospitable living space in a corner of it, and the rest of it was used for studio space. Our rent was $2000. All of these have come about as word-of-mouth opportunities or the landlord looking the other way. Ironically, or perhaps fittingly, they cut our lease short by two years because they were demolishing the building."

I have had several tiny female friends live in that general area for a while, and there have only been 1 or two stories of shadiness in that time period.  Nothing violent or dangerous.  No break ins, no muggings, just some late night cat calling.  However,  That general area can make non-New Yorkers feel super uneasy.  One of my friends parents visited from small town Ohio and almost refused to let her go home after dinner in the dark."

When I fist moved here there were 3 mobile police towers on three consecutive blocks past Atlantic on Nostrand and a lot of foot patrol, but now I mostly see police closer to the train stop on Fulton.  As long as you are aware of your surroundings, and don't make yourself an easy target (walking home at 3am blasting your earbuds)."
Brooklyn,385thf,LittleMexicant,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:50:45 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's all pretty relative. There are definitely still occasional muggings and break-ins in the area, but generally nothing crazy. Just be smart at night, make sure you have bars on your windows, lock your door when you leave, etc and you will probably have a great time.  It's not the same level of feeling safe you would have in Park Slope or even on Franklin Ave, but it's still far from straight up 'unsafe'. Nostrand is also gentrifying super fast now.  So basically, I would still live further west if its an option, but if you are already at max-budget and are a city-adjusted street-smart person, that spot is totally fine."

We can't adopt until late July since we need to finish saving up for the preliminary costs (adoption fee, pet deposit, vet visits) and I (who work from home) will be out of the country for 2 weeks so my husband (who works all over the city) wouldn't be able to provide properly for a pup, and dumping a brand-new dog into daycare or with  sitter/walk service a month after adoption doesn't sit well with me.

The best way to get on the list of prospective nodes is to fill out the request on https://nycmesh.net.  The router I'm holding is the highly directional ~$90 Ubiquiti NSM5.  I'm currently not peering with anyone via wifi but have a vpn tunnel to two other nodes in Manhattan.  The goal is to someday kill the tunnels and not have to rely on the Internet to connect distant pockets.

Brooklyn,37pwr3,Lucretiel,1 point,Fri May 29 14:33:12 2015 UTC,It's a way to share your connection and have access to mesh only servers as they get set up.  The ultimate goal is not rely on the public web for our node to node communications but tie into the Internet.
Brooklyn,37pwr3,Lucretiel,2,Fri May 29 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"So, you use the internet connections people already have to provide the whole mesh with internet access? Distributing the load over everyone's connections?"

Will this be seamless, or will users have to be aware of it to take advantage of it? How does the mesh interact with the global IP address network?"

If you're that worried about it, check out dyker heights and bensonhurst. They're both right next to bay ridge and the parking is no where near as bad. A lot of them are semi attached houses that rent out the basement or attic. If that's the case, toy may have access to its driveway."

Something like Carroll Gardens near Guawnous.  Fort Greene near the Navy Yard, Red Hook, and I think there is a good one up on the North Side of Williamsburg.   Its hard to find a spot in the day, but fairly easy in the evening when the shops close down.    Be sure to budget for a couple of tickets a month.  A person can only spend 30 mins looking for a spot for so long before that mostly legal spot if probably worth the risk."

Brooklyn,37noum,grink,3,Thu May 28 23:50:07 2015 UTC,I'm getting nearly 80 - 95% packet loss on one hop.  EDIT: Source of image: http://internetpulse.keynote.com/Main.aspx?OriginLevel=0&DestinationLevel=0
Brooklyn,37noum,drkles,2,Thu May 28 23:50:36 2015 UTC,ELI5?
Brooklyn,37noum,quietlight,5,Fri May 29 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"Note- I'm a filmmaker, not an IT guy. But I think I can do the ELI5 on this one...   Packet Loss refers to how much data is being lost between source and destination. Analogy- if we have a pickup truck full of oranges, we can consider each ""data packet"" as one Orange. How many oranges fell off the truck during the drive from NYC to Boston? If you lost 80-90% of your oranges on the trip, that's either a REALLY bad road or a big problem with the van. Someone is getting fired   ""One hop"" refers to how many servers your jumping through to get from source to destination. Each server is a ""hop"". So a lot of hops might justify slightly higher packet loss %, but still nowhere near 80%. If there is only one hop as stated, that's the equivalent of going around the block with the orange truck. Really short trip, no justified data loss. If you lost more than a handful of oranges, then something is wrong with that pickup truck!"
Brooklyn,37noum,TheHolyLampshade,2,Fri May 29 00:27:45 2015 UTC,"I'll just make one minor correction (you are spot on however on the overall description).  Replace server with switch, or ""piece of network equipment"", and you're right on the mark.  Just because I have some free time let's look at the orange truck story.  You want to get oranges from New York to Boston, however this is the post-apocalyptic future and people have mined the route, there are bandit gangs hijacking trucks, and generally the route is very unsafe. You, being the shrewd business man you are, have a large number of pickup trucks, and an inexhaustible pool of drivers. In order to guarantee you get the right number of oranges to Boston someone has to drive the empty truck back to NY to tell of their success (on a network in reality this is just a message confirming receipt, depending on the protocol).  Packet Loss - A packet in this is a pickup truck. It represents one load of oranges. Sometimes that will be 100 oranges, sometimes it will be 120 (Packets in the real world are bundles of data). You send out 100 trucks to Boston. Only 20 make the trip there and back successfully. You've got 80% packet loss.  ""One Hop"" - Every intersection you arrive at (where your truck driver needs to make a decision to go left, straight, or right) is a ""hop"". A driver has to spend a fractional period of time deciding which is the correct direction. If they've made the trip frequently they may have it memorized, or they may have to consult a map. This can take extra time.  So, if the drivers make it successfully to the first intersection they've made it one hop. If the roaming gangs know you are going to send a shipment they will probably be ready on all of the various routes beyond this intersection.  (In the real world hops are basically a successful jump from one piece of transport equipment to the next)"

Brooklyn,37c2i7,black_eyed_susan,1 point,Thu May 28 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"Can I ask you about HBH?  I used to love their sandwiches, but took about a year break because the price was a bit much.  A few weeks back I ordered from them again and was very disappointed to see the menu had been redone.  Regardless I knew HBH=great sandwiches, and we both ordered this mac n cheese pulled pork sandwich.  When it arrived I took my first bite and it was one of the spiciest things I had ever eaten. I immediately started crying, and the burning lasted damn near 30 minutes.  My boyfriend, who looooooves spicy food, also could barely get past a couple bites before he had to admit to defeat.   When I called HBH up to complain (because nothing on the sandwhich description mentioned spicy) they said that they never had had a spicy complaint before.  They refunded our money, and I'll not fault them but now I'm torn. I couldn't find a single review of someone complaining the sandwich was spicy, but I'm not stranger to spicy foods so I found that hard to believe.   Have you had their sandwiches lately?  Are they honestly that spicy now?  At least any of the ones with the BBQ sauce or did we just get one where someone accidentally or on purpose doused it with cayenne pepper?  I really want to try them again, but I don't want to go through another tortured eating like that either."
Brooklyn,37c2i7,brazillion,1 point,Tue May 26 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  I last had a sandwich from them maybe like 3 months ago. I've had the Smith Street Cheesesteak and the Ruben  a few times and tend to get the Cheesesteak.   I've had some interactions with the owner and he seems to be cool. He kept on serving us canned beer, which when we opened, they would explode. This happened to several cans and he then comped the beers and gave us a free appetizer too.  So it seems he has the customer service down. What sandwich did you get?   I agree they are on the pricier side, so I don't have them too often. There is also Boomwich on Atlantic which has smaller sandwiches and better marketing. They're good, but I think I still prefer HBH."
Brooklyn,37c2i7,black_eyed_susan,2,Tue May 26 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  We both got the The Redneck Wedding which is described as Smoked Pulled Pork, bbq sauce, cheddar mac on an onion ciabatta.  Maybe I'll try one w/o bbq sauce and give them another shot.  I was just really bummed.  They also took my favorite sandwich off the menu which was sad.   I definitely agree customer service was fine.  When I called the guy was confused but sympathetic and offered us a refund w/o me even asking.  I'll have to try the cheesesteak instead.   I'll also look into Boomwich.  I'm a sucker for a delicious sandwich."
Brooklyn,37c2i7,justzisguyuknow,1 point,Tue May 26 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"Are you sure they took the sandwich off the menu? I had a discussion with the owner and he says that the menu on Seamless is slightly different than if you call.  Mainly, restaurants don't like Seamless too much bc they take a 15% cut. So, a lot of mom and pop places prefer that regular customers just phone in their orders.   Edit : And to encourage people to call or visit the place directly, the menus are slightly different."
Brooklyn,37c2i7,onlystanthatmatters,1 point,Tue May 26 22:40:26 2015 UTC,Oh.  Just confirmed they have it again (The Smith St.)  They must have been out of it when we went to order it last time....  Good to know.  I'll be ordering that bad boy soon :)
Brooklyn,37c2i7,onlystanthatmatters,2,Tue May 26 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"When I was MUCH younger, I worked as a cook in a little cafe, one of my first jobs.  Mostly salads and sandwiches, the occasional pasta (made from a pre-cooked frozen pack).  One time I was making a pasta and when I went to sprinkle the red pepper flakes in, the top came off the container and a TON of pepper went in the dish.  I was very inexperienced and possibly stoned, and also very slammed with orders, so I basically said 'fuck it', scooped out as much of the pepper as I could with a spoon and just finished it and sent it out to some poor unsupecting casual diner.  Who sent it back of course, so I had to make another one anyway.  The owner of the restaurant then figures, ""Hey, Mr. Customer can't handle spicy food. Ok, but we don't want a perfectly good dish to go to waste,"" and proceeds to chow down on it himself.  Pretty soon he's panting at me, ""juszisguyuknow, what in the everliving fuck did you do to this pasta!?  You almost killed me!"".  Which is just to say, your spicy sandwich may have simply been an anomaly, the result of some stoned/apathetic line cook who accidentally dumped too much hot sauce in the slow cooker but didn't want to throw away a perfectly good (in his mind) hunk of pork.    tl;dr I wouldn't hold it against the restaurant.  These things happen (even though they shouldn't)."

Ample Hills Creamery in Prospect Heights and Gowanus has awesome ice cream.

Around that area (my neck of the woods), I'll also recommend DOUGH donuts of course, Peached Hot House for some incredible fried chicken, and Chuko for Ramen.

Brooklyn,37c2i7,bigboatfear,2,Tue May 26 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"Williamsburg has plenty of great food, which I'm sure you will get plenty of recs for in here. But brownstone Brooklyn has just as many great options, so worth checking out both - plus, that side of Brooklyn is incredibly beautiful and aesthetically quite different than the Williamsburg/Bushwick side. Here are some recs:  -Lucali in Carroll Gardens for pizza   -Locanda Vini and Olli in Clinton Hill has delicious Italian food, also like Brucie in Cobble Hill, Noodle Pudding in Brooklyn Heights, Frankie's in Carroll Gardens  -For New American: Colonie in Brooklyn Heights, James in Prospect Heights, June in Cobble Hill, The Grocery in Carroll Gardens  -American: Buttermilk Channel in Carroll Gardens  -For tapas: La Vara in Cobble Hill  -French-Caribbean: Kaz an Nou in Prospect Heights  -Japanese: Hibino in Cobble Hill, Ganso Ramen in downtown Brooklyn (not quite 'brownstone' Brooklyn but incredibly close to many brownstone neighborhoods worth wandering around)  If you want a good variety of stuff, definitely second the Smorgasburg suggestion - especially Saturday when it's in Brooklyn Bridge Park. You can try a variety of BK and NYC food vendors all in one spot."
Brooklyn,37bflk,popamollydrinksomeoj,4,Tue May 26 11:45:23 2015 UTC,"I lived in sunset park for two years on 45th street. If you are set on sunset park I would take the place on 41st. D train is super fast to the city and you'll be close to Brooklyn Chinatown where you can find excellent cheap grocery stores and great restaurants.  The actual park of Sunset park is also nearby and actually very nice in the summer with great views of the city.  If you are into food check out Ba Xuyen for the best Vietnamese sandwiches, metro cafe for killer Szechuan food, Kings kitchen for duck and roast pork. Closer to fifth avenue are some great Mexican places. Tacos matamoros, tacos al bronco, Ricos. And then you have a great bowling alley Melody Lanes on 37th that has 10 dollar pitchers.   Anyway, what I'm trying to say is sunset park is pretty awesome if you give it chance. Good luck! Hope you have a great summer!"
Brooklyn,37bflk,riceonwhite,1 point,Tue May 26 13:37:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the zone looks good, but now I'm confused because it seems like the price I was willing to pay it's too much for the zone it is?  Thanks for your tips, and for your wishes!"
Brooklyn,37bflk,ThelemaAndLouise,2,Tue May 26 13:48:28 2015 UTC,"lots of factors set the price.  you're short term, utilities are included, and you're two people.  i would tack $100 at least on for a couple if i were renting a room, and i would tack on $100 to cover utilities and other unforeseen expenses.  if the room had its own window unit, i would tack on at least another $50 to cover idiots running the A/C with a window open.  if i was going to have to find another renter in two months, i'd charge more for the room, because what if i'm sick that week and don't find anyone?  people are saying you can do better, but finding a place sight unseen on craigslist is rough.  if you can lock in on a place in a good location, ask yourself if saving $600 over the summer is worth the potential headaches."
Brooklyn,37bflk,riceonwhite,1 point,Tue May 26 14:14:59 2015 UTC,Also if you are near the subway the price tends to go up. I'd say it's worth it because the hills are killer. Most of the places around where I was for new renovations were around 1500 for a two bedroom. If it's a nice place I wouldn't stress too much. It's definitely cheaper than mahanttan and on par with most places in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn,37bflk,jenhbrooklyn,9,Tue May 26 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"Really, $1500 for a room for 2? You're going to wind up paying the leaseholder's rent for the summer."

Brooklyn,37bflk,Bacarey,2,Thu May 28 10:50:31 2015 UTC,Try roomorama.com or even airbnb. Sunset is still industrial and many parts are still shady. Trains totally suck in summer.
Brooklyn,37bflk,beachhouse5,2,Tue May 26 21:11:32 2015 UTC,Airbnb is not cheaper.

Brooklyn,37bflk,black_eyed_susan,1 point,Tue May 26 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"It isn't shady- I live there now. I am a girl and I never feel weird walking around alone at night. It is a really large immigrant community. BK Chinatown is on 8th Ave and on 5th ave there is a really large hispanic community, which means really delicious food. And the trains are all fairly reliable while commuting. I like the D better than the N/R but they are all good. The R can be a little unreliable on weekends because they are always doing construction.  I think that price sounds pretty normal for the neighborhood, maybe a little high but not crazy. People are starting to realize it is nice!"
Brooklyn,37bflk,black_eyed_susan,4,Thu May 28 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"You might want to look into airbnb. Search for rooms or whole apartments that are available for your dates, and often times if it's that long-term (several weeks or more), you might be able to get a big discount on the total price from the person renting the apartment. In much the same way as your timing might work against you looking on craigslist, it might work in your favor on airbnb (the host would not have to work to get the place rented as many individual nights as possible, and he/she'd be getting guaranteed income.). Also, you both would have the advantage of going through a safety-net website in case things didn't work out.   I just did a very cursory search to be sure that I wasn't leading you astray, and there are definitely options that would work for you."
Brooklyn,37bflk,slopduck,1 point,Tue May 26 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's where Rooms A and B are from! I thought it was the best option so they could fit my dates.  But I still don't know which ""neighbourhoods"" are good enough. I know people say that East Flatbush should be avoided, and same goes for ""Bed-Stuy"" (¿?)  At least that's what people told me.  Which areas are nice enough, ""cheap"", and not far to commute to SoHo?  Thanks for your help!"
Brooklyn,37bflk,cyril0,1 point,Tue May 26 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"Cool! During said cursory search, I saw a couple promising ones in the Clinton Hill/Ft Greene area. I am very partial to that part of Brooklyn, and would highly suggest that over Sunset Park in order for you and your girlfriend (does she have a job? Friends?) to find a good group of people to live around for your brief stay. I personally feel like Sunset Park would be more NYC-established people and not necessarily interested in meeting new people in town for a month or 2."
Brooklyn,37bflk,BowDown2Anthony,3,Wed May 27 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"Since no one is really answering your question.  The one on 41st  St is probably better.  The D runs express so during the week you'll get to Manhattan fast (4 stops to Grand St).  Also you're on top of the hill so you won't have to deal with a crazy climb! The hills are steep in that area.  Both Sunset Park and the Cemetery are nice to walk around, and there is a lot of good food in that area, and overall it's a pretty quiet neighborhood.   You're also still one stop from transferring to the R so you can stop off in South Slope/Park Slope and other fun area of Brooklyn fairly easily.   You're asking for a difficult renting situation so I'm not surprised rent is that much a month."
Brooklyn,37bflk,aamatulle,1 point,Tue May 26 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer, 41st Street looks the best so far between those two and if I go ahead with one of those I'll take it. It's nice to know more about the area.  Would you suggest other similar areas that I can look for?"
Brooklyn,37c806,weagleATL,7,Tue May 26 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"Oh hi! I'm an Atlanta native living in Crown Heights with two pits (on the smaller side of the breed group, about 55 pounds each). I just got them about a month ago, but I'm absolutely loving Mount Prospect Park. It's a little enclave on the the north side of the main park that you can enter from Eastern Parkway, right next to the Botanical Gardens. From Crown, it's much easier to access than the main Prospect Park. I also really like the group of dog owners there. Off-leash hours are 9 PM to 9 AM, but it seems like they break that rule pretty regularly without a big fuss. As long as you are watching/controlling your dog and not disturbing anyone outside of the dog community, you shouldn't have an issue.   For a bigger field, you can walk south down Franklin Ave and you'll eventually hit the southeast entrance to the park. From there, you can find a big field where tons of dogs enjoy the off-leash hours (which are more strictly adhered to). It's definitely nice, but it's a little more hit or miss because it is so big.   Where are you looking to take your dog during the day? Unfortunately our neighbors say ours do make some noise during the day, so starting to look into options to keep them occupied. I just don't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money."
Brooklyn,37c806,empirestateonmymind,2,Tue May 26 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely have to find you at the park! I'm on the southside of Crown (Montgomery Street), so I'll probably do the southeast entrance.   Scully loves pits, so she'll definitely come find your pups at some point.  I'm taking her to Kiki's on Washington - it's pretty expensive, around $450 for 20 day package, but I'll be working longer hours, so it's worth it for the peace of mind/not feeling guilty that I can't run home and take her to the park as early as I do here."
Brooklyn,37c806,sunrei,1 point,Tue May 26 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"I love walking my dog on Eastern Parkway! We do a little loop for afternoon and evening walks. Lots of people run, bike and take their kids for strolls. We like to stop in at Lula or Dunkin to get a little snack and there's always a pup outside to make friends.    I dunno about daycares around here, but I've had a positive experience using Rover.com when I go out of town. There are a ton of doggie services in the area though. Personally, I used to work at a dog daycare and I think the smaller, in-home types do a better job of catering to your pet especially for the price you pay. You're essentially paying the daycare's rent for the facility and they upsell you all the time. Just my 2 cents."
Brooklyn,37c806,sunrei,2,Tue May 26 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"I just want her to get socialized and exercise during the day, so I think daycare is probably my best bet. She's a border collie mix, so she needs to run and I don't think a dog walker would be enough of an outlet for her.   I don't have her in daycare in Atlanta but I live walking distance from an off-leash park and I can get home by 6:30 every day, and I know both of those things are luxuries that I won't have once I move. I'm sure I'll run into you and your dog on Eastern Parkway though!"
Brooklyn,37c806,Ant-honey,2,Tue May 26 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"True, I love border collies, but I wouldn't have one here without a good exercise outlet.    Also, be prepared for your new game you'll play when you walk. It's called ""spot the chicken bone before the dog does."" Not a challenge I had before I moved to Brooklyn and yes, I do keep a daily score haha. Oh and people will definitely learn your dog's name before yours if they learn yours at all. Pretty sure my whole building knows me as Cici's human.     Welcome to Brooklyn, I'm sure you and your dog will have a great time!"

Brooklyn,37c806,Jota769,5,Wed May 27 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"Don't let them off-leash. Not only is it just a Dumb Thing to Do, but it also carries legal consequences if there is ever any kind of skirmish between dogs.  Other than that, it's just like anywhere else, really."
Brooklyn,37c806,mrfogg,2,Tue May 26 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"This website may help you regarding Prospect Park  And this for NYC leash laws  I'd recommend keeping your dog on-leash at the very least the first 3 months you're here before you even consider going off-leash ever. Give your dog a chance to learn her new environment, because if you do go offleash (in parks only!) and she runs away, you want her to have a sense of running to your place in Crown Heights, not Atlanta. Stick to the dog runs for off-leash, but be alert to the attitude of the others dogs in the run as well as the owners, you don't want your dog to end up in a skirmish.  Also, note that Police Officers, Sanitation Officers and Park officials are all empowered to issue citations for off-leash, and it really depends on the mood of the officials at the time. I'm in North Brooklyn, and got a citation a year ago. Just be alert, they're more inclined to cite a large dog than a little dog."
Brooklyn,37c806,BowDown2Anthony,1 point,Tue May 26 19:23:13 2015 UTC,"Oh man, thanks for all of this. Especially for the heads up regarding citations, she's a large fluffy black dog, and she gets a lot of attention (positive and negative) so I'm sure she'd be the first to catch their eye."

It SUCKS having to walk over 6 blocks to a dog run.   always always always carry poop bags. people freak the F out if you dont pick up the poop.   Park Slope has really really weird off leash hours.

I agree wholeheartedly that mom and pop shops moving out is sad, and certainly a sign of the changing times. But you can't have your cake and eat it too. The only people I feel truly bad for are those renters who don't have the luxury of cashing out. That goes for shop proprietors as well as rental tenants."
Brooklyn,378kot,EJWatson,2,Mon May 25 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this sentiment, the market rises to levels that support it. Brooklyn isn't exactly like Manhattan there aren't a ton of empty condos sitting around being hoarded by multi millionaires."

Brooklyn,378kot,EJWatson,10,Tue May 26 02:36:18 2015 UTC,"Yes the shop owners are walking away swimming in money, the tragedy, at least to me, is that what they've worked so hard on for for so long isn't what is being valued - it's simply the stupid plot of land for developers to speculate on.   Toiling for years making whatever wares they're known for, adapting to the ever-changing neighborhood - staying whether it's ""good"" or ""bad"", the longevity: all of those things that helped make these neighborhoods desired - none of that is what's valued here.   It's just a 5200 sq foot corner property to a developer, that's the tragedy to me."

Brooklyn,378kot,zacura23,0,Tue May 26 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"So the people you truly feel bad for are the ones that opened up a shop 4 years ago on a lease.

Brooklyn,378kot,EJWatson,1 point,Wed May 27 20:43:54 2015 UTC,Huh? Lots of long-time NYC and Brooklyn establishments have been on leases since the 70s. Not everyone owns and can walk away with a big payout. That's the group I'm referring to.
Brooklyn,378kot,EJWatson,-2,Wed May 27 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"Leasing since the 70s doesn't seem like very good business sense.  Not too different than renting the same a partment for that long.  Your mortgage would have long been paid off instead of you having to face rent increases every couple of years.  So I don't know that I'd have much sympathy for those business owners, which leaves those who opened much more recently.  Edit: thanks for the downvote.

According to you, to go into business you must first buy the property upon which to do business. Then the business startup costs themselves on top of that. Brilliant! Why doesn't everyone do that? And while you're at it, why doesn't everyone in NYC buy their apartment before moving in?? It's a much better business move, according to this genius over here!

For reference, it only takes about ~30min to get from Barclays to Penn Station and vice versa, but give yourself 45-60min for confusion/weekend track maintenance/etc. Make sure your train/bus is running late enough for you to get home afterwards.  2) Drive into Brooklyn. You can either pay to park somewhere or you can find street parking in a nearby neighborhood (Ft Green, Park Slope, Prospect Heights) as long as you don't mind parking a 10-20 minute walk away from the venue. It's pretty easy as long as you don't mind doing some loops looking for a spot and there is essentially no stadium traffic, so your only gamble would be random NYC traffic jams."

Brooklyn,37cnl7,PongSentry,2,Tue May 26 20:23:57 2015 UTC,Parking in those areas might be tough.  There are many subway lines going to Barclays so you can park further out and take the train in.
Brooklyn,37cnl7,cutratestuntman,3,Wed May 27 20:36:38 2015 UTC,"Practically every train stops at or near Atlantic Ave/Barclays.  Since PPVs are on Sunday, traffic into the city is probably pretty ugly since the shore traffic is coming in.  I would check traffic constantly as you drive in.  If it's especially brutal looking you could drive to the Bronx and take a 4/5 train all the way into Brooklyn.  If traffic isn't looking that bad, sneak into Queens on the Throg's Neck bridge and drive closer to the arena.  With patience, you can find street parking on Pacfic/Dean/Bergen Sts, but start a few blocks east of the Barclays.  Same for streets further north in Bed Stuy (Gates/Monroe/Madison).  Be careful when parking though, NYPD are extra dickish to people with out of state plates.  Leave 10' between your car and any hydrant, look for sweeping signs to confirm you are in valid street parking, check for driveways and NO PARKING signage on the buildings next to the curb."
Brooklyn,37cnl7,cutratestuntman,1 point,Tue May 26 18:47:25 2015 UTC,Thanks! Would you say traffic is heavier going to Brooklyn or the Bronx? I aim to arrive around noon so I'll have plenty of breathing room if I end up not finding a place quickly.
Brooklyn,37cnl7,aamatulle,1 point,Tue May 26 20:25:48 2015 UTC,At noon I'd just drive in as close to the venue as you could find parking in.  Getting out of the city without having to wait for night service trains would be my main concern.

I find it to be very intelligently designed, it doesn't suffer the many pitfalls of most tiny houses. Not having unnecessary walls allows more of an open space feeling, the murphy bed let's you get rid of having a loft, which feels cramped. I love the office, i work from home, and it's amazing to have a big office in a tiny house. This design doesen't feel like a ""dollhouse"" like most tiny houses do, it doesn't have, imo, dumb spaces like a porch or the incredibly, again imo, stupid low gable roof that cuts A LOT of space just to look cute. It is triangular roof but wider for rain catchment purposes on the water systems. Anyway, it's an incredible functional, open and comfortable house.

Brooklyn,375gu4,SoulScience,2,Mon May 25 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"3 choices:  1) RV style blackwater tank with flushing. So just like a normal toilet, except you have to dump the blackwater out every so often. Problem with this, besides the wildly irrational notion that you mix feces with perfectly clean water, is the inconvenience of finding dump sites, which is a giant hassle. Also it would require at least another storage tank, and with the clean water, and gray water tanks, there simply isin't enough room.  2) Incinerating toilet: It's a toilet connected to electricity and a propane tank, that burns everything up. Very convenient and odor-free. You just have to dump the ashes out every couple of weeks, which is pretty easy. This however is energy intensive (2 sources of energy needed). 3) My favorite: Composting toilet. It turns your feces into compost. Very odor-free, it connects to the electricity and it's really easy to use. For 2 people using it you take out the compost every 2 weeks. It does take up more room though."

Brooklyn,3735j8,KrisKrox,12,Sun May 24 12:55:36 2015 UTC,Coney Island has lots of people playing
Brooklyn,3735j8,BowDown2Anthony,2,Sun May 24 14:02:18 2015 UTC,Be careful of who you play at the Coney Island Seaside Courts. A lot of the games are played for money.

Brooklyn,3735j8,kingunderpants,7,Sun May 24 13:52:08 2015 UTC,Also try Brooklyn Bridge Park
Brooklyn,3735j8,SuspenderSnap,6,Sun May 24 13:46:31 2015 UTC,"Anything along the southern edge of brooklyn and west of Marine Park (which is better for basketball); Gerritsen is okay, but sheepshead, gravesend, bath beach, Bensonhurst,  etc. are probably your best bet. The other day I passed that park near Ave P and Bay parkway, the courts were packed (in a good way)."
Brooklyn,3735j8,Xavs42,5,Sun May 24 13:43:34 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about Bensonhurst and Sheepshead. I haven't played handball in like 4 years so I'm trying to get back into the groove of things. Thanks though!

Brooklyn,3720zs,buggsuperstar5,9,Sun May 24 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"Living a block from Ocean Parkway I'm all for anything that makes that road a little less terrifying.    Are you sure it's a speed camera though?  Could be a red light cam. Currently speed cameras are restricted to being installed near schools and operating during school hours.   Love them or hate them, speed cameras have been pretty damn effective at drastically reducing speeding and therefore traffic deaths. The mythical argument that the city just wants more money (as if there aren't countless other ways they could more reliably increase revenue streams if needed) breaks down because revenue from an individual camera plummets after the first couple months as people adjust their behavior and stop speeding."
Brooklyn,3720zs,CurbYourNewUrbanism,3,Sun May 24 12:28:43 2015 UTC,I cross it occassionally when I take the F/g home.  It is definitely a scary road.
Brooklyn,3720zs,dano670,3,Sun May 24 23:59:09 2015 UTC,Why is it scary?  I cross it all the time.
Brooklyn,3720zs,dano670,1 point,Wed May 27 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"It's 8 lanes or so.  If you don't start exactly at the moment the light turns green, you get trapped in the middle."
Brooklyn,3720zs,cberlin,2,Wed May 27 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"It's 7 lanes.  And you have more time than what you indicate.  If you need more time, you can start crossing when the left turn arrow is still green.  That way you're already past 2 or 3 lanes by the time you get the walk sign.  And the lights have timers on them, so if you don't think you can make it across in the time left, wait for the next cycle.  You do have to be cognizant of the cars turning in from the crossing roads, though.  That's the more dangerous part, and there are many idiots out there, so never put your own safety in the hands of someone else."
Brooklyn,3720zs,Squishy90,3,Wed May 27 23:22:15 2015 UTC,"Also scary for cyclists who use the bike lane. Lots of cars turn and barrel through without paying attention to right-of-way. As a cyclist I try to exercise caution and check behind me, but sometimes they come up so fast I miss them (and then hyperventilate when they miss me)."
Brooklyn,3720zs,imnotthesmartestman,1 point,Wed May 27 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"They could be red light cameras, but they don't look like any of the other red light cameras I've seen around town.  They also have sensors mounted on a second pole right next to the intersection, which I assumed were to monitor speed.  I'm not trying to argue whether or not the speed cameras should be there, just trying to give people a heads up in case they don't notice the reduced limit.  I remember my mother getting a ticket when I was a kid, driving the same road she had driven several times a day for years, because they suddenly lowered the speed limit and posted a cop right behind the sign."
Brooklyn,3720zs,maramos,3,Sun May 24 12:50:06 2015 UTC,Learned that the hard way. Not fair :( I also saw a new camera on coney island ave and J a couple of weeks ago

Brooklyn,3720zs,samtresler,-1,Wed May 27 20:48:18 2015 UTC,Speed cameras will only serve to increase money flow. Speeders still gonna speed and people will still jaywalk.
Brooklyn,3720zs,Flying-Dodo,3,Sun May 24 06:29:46 2015 UTC,"As someone already commented, it's a short lived revenue stream. Once everyone gets used to the new speed limit there are diminishing returns money-wise. It's a baloney argument."
Brooklyn,3720zs,iamnyc,1 point,Sun May 24 13:58:59 2015 UTC,I would disagree. People will always be in a hurry. Otherwise we would see diminished returns on red light cameras as well. Its never gonna happen though.

Brooklyn,3720zs,NotReallyASnake,2,Tue May 26 14:25:19 2015 UTC,Not so much revenue but more about saving the life of someone trying to cross 6 lanes of traffic. Slow down and drive like your kids live here.
Brooklyn,3720zs,samtresler,3,Sun May 24 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"When you say ""slow down"", that implies I have the green light, in which case, why are you crossing 7 lanes where you have a don't walk sign.  Not too smart."

Brooklyn,36zj5z,mtpelletier31,11,Sat May 23 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"Are you paying, or are you expecting free work? Little vague in that regard."
Brooklyn,36zj5z,SwellandDecay,2,Sat May 23 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"So, it's a unpaid position, there is conflict between the missing actor and OP.  Just going by the facts, sounds to me like OP is your typical exploitative Craigslist producer. I'd be happy to be proven wrong but if this guy set foot in an industry subreddit they'd tear him a new one."
Brooklyn,36zj5z,xXxdethl0rdxXx,2,Sat May 23 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"Would it be any different had OP not used the words actors/actresses? That is to say if they were just said ""Can anyone help me out by acting in this..."" would you consider it exploitative?     To be very clear, I'm not trying to start a pedantic internet argument, I'm just curious what the etiquette would be considered for acting/creative work. I'm imagining it's the difference between saying ""I need a sysadmin to fix our network..."" and ""Can anyone help me figure out why my $THING isn't...""   I would think the expectation would be if the requestor is looking for ""professional"" level work they should be paying, but if they're willing to work with amateurs/people who are just bored, it's buyer beware on both sides."
Brooklyn,36zj5z,MrVonBuren,-1,Sat May 23 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think the distinction would matter. It's like saying ""who wants to take a few photos"" or ""who wants to pick up a shift down at the McDonald's"" for no money. Not only is it exploitative, but it devalues actual professionals who need to get paid."
Brooklyn,36zj5z,xXxdethl0rdxXx,1 point,Sat May 23 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"It's great in theory what you're saying--however, I don't think the people advertising for these things would be satisfied with shit work. They may not be looking for ""professional"" quality, but they will sure as shit be pissed if you give them unusable work. Who wouldn't?  At any rate, you should always be willing to pay for someone's time. Even if they aren't professional (where you are also paying for skill), maybe they aren't even good--but this idea that only some people's time is worth something is really shitty. Give this person $20, or give them a nice meal, a tiny cut of profit--something.  Unpaid work is a real problem in several creative industries here. Many professionals are asked to work for ""exposure""."

They didn't have so many questions on how helpful this was for them, or being paid.. He came out, had a few beers, some pizza... Had some fun doing a comedy. I was literally looking for someone to stand there and say a few lines. It is also a personal project of a few of us and we had a last minute flake and were desperate to fill.

Brooklyn,36vyct,freeradicalx,-2,Fri May 22 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm actually leaving Bed-Stuy for Lefferts Garden tomorrow and thought this exactly.  Edit - OK this sounded douchey. To expand my post a bit, I've been at Myrtle/Willoughby since 2008 when I got priced out of East Williamsburg. Figured for a long time that Bed-Stuy was more or less gentrification-proof due to the 'Do or Die' stigma associated with it but in retrospect I realize how foolish that prediction was. Real estate prospecting, Hasidic community expansion and the hip-hop 'brand' of this hood have drawn steadily more people that look like me, and at this point my corner of Bed-Stuy is starting to look sort of like my corner of Williamsburg did back in 08. But I honestly don't think that this place is ever going to look like Williamsburg. It's too underserved, and the Hasidic pressure for housing expansion will likely snuff out any burgeoning 'hip' scene that starts to develop. But that hasn't stopped my landlord from asking for nearly $3000 for a crap 3BR with paper-thin walls that's falling apart less than a decade after it was constructed. It's way too much for me to justify, so white upper middle class me is now being priced out of Bed-Stuy (""Only in New York""). And it's for the best. I've discovered rent stabilization and Prospect Park. Quality construction, dignity and rolling green fields without pricing anyone out or being priced out. When the real estate bubble of Marcy Ave collapses may my old apartment be torn down to make way for affordable housing (Apparently what it was originally supposed to be had the now-blacklisted developer involved not swindled the city)."

Terrible management, shoddy workmanship from the super, and signs to tell people to stop pissing in the hallway/elevator. It was cheap rent, but when we got bedbugs at the beginning of our year lease, and subsequently texturing bouts of it, our landlord was indifferent. Everyone we asked, in our neighborhood and building, attested to the fact that no one cares about the buildings or residents. Brooklyn doesn't have quite as many regulations as Manhattan has for disclosing issues and agreements for leases, so buyer/renter beware."

Brooklyn,36u7dj,dano670,2,Fri May 22 06:44:39 2015 UTC,"Coming home at 2 your only concern will be how much it costs to get there at night.   I live at the end of that train line now, strategically so I get a seat everyday. Cabs from Manhattan cost me 40-50 bucks. Trains are intermittent at night, it can take at least an hour to get home from places like bushwick.   Nobody really wants trouble, it feels safer than bedstuy/crown heights."
Brooklyn,36u7dj,potdecreme,2,Fri May 22 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"I live about a 5 blocks from there.  I wouldn't really recommend that area unless you are working at kings county hospital.  Stay to the west of B/q train line if you can afford it.  Down by cortelyou road, the good area extends to the east side of the tracks.  Bars really don't even exist in by that apartment.

Brooklyn,36s5ux,lifeontheupswing,2,Thu May 21 18:12:31 2015 UTC,Could you expand on what a life coach does?  What areas of life are you looking to provide guidance to?
Brooklyn,36s5ux,blindfun,1 point,Fri May 22 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"Oooo great question!   Well to start, therapy, is the treatment of a disorder. A therapist’s job is to help uncover the roots of their client’s symptoms and educate them on the course of the disorder and how it can affect their life. Therapy often deals with the resolution of difficult feelings and learning how to cope with them. It’s a great way to get perspective and have a safe place to talk through what’s going on under the surface.   A coach’s role is more focused and direct. The idea is to help you get to the place you want to be by helping you step by step. The coach helps you move forward by setting goals, working with you to find ways to achieve them, supporting you during the process and helping you break through barriers (mental, logistical, and otherwise) that are keeping you from your goal.   A therapist’s role is that of a provider (or a doctor). A coach’s role is that of a partner, the other half of your team. For example, if you are going through major changes and you need help and direction a coach would be more appropriate; if you’re having trouble coping with the changes a therapist would be a better option. Or, if you’re having trouble coping and you’re not sure where to go a combination of the two might work best for you. Which one is better for you just depends on where you are what you need help with.   Therapeutic techniques definitely come in handy, but make no mistake- they are just techniques that are being borrowed but they’re totally different things!  Coaching can be therapeutic (and it is a helping profession) but it ultimately depends on what end you are working to that would determine what approach is best for you. I hope that helps!    If not let me know and I can go into more detail."
Brooklyn,36s5ux,gbiloba,1 point,Fri May 22 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"In terms of what areas of life I work with, I generally work on personal development/betterment, but that's a very broad area. Personally, I find the most enjoyment from helping people find who they are and then working with and supporting them while they get there. Like I said though, there's so much that can encompass because that has a different meaning to everyone. I’m open to working with anyone who has something that they want, that means something to them, and they are dedicated to bettering themselves. Guidance is part of it, but for me its really about being there and giving tangible assistance (like creating game plans and holding you accountable to your goals) that really takes things to the next step; as opposed to just talking and listening."

Brooklyn,36u1dh,alicefordictator,19,Fri May 22 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"My biggest suggestion is not to be married to the neighborhoods you've heard of/are familiar with coming from out of state. $1,700 for a studio or one bedroom well get you great space and great commutes from places like Bed-Stuy (AC), Crown Heights (25), Prospect Park South/Lefferts Gardens (BQ)...and like others mentioned, Ridgewood and Sunset Park/Bay Ridge. Dunno when your move date is, but you may want to plan ahead and start contacting people from Craigslist today for August 1 move in, etc. Don't. Turnover is so fast that everything you like online now will be gone by June 1/15th.  The best inventory will come online in the first 4-5 days of the month prior to your desired move, when tenants tell their current landlords they'll be leaving. So in that example, hit the web July 3rd for an August 1 move in and in that first weekend you'll be able to get the new inventory while it's hot AND available for you. Don't leave the leftovers for the last 4 days when you'll have to take the sloppy seconds.  You may feel like you're getting the best of the system by sending a form email to every ad you see. But brokers/agents will be able to tell that you're blasting the listings and you won't get their time and attention. Instead, find a couple places you like, CALL the numbers listed. Express your needs and interests, and ASK if they have any others that may fit. Chances are, they're only advertising a small number of what's available, with the hopes of getting an exclusive client like you who wants to see the range and work with them directly! CraigsList is a jungle. But it's still the best hope of finding a great range of places, especially if you USE THE MAP function when viewing listings. Otherwise, Naked Apartments and Hot Pads are great."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,BEER_ME_THAT_BAGEL,2,Fri May 22 04:06:25 2015 UTC,I could not agree more with essentially every point you've made.   I'd also suggest using Street Easy along with Craigslist.

I think you should look in the vicinity of your school, as prices there for a one bed are right in your budget. Preferably west or northwest of the school, as those are better neighborhoods that are closer to even better neighborhoods beyond them."

Brooklyn,36u1dh,BEER_ME_THAT_BAGEL,2,Fri May 22 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"If you have someone you trust, they can definitely take some appointments for you. If nothing else, to send you pics and relay a feel for the different neighborhoods (take that with a grain of salt, everyone feels 'home' in a different hood).  Some brokers will let you put a deposit down ""sight unseen"" if they find you the perfect place. Some probably don't. If you have the time or the money before your move, a 3-day weekend in BK would be a great way to book a lot of appointments and give yourself pressure to put down for a place (delay, and the need to keep shopping will lead to losing places you liked).  I work in the field, feel free to PM me with any questions."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,ianmac47,7,Fri May 22 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"You should probably look at Ditmas Park and Lefferts. That's near the Q and B trains stations: Parkside Ave, Beverly Rd.

Brooklyn,36u1dh,ak_toxik,1 point,Fri May 22 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but OP is starting medical school at Suny Downstate, which is walking distance to Ditmas park.   Also you are being optimistic that there are apartment units much closer to the city for $1,700."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,ianmac47,1 point,Fri May 22 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"I actually found some stuff in Cobble Hill offshoots and close to Slope/Ft Hamilton for around that price... that was last year, so not sure if it went up. My general rule of thumb is to get closer to the city if you have money to spare, simply since as you get closer, the nice restaurants/bars/spots become more frequent. Ditmas is nice but we only have a small selection of places to go to, the area is pretty and cheap and those are really the only upsides of the neighborhood."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,Fronesis,2,Fri May 22 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"Other than change what trains you have access to, Ft. Hamilton isn't really closer to anything than Ditmas. I could see Sunset Park being in that price range, although again I don't know if I would consider that closer to anything.   Bushwick past Myrtle-Wyckoff is probably the only thing that closer in terms of time that is cheaper. For OP that probably doesn't work given the way trains run north-south in Brooklyn."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,metaphorm,8,Fri May 22 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Here's something you might not expect, coming from outside the city: you need to be ready to jump on any apartment you find that day.  If you or one of your roommates isn't ready to get a money order to give to the broker/agent that day, you probably won't get the apartment."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,EJWatson,5,Fri May 22 11:16:34 2015 UTC,"well, lets clarify.   its important to be ready to put in an application the same day you see the apartment. that usually means something like a $100 application fee and filling out a little paperwork, maybe sending a paystub and/or bank account statement to them.   you certainly won't have to throw down your first month rent + security deposit same day. in fact, if an agent is asking you to cough up checks like that immediately after showing the apartment that's probably a serious red flag. there are really scammers in NY who will try to steal a naive person's deposit check."

Brooklyn,36u1dh,happydayz94,1 point,Fri May 22 03:34:55 2015 UTC,"Crown Heights would be great just because of the proximity to the school, but I'll take a look at Sunset Park too, 1700 for a 2br is very reasonable."
Brooklyn,36u1dh,CCTTGT,1 point,Fri May 22 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"You have to really hunt for them, but they do exist! We looked at maybe 12-14 total while questing. You WILL end up paying a broker fee no matter what unless you find a magical sell-by-owner, so it may even be worth your time to just hit up some brokers for listings that fit your quest now. Expect to pay %12-%18 of your yearly rent in broker fees, and 1-3 months rent down in deposit.  My friend worked with La Matto and they did a great job finding her a place."

Brooklyn,36u1dh,neurone214,1 point,Mon May 25 02:07:50 2015 UTC,on $1700 you guys will probably have to share a 1br. its pretty hard to find a 2br for that price these days.   try Streeteasy to find some rental listings: http://streeteasy.com/for-rent/brooklyn/price:-1750
Brooklyn,36u8dv,Approximosey,3,Fri May 22 04:02:24 2015 UTC,"This applies to my most recent rental experience:   We paid first month, broker's fee and deposit equal to a month's rent.  When we renewed, the rent went up by $25 per month.  We had to send in $25 to add to the original deposit (to equal a month's rent under the new lease.) Our last month we paid the rent like normal and then it took six months to get our deposit back."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,lady5murf,1 point,Fri May 22 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"This is the standard. Although shit, 6 months!? Did you have to take legal action?"
Brooklyn,36u8dv,aceshighsays,1 point,Fri May 22 05:58:09 2015 UTC,"Kinda hard to justify legal action over $1275, especially after we had moved out of state. We just continued to call Mr. Rieger's office and I sent a letter and finally the fucking check showed up."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,lady5murf,1 point,Fri May 22 18:09:12 2015 UTC,How did the letter look like? What template did you use?
Brooklyn,36u8dv,aceshighsays,1 point,Fri May 22 18:45:14 2015 UTC,"Just looked through my files - can't find a copy.  But, I just wrote it up myself.  It was essentially just a reminder that we had moved and here is our new address and we were expecting a deposit of $x, etc. Didn't really help which is why we did the phone calls after that.  I also called our real estate agent a couple times.   I'm a huge pussy even when working over the phone and by mail."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,lady5murf,0,Fri May 22 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Unless they have particular cause they are legally required to return your deposit within 2 months of the last day of the lease. As I understand it housing court is pretty tenant friendly about this, and will even add to the amount owed if they are caught not complying.   Also if they withhold any for ""damage"", you can request and they must provide detailed invoices to show the work done and actual cost for any repairs they claim to have done."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,derpoftheirish,3,Fri May 22 11:15:19 2015 UTC,"Your landlord is within their rights to ask for last month's rent. If it is in your lease, and you do not give them that amount, they will be within their rights to evict you.   Normally when renewing a lease with last month's rent I would just give the difference and not do any freebie month, but that's just me.   Don't just assume it will be ok to break the terms of your lease. Being a tenant for many years really doesn't matter when the market is so hot. They will replace you very quickly. Also, you are probably bound jointly and severally in the lease. That means if you let your roommate push you into this plan, when they evict you your landlord can go after you individually for the entire value of the lease. They can get a judgement against you and any job where you pay taxes from then on you can have your wages garnished up to I believe 30% to pay this debt."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,derpoftheirish,3,Fri May 22 11:09:52 2015 UTC,"That sounds like greed. I've renewed my lease twice in my current place, and all it required was a $50 money order each time. My rent went up $50 each year, so the money order was needed for my security deposit. I've honestly never heard of requiring first and last month again after living in the place."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,MorriesWigShop,2,Fri May 22 11:19:27 2015 UTC,"I've never even been asked for last month. I would just pay and assume the last month carried over to the next lease. if the landlord wanted to credit me back the last month and have me pay another last month subsequently, I would tell him that was crazy."
Brooklyn,36u8dv,yallcat,1 point,Fri May 22 12:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah we don't get credited, typically we've just not paid for June, then on July 1st paid for two months of rent. So whether it counts toward the recent June or the last June doesn't really matter, the balance sheets equal out eventually. I guess I'm more looking for anyone who in the first lease paid first/last month rent, then in the next lease just paid first month, with there being a ""free"" month in between leases, does that make sense?"
Brooklyn,36u8dv,MorriesWigShop,1 point,Fri May 22 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"It does make sense when I try to figure it out, but it feels way more complex than it needs to be. Rather than a free month, the new rent should simply activate with the next month. For example, my lease renews Feb. 1 and that's when I'm expected to pay the new rate."

The first murder was a couple blocks from the Bushwick houses.  I know a lot changes in five years, but based on 2010 data, close to zero percent of Bushwick is anything but latino with a small black population.    A large part of Williamsburg is almost 100% hispanic and another is almost 100% hassidic.

Good luck in your search!"

Brooklyn,36jpuk,UrbanAssault,1 point,Wed May 20 15:57:36 2015 UTC,Go to sears buy one depending on the size of the room and how much your willing to spend. Then depending on how old the wiring in the building and the BTU of the unit Pray it doesn't trip the breakers. Also might want to buy the mounting brackets or use a couple cans of Goya beans and some bricks will suffice.
Brooklyn,36jpuk,obvious-statement,1 point,Wed May 20 16:32:24 2015 UTC,Get the quirky AC unit. It's so convenient since it hooks up to your Wi-Fi and you can set it on a schedule. You can turn it on when you're on your way home from your phone so your apartment is cool before you get there. It's on amazon and with prime it's free delivery to your door.

Brooklyn,36itpd,biggreen10,0,Tue May 19 19:02:30 2015 UTC,15% is an unusually high fee. Probably a scam.

I'm actually seeing someone who lives with a couple. I hang out and sleep over at his house a lot. It's actually pretty cool because they just never leave their room! I dated him for a month before I even met them because they just do their own couple things. Of course not all couples are this reclusive but this is just my experience.   Also - I used to live with a young single girl. She brought home dates ALL the time and it made me very uncomfortable knowing that random guys were in my house where I keep my equipment and diamonds. So rooming with a single person isn't always great either! ;)"

Brooklyn,36e7xp,Gingerbreadmancan,8,Mon May 18 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"I would not. I just really don't see any benefits and whole lot of downsides. You'll always be outnumbered on all household issues. They'll probably want to split the rent by room so it would be in their favor, so you would have to deal with two roommates for the price of one. One more person hogging the bathroom, the kitchen, etc. They'll cozy up in the living room and you'll feel like you're intruding on a date in your own home."

Although the couple would be subletting from u/IsKrispyKremeaCarb which is a slight advantage, but you don't have anyone on your side should any issue arise. If there were more rooms/roommates in the apartment I think it'd be a different answer.

They balanced each other out and each had strengths that benefitted the apartment as a whole.  I think it would only be fair to judge couples as roommates on the same scale as any single person. A shitty roommate is going to be a shitty roommate regardless of relationship status.  Couples tend to make their apartment more of a home base/leisure space, so it's logical for them to be more invested in upkeep and keeping the peace.

The infighting of which one of them had to do it makes you have to clean less.  2)  If they are cool, you can usually muster up a board game a lot easier.  Settlers of Catan is shit with 2 people!  3)  Easier to depend on them for things, if one of them has to flake, perhaps the other one can be there for you.  When I lived with a couple they paid a lot more for their room.  I'd think something like, if you have a two bedroom, give them the master, but also make them pay 1.5x rent.  Its not quite fair to rent split 3 ways, but not fair for them to go 50-50 with you either.  If you have all the financial shit worked out beforehand, then its all good!"

But given that dogs lost in NYC in the past have been found rather far from where they were lost, and given that many people may not necessarily subscribe to the subreddit of their borough but may subscribe to other nyc based subreddits, I want to recommend that you post this to:  /r/greenpoint  /r/bronx  /r/nyc  /r/williamsburg  /r/manhattan  /r/queens  /r/astoria  /r/statenisland  /r/AskNYC - I am NOT sure if this is the right subreddit but you can maybe skim the sidebar to see if this sort of post would be allowed  /r/nycpics   possibly other area/location subs like /r/newyork /r/newjersey /r/newark /r/hoboken /r/jerseycity /r/longisland /r/Connecticut - and maybe more, based on what you decide. (You can find subreddits of nearby locations listed in the sidebar of /r/nyc)   Best of luck. I really hope that dog turns up because it's a pretty messed up thing to have your dog stolen."
Brooklyn,36ar5y,grink,2,Sun May 17 22:21:09 2015 UTC,This is why you don't tie your dog up outside.  Glad the dog was returned.
Brooklyn,36ar5y,SirHumphryDavy,3,Mon May 18 13:25:39 2015 UTC,Outside of a grocery store is a bit much. I can understand if you go into a bodega for a few minutes but anything more is pretty irresponsible.

Brooklyn,36bi90,arcdetriomphe,2,Mon May 18 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"You can find modestly priced rooms on the Q/B, F, D, N. Look closer to the first stops in places like Sheepshead Bay, Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach. These areas are safe but tend to be a longer commute and not as nice (looking). There are also some room shares near Flatbush on the 2/5 trains for around the upper range of that price. I highly recommend the B or D train personally.  These are more lower middle class communities so don't expect trendy restaurants, etc (though there ARE a few really good ones which have been around forever). Some areas of Brooklyn which were historic ""white flight"" enclaves lack train coverage, generally in South-Eastern Brooklyn in places like Mill Basin. The areas I listed are still mostly Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese and Italian, mostly first-generation Americans.  You still might want to raise your budget to $1000/mo. for more flexibility. You also might want to consider Queens, since you're working in Chelsea you'd want to be on the ACE line which would mean less of a crosstown walk. Especially the E, the E is so great."

All you need to know is:   Don't get a car, it's a serious pain in the ass and not needed. Avoid places where you need to take a bus to the train with the exception of the Q35 through Flatbush which actually is faster than walking. The B1, B2, B3 are not much faster than walking and pretty infrequent. Avoid East Williamsburgh and East New York. This isn't the 80's, people come here thinking for example that certain neighborhoods are unsafe from watching movies."

Brooklyn,3641v6,jackwoww,8,Sat May 16 11:33:02 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Let me explain how NYC public schools work. The address of Prospect Heights Campus is 883 Classon Ave, 11225. Campus systems, which is what most NYC public schools have, contain more than one school. All sports are for the building - so our sports are all Prospect Heights Campus Cardinals, even though none of our schools are Prospects Heights High School (though in the past, this one large school did exist). All four of these athletes are from the school I teach at, which is Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment, on the 5th floor. If you click on the official DOE link to my school here, the picture actually shows that our building is called Prospect Heights High School. The other schools in the building can be found here here and here to see that we all have the same address and share the Prospect Heights campus and thus the same sports team."

Brooklyn,365vuq,applesandcherry,6,Sat May 16 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"That's not happening with utilities included. You don't find many places here with utilities included (beyond heat and hot water).  Adjusting your ask to a 2br for $1700 with heat and hot water, I'd recommend looking in Queens; you'll more easily find better neighborhoods where you might find a 2br for that price.  You can look in Brooklyn but you're going to have a very hard time finding a 2br in an area you like for that rate. Look at sunset park or Kensington or Bay Ridge or Bensonhurst; maybe you'll find something around that rate. But it's going to be tough.   Edit- good luck"

Brooklyn,365vuq,blatantdream,3,Sat May 16 14:08:27 2015 UTC,Queens is often quicker to get to Manhattan than Brooklyn depending which neighborhood. 30 minutes door to door to Midtown from Astoria. I'm in a 2 bedroom for $1500.

Brooklyn,365vuq,pixelsguy,3,Sat May 16 15:41:52 2015 UTC,Get yourself a subway map and see how far things are. You can also use the public transportation option on Google maps to see what subway trains and how long from one spot to another.
Brooklyn,365vuq,IveRedditAllNight,1 point,Sat May 16 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you're starting and ending. Use google maps subway directions to get a sense of what travel times between particular places are.   Express trains are your friend; you can save a lot by living further into a borough without sacrificing commute speed by being relatively close to an express line. Bonus points if you're on a line that has several major hubs with one transfer access to at least three different colored lines.  Try to keep your commute around 45 minutes, tops. This is a grueling city. Long commutes on a subway are not relaxing like a long drive. More like a long bus ride. Maybe."

Or Flatbush off of the 2/5 from winthrop to Brooklyn college. Idk about all utilities included, but if you find a 2br for ~1500-1600, that should keep your utilities at or near 1700/mo.

Brooklyn,365vuq,mikerakabit,1 point,Sun May 17 01:49:27 2015 UTC,"You MAY find a cheaper place in Bushwick - I've found some affordable places over the years. But you may also need to consider some alternative living situations, like lofts and/or living with some other roommates.   Try the Dekalb stop on the L, which is close to Ridgewood, Queens. There are some loft buildings there with a ton of young people, common areas, a roofdeck, etc. It's kinda like post-college dorm living and you'll get to meet a lot of people. I'd suggest being open to the possibility of a third (or even fourth) roommate there, but tbh the lofts I've seen are pretty cool and wouldn't feel too crowded."

I believe Hope is currently in the process of becoming a VCA (corporate) animal hospital and merging with Cobble Hill. You should also be aware of the emergency services for animals in Brooklyn too- we have VERG and Blue Pearl Brooklyn. There is also an animal ambulance, Ambuvet, which is great if they are available but often they are backed up.   Re: transport- how big is your dog?

Either one might be able to find you something in that price range in Williamsburg or Greenpoint. Proper got me a one bedroom apartment with a kitchen, living room, and family room for $1560 w heat and hot water included. You have to visit them though, they don't have a website."
Brooklyn,363ml4,blipblapblorp,3,Sat May 16 00:01:58 2015 UTC,"Probably going to need a ton more detail here, but a $1500 budget gives you more options than most. Make a list of things you need. Then make a list of things you want. Then make a list of things that are a bonus. Think about travel time to work (where is work?). Proximity to subway/transit. Luxury building that's new and has amenities or pre war low rise with charm? Realize you don't know anything about neighborhoods, but Brooklyn is fucking huge and tremendously diverse. I mean...be honest. Do you want to live in a cultural diverse area where you're going to learn what it's like to live around people of different backgrounds or do you want to live near rich white people in a gentrified area? It's ok...be honest. I live in Ft Greene/Clinton Hill - it's still has a way to go before being full gentrified but there's a large constituency of rich yuppies with dogs and babies around here...just like me. Are you into the arts and love museums and want to be near them or do you prefer music and sports? Start really getting in depth and maybe we can help you out. Fortunately, $1500 should take you a long way, especially if you don't mind a share. Hell, if I didn't have a baby, I'd rent you a room in my place. It's a 2/2 fully gut renovated duplex with exposed brick walls across the street from Pratt Institute near the subway and pretty good night life along Dekalb Ave."
Brooklyn,363ml4,duyogurt,4,Sat May 16 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"$1500 is pretty high if you're cool with living with roommates. You can split a good sized place in Williamsburg for probably less than that. If you're looking to live alone, probably Bay Ridge maybe?"
Brooklyn,363ml4,sinkwiththeship,2,Fri May 15 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"How much of a commute can you handle? If you're otherwise not picky and just want somewhere safe, I would suggest somewhere like Bay Ridge. Very quiet, mostly middle class families, and cheap by NYC standards (you could definitely afford something by yourself for $1.5k there). The only catch is it would be a somewhat long subway ride into the city.  Others here have suggested Williamsburg, Clinton Hill, etc., but if you go out to somewhere like Bay Ridge, Kensington, Bensonhurst, etc., you will get much more bang for your buck, other than your longish commute and possible lack of fancy restaurants and coffee shops."
Brooklyn,363ml4,Yofi,2,Sat May 16 13:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was looking at Bay Ridge, but I'm a little worried about the commute--I'll be working in Brooklyn Heights. Google tells me it's like a 40 minute subway ride"
Brooklyn,363ml4,buzzedonbooks,2,Sat May 16 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"The commute from Bay Ridge to Brooklyn Heights is not 40 minutes, unless you work and live really far off the subway. 86th Street to Court Street on the R is a solid 30 minute commute - and one without any transfers, which is nice."

Brooklyn,363ml4,EJWatson,1 point,Fri May 15 21:40:15 2015 UTC,$1500/month is the cost of a nice studio here (not too nice but nice). Do you want roommates? Do you want to live dolo? What train lines do you need to be near to get to work? Things you like? Do you have family?  I echo the idea of airbnb'ing a room for 1 month and use that time to find a nice/safe apartment

It sounded like jets were flying over our heads, or like a continuously moving train.. it was so loud but I couldn't pinpoint the location. It sounded like it was coming from our Con-Edison power plant in Astoria, but that's just a guess. I wonder if it was the same sound that you heard too."
Brooklyn,35x6ja,alcogiggles,1 point,Thu May 14 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a con-ed station in this part of Brooklyn.  Side note but related, when I used to live in Sheepshead Bay, I used to hear Air Sirens in the distance once in a while from very far away.    Back then when I looked up online some time later for what it might be, some message boards suggested it was a way for a neighborhood to signal the start of the Sabbath.  Now I don't recall what days it started, but it was certainly in the late afternoon/early evening time.  That can't be it though right?  That would be wrong in just a few ways."

I thought living across the street from a playground, I'd be in a relatively safe neighborhood. Aye."
Brooklyn,35udoi,rassierae,2,Thu May 14 03:58:32 2015 UTC,I was surpised when the tower went up because I ride up Parade pl on the wrong side of the street to get to the park.  So I had to change my route.   I would have think the tower would have definitely stayed in then for a good portion of summer.    The area is changing quick.

Brooklyn,35tutj,twoandfortysix,2,Wed May 13 20:38:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that Wegmans is awesome and will help the neighborhood, especially the nearby housing projects. But sooner or later, more of the middle class will settle there. It's close to Manhattan, the waterfront, and downtown Brooklyn. Now that there will be a Wegmans, more of the middle and upper class will see this area as a suitable location to move to. I went to high school near there and I saw this happening to Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights. Wegmans won't directly cause gentrification, but it will speed it along. I'm not saying gentrification is a good or bad thing, that's another discussion."

Brooklyn,35sfur,wrong_bananas,8,Wed May 13 14:06:03 2015 UTC,"I work in DUMBO and pass that spot every night on my walk home. There's a big housing project right next to that spot and the Wegman's will bring SO. MUCH. FRESH. FOOD. to those people who only had a couple of small grocery stores and bodegas near their apartments.   The spot is also very easy to drive to being nestled up to a fairly blank stretch of Flushing Ave. and several buses service the spot, there's a B57 and B69 stop (and maybe some more that I'm forgetting) literally across the street."

When I left my hometown, I moved to a couple of other cities, some of them were cool and had loads of character (Austin, TX), some of them were not.  But one thing that all of those cities had in common was a suburban sprawl. Every city had their own ""downtown"" that was full of pretty high-rises and what have you.  But the suburban areas made up the majority of the city.  That and their reliance on cars really made these places kind of empty.  A good example of this is Houston, TX.  Houston is supposed to be one of the most populated cities in the USA.  Yet Houston is so spread out that you rarely see any people.  That is the one fate I would not want for New York.  Luckily it's a little impossible what with the small space and the giant population, but the threat does kind of loom there.  The arrival of big box stores isn't the problem, I don't mind that my city is a little cleaner.  I do mind if my city becomes another empty wasteland ONLY made up of big box stores and suburbs."

But that's okay, the shitty parts were really shitty. For example, I haven't been mugged since Giuliani's first term. No one graffiti's my grandmother's house. No one has those stupid 'no radio' signs on their cars anymore.

Shopping is diverse and you'll find the cheap (Aldi, fill your cart for less than $80), to the mainstream (Stop n Shop or Walbaums). There's a Duane Reade or Rite Aid every fifteen feet or so. The Chinese supermarkets on Avenue U are interesting to say the least. Brennan and Carr and Roll n Roaster are both in the neighborhood, so your hot beef injection is never far away. Soooo much sushi in the area too. Ginza on Ocean Avenue has some of the best bang for your buck.   Crime really hasn't been a huge issue. Be street smart. Stay out of the projects (best stay west of Nostrand Ave) and be aware of your surroundings. Most of the area is heavily Russian, Asian and Orthodox Jew.

I grew up hiking those trails. Really, really beautiful. Part of the AT runs through it. You can take NJ transit from Penn - Seacaucus - Tuxedo, NY. Hop off the train and you're about 10 minute walk from the state park.  Here's a link I just found that gives you a bit more detail: http://www.myharriman.com/from-new-york-to-harriman-getting-to-the-trails/ You can get a map in the little downtown  area outside of the trains station and a bite to eat at the diner at the side of the road.

I was going it solo and wanted to push myself a little, to get a good workout. Really good variety, a few killer views, and the trail was generally well kept. There are a ton of spots where you can branch off onto other trails, the whole park is MASSIVE. I bought the Nat Geo map at REI soho and the 8 mile loop occupied roughly 1% of the map. Seriously. It was very handy though, would recommend if you plan on going there or just to peruse potential routes.   Downsides: forgot big spray (ughhhh) and also, I finished about an hour before I planned on and there was no return train. There was however a great little bar and grill with an extremely friendly waitress / barmaid and cheap eats / beers. Got a burger with the works and 2 IPAs for $20 I think, it was incredible."

Brooklyn,356ie3,ak_toxik,1 point,Thu May 7 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"depends... over the long haul, having more credit lines (and a larger total credit line) is good, because they analyze how much of your credit that you're actively using (ie you have two credit cards with $5k lines each, and you owe $1k on one of them, you have a 10% utilization)   But - your score also includes components about the age of your accounts. Having a credit card for a really long time is a bonus. So is having a large average age of your accounts. If you have one card that's 10 years old, cool. But then you open up 4 more cards last month, now your average age is 2 years. Dings your score a little bit."

This is a part of Brooklyn that still somewhat makes sense to own a car. Grocery stores around here are less common and you have to travel farther. Not to mention, if you commute within Brooklyn it can be near impossible to get around via subway since everything heads towards Manhattan rather than around Brooklyn. I have a friend in Bushwick that is 20 minutes away by driving but nearly an hour and a half by MTA.  I think one of the reasons it hasn't become an issue is that it's lost its saliency because wealthier residents who are more politically active live in neighborhoods that have reduced ASP such as Park Slope. The only people dealing with high levels of ASP are residents who aren't as politically connected in less wealthier neighborhoods.   If I wasn't in the middle of exams, I'd parse through census data and create a graph mapping ASP rules to income and see how it correlates. There's also data containing every single parking ticket that I want to sort through to see if it correlates with the income of a neighborhood.

It puts a lot a pressure on you when you live 10+ blocks from a subway station and there aren't anything nearby but delis nearby.

It is an administrative process from the mayor's office and the Sanitation District's that receive poor cleaning score cards usually get stiff consequences and reprimands coming from the top.  It is very little to do with Sanitation Worker's and their hours.  The workers do not rate the neighborhoods it is done by the mayor's office and the union has even less to do with it.    My personal opinion is neighborhoods that are currently being developed receive more cleaning operations then those neighborhoods that are already established.  There has been huge development in the East New York area within the last few years.  Big retail outlets, condos, new development, etc.  This are also recently received a very poor cleaning score card and cleaning operations are being micromanaged.  I think this is because the areas are being developed and there is more incentive for people to move to cleaner neighborhoods.  No one will buy housing in a dirty neighborhood.

Even if that's not the case, it's hard to argue that forcing people to spend a work-day's worth of time each week is socially optimal.  Hourly workers would gain flexibility and the ability to work/rest/learn for an additional 6-8 hours a week.  Even for low-income car owners, paying a monthly fee to save the time spent on parking may translate into a net benefit.  Finally, the current system already disproportionately affects low-income car owners as there already exists a fixed-cost option for  leaving your car on the street.  This is the cost of the parking ticket.  $45 * 2 times a week.  Works out to about $150/mo on average (taking into account holidays, etc) and does not depend on your income."

Brooklyn,34udqh,ldpreload,1 point,Tue May 5 01:52:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, and my solution was to tax Michelin stars and generate revenue that is definitely used towards improving mass transit, which is better than a solution that ""could be"" used, right? :)  Or less cheekily, there's no particularly strong link between a permit for parking and using the money for mass transit. On the one hand, there's no inherent link between the concepts: you could equally propose a permit for parking that raises money for something else entirely like schools, or a permit for something else entirely (like Michelin stars) that raises money for mass transit. So it's fallacious to claim that you need this negative to accomplish a fundamentally unrelated positive: it is a strictly worse plan than one that avoids the negative and accomplishes the same positive.  On the other hand, and very importantly, there's no political guarantee that this is going to work. The proposal could easily get mangled into permits for street parking that fund better roads, or more parking spaces, or more enforcement of street parking rules, or something. (All of which are more closely connected with parking permits than transit is.) And even if it goes towards transit, there are all sorts of things that could go wrong in the political process to cause that money not to get used the way you'd expect. (For instance, the MTA is now less in debt by X million dollars, which means that some other source of funding no longer needs to give them X million dollars -- so the MTA doesn't actually end up with more money than they would if the permit program hadn't been created, it's just some other government coffer remains filled.) So essentially the only thing that's guaranteed by this plan is the negative associated with permitting, and any improvements (if any, there may well be none) due to the changed market pressures on parking spaces. The positive effects of the revenue are merely a hope.  My tongue-in-cheek plan for taxing Michelin stars has the important property that, even if it goes horribly wrong and doesn't fund anything at all, nobody's lives get worse (if you can afford to eat there, you can probably afford the tax on your meal, and if you can't, whatever, it was a complete luxury anyway). That's not something you can say about a parking permit system."
Brooklyn,34udqh,crbiker,1 point,Tue May 5 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"Those are great points and I think the Michelin star example is a good one.    TBH, I doubt that a paid permit system is actually the optimal way to allocate parking.  My main motivation in commenting was to counter the suggestion that permits are bad idea because they ""disproportionately affect low-income car owners"".  I still don't think that necessarily has to be the case.  Politically, I think there already exists a strong tradition of levying taxes or fees on activities associated with car ownership in order to fund mass transit.  For example, the tolls that the MTA collects on bridges and tunnels are far greater than their operating expenses and are used to subsidize mass transit.  And the alternate side parking regulation as it currently exists already serves primarily to exert pressure against car ownership and as a way to collect revenues for the city.  (Parking tickets in total bring in about $0.5 billion/yr)  I think that if you accept the premise that ASP currently functions mostly as a way to reduce demand for on-street parking spaces, collect revenues for the city and literally waste residents' time (rather than as a way to keep streets clean), then I think you have to also accept that a system that accomplishes the first two goals without exerting the associated time-wasting negative externality would be preferable."

Brooklyn,34udqh,algorythmic,11,Tue May 5 03:06:09 2015 UTC,Who is talking about fundamental human rights? We're talking about parking laws that disproportionately prohibit the poor.
Brooklyn,34udqh,ianmac47,9,Tue May 5 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"Until we figure out a way for people to get themselves food, water, housing, and medical care without having a job, being able to get to your job, in a timely fashion such that you don't lose that job, is an essential, fundamental human right. And depending on where you live and where you work, a car might be the only reasonable way to do that.  Now you might argue that people can get to their jobs in unreasonable ways, which is true, but we were not talking about entitlements or fundamental rights in the first place, we were talking about disproportionate effect. If low-income car owners who bought a car because they needed it to get to work reasonably now have an unreasonable commute, where as high-income earners continue to live two subway stops away from their workplace in a rich neighborhood, that's a disproportionate effect."
Brooklyn,34udqh,ldpreload,1 point,Tue May 5 01:35:10 2015 UTC,"I think you have to consider the suggestion as an alternative to the current situation.  Low-income car owners already do pay for parking, in the form of time spent waiting for ASP.  Rich car owners can afford to pay for a garage or to pay for parking tickets.  There are probably ways to price permits in a way that reflects income, so it's not clear that this should significantly affect car ownership patterns if you don't want to do that.  The best part is that currently the time wasted on ASP regulations does very little for either the city or for the car owners.  Perhaps permits can help allocate this scarce resource more effectively."
Brooklyn,34udqh,Mantisbog,0,Tue May 5 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"Food stamps, public housing and medicaid actually provide these essential things, albeit poorly.   You're basically making a really good argument as to why affordable housing should be mandated as inclusionary housing in every neighborhood rather than pushing the poor out of the urban core.   Beyond that though, monetizing street parking would make available a lot of money to improve public transit while reducing the need to invest in roads and highways, which serve primarily private vehicles.   So yes in the short term a few people who made poor investments in a depreciating asset will be financially harmed, but in the long run the public good is better served by charging for private vehicles that exploit a public resource--free parking-- and use that money to benefit of the public in the form of better public transit."
Brooklyn,34udqh,ianmac47,1 point,Tue May 5 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would also be fine with a basic-income-ish approach, which is why I added the caveat. If you do figure out how to get people (sufficient) food, water, housing, medical care, and pursuit of happiness apart from money, or money apart from wage, we no longer have this weird problem where actions that pose even a small risk to the employment of people without savings are hugely dangerous. (Which of course doesn't mean we ought to risk people's employment with impunity, it just puts more proposals on the table.)  But I think those steps need to happen in order. The safety net needs to be in place before we demand that people jump, especially for something as risky as getting government more money that it's supposed to use on public transit. San Francisco, for instance, charges $110/year for a permit that more-or-less makes street parking usable for long-term parkers, but it does not seem to have a particularly good public transit funding situation, by any stretch of the imagination. Nor is street parking particularly plentiful, except maybe in rich neighborhoods: it turns out that demand remains super high unless those investments actually happen, and so the need to invest in vehicle infrastructure doesn't much disappear.  If we can find other ways to improve public transit and affordable housing (which I'm pretty sure we can), we should try those approaches first. I don't think it's particularly justifiable to try an approach that jeopardizes the very people who would benefit from more public transit and affordable housing, unless we are firmly convinced there is no other way."
Brooklyn,34udqh,grandzu,-3,Tue May 5 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"God forbid the ""low-income"" car owners park a block or two away where there aren't such stringent restrictions."
Brooklyn,34udqh,icanhe,5,Tue May 5 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"That's a very valid point. Freakanomics did a great series on this that showed that charging for parking could eliminate a lot of headaches. The problem I see is that the transaction costs are too high and that limits the ability to adequately enforce paid parking outside of meters. Residents wouldn't put up with constantly feeding meters. Parking permits are great, they work in some neighborhoods but they exclude family and friends who are visiting. If you have your parents in town, they can't park their car near your apartment. It's a complicated mess and there aren't many easy solutions.  In all honesty though, ASP acts as a cost of parking. Even if they charged, there would still be a need for ASP to clean the streets. The cost of sitting in and idling a car for an hour and a half, lost productivity etc."

Brooklyn,34udqh,crbiker,-1,Tue May 5 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"If its a job requirement, then the job will either pay for the car directly or by providing a salary that will offset the cost of parking. Just because YOU need the car doesn't mean someone else can't do the job without the car."

Brooklyn,34udqh,alent1234,1 point,Mon May 4 21:20:00 2015 UTC,No. Gas taxes do not cover maintenance because the taxes are too low to reflect the cost of maintenance. Interstates are primarily funded through federal sources with smaller amounts from the states.
Brooklyn,34udqh,alent1234,1 point,Tue May 5 03:11:36 2015 UTC,"Or just the logistical nightmare of just the switch would be enough to dissuade the city council. I like what Brooklyn Heights does you're allowed to park on the other side of the street only during ASP, and they have it all day long.  Here in Bay Ridge everyone, and I mean everyone, double parks. The cops only care about the people who don't move their cars. And they're on it, once 9:05 or 11:35 rolls around they circle like vultures. I actually like how Bay Ridge does it. Our neighborhood is one of the largest in all of NYC, but they have it split up once a week (or 6 days for meters) but every 10 or so blocks they switch up from Mon or Tues to Thurs or Friday, it's bound both by streets and avenues and consistent from 68th st to the Belt."
Brooklyn,34udqh,alent1234,1 point,Tue May 5 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"Almost every other city has paid on-street parking permits and the only one that I know of that comes close to guaranteeing a spot is Toronto, where the permit is good only for a certain block, and they only sell permits that equal the number of spaces on that block + 10%.

Brooklyn,34udqh,algorythmic,4,Tue May 5 03:33:15 2015 UTC,Parkside ave looks like a major street which is why it is six days a week. How often are the smaller streets that branch off it?  And you shouldn't be driving to work unless you absolutely have to. Park the car until the weekend and take the train
Brooklyn,34udqh,CWSwapigans,1 point,Mon May 4 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"The map shows it. What doesn't make sense is that half of parkside is 4 days a week 8:30am-10am and the other half is 6 days a week 12am-3am. Look at the map in the post. The rest of the streets next to Parkside are all 4 days a week.  The irony is that you can't use your car here on the weekends, at least during summer. Since it's right next to the park and the parade grounds, thousands of people come to BBQ and play sports so there is absolutely no parking if you leave to go somewhere and come back. With the way Parkside ave is set up with nighttime ASP, even Friday nights we can't use our car because if we go out and come back anytime before 3am we have to sit there waiting till 3am since there is no parking elsewhere in the neighborhood.  A quick fix for most of the neighborhood would be to just make all of Parkside 4 days a week at the same time as the rest of the neighborhood. It would cut down on the dozens of people sleeping in their cars at night because of nighttime ASP in a residential area. It would provide at least a hundred additional spaces every night."

There are some areas really far from subway stops.  I don't have statistics on this, but I doubt that a majority of people are spending multiple hours per week on moving their car for street cleaning just because they like having a car.

Many people who call themselves artists  do ""little jobs,"" like dog-walking (as you said), proofreading, bicycle repairing, etc., so they can have time for their art. In my day (1970s), many would work at a full-time but non-demanding job, like civil service, then do their art in the off-hours. What changed?"
Brooklyn,34xx0c,xalgorafan,1 point,Wed May 6 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's always been this way but very much so in the art and music world, the people with the most resources have the highest potential to be successful. I work 50+ hours a week with commute factored in so I don't have as much time to dedicate to my band as my friends who teach and gig as a supplemental income while their parents front the money for big expenses like rent, college, etc. Most people don't have their lives provided for them in that sense but the ones that do have the most time at their disposal to practice, make connections, take unpaid internships etc. Meanwhile the cost of living is much higher for financially independent people than it was in the 1970's once you factor in wage stagnation and the cost of education.   Also, art isn't as important to people as it was in the past. NYC is still an arts mecca but art and music fill the role of pleasant diversion from cell phone zombification rather than life inspiration. We have the internet coursing through our veins, rendering art much less novel. It's almost suicidal to go into the arts unless you want to make corporate / commercial stuff. The people that make art now a days with the goal of reaching others are deluded. With such a saturated and unrewarding market, the best one can hope for is art as fulfilling for the artist."

Look for your closest ""home distributor"" and not grocery or liquor store--most of the suggestions here are home d's, and pricing is going to be roughly the same at all of them. They should be able to deliver, so the closest location with the cheapest delivery is going to save you more money than a further location with a lower price (and higher transit cost).  Unless you have access to a retail liquor license. Maybe check with the venue? They might have a catering license that lets them purchase at wholesale.

I originally planned on taking the 5 train to downtown when I moved but found the B/Q to the R faster and way less crowded, thirty minutes door to door in the financial district. Your budget is completely doable and should get you a decent sized 1 BR. The neighborhood is really changing and some interesting places have opened up in the last few months. Plus its a relatively quiet neighborhood and close to the park (big bonus). The Q is one of my favorite trains too, 30 minutes to midtown and it connects to a majority of the other lines."

I'm white and my husband is Korean, and some of our neighbors who we have known for some time kinda look at us as outsiders. Some of our neighbors are great, though. We were lucky enough to snag our 1br at an affordable price, and could not afford to consider this neighborhood if we were moving here in 2015.  I lived in Sunset Park about 8 years ago and loved it, and actually really miss it. The secret's out about how fantastic that area is, and with our last move I wanted to go back but the commute was preferable off the Q.   Sunset is much safer than PLG, fwiw."

The best you can hope for is surface mount everywhere and going through walls from room to room, so drilling.  Also you will need to drill in from outside and come up the outside of the building to the second floor.  Also why do you need able port in every room?  Seems excessive, why not do ethernet and a single cable port.

They're pretty slow, so I think it's a better place to sit and sip coffee rather than take coffee on the go (typically what I need it for).  Family Dollar is my go-to for pretty much everything, and although it's kind of sketchy, the employees there are always friendly and you can score some things for relatively cheap.  983 Bushwick Living Room is a quick walk and a really good restaurant. They have drinks and breakfast, too!  I've been spending a lot of time at Maria Hernandez park, just a short walk on Willoughby. If you have a dog there's two dog runs for big and small dogs, and there's also a playground for kids and lots of green space. It's nice.  The best supermarket in walking distance is either the one near the park, or the Food Bazaar off Myrtle, one stop away. Mr. Kiwi is also good but moreso for fresh fruit.

The way I see it (again, upper-middle class white guy), it's ridiculous to expect someone to turn down a career/life choice because it might tangentially be part of a larger gentrification. I think the best everyone can do is try to fight the system in place that promotes gentrification. IMO the luxury building yuppies are being exploited in different ways than the people being pushed out, but the developers and landlords are laughing all the way to the bank regardless. They are the real enemy, if you are talking about class struggle. Yuppies/hipsters are simply inventory, just like lower income folks were a decade and a half ago.  tl;dr: Farm-to-table vegan quinoa is a result of income inequality, not the cause."
Brooklyn,33xgnh,xXxdethl0rdxXx,3,Sun Apr 26 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"But the question isn't why did you move to nyc, per se. It's why did you move to Brooklyn and why."
Brooklyn,33xgnh,buttscoots,4,Sun Apr 26 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"That's true. I moved to Brooklyn because I work in Brooklyn, simple as that. I've thought about moving to Manhattan and doing a reverse commute, but I like having a (small) yard and paying less than my friends in the city. It wasn't a hard choice at all."
Brooklyn,33xgnh,allofthelights,3,Sun Apr 26 22:56:47 2015 UTC,"As a 20-something, nearly all my friends who moved to NYC live in either Brooklyn, Harlem, or Queens. I think they fairly interchangeable in this situation, but I'll speak to Brooklyn specifically:  1) We already had friends living here. A good chunk of them work in nonprofits/arts or are in school and cannot afford Manhattan. So even though Manhattan is an option, it's better to be near our friends and save money in the process.  2) The commute:price ratio is as good as you can get while still living in a fairly central location within the city, where our jobs and grad programs are located.   3) It's cheaper than Manhattan when accounting for space/amenities.  4) There are more parks and nicer architecture, it's a calmer atmosphere. Yet it is still walkable with plenty of shops/bars/restaurants.  5) The people who live here, on a whole, are more relaxed and relatable. Manhattan has so many intense people (be it 'type-a' finance/fashion/real estate kind-of-people, ex-frat-boys, or rich NYU kids). I have found that I'm much more likely to mesh with someone who lives in Park Slope. (Obviously this is a huge generalization and plenty of wonderful people live in Manhattan and terrible people in Brooklyn)"
Brooklyn,33xgnh,mrfogg,4,Sun Apr 26 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"So, this is a good example. You moved here when Crown Heights was still a little gem and there weren't many brand new buildings and expensive rent.   In the last year that's completely changed. There is new construction going up all over the place and Franklin Ave, in my opinion, is becoming over saturated with the same old, same old.   Because I'm being priced out, the people that are looking at my apartment are the same people to which OP is directing this question.   People are looking at my apartment and comparing Crown Heights to Brooklyn Heights. What?!"

Brooklyn,33xgnh,zacura23,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:02:27 2015 UTC,"Same boat. Came to NYC in 2008 and worked as a mobile engineer - salaries and demand were (and continue to be) very good. I found a reasonably priced place in Prospect Heights where I could live by myself and, because of the good salaries, save more money than I could when I was living elsewhere. Honestly, I would have never been able to achieve the same level of income or career growth somewhere else that I've had in NYC. It's been awesome.  Sadly, the days of reasonable rents are pretty much gone, and the cost/value proposition of Brooklyn is waning IMO. On my last apartment search I looked at a 2Br in Crown Heights - $2800/mo, a 10-min walk from the closest train (the C train). Definitely made me reevaluate things."

We moved because she got a job that she couldn't pass up, making not a ton of money. Back home I was working 4 jobs all why trying to find a full time job in my field. Unfortunately, moving to Brooklyn also made sense for me.   As far as why we chose Brooklyn, it was because her job is in Fort Greene and it seemed to make the most sense commute-wise for her. Now we're living in Bed-Stuy and I know that we are helping to contribute to everything OP mentioned. I didn't want to move to Bed-Stuy specifically for those reasons. (I was raised Catholic, so I feel bad about every choice I've ever made.)  Anyways, long story short we moved because there was nothing happening for us in Upstate New York. The same reason people have been moving to New York since the Dutch arrived."

Brooklyn,33xgnh,cFlasch,5,Sun Apr 26 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a child of immigrants. My father moved to the US for work (he's an engineering professor), and I grew up in a small-ish college town. I then moved across the country for college, across the country again (to San Francisco) for work (in tech) for a few years, and then here again for work / career growth.  I don't have a ""home"" in the sense of ""leaving my home"". It would make no sense for me to go back to the small college town where I grew up: I have no ties there other than my parents, since I haven't kept up with my friends from high school, and many of them moved away anyway. There are approximately no opportunities there for the career path I'm interested in. Brooklyn is my home now. I have friends in SF, but that's not ""home"" any more than here is, and I have friends (and have been making friends) here. I don't speak the language of my parents' country, and I was born in the US so I'd need a visa, so that's definitely not home.  I like big cities. I like not owning a car. I like that the city never sleeps (downtown SF was often dead quiet at 11 PM). I like the bodegas, the subways, the halal carts, and yes, the tech meetups. I like the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. NYC is widely considered one of the world's best cities: why shouldn't I love it?  I dislike people being priced out of their homes. I dislike people moving into neighborhoods who don't care about the culture of the neighborhood. I dislike people being evicted via underhanded means. I used to live in the Mission District, and my unease with the changes there in the years I live there was part of why I wanted to move here. On the whole, NYC seems to be healthy. If I'm going to move to a big city, I want to move to a city where I'm not being actively harmful by being there. I want to move to a city where the process of successfully renting an apartment doesn't involve raising the market price of extremely limited, rent-controlled housing stock. I want to move to a city where I can see myself having a family. (The tech crowd in SF largely moves to suburbia when they want to have a family, which has weird effects on what the city of SF itself has funding for.) I want to be contributing positively to the city I live in, which is something I found extremely hard to do in SF. I'm probably not doing as much as I could here, and I'd love to do more.  Now, if you're asking why I'm not in the richest, most expensive part of Manhattan: I couldn't afford it. I mean, I suppose I could try to chase down some absurdly high-paying, questionably-ethical job, focus all my time into working harder and getting more promotions and raises, and try hard to become the 1%. (And I recognize that I'm absurdly fortunate that there's even a chance of that being possible.) But I really think that'd be way more harmful for society, and I've deliberately chosen to do things with my life that are good for the world, not just good for my bank account."

Brooklyn,33xgnh,ak_toxik,0,Sun Apr 26 22:30:58 2015 UTC,The argument about Dutch natives is moot. We're talking about the very obvious socioeconomic change that Brooklyn has experienced in the last 15 years.   Prewar buildings and brownstones are being torn down for brand new high rise residential buildings.   Nobody is arguing about the diversity of Brooklyn.

This happens in cycles, you can't expect your view of a neighborhood and its character to stay forever.

Perhaps I'm not the ideal class you're addressing, but I came to NYC to work in [the field I was working when I moved to NYC]. I eventually moved onto other fields—but even with the scarcity of jobs, the variation and amount of jobs in various fields in NYC is amazing. Eventually I made lifelong friendships and came into my adulthood in BK, and that's what kept me there.    A combination of aggressively pursuing the cheapest rentals + luck allowed me to live a few hundred dollars below what it seemed many of my peers were paying. Not saying I didn't live in shitholes, but I didn't pay as much to live in shitholes as my peers. For the longest time I was renting a building from a native, so I don't really have a 'gentrifier's guilt'. Not saying I'm not part of or contributing to 'the problem', but I think it's a really complex issue that's probably too nuanced to be tackled on Reddit/the internet.

Brooklyn,33xgnh,WithLinesOfInk,2,Mon Apr 27 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"Blaming the new residents is a way of creating divisions and obscuring the cause of gentrification. The people to blame are the developers and the city policy makers, as well as the capitalist system itself. Those same policy makers like to encourage that blaming because it gains them browny points in their constituency while they get campaign contributions from those same developers. A single renter has no ability to evict longtime tenants or change the value of an area. They don't set the rents, the landlords do."
Brooklyn,33xgnh,jon_laing,2,Mon Apr 27 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"I moved to Park Slope 14 years ago, right out of college from the south. I had to choose L.A. or here to work in my field, and I chose here because I couldn't afford a car and I had more connections here. I ended up in Park Slope, which was already expensive then, because I found a room with friends of friends. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, we stayed in Park Slope because we love it and found a reasonably priced apartment in an old town home rented directly from a community-minded landlord. It was all we could afford at the time, but now we make more money. I don't think paying $1000 more to live in some new luxury condo in Bushwick is helpful to the community or what we want. And I'm sure if we moved, our landlord, as nice as he is, would rent this place out for much more to the next tenant.   ""Do you feel as though your presence has hurt or helped brooklyn and its natives?""  I have no idea. I hardly know any Brooklyn natives. All my friends moved here from somewhere else. But I've lived here longer than I've lived anywhere else, so while I'm not a native, it sure feels like home."
Brooklyn,33xgnh,maryvarn,2,Mon Apr 27 04:16:45 2015 UTC,"I live in Bushwick and am Middle Eastern, but I look white. I moved to east Bushwick at 17 years old on my own, and I spent nearly 9 years living in various apartments in the area.   Because of my skin color, I see both sides of the gentrification argument. I was raised in Bushwick, but natives tend to think I'm a gentrifier because of my light skin.   Basically, one of the biggest reasons why young people move to cities, especially into bad areas in cities such as Bushwick, is because of necessity. They want to live their lives in a fun place like New York, but they can't afford a place in Lower Manhattan, so they live in less expensive areas like Bushwick or Harlem. While they are there, their social and economic mobility rises, as they are often able to capitalize on cheap local real estate. Most gentrifiers in places like Bushwick or Harlem aren't the same people moving into Soho or Williamsburg, it's usually a younger, poorer crowd. Party kids, ravers, junkies, punks, artists, these were the type of people which moved into Bushwick around 2007-2013, around the same time I was there. These are known as first generation gentrifiers. However, once that whole entire scene is established, THATS when the yuppies begin to move in and where the real problems begin.   There is a whole entire generation of people who move to neighborhoods, not to actually contribute to the neighborhood, but to be around people who do contribute. They will only go to restaurants or bars owned by  first generation gentrifiers because their previous existence in the suburbs doesn't give them a lot of experience dealing with the native people. They will only buy organic food, and won't contribute to local businesses. All of their friends are gentrifiers, or they live in Manhattan. These are second generation gentrifiers, or the people currently moving to Bushwick.This is where the real problems begin to arise, the people simply don't connect with the natives at all. Rents begin to rise drastically, poorer people begin to move out because all the local businesses get replaced and everything is too expensive, and even some first generation gentrifiers begin to move out. This started to happen to Bushwick around 2013-2014, and has been happening to Williamsburg and LES for a while.   Third generation gentrification is when the second generation gets older and start having families. Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Carroll Gardens, these are all a good example. Youngish families get older as time goes on, and families in their 30s, as long as they have enough income, can move there. All traces of natives or first generation gentrifiers is erased outside of maybe a few places or on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Neighborhood is completely transformed, and rents begin to peak at around 3,000 a month.   Almost every single neighborhood in Brooklyn is experiencing one of these forms of gentrification. As Williamsburg, home to nearly 250,000 people, begins to enter it's third stage of gentrification, we will see more and more people expanding southward into Brooklyn and even Queens. Bushwick is transforming rapidly, and even Bay Ridge is seeing a lot of young ravers and addicts moving there. As they get older, they attract more people as the neighborhood becomes trendier. Addicts aren't exactly appealing, but they give the neighborhood roughness, which attracts a lot of people.   The humanitarian cost? Refugees.   Hundreds of thousands of people displaced, forced to move to neighborhoods like Brownsville or East NY, or even worse, they are forced completely out of the city. For those who remain in gentrifying areas, prices begin to rise DRASTICALLY, and life becomes overwhelmingly more difficult. The police presence increases a lot, resulting in a lot of racial tension, and any cheap businesses are run out. I have seen nearly all of my old friends forced to move into worse areas because of gentrification, and whole entire blocks of families are removed every year. Their neighborhoods become insanely hostile to them, with all the signs and changes basically pointing at the exit for anybody below a certain income or race.   Gentrification helps people, rich people, and the occasional poor homeowner (the city is 75% renters) and that's basically it."

Previously shady areas like Kent ave in Williamsburg are completely safe at night now   It...it notably is not because of gentrification. Gentrification started pretty early in Williamsburg, right when crime as a whole was decreasing, but other neighborhoods in central Brooklyn that didn't have gentrification until recently already had far lower crime rates than some most of their recorded history. Neighborhoods that aren't undergoing gentrification AT ALL have lower crime rates as well.    Nice areas attract talented, well-off people.

Perhaps you should consider for a moment why people feel antagonized when they are forced or tricked from their homes by greedy landlords and real estate agents, or angry when their honest effort to make something of themselves and the community is squashed and then are called either ""lazy"" or ""entitled"".    I'd just like a nice neighborhood that doesn't smell of piss and one where my girlfriend won't be mugged or raped on her way home.   I find this to be especially hilarious. I was in bay ridge, which I'm sure you are aware is a affluent neighborhood, and the smell of piss was definitely there. Funny enough, I smelled it again in Prospect Heights. Funny how that works.    mugged or raped on her way home.   Hmm. You know, its funny, but places like Brooklyn Heights and Clinton Hill had similar overall crime rates to that of Brownsville and East NY.

Until New Yorkers of all durations come together and in great numbers to elect state and local representatives who will actually and loudly protect renters (the majority) instead of developers and landlords (the minority), problems like this will continue. Many just throw their hands up and blame the people moving in, but it is important to remember that so many steps in the gentrification process (from granting of liquor licenses to an expensive speakeasy bar to ordering evictions on shakey grounds to approving new upsized construction with only 10 affordable units in place of a laundromat etc. ) go through government processes and could be fixed if people found time to vote and otherwise take action."

In the Bible/Torah version, it's kill anyone who speaks of other gods:  Deuteronomy 13:6-10  New International Version (NIV):  If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, 7 gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), 8 do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. 9 You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. 10 Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."

In building washer and dryer in cheap places are also rare. It's one in a million to luck out and find a deal. Safe neighborhood? Pay up. Dishwasher? Pay up. Elevator? Pay up. Near the subway? Pay up. Want an idea? I own a 2br duplex in Clinton Hill across from Pratt. Quick walk to subway in a great neighborhood. Elevator and doorman building. I have dishwasher and washer dryer in the apt. If I were to rent it out, I could easily get $3500 and likely closer to $3800. Doubt you want to pay that so start knocking down from there. Moving to NYC can be a reality check.

Brooklyn,33mf1r,pixelsguy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"You just described a $3k/mo apartment. Knock out some amenities or decide if you'd like to live in a cheaper, safe and more residential hood (cutting out the easy access to happening places and people very near you) and recognize you can spend time in the city and mostly sleep in your 'hood. Then you can drop your budget to around $2k/mo.   Consider Queens. Astoria or LIC are nice, younger, and you'll have an easier time finding an affordable place with amenities than in Brooklyn. Affordable Brooklyn apartments in the kinds of hoods you described are short on amenities (but imo the local flavor- restaurants and whatnot- makes up for it).   May I suggest you also come and rent a room from Craigslist for a few months until your girlfriend is ready to move out here- that gives you more time to look for a place. Apartment hunting for an affordable one bedroom is an Olympic sport here. Having the luxury of being month to month in your living situation lets you take a few stabs at finding a place; all of the good apartments are rented within a few days, so by the second or third week of a month there's not a lot left to even look at.   Good luck."
Brooklyn,33mf1r,duyogurt,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Transfers decrease the predictability of your commute.

Brooklyn,33ljqr,brooklyngeek,2,Thu Apr 23 19:10:15 2015 UTC,Just eat out at cheap places and get a feel for the various neighborhoods you are exploring.  In the grand scheme of things you are looking at maybe an extra $100 max by eating out versus frugally cooking (which is extremely hard to do if you don't already own all the basics like olive oil and spices and butter and such.) Plus your time is better spent walking around and/or checking craigslist instead of spending an hour or two cooking and cleaning every night.  Random list of cheapish places I like to eat at: Try Banhmigos in Park Slope. Taqueria De Los Muertos in Prospect Heights. Gloria's in Crown Heights. Kimchi Grill in Prosepct Heights. Rosco's pizza in Prosepct Heights. Boomwich on Atlantic. Any random Indian BYOB meal deal place. Calexico in Park Slope. Chick P in Prospect Heights. Food Truck Rally and Farmers Market in Grand Army on the weekends. Any bar with a backyard if it's nice out for happy hour.

I moved from Park Slope to Cortelyou 1 year ago and it was a huge improvement. This is a real neighborhood and we just love it. Plus it has the largest grouping of Victorian houses in America.

People walk their dogs down Eastern Parkway to the great lawn that's not far from the entrance.   There are a lot of restaurants, bars and shops. The subway stop is the 2/3/4/5 or the A/C, depending on where you are.   If you're price range is above $2,500, you won't have a problem.

You'll be close to Maria Hernandez Park, which is a real park, and has a very neighborhoody feel around the Jefferson and Morgan stops. It's not Park Slope, but you've got a lot of fun places to eat and drink around there.  The M goes to Soho at Broadway-Lafayette in ~25-30 minutes, and the J to Bowery in about the same.

Here's a random example: http://www.trulia.com/rental/3188472166-841A-Greene-Ave-3-Brooklyn-NY-11221#photo-3  You can definitely find places for 1,500-2000. Just make sure you walk the block on a warm Friday / Saturday evening to make sure it's not too loud and that you feel safe (each block is different); same goes for Bushwick too.  That said, the Jefferson/Morgan stops mentioned by /u/crbiker are far superior from a quality of life perspective - I'd be willing to pay a bit more just to enjoy all the restaurants/galleries/events etc."

Sounds ideal, but we're moving because the landlord is raising the rent from 3100 to 3400 and we're right next to a whole lot of new construction ☹  Our moving requirements were pretty specific (e.g. elevator was necessary), so we were able to go without a broker (because our choice of properties was severely limited anyway) - on our brief search, many properties were ""broker only"", but, (with our budgeted rental cost) it was cheaper to go no broker."

Brooklyn,33d7wc,otisthorpesrevenge,11,Tue Apr 21 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"My assumption, as with many things 311 related, is that if they show up at all, they don't really give a shit.  Some overworked person at the DEP maybe does a drive by or barely investigates at all.  If there were several calls about it (besides just one complaint from one person) it would likely become more of an issue to them as they'd be getting multiple complaints.  If you're truly concerned, ask your neighbors to call as well - see if you can't get people in that building to call and investigate it.  The more complaints, the more pull."
Brooklyn,33d7wc,dougiemeowserMD,6,Tue Apr 21 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right although with a city agency they may not be overworked, they could also be overlazy. I've used 311 maybe 5 or 6 times in the last 10 or so years. One time was to report a sheared off rivet from the elevated subway platform (the huge rivets that are like 1.5"" in diameter) - and I got a response a month later from MTA saying the issue was resolved. I know where the rivet came from and I'm 100% sure they didn't fix it. If I thought the issue was putting people's lives in imminent danger I'd keep barking up the tree, but at the end of the day, I don't care enough to fight it further... same with this building's shitty boiler."
Brooklyn,33d7wc,anniczka,3,Tue Apr 21 16:49:48 2015 UTC,I'll make sure to give 311 a call next time. I've seen the smoke (live on Sterling) and was wondering what was going on there - didn't realize I should/could be calling 311 about it.

Brooklyn,33d7wc,badasimo,4,Wed Apr 22 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"You probably won't be seeing this much longer, as the weather's warming up. I think it happens when those boilers ""start up"" which is going to happen when the weather is between seasons like this.  In the winter the boiler is probably running at full capacity and it likely burns cleaner when it reaches a certain temperature. Otherwise you would have seen this smoke all winter and constantly."
Brooklyn,33d7wc,Lothar_Ecklord,3,Tue Apr 21 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"Where I live in the Bronx, this is very common. Due to the heating fuel used which is very dirty and spews black smoke every time they kick on. I think many of the city's pre-war (specifically 30's-40's) buildings burn this nasty shit. This map shows it pretty well. I live in the brown spot. There is black soot all over my window sills."

Brooklyn,33d7wc,Chester_Allman,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, timing.  It was developed in a period when those boilers were popular (and probably cheap).  It is also one of the few parts of the Bronx where, frankly, it is both old developments and did not burn down in the 60's-80's.  The rest of the boro is either too new or too old.  That's just speculation based on what I have seen and some old fashioned logic."
Brooklyn,33d7wc,sltfaf35,2,Wed Apr 22 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for calling. Another poster pointed out something I hadn't thought of when we talked in the last thread, about how it may have been related to the boiler ""starting up."" That said, I have a clear view of the building from my apartment and if I see the smoke again, I'll call 311.   I know things don't always work out, but I have a lot of respect for people who at least try to get things like this addressed. You're motivating me to try and do something about the garbage problem on Franklin Avenue."

I can send a cease and desist notice to /u/bangarang666 because I want you to wear pink socks to work. You are free to ignore that if you so wish; and if i tried to take legal action, i'd get laughed out of court.  However, HBO does have grounds for legal action if they so wished.

Brooklyn,3381cj,alent1234,4,Mon Apr 20 19:55:26 2015 UTC,Very expensive ones. Same for boxing/ufc. That's why a lot of bars charge to see the events. They don't pay the $40 you would at home. I think for the mayweather-paquiao fight the cheapest commercial ppv package is $10k. It goes up based on venue size and how many tvs you have.
Brooklyn,3381cj,derpoftheirish,6,Mon Apr 20 12:23:42 2015 UTC,"Bars and restaurants must get commercial pay-tv packages from companies like DirecTV in order to show pay-tv content on the premises.

Brooklyn,339sqi,krobs42,6,Mon Apr 20 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've got electric heating in a place not properly insulated. What probably happened was a few years ago the boiler broke, and instead of replacing it- the landlord just put in baseboard electric heating, and didn't update the insulation."
Brooklyn,339sqi,Corgana,3,Mon Apr 20 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It sounds like the answer is in the post. If you're using electric heating and running it at the highest setting, that's probably the reason why your power bills are so high."

Brooklyn,339sqi,grink,2,Wed Apr 22 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"(We do know from ConEd that they left a huge bill unpaid.)   You should not be paying another tenant's bill.    I agree with the posters below; are your meters being properly read?  If you have a breaker in your apartment, turn everything off--then go look at your meter.  If that's not an option, unplug every single item in your house, then go check.  It it's still spinning, it's possible another apartment / common utility (like the hallway or something) is leaching off your meter, and it hasn't been caught before now."
Brooklyn,339sqi,Zheudai,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:03:09 2015 UTC,"We have tried turning everything off for a day and the meter barely moved. And we know they are actual readings, not estimates, this is why we feel like there is nothing that can be done. We asked other tenants in our building (just 3 apartments total) and we saw the same percentage jump from summer to winter months, albeit they have lower usage."
Brooklyn,339sqi,JeffersonPutnam,2,Wed Apr 22 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"This doesn't sound right at all.  You might be paying the entire building's bill.  How many meters are there?  Even for electric heat that's expensive as hell.  Con Ed doesn't try to screw you.  As /u/HumblerMumbler said turn off everything and see if your meter is still spinning, if it is, there is an illegal tap off of it.  Disclaimer: I work in the utility industry."
Brooklyn,339sqi,grandzu,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"There are four meters downstairs... three apartments and, I assume, the business at street level?"
Brooklyn,339sqi,JeffersonPutnam,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:57:34 2015 UTC,That's way too much. We are only paying $50/mo in electricity for a 2 bedroom. How old are your appliances? Do you have access to your meter? You could unplug everything and then serially plug in everything to determine if it's a particular device. I remember hearing a story about someone's printer that was hidden in a cabinet that was continually trying to spool paper that ended up costing hundreds of dollars.
Brooklyn,339sqi,grandzu,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:45:38 2015 UTC,"For one thing, before you sign a lease on an apartment where you pay heat, ask for a summary of the past two years of heating/electricity bills.  The landlord must provide these by law if you ask.    The other concern I have is that if your landlord does not provide heating which can reach 68, that is illegal.  You could report that to HPD.  Theoretically, you could take your landlord and the department of buildings to housing court over that issue and potentially get monetary damages.  Is that worth the hassle?  I don't think so.  But, perhaps you could pursue that."

Brooklyn,335lhc,ianmac47,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but HBO has to make a big show of cracking down right now because they just launched HBO Now and timing the service with GOT premiere wasn't exactly a coincidence. They used to be cool about GOT piracy and HBO Go account sharing because everyone justified it by saying they were just waiting for them to make HBO Go standalone at a reasonable price. Now that they've given people what they asked for, they want to see you put your money where your mouth was, and public viewing parties are gonna have to be a casualty of that."
Brooklyn,335lhc,filthysize,1 point,Mon Apr 20 11:30:56 2015 UTC,"That is ridiculous.  The reason HBO has such a piracy problem is because they were so bad at offering their shows to people in a reasonable format.  HBO GO and HBO NOW are good steps in the right direction, but shutting down other ways people want to see the show instead of finding a way to allow it and still make some money is falling back into the old trap that got them so pirated in the first place.  Charging the bar a fee, like ESPN, make everyone happy."

Brooklyn,335lhc,donat28,12,Sun Apr 19 21:30:02 2015 UTC,Are you selling beer to people at your house and using the show to sell more beer than you usually would?  HBO is in the right. I wish they hadn't shut it down but it's unlicensed commercial use of their show.

I wish they hadn't shut it down but it's unlicensed commercial use of their show.   I understand that - but in a way this is one of those stupid decisions that goes against the grain and that would end up damaging the HBO brand more than helping.  If HBO decided to play along and send the bar merchandise for giveaways or games, game of thrones and HBO would stand to benefit as these types of people are the ones to buy merchandise, DVD box sets etc and most likely already have HBO - they just enjoy watching it in a group setting.  that's why it's dumb."

It's impossible to measure the benefit/harm that will come to HBO because of this.  I am simply stating my opinion, that I feel this is dumb and the wrong way to go.   You might even be right, by chance, but saying ""it's stupid"" because a single part of a gigantic PR system didn't make sense to you is what's stupid.    you are mistaken bud.  My objection isn't because I don't understand their PR system (this isn't a PR decision on their end btw) but because I believe in the long run that it is something that will backfire.  I am not forcing anyone to burn down HBO - I just think their actions will be counterproductive to what they are trying to do.  It will be one more in a string of bad decisions by HBO, starting with them claiming that they are proud that people pirate their program, then saying that they had no interest in standalone HBO service before backtracking on both."
Brooklyn,335lhc,donat28,-2,Mon Apr 20 04:17:57 2015 UTC,Is HBO losing out on beer sales? The people who went out to see it there likely don't have a tv or just want to watch it with other people in a social setting.
Brooklyn,335lhc,NinjaSupplyCompany,6,Mon Apr 20 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"Videology is using HBO's intellectual property to make money. People who pay for drinks/food in exchange for the chance to watch the show aren't paying for an HBO subscription or digital downloads of the episodes. Videology is syphoning profits away from HBO to increase their own revenue. Because they rent the dvds, Videology can show the episodes they already have on disc but their first run episodes would require a separate licensing agreement.  You can go to your friend's house with an HBO subscription and bring beer and watch it but you can't set up a free screening to make money on concessions."
Brooklyn,335lhc,InfiniteGist,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:58:46 2015 UTC,Well then HBO should just charge the bar a fee or a percentage.  Then everyone will be happy.

Brooklyn,335lhc,nonhiphipster,-3,Mon Apr 20 13:05:19 2015 UTC,How is this any different from watching sports in a bar? Should ESPN do the same to every sports bar in America?
Brooklyn,335lhc,InfiniteGist,3,Mon Apr 20 01:23:53 2015 UTC,Sports bars pay for different cable packages than residential customers and ESPN makes money from commercials as well as cable subscriptions so ESPN benefits more from having large groups of people watching their shows. If a bar wants to show a commercial free Pay Per View event like boxing then they pay insane fees.

Brooklyn,335lhc,ianmac47,-1,Mon Apr 20 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"That's absurd. HBO would never recoup lost revenues by selling merchandise rather than HBO Now subscriptions. Tell me, why should I subsidize your personal enjoyment of Game of Thrones?
