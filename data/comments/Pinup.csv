My personal favorite is Cherry Dollface, as I feel like she explains everything in detail and is friendly to all skill levels.

Pinup,3b05qa,LookSpaghettiArms,5,Thu Jun 25 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"Regarding hairstyling, I HIGHLY suggest this book along with YouTube tutorials (there's also a companion book all about pinup makeup )It not only tells you step-by-step how to do the style, but the history of the style itself (why and how it came to be etc.) So you don't pair 40's hairstyle with a 50's outfit if you're going authentic.   I would also suggest learning to sew. Even basic stuff on a machine. You can shop retro, but sometimes things won't fit you right. Knowing how to tailor outfits specifically to your body will be more flattering. Edit: it also comes in SUPER handily when you see a $200 dress online, and can make it for under $30.  Try searching your area for other interested in the pinup/rockabilly/psychobilly scenes. Social networking helps with this. You can find hair/makeup/photographers you can make awesome connections with. Speaking of photographers.... ALWAYS HAVE A SHOOT BUDDY! I've heard too many stories of scumbag ""photographers"" creeping on girls cause they're new to it all. Take a friend with you, and if the photographer says no tag-a-longs, they ain't legit, honey— blacklist them.   My last bit of advice... Be yourself. Incorporating your own unique style to the classic pinup looks is where you can really stand out and shine. You'll meet some girls out there who are ""purist"" and take the scene too seriously— these girls are killjoys, and will drag you down. Don't hang around people who shit on others; the scene is supposed to be kitschy & fun, not stuffy with a buncha sourpusses.   edit: f'ing formatting."

The style reminds me of magazine illustrations of the '20s and '30s.  The one of Ygritte is particularly good.

I think that, if I was doing the shoot, I would've put more thought into the ""geeky meets classical pinup"" idea. Maybe instead of having a classic pinup pose where she's just randomly holding magic cards behind her, you could have a more noire setup of her posing while playing against some guys dressed up nice but drab, like it's the 30's or whatever, in a smoky pub or other suitable location.  Kinda like a femme fatale playing high stakes poker against some shady goons, but working in a more modern angle in a way that fits and adds to the 'story' of the photo. Then it's not just ""Here, hold some geeky stuff because... geeky, yeah..."", but it actually adds to the shoot, while incorporating both elements naturally."

Pinup,32q08g,thewayimakemefeel,7,Thu Apr 16 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with her work, it just feels like too much."
Pinup,32q08g,brningpyre,8,Thu Apr 16 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"maybe not ""too much"" but definitely like they just shoehorned the nerdy stuff in without too much forethought. the props seem kind of forced into the shoot"
Pinup,32q08g,sarahg312,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:43:24 2015 UTC,"Did she leave SourceFed? I didn't even hear about that. I kinda hate SF and SFN, but Trisha was great."
Pinup,32q08g,Steelfox13,2,Thu Apr 16 00:53:27 2015 UTC,"I think she has one more table talk going up next week, but after that she's gone"
Pinup,32q08g,brningpyre,3,Thu Apr 16 03:20:27 2015 UTC,"That's cool. I didn't get that at all. In the video she did about the shoot, I think she mentioned wanting to include the things she's passionate about rather than the usual props.   Maybe it just feels forced because they aren't standard like a vintage car or WWII plane?"
Pinup,32q08g,AIM-9enema,3,Thu Apr 16 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"No, I think it's the classic poses and clothing and then ""here hold some magic cards.""  I guess the geek angle isn't the focus but an afterthought."
Pinup,32p30h,triforceful,7,Wed Apr 15 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"Photographer here, the photos are just ok. Here are some things I would try to do for next time. In the photo with the bench, there is a lot of bench leaves we don't need to see. Your legs need taut to show definition. Your head is too far off the bench. We can't see your facial expressions well. Make up is ok but we really can't see it because the shot is too far away. And we can't tell if you've done your hair because your head is off the bench.   With the shot by the water, again it's too wide of a shot. We don't need to see that much around you. And while your neck is extended, it's too taut. It doesn't look ""pretty"". It would have been nice if you would have angled your head towards the camera. Or if the camera was in a different position.   I think with some refinements on posing, and location, you'll totally hit it out of the ball park."
Pinup,32p30h,moxiedanger,3,Thu Apr 16 00:32:02 2015 UTC,"Well, thank you for your critique. I was working with an amateur, for free, so I wasn't expecting perfection. All of my poses I just did on my own with no instructions, and since I am very new to the game, I had no idea what I was going.   Next time I hope I can work with a really skilled photographer who can help me with poses, such as yourself. :3"

Pinup,2uaeio,odnadevotchka,2,Sat Jan 31 08:05:20 2015 UTC,The girl on the top row in the center is tattooed on my ribs.
Pinup,2uaeio,HEYPAUL17,5,Sat Jan 31 13:11:26 2015 UTC,"You should have put it on the skin covering your ribs.  It's more visible there, and no surgery needed."

Pinup,2u6l3l,Pallas-Athena,7,Fri Jan 30 09:25:40 2015 UTC,Oh wow
Pinup,2u6l3l,LC_Music,2,Fri Jan 30 09:27:06 2015 UTC,That's what I said
Pinup,2u6l3l,MrTomAce,2,Fri Jan 30 18:31:04 2015 UTC,This is a VS photo shoot?
Pinup,2u6l3l,maxout2142,2,Fri Jan 30 20:54:45 2015 UTC,I'd hazard a guess it is. I wouldn't have the slightest idea how'd she could tart it up for a pinup when the body of her work is what it is without crossing the line.

Pinup,2twli6,CJ105,7,Wed Jan 28 00:27:01 2015 UTC,I feel like I would love this if the perspective or photoshop or whatevers making her ratios seem completely off. Am I the only one who sees this as off-looking? I don't have my glasses on so that maaaay be it.
Pinup,2twli6,lilybeth,3,Wed Jan 28 08:09:54 2015 UTC,Right there with you. For me it is a texture/lighting difference between her face and legs/clavicles.
Pinup,2twli6,Vithryld,3,Wed Jan 28 09:57:18 2015 UTC,"Too bright. The Elvgren this pic emulates is lit dimmer ""in the evening"". This looks like it's midday and throws the fantasy off. Some extra work could have gone into her posture to tease a little more sex appeal that would compliment Sarah Michelle without compromising her values as a person.  Edit* Came back to say it's also a juxtaposition to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer hold a hammer loosely while looking helpless against a stubborn nail. Someone also missed out on an opportunity for product placement as far as the hammer is concerned."
