FUTMobile,3e5jit,VolcomSwag,3,Wed Jul 22 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"If you want to improve your team, pick a ""big"" league* (premier league, liga bbva, serie a, bundesliga, ligue 1) and start out with the cheapest players(try to win non rare golds off of the market for 300/350 and eared for 600/650). Once you've got a basic squad, you can simulate easy tournaments or even seasons until the players run out of contracts. Don't waste your contracts on them. Quick sell them and buy a fresh set of players. If you buy two sets of players, you can create two squads and use players from one squad to fill the bench of the other squad, allowing them to regain their fitness. After awhile, you can upgrade the team that you posted with SIF Donovan, IF BWP, MOTM Dempsey, IF Keane, and IF David Villa.  It may take a long time, but once you make your dream team you will be very satisfied.   the reason why you should pick a ""big"" league is that they have a lot of players. The more players, the easier to is to fill out positions and get good chemistry."

FUTMobile,3e4qsk,tugaribs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:27 2015 UTC,Agreed that is pretty much my bundes squad after dans' giveaway.  If i am actually playing rather than simming i like to have auba up front...  yes i am a pace whore...
FUTMobile,3e4qsk,smockteleheli,2,Tue Jul 21 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"If you need everyone on full chemistry, you're set.  Tots fahrmann is better than toty neuer for me. I havent tried pink gundogan, but I'd suggest trying tots junuzovic bc he can shoot from distance  and tracks back.   For the best possible squad, back 4 of tots marcelo, toty Ramos, tots boateng, toty Lahm. The left two will have 8 chem but will still be better than Rodriguez and naldo."
FUTMobile,3e4qsk,PaulGawdba,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:49 2015 UTC,What a great squad!  Not sure why the dislike for TOTS Naldo + Rod? The pairing is awesome for me.   So I would switch the position of Naldo and Boteng. Also you might want to try swapping KDB with Gun. I know perfect link and all but you never know. I for one did not feel that link was that perfect.
FUTMobile,3e4qsk,lingmister,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:01 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no dislike for Naldo and Rodriguez.  They're great.  It's that he was asking how to improve, and imo Ramos is a big improvement over any CB except Boateng.  The agility sets him apart -- he can stay with any attacker."
FUTMobile,3e4qsk,PaulGawdba,2,Wed Jul 22 00:58:28 2015 UTC,Swap de Bruyne with Muller?
FUTMobile,3e4qsk,aznc00kies,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:21:01 2015 UTC,I would switch KDB and Muller. I think muller is better suited as a midfielder with his workrates and physicality.

FUTMobile,3dvav1,tugaribs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:36 2015 UTC,Do you have any advice on sniping? I still don't know much about buying guys cheap for trading or for my team.
FUTMobile,3dvav1,Thebig1two,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:45 2015 UTC,"Go all the way to 59th minute page. Check the remaining time on the cards and make your way to the 59th minute cause that's the cards that were just recently listed and they might be listed for much lower than usual, so that's when you snipe them. Hope I helped!"

The last time i lost the glitch i also lost those players.  I am glad for MEGA packs means i get less chance at special cards but pick up more non rare transfers too.
FUTMobile,3dup0k,ukplaying,0,Sun Jul 19 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"you will be,  once the glitch chooses you he/she never lets go, but mega pack is 35k vs rare player pack 50k, yes most of what i get are duplicates but still feels like a downgrade to me, i was hoping for 100k packs."

FUTMobile,3dt32z,mlg_cat,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"For me, he does alright.  He links up with TOTS Nkoulou who performs well.  Most people go with Sirigu to link with Luiz and Silva, since that's statistically the best back line.  IF Ruffier is good but only links with TOTS Perrin, and Lopes only links with TOTS Umtiti.  Frankly it's up to you since keeper quality doesnt seem to matter as much as defensive quality, hence the common choice of Sirigu"
FUTMobile,3dt32z,madd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:06 2015 UTC,I assume you mean perfect links?? Otherwise they link with many different players...
FUTMobile,3dt32z,kev11111,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:41 2015 UTC,"perfect or at least team links, since my squad is all Ligue 1 players.  If you include ANY players then Sirigu is the clear winner, since he can link with Serie A defenders"
FUTMobile,3dt32z,madd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:03 2015 UTC,Well today Castro used a Hero Mandanda that didn't do shit the whole game. H eended up buying 1-2 pages of him on xbox and quick sold them all. That's how bad he is apparently
FUTMobile,3dt32z,Krishido,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:12:59 2015 UTC,Just used TOTS Mandanda for a game and he made some impressive saves for me including saving Rooney's one on one in the 90th minute. I used TOTS Mandanda not the hero card.
FUTMobile,3dt32z,kev11111,2,Sun Jul 19 05:28:11 2015 UTC,hes bailed me out a few times by saving the obligatory 90th minute shot/goal/equaliser/winner that happens 90% of the time no matter what you do...

FUTMobile,3dt32z,ukplaying,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"for me he was horrible. statisticaly he is the 2nd best gk but after having a good first game, he just kept doing blunders, the game treats him as a short keeper i think and he is horrible at crosses parries them directly to an attacker, his diving is excellent in that he will somehow manage to go around the ball however impossible it may look, reminds me of keanu and bullets in matrix. I dont know how he is online but the only positive i found about him is that he is cheap and can easily boost ur squad rating from the bench. he is also the only keeper  i have used for a reasonable amount of time who will let shots go into the net even after getting someting on it."
FUTMobile,3dt32z,xx263xx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:25:07 2015 UTC,hmm.. have you used TOTS Fahrmann before? Heard he's decent

After TOTS Alves, Mandanda is my favorite goalkeeper in the game. He is quick off his line and always gets something on the opponents shots, unless I go full potato with my defenders and let them in one on one. Mandanda is definitely the way to go."

FUTMobile,3dsktw,Soviet__Russia,7,Sun Jul 19 01:27:51 2015 UTC,"Packs as a whole are no different then sitting at a slot machine in a casino. Sure you can win sometimes, you may even hit a jackpot. Over time though very few people come out ahead, if they did then EA would make less money. So if you have the time and patience, trading is the way to make the most amount of coins.  With that being said.....I love mega packs. By far my favorite because even when you don't find good players at least you end up with contracts and other items. Most people sell them, I just stock them up, and when I get low on coins for trading k have a binge sell off of thousands of consumable to get me back on my feet again."
FUTMobile,3dsktw,Danimalistic2782,2,Sun Jul 19 05:37:04 2015 UTC,Packs are never worth it.

FUTMobile,3dsibz,mpassell99,3,Sun Jul 19 01:02:28 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a transfer glitch like with David Villa. He transferred from Shalke to Olympikakos (I think I spelled that right), and his transferred card is identified differently than his non-transferred, except EA has it glitched where it is like they still play for the same club so they are functionally identical, but EA's code identifies them as different cards, hence 2 of him"
FUTMobile,3dsibz,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun Jul 19 02:16:30 2015 UTC,"Cool. Thanks for all the details, something that EA clearly has trouble with."

FUTMobile,3drf2g,Fifiboi,0,Sat Jul 18 19:33:48 2015 UTC,his sweat level has been increased 10 folds. any opponent that gets within 10 feet of him drowns in his sweat. it would require at least 10 pediatric doctors to revive the affected individuals.

Maybe I am just not using him the correct way but he seems underwhelming as compared to all the hype. I use him as a LW in the 4-3-3 (4), or as the LM in the 4-1-2-1-2, and he seems to rarely make that big of an impact on the game."

He is so smooth on the ball...jinks are so easy, dribbles in the box and around defenders, and his weak foot is not too bad.   At 88 LM, he reminds me of SIF Neymar, but I feel he is better tbh. Pity I sold my Abeuy.   Gudogan is quite standard, nothing outstanding, but solid CM. Was out of position a few times but tracked back well in box to box play."
FUTMobile,3drf2g,WillAlwaysLie,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:52:31 2015 UTC,Is it worth it to spend the coins and upgrade from his NIF?
FUTMobile,3drf2g,lingmister,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:03:04 2015 UTC,Hmm...I'm not 100% sure. If you were a bundes supporter or collector I would say yes. But considering we just finished TOTS he is probably not up to say Hazard. That is if you have Hazard.   In general I find Pink players good but TOTS are still better.

Usually I like the strong foot facing inside on F9 wingers for far post finesse.  That outside boot shot is strong af too though.

Someone at EA said that the cards will be given the equivilent value of a TIF. So Yaya, Quaresma, Lloris, Erikson, and Rooney aren't going to get huge upgrades but Reus, Bale, Doumbia, and Gundogan will. Just make sure you buy on Saturday/Sunday when the prices are low."
FUTMobile,3d55xz,nannerbots,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:21 2015 UTC,My guess is Bale is gonna settle around 1.5 mil and reus is gonna settle around 1.9 mil.

I've passed on Benedetto 5 times at 1m or just above thinking I would see it lower. I have a feeling the guy selling right now for 15m has 3 or 4 of them and is price fixing.

I can't remember for sure, but I think he was released when the transfer market was down. Not a lot of packs were bought at that time, 24 hour window to get an extremely rare card at a time when few people are buying packs, I think he is a phantom. Also with the fear that the market may never come back most people wouldn't spend money on silver packs."
FUTMobile,3d2pvd,tugaribs,2,Mon Jul 13 16:01:00 2015 UTC,I would love to get my hands on a Man Utd Nani

FUTMobile,3d3l6w,kev11111,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:24 2015 UTC,I understand your pain Kev. His happened to me in my previous account and I decided to restart. This is also the reason why I will never buy FIFA coins or just coins. The game has a habit of dying in someway so it was really the effort you put in that you lost.   Going forward I'm just going to take a break from FIFA. Read IRL soccer news and wait for FIFA 16. See you there.

FUTMobile,3d2rea,nannerbots,4,Mon Jul 13 01:40:26 2015 UTC,"so, is EA gonna screw us on mobile with no Ronaldinho or do you think the put him in the game or maybe give us Xavi (who I think just beat out Pirlo for second?) My guess is we get the shaft. Nada. Nil. Zizeroni.  I want, no need, that Yaya.  I'll also have to try Cavani. This card might be fast enough to be useful.  Can someone explain to me why folks voted for Bale, when there is a RW and ST version of him? Do people want to play him at LB? I don't get it. FFS people could have had Alaba who would have been epic at CDM. EPIC.  I really wanted Guarin and Alba & Pedro."
FUTMobile,3d2rea,bitchfaceronaldo,2,Mon Jul 13 04:03:24 2015 UTC,I wanted Hernanes but I'll take Yaya. There's is no chance that we're getting Ronaldinho. Maybe they'll give us another 25K sympathy pack as if it even matters.
FUTMobile,3d2rea,Krishido,3,Mon Jul 13 04:15:23 2015 UTC,I never got that 25k pack ;-;
FUTMobile,3d2rea,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"The people want Bale because his IF card is all but extinct and they want a 10 chem striker Bale they have a chance of packing. Also, Alaba already has an available card in a central position, as does Walcott, nobody likes David Luiz and Walker would be awesome as a CB but it's better to hybridize BPL teams than use their center backs"

FUTMobile,3d2rea,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:58 2015 UTC,It's actually Roma. Just a mistake in the picture

Kilimanjaro by slitting it's throat and having the blood fall upon the centre of a satanic star, then burn the entrails at dusk, while performing a ritual and chanting ""BASED GOD WE ARE NOT WORTHY"" until you see a flash and a white pillar of light descend from the heavens, at which point, Chu Boi will descend from the sky and grant you the ability to induce lag in any online game at any point, especially when your opponent has a clear chance. He gives you amazing pack luck, guaranteeing you at lest a 90 rated player in every pack you open, even ones that are out of packs, like TOTY and past IFs. Lastly, he grants you the abilities of all of the greatest players in Ultimate team- the pace of Walcott, the strength of Akinfenwa, the ball control of Messi, the shot power of Diego Costa, the skill moves of Ronaldo, the defending of Boateng, the passing of Ozil, the steal-your-girl attitude of John Terry and the diving of Busquets. With that, he blesses you, and ascends until the light brightens until you black out. You awake a day later dehydrated on the top of a mountain in the blistering sun covered in lamb blood.

FUTMobile,3d12dw,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:03 2015 UTC,Better to make videos no more than 7 minutes imo. 3-4 minutes is the sweet spot. 5 is good as well. 6-7 is okay but starts to get tedious for the viewers. You don't want it too long in case viewers start to get bored in the middle of one. Shorter videos make people want more and can snatch you a consistent viewer base.

FUTMobile,3d1cbl,nannerbots,3,Sun Jul 12 21:17:25 2015 UTC,Yes. He also has a strong link with Griezmann and a weak link with Lacazette
FUTMobile,3d1cbl,Boosterflex,0,Sun Jul 12 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"I think so, Benzema and Griezmann work well together, put Benzema on the left."
FUTMobile,3d1cbl,gimmethat____,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:34:51 2015 UTC,In my opinion Suarez would be a better pairing since griezman is more of a finess striker and Suarez can just bully his way to goal

FUTMobile,3cx0vx,iLikeFatChicks,2,Sat Jul 11 16:03:34 2015 UTC,I used to have the same problem with him. I used to play like a beast when I added a +5 or +10 pace card on him. I think the best thing is to add a chemistry style that adds some pace and also add a boost for team pace. All this just proves that this game is dictated by PACE.
FUTMobile,3cx0vx,DerpTagTheSlaya,2,Sat Jul 11 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"I think Defenders in this game (the AI defenders at least) are too strong which makes up for the fact that GKs this year are so useless. I'd like to see EA shift more power into the GKs and take some away from the defenders so that there's less reliance on pace and more focus on the other parts of the game such as shooting + longshots (I swear the only time that I can take a longshot without an AI defender blocking it is when there's a 15m semi-radius in front of me with no people), passing, and dribbling."
FUTMobile,3cx0vx,DerpTagTheSlaya,2,Sat Jul 11 15:15:44 2015 UTC,Also try winging and crossing the ball more as his headers are like TOTS Aubameyang. (99 pace)

I have an idea on how to get him to work but he requires a lot of attention and needs the Target Man tactic to work. If he ever gets inside the box, he'll pretty much finish everything as long as your shot isn't too powerful or too weak. His long shots are really good as well. I was 3/3 with him yesterday shooting outside the box"
FUTMobile,3cxnc5,Krishido,2,Sat Jul 11 18:20:49 2015 UTC,What would a reasonable price be?
FUTMobile,3cxnc5,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:30:02 2015 UTC,I'm guessing anywhere between 75k-170k? idk his price pretty very well
FUTMobile,3cxnc5,Kenya_West,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:15:12 2015 UTC,Get Aguero/costa at that point lmfao
FUTMobile,3cxnc5,Sneakerhead223,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:39:10 2015 UTC,I'll sell you my IF Diego Costa for 135k that's pretty cheap since others are buying at 175k-250k

FUTMobile,3cw9rg,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:46:01 2015 UTC,I had some videos before. And I've started fresh with Fifa only. And around 200 subs is not that much :|
FUTMobile,3cw9rg,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:47:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh OK, that makes sense. 200+ would've been a ton for 2 video clips. Keep them coming I like to see other mobile players."

FUTMobile,3cvyv2,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:36:48 2015 UTC,Haha. Yes. I figured to give it a go as I did not have the millions to buy him.   I opened about 250-300k worth of packs. I think about 70-80 packs. Maybe closer to 100. I can't really tell as I was selling contracts and fitness cards to feed buying more packs.

I don't have as much as hour asking, and don't want to take coins away from you. So I would suggest you keep trying to sell for the most you can get, if I end up making more coins, or the price ends up coming down naturally, then we can figure something out."

I guess j could try to flip it. But if the opened bid wasn't outbid even once then he is probably not even worth as much as I paid, so I'm stuck with it most likely.

FUTMobile,3ctsfg,bitchfaceronaldo,2,Fri Jul 10 18:40:35 2015 UTC,My pre-TOTY Thiago Silva has got you beat for goals. Do you rotate squads? 4000 games is a lot for one player.   http://imgur.com/XOV9k6y
FUTMobile,3ctsfg,nannerbots,2,Fri Jul 10 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"If he has 4k games played and less goals than your Thiago Silva, I'm guessing the majority of his GP are from simming, as defenders almost never score when you sim, even from corners"
FUTMobile,3ctsfg,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Fri Jul 10 19:30:04 2015 UTC,It seems like I always score from my corner kicks. I think most people drag the ball whereas I just tap a spot in the box

FUTMobile,3csiit,shell839,2,Fri Jul 10 15:48:23 2015 UTC,It's probably because all of the people who didn't pull any good players in their untradeable packs aren't posting because they don't have anything to post about. I for one haven't gotten many good players in untradeable packs
FUTMobile,3csiit,jamesberullo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:04:13 2015 UTC,Follow up question: What is the best player you guys have had to discard? It's a NIF Robben for me.

Here are the packs that I've opened:  FUTmas: 94 rare gold packs   Premier Cup: 134 rare player packs  Bundesliga TOTS (when the glitch started): 124 rare player packs  Liga BBVA TOTS: 102 rare player packs  Ligue 1 TOTS: 152 rare player packs  EA TOTS: 79 rare player packs  Stars and Stripes: 33 rare player packs  Copa Final: 104 rare player packs and counting  So I think it's little wonder that I've packed every player besides Messi and Ribery and I got a ton of duplicates along the way.

FUTMobile,3csiit,ukplaying,3,Fri Jul 10 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"nah,  you dont choose the glitch the glitch chooses you and then never leaves you(sorry but it has become my trademark line here). the glitch is that you can keep on winning the special tournament, currently the copa final and you get keep rewarded the same price everytime(50k pack and 7k). nobody has been able to deliberately simulate the conditions,  it just happens i got it a bit late after all tots are over,  but better late than never i suppose"

Zlatan is a rather strong tactical player, (mainly his IFs and TOTS) similar to Benteke. He won't be able to outpace fast CBs, but is physically strong and agile enough to dribble past them.  I personally wouldn't use his NIF in online games. There are better strike options at cheaper prices (TOTS Laca @ around 120-150k atm)."
FUTMobile,3ct95b,grimdercell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"I used Ibra with a front three of Ronaldo, Ibra, and Lucas and he dominated. I also used him in a 4-1-2-1-2 paired with TOTS Lacazette during the Ligue 1 tournament. He has played really well for me. He may have lost his five star skills, but I don't use skill moves on mobile so that doesn't affect me. On console (well PC anyways) he was my favorite player in FIFA 13, and since his dribbling and shooting are good in this game, he still works wonders for me.

FUTMobile,3co7jf,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:07:01 2015 UTC,No clue. I tried getting it to glitch during TOTS but out of nowhere it started glitching during the US tourney and now it's glitching for this one too.
FUTMobile,3co7jf,gimmethat____,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:54:28 2015 UTC,for me too as for ur question the cost effective one is to snipe on market while time effective is to open consumable packs.10 tournaments(40matches) will give you 70k therefore 23 packs each pack gives an average of 3gold  contracts so 69 gold contracts. ur 11 players need only 2 contracts each (38matches if no server error) so that is 22 contracts you can hoard or sell the remaining ones and/other remaining items. (assumption is made u want to spend most of ur time simming the tournament).

FUTMobile,3chi4h,lingmister,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"A cheaper alternative would be with Perez. 81 CM from Valencia. Quite beastly.   Edit. My issue actually is with the formation. 4-2-2-2 in FIFA 15 struggles. The CAMs play as wingers and really struggle with cutting back in from being too wide. I see that you have pacy CAMs but I feel that there are really huge gaps in the field. I actually prefer 4-4-2. Some how, at least for me, the midfield is tighter."

Coincidentally, this happened a day after i shared my FB replay videos and i got email when someone tried to reset my FB password.

FUTMobile,3ce82o,youngchild21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:19:19 2015 UTC,Fucking love that silver squad I'm going to try it right now.
FUTMobile,3ce82o,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:48:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I'm a bit late with my squad. I do believe this puts me in top position for your Gold Ultimate Squad, being rated 94 overall, 100 chemistry and no red links, putting me in a tie with /u/youngchild21, and winning that tiebreaker, having 4 different nations spread amongst 4 different leagues. I hope that it was worth the wait.  EDIT: It appears that the rating glitched out while making it, as the squad rating is now 95. I don't know what happened, but I like raising the bar for the minimum rating :)"
FUTMobile,3ce82o,youngchild21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:26:08 2015 UTC,"Not too late, you have until Friday. Looks awesome though, 195 is what I'm hoping to see I could never muster more than 194 with or without the glitch.   From my experience with the ratings glitch it works like this. When you log on it will be the higher number, and remain that way unless you switch any players around. When you switch someone it drops to the lower number, I have no idea why though."
FUTMobile,3ce82o,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:49:07 2015 UTC,"Well, even if it is 194, I still have 4 leagues (BPL, Ligue 1, La Liga and Bundesliga) and 4 nations (Belgium, Argentina, Brazil, Germany)  EDIT: Not gonna lie, I'm real sad about the lack of midfielders Brazil has created. Like really? You can make Neymar and Marcelo and Naldo and Dani Alves and even FUCKING PELE but your highest rated midfielder when I'm making a hybrid is 85 IF Oscar? That is so shitty"
FUTMobile,3ce82o,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"I used to have a squad a friend made me called 5kuntsCincoLigo I couldn't use cunts the game wouldn't let me. 5 nation 5 league no reds, but that was with non inform cards. Just a couple players with informs would have made this all so easy. Xavi Alonso, Javi Martinez would have been the ultimate though. Then you could have a 3 atb with Ramos and Boateng.  We will see how your squad holds up, still a lot of time left."
FUTMobile,3ce82o,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I had the same problem with some of my higher rated squads, but none of the below 90 rated ones had the problem."

FUTMobile,3cdw5y,Forza_Milan_,2,Tue Jul 7 03:51:12 2015 UTC,Ahh he used to be pretty expensive for a non rare a while back. Because of his link with Chikhaoui he'd sell for around 15-20k BIN. I'm not sure if he would still sell at around that price now though. i managed to buy one for 8k.

FUTMobile,3cdkn7,Forza_Milan_,2,Tue Jul 7 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"For the clue for the CAM, I thought he meant the players name started and ended with the same letter, hence Nainggolan"
FUTMobile,3cdkn7,KSearle21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:04:10 2015 UTC,Ahh i can see why you would think that. The first player that came to mind for me was Paul Pogba. I was also thinking that this team would be 100 chem. therefore tevez/icardi would be off by like 2/3 chem
FUTMobile,3cdidw,Wogboy1,3,Tue Jul 7 01:48:11 2015 UTC,He's not that cheap right now. I bought him for 93k last night just after the lucky 100k packs expired and it was the lowest price by at least 20k iirc

The last giveaways you could only win once, which sucked for someone who won a 12k prize in the first round and didn't even get a chance at bigger prizes. This was the change I made. Did I expect to have someone win 3 or 4 times, no, not with 81 entries, but shit happens and I'll learn from it.

It'd be nice to have gotten some more players, but I got what I set out to get, and hope to perhaps play with a TOTY Hazard in the near future (cause lets be honest unless he royally fucks up in the 1st half of the premier league season he's a lock at the rate he's going)"
FUTMobile,3c9mob,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Mon Jul 6 05:09:01 2015 UTC,"I'm satisfied with the way my club stands right now. Managed to get very cheap/semi-cheap TOTS that were out. I wish that i could have gotten players like Ibra, Neymar, Suarez, Lewandowski, Messi, and Aguero but their prices were too high for me. I'm saving up coins now for the MLS All Stars and I'll maybe get one or two of the Futtie players, especially if Eriksen gets one."
FUTMobile,3c9mob,Forza_Milan_,2,Mon Jul 6 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"Speaking of FUTTIES, the only two I'd be looking forward to getting would be Gundogan and Quaresma, for my Bundesliga and Portugal national team, respectively."
FUTMobile,3c9mob,Forza_Milan_,2,Mon Jul 6 04:34:17 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to Gundogan as well. I think i might skip over Quaresma as i have his IF and i enjoy using that card. Maybe Sirigu as well if his price is low.
FUTMobile,3c9mob,pellias,3,Mon Jul 6 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that people trying to pack Rooney, Toure, Bale, and Reus will sell other players like Gundogan, Quaresma, and Eriksen for cheap."

I started Fut in 2013/14 season and gave up to Diablo after the new year or so. Now I can say i completed Fut 2014/15. I did so much better than i set out to be.  I've gotten almost every TOTY except Neuer, Robben, Messi and Ronaldo. I've played most worthy TOTS except Suarez, Ibra, Messi. I've played all good players >87. Bale, Neymar, Ibra, Aguero, Messi.  Its a good season. Come next season, I'll go PC version."

FUTMobile,3c8yhc,Danimalistic2782,3,Mon Jul 6 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"Took my daughter on this ride. I remember being scared of it when I was 13, she was excited and jumping around and she is 6. They had to pull her out of the ride to double check her height, she made by about 4mm. A ton of people were pointing and talking about her, she did better than half the adults I saw.   I have no proof of any kind for this, but I think she has to be one of the first 100 or so 6 year olds to ride it. She is in the 90th percentile for average height for her age, and still barely made the minimum requirement. So not very many kids her age would even be allowed on the ride. Then out of the small amount of kids able to ride, there would only be a small percentage that wouldn't be too scared to go on.   I swear j was squeezing her hand tighter than she was squeezing mine. Now she wants to ride it again, and go on even bigger rides....what did I get myself into."

FUTMobile,3c7w9n,DawnoftheSuarez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:26:09 2015 UTC,"Serie A is my league! How many coins do you have because TOTS Pogba is completely worth it.  I like Pirlo as much as the next guy but maybe get someone faster in there. NIF Marchisio wouldn't be a bad choice.  I see you don't have any wingers or LM or RM but if you do opt to add them, I suggest IF ElSha on LW and IF Candevra or Salah on RW. In my opinion, they all play better at LF or RF. If you were looking to buy ElSha I could sell mine to you at a discount, just let me know.  I have TOTS Tevez and he plays very well inside two wingers. Either way, I would not sell Higuain after yesterday because you'd probably lose alot  Also, if you can afford TOTS Florenzi, try him out. He's a great RB."

FUTMobile,3c6k6u,taiwanisacountry,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"It's either that, or they make us pay for the game, which they will never do because the pay to win system is superior for this game format as it ensures the most amount of people play the game (you need this for the transfer market to be functional)."
FUTMobile,3c6k6u,nyza,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Look at Hearthstone, a turn-based card game developed by Blizzard. Not only is it free to play. but its pay-to-win component isn't required to become an elite player. Heck, one of the most respected professional Hearthstone players, Trump, made it to the top ranks without paying a single penny.   Apart from being multi-platform, Hearthstone differs from FUT in two major ways. First, there is a flourishing professional gaming scene with weekly tournaments featuring Hearthstone celebrities, professional teams, big sponsors, and lots of money. This a great way to get tons of publicity, and promote a healthy, active community. Secondly, Hearthstone's pay-to-win component isn't even that unreasonably priced. Card packs, which each contain five cards with one definite rare card, can be bought en masse for $70 for 60 packs. My AP Statistics teacher, who is also a really good Hearthstone player, admits that he buys a lot of packs simply because they're relatively cheap and as a result more worth his time. If EA's pay-to-win system were more reasonably priced, I'd have no problem with it.   I also wrote up a proposal a while back for features that should be included in a viable FUT competitor, as EA basically has a monopoly on mobile soccer gaming. A link to that proposal can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Knbd0P3GMEmPNS_IiJEejzCg9LD1bFQE80aLFnZkAUY/edit?usp=sharing . I believe that some of these features, if included in FIFA 16, may make it a lot more worth playing.   Note: I haven't sent the proposal to any developers or companies yet, but I'm still thinking about doing so, especially since I have a lot more time during the summer. Furthermore, I believe in the capitalistic idea that competition is the best motivation for innovation, and FIFA could really use some of that. Thoughts?"

I have watched the silver market closely for something lime 4 or 5 months now and have not noticed that card to be one of the high priced sellers. I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure if he was more valuable he would have made his way onto my radar by now.  BTW, willing to sell my left but for motm Benedetto.

FUTMobile,3c5510,lingmister,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"My advice is to always check if the card looks Lome it has even a remote chance of being valuable, there are so many strange cards that are super high priced that wouldn't expect to be.   If you see any rare card, that the player is from an uncommon nation, that plays in a top 5 league, you are most likely looking at 2k or more, some can be 20 times that. As far as specific packed silvers I don't remember many off hand, I always hunted for informs and just picked up other knowledge on the journey.  Generic, is a Brazilian ST I believe, he is faceless and used to go for 70-100k. There is another faceless card (which I still don't own) from the Mexican league, he goes for over 1 million always, never seen him for less. I can't remember any of his info but if you search just the mexican league for cards over 1m, there will usually be 1 maybe 2 for sale.

FUTMobile,3c4y0b,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"Too late now, i bought like 30 reus cards for relatively cheap. If he even goes up by 5-7k ill make a pretty good profit.

FUTMobile,3c4y0b,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"The theory is simple those desirable cards in tots that were only in for 1 week, and more expensive the card the faster it will skyrocket so idk what is @450 k griezmann, auba maybe however  u could also invest in the good fbs there seem to be a scarcity in them(none in the tots) although i think some kind of price fixing is going on in some of them like eg. Rodriguez (Wolfsburg)"

I'm extremely experienced in trading his card, I had to have bought and sold 500 or more of them, however it ended badly. It also didn't end for a long time due to my stubbornness.

If you are using skill moves, counter attack is a perfect substitute for not having the through ball button, as the midfielders will play more through balls when you do a regular pass. The passes are made more accurate by the pass boost, and your forwards will more likely outpace the defenders on the counter because of the pace boost.   Here's the team: http://imgur.com/bPjKXN1"

Usually 3rd man release, or box overload.  4-1-2-1-2, the one with all central midfielder. I use this one when a squad I'm putting g together either has a weakness in the LM/RM/LW/RW positions, or they won't combine without making red links, its easier to find central players you can move positions around to fit the squad. With this formation I again use defense, midfield passing, and it is a must to use wing play to spread the players out more.  5hose are my favorites, but I'll play any formation. The boosts and tactics are almost ways the same for me. Defense and passing for the boosts. 3rd man, box overload, or wing play for the tactics."

FUTMobile,3c0w5d,Krishido,3,Fri Jul 3 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's better to analyze the elements of play separately from the elements of the replay. The criteria of technical skill, uniqueness, and creativity seems a bit hard to differentiate between each other and it seems very hard to judge what the rating boundaries are (e.g what's the difference between a 4 and a 5). I think it might be better to put in more specific categories such as:  Passing  - how well the player controls the ball and uses his teammates rather than make 1 man sprint runs    /10  Shooting - Did the person use swipe or the button? Did they put him some curve? Was it a ""lucky goal"" or a goal purely based on skill? Does the shot look cool? /10  Dribbling + Skill Moves -How good was the player at maneuvering around players and using skill moves? Does it look fancy? Do they use a variety of skill moves rather than just the normal lane change and step over? Do they use harder-to-use skills?   /10  Cleanliness of the play -Did it seem forced or was it natural? Was the play enhanced/helped by some glitches/unfortunate events by the AI (e.g ball bouncing off the keeper)                          /10  Entertainment -Did the play make you impressed? Was it really fancy? Did it make you go ""Ohhhhhh""? Did it look cool? /10  Overall format/editing -Did they do extra editing to make it look better? Was the replay recorded using just an external camera or with internal software? Does the whole thing look appealing? Can you see the replay clearly?  /10  All of this adds up to 60 points total. Now you don't have to use all of these to determine a winner as some fantastic replays may not have some of these elements (e.g Nyza's nutmeg didnt have shooting in it but it was still really nice). What you could do is maybe take the top 2 or top 3 scores from the 6 and as well as the lowest one and then average them altogether. Highest average wins. I think this rewards replays with really high ""Highs"" in their replay as well as relatively high ""lows"". It awards the replay with the overall best quality.  Just an idea :)"
FUTMobile,3c0w5d,Forza_Milan_,3,Sat Jul 4 04:34:59 2015 UTC,I feel as thought the editing part of it shouldn't really count. It should just mainly be judged on the goal. I feel as though there might be a few people who upload goals that don't have the best quality but score a creative/banger of a goal. Just my opinion though.
FUTMobile,3c0w5d,Krishido,2,Sat Jul 4 04:59:03 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for all of the input! I really like the proposed criteria, and I want to incorporate some of it in the final criteria, so I'm gonna give you some feedback and we can go from there--I would love input from everyone here, as I want the criteria to be balanced and fair.    Passing, Shooting, Dribbling.    These may not apply to all replays (i.e. some replays may just be a bunch of skill moves pulled off really nicely without an emphasis on shooting for example), so I wouldn't want to concentrate too much on them, as it may deter people from posting replays if they don't have these aspects. I think having a general category for all of these technical skills would be a better approach--i.e. so we can judge the overall technical ability (whether it be passing, shooting, or dribbling or a mix of some but not all) into this category. This helps ensure that we can still judge replays that don't include one of these skills. Of course, another solution would be the one you proposed (taking the top 3 scores from the 6), but I think this can get very messy, as the average scores for a given replay would not be composed of the same components as all of the others (so it wouldn't be standardized). It's best if everyone is judged on the same criteria, to avoid potential scoring bias (i.e. systematic inflation of one criterion). What do you think?    Entertainment and cleanliness of play   I really like these two, and I would like to implement them in the scoring. Could we group them under the already existing categories, or should they remain separate? I don't think cleanliness of play should be a stand-alone category. Would it fit better under Technical skill?    Overall format/editing   I see where you are coming from here, but I think that this wouldn't be fair to all users, as we are all using different devices and have different abilities with editing and photoshop etc. Also, iOS users are at an inherent disadvantage because it's much harder to record your screen than on Android. I wanted to keep the scoring criteria free from any formatting constraints to encourage more people to just post their replays and get creative without being deterred about having to worry about editing and touching it up. Hopefully this makes sense.   So far this is what the criteria is looking like:    Technical skill (/10): judged on the difficulty of relevant technical aspects displayed (passing, shooting, dribbling, etc), as well as smoothness of play  Creativity (/10): judged on how original the play is  Entertainment value (/10): judged on how appealing or ""beautiful"" the play is    Let me know what you guys think!"
FUTMobile,3c0w5d,kev11111,2,Sat Jul 4 05:00:57 2015 UTC,"Ok let's see:  1st point about technical skills: I agree with you here. The more I think about it, having just 1 category for skills seems more appropriate since some replays may not have a few of those aspects. 1 criterion for it is good :)  2nd point on entertainment and cleanliness of play: I think that entertainment should be a category on it's own. One of the biggest  reasons to upload replays in general is because it's enjoyable to watch and at times it's also humourous as well. It should probably be a category on it's own so yes, entertainment and cleanliness should be separate. As for cleanliness, it should go under technical skill as well. The smoothness of a play really reflects on your skills in game imo. The only problem I have with this is that for 1 criterion of Technical Skill, there are so many sub-criteria under it. Should it possibly be weighed a bit more than others? (e.g out of 12 or 13 maybe?). What do you think?  3rd point on overall formatting/editing: Yeah, I agree with the formatting points. I do think it's fair that formatting shouldn't be a part of the scoring. The editing though, I think there should be a category that rewards people who are willing to put in the skill/effort to make the replay standout/more appealing. I thinking more in terms of it being a ""bonus"" category of up to 2-3 points. Those who did some editing could get a score out of 2 or 3 and it acts as kind of a ""mark booster"" or ""score booster"" for those who maybe don't have as much skill or creativity. For those who don't have any editing, it shouldn't affect their scores at all as it is a bonus. But then again, the main purpose of is to enhance it's appeal and add to the entertainment value. I only proposed this bonus category because as you said, editing shouldn't really be a part of the main scoring. What are your thoughts on this?  So for now, here is my ""slightly changed"" scoring criteria proposal:   Technical Skill (/12-13). Reasoning: many sub-criteria under this 1 main criterion. Should probably increase the overall scoring of it. Creativity (/10). Nothing really changed here Entertainment Value (/10). Nothing changed here either NEW: Bonus for editing (/2-3): rewards efforts of people who are willing to go the extra mile"
FUTMobile,3c0w5d,Modern_Drummer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"I like your changes, very thoughtful and they make sense. We can make it out of 35 by having technical skill out of 13, and then the bonus for editing out of 2.   So here's the criteria so far:   Technical Skill (/13) Creativity (/10) Entertainment Value (/10) Bonus: production quality/editing (/2).   Does anyone else have any other feedback? If not, I think we're good to go! thanks for all the input man :)"

A-z screen recorder IMO is a little better but to use all the features it is like  2 or 3 dollars. You may be fine with the free version I don't remember exactly what features it limited.

If memory serves me correct tho, there wasn't a full team there - I'd already completed the tournament and had started selling the team off...

FUTMobile,3bywp2,ukplaying,2,Fri Jul 3 07:49:59 2015 UTC,Messi is amazing everywhere. I'd suggest getting his TOTS and playing him at RF in the 4-3-2-1.

FUTMobile,3bxajm,donkeyramp,3,Thu Jul 2 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"Play the games. Focus on passing and maintaining possession and scoring goals at the right time. Doesnt matter how many shots on target you have as long as you have a well timed goal. After scoring a goal, put 5 in the back and play defensively for the rest of the game. If you have any pacey player, regardless of whether hes a defender or midfielder, put him as a striker in a 2 striker formation. You dont neces sarily have to score with him, just have him bring the ball up the field and feed it to your other striker. Plus, most bronze players have shitty shooting anyways so it shouldnt matter that much. Lemme know if you have any questions.Good luck!"
FUTMobile,3bxajm,oompaloompafifa,2,Thu Jul 2 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"I am almost positive you have to play it. I didn't beat it until 2 or so months ago. I think it was when the market was down. By far the hardest tournament, and I was using a very good squad, probably about as good as was possible at the time. I almost beat the ultimate cup with the same squad, made the finals about 5 times, all losses though.  When I beat the bronze tourney I had the best draw of the dozens of previous attempts. Normally you will face multiple teams that are rated quite a bit higher than yours. The first time I beat it, I faced zero higher, only squads equally rated or lower. That was probably the main reason I won it.  I've since beat it a handful of times, but I have stupid good bronze squads now its not really fair.  Follow oompa's advice about quality chances. I believe every game in my first win was 1-0 or 1-1 with a win in penalties. I never used 5 ATB, but it seems lime a smart move. Dominate possession, pass it around and wait patiently for an opportunity. You will get it, just keep plugging away."

Nothing spectacular, but I packed an inform muller I believe it was. I didn't know how anything worked, I watched the 4 or 5 on the market at 650k or so, none of them sold in the 25 minutes I watched, so in order to sell it fast I listed it for 300k or something stupid low like that. I swear it disappeared before I took my thumb off the sell button. That was my first lesson learned about informs. But I took that and with the points I bought I had most of the top rated non informs, minus Messi/Ronaldo. When 15 came out I sold them all for 1k or less each. Then took all the coins and bought over priced crap intentionally to give the coins away. Then deleted the game and never looked back. If I knew then what that stuff was worth I would've handled it different, oh well."

FUTMobile,3bufyi,Skiffbug,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:32:14 2015 UTC,"This is the general trading method that works for ANY amount of coins or budget you may have: Find a popular player that sells for under your budget, identify his low BIN, and BIN snipe or open BID his cards for 20-30% less than the lowest BIN. Sell at or slightly above the lowest BIN. If not selling, undercut the lowest BIN by a little bit.   As you gain more coins you can either go for more expensive players (higher payoff but more time consuming as there won't be many good deals) or you can continue trading with a core group of cheap players that you are comfortable with (will be faster and will give you a steady profit as you can mass bid because there will be lots of these cheap players on the market)."

FUTMobile,3bufyi,Skiffbug,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:32:56 2015 UTC,"There is a method called bottom feeding.  Basically, you set the filter from 150 to 200 and you bid on every player that comes up, just as long as it is less than 300 for NIF and 600 for IF.  You can then either quick sell them (NIF sells for 300 and IF sells for 600) for a quick profit, or set the prices somewhat higher, but not too much higher.  It takes a bit of work, but it's a guaranteed way of making money. You can easily make another 10k with about 2h work doing this."

If what u say about almost none being on the market most of the time then it rules out price fixers as they usually keep atleast 1 on market at a much higher price(500k tona million maybe?)"

Did you notice if he had a chem card on him?? I put a finisher card on him when I bought him due to his lack of pace... Anyway, maybe yr right, but I only bought him 3-4 weeks ago and there were literally hundreds on the market, some as low as 12 or 12.5k BIN... guess we'll never know, kinda strange though. And if I had packed him I'd be glad to get something back off him, even only 20k, but maybe for the sake of 20k theyd rather have a nice bit of colour in their squad, who knows lol"

I have tried many different players with different cards and after obderving them closely, without doubt, I am now a 100% firm believer that chem cards do influence a players playing style... check it out, see for yourself and make your own judgement :)"

FUTMobile,3bkgvr,nyza,3,Mon Jun 29 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"I was doing all kinds of things for a while with a lot of success. I don't know the current prices, but I'm sure the patterns should be similar, just adjust the prices I'm giving as examples to the current market value.   +15 pace cards I could find as low as 400-500, but usually 800-1200. I could then sell easily for 1800.   +10 to all attribute player training cards fluctuate a lot throuout the week, but I would find them from 250-1200, and sell them from 1800-3400, I think mega packs, and tournaments are the main factor of the swings.   +6 to all I would again find all over the pricing map so to say, 150-600 is where I would buy, I would then sell for 950-1200 some times they would creep up to 1500, I think tournaments with good rewards is what drives the price up on them as people are trying to boost for the finals or what have you.  Then player contracts, j only dealt with the rare gold ones, selling from 90p-1300, buying usually around 650, they come in bunches around the 1 hour mark as people unload a lot at a time. You just need to keep specific search parameters and then hover around the correct page numbers, and be ready to pounce when they start popping up. If you hit buy on one and it says sorry your bid wasn't high enough or whatever that message says, make sure to then skip at least one or two after that, don't buy the very next one or you will get the message again and again. If you skip ahead you can gain control of the pace ahead of the other bidders. Hopefully that makes sense, it does in my head, but that doesn't mean much.  Gold squad fitness cards j would sell between 700-1100, buying below 450 only.  The only other ones I traded with I o my dabbled in so I do t know too much about. Mainly player training cards, +15 only, and only passing, shooting, and defending. Those were the only ones besides pace which j already mentioned, which I had any success with at all.  TL/DR is badly needed here, but I can't make it any shorter and still have value in my fucked up head."

FUTMobile,3bj6de,ukplaying,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:58:54 2015 UTC,No i have a bunch of contracts and fitness. I need more coins to fund potential future competitions like the last one
FUTMobile,3bj6de,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"well  prices will shoot up after pink cards are dealt with, so that will mean a wait of 17 days,  a better plan might be to give these cards one by one in your giveaways  till then (actually  just 2 if you intend to do 1 weekly)  and then sell them  1 each week and idk give half of it for those weeks giveaways(most of these ones will reach 150k to 1m plus) this should sustain you for around 1.5 to 2 months"
FUTMobile,3bj6de,Toobuckchuk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good plan, although i was planning on waiting until after dan's giveaway to do the second competition. We'll see how it goes"

If you do yours it will keep people busy. I'm not trying to the you what to do though, just saying don't worry about affecting me in any way, it's all good as far as I'm concerned."
FUTMobile,3bj6de,messimerizing,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:50:50 2015 UTC,"With little reason for people to buy packs once EASFC TOTS are over, it seems logical that prices are only going to keep going up as people look to spend their coins over the last 2 months."
FUTMobile,3bj6de,messimerizing,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"theres plenty of reasons to open packs on the horizon: the Copa America MOTM's; MLS TOTS; Pink Futties etc; dude we're dealing with EA here, theyll never stop milking this cash cow..."
FUTMobile,3bj6de,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:03:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, MLS TOTS and Copa America MOTMs won't be all that exciting compared to what we saw in BPL TOTS(when NIF Ronaldo went sub 700k)"

FUTMobile,3bhwtx,pellias,2,Mon Jun 29 11:52:27 2015 UTC,"Not anymore. Somebody from this beloved subreddit saw OPs post and decided to lower prices, thus leading to undercutting. Lowest BIN right now is 325k or so ."
FUTMobile,3bhwtx,messimerizing,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:55:28 2015 UTC,"er, his lowest now is 650k and not selling(might be someone on this sub though), he might have become rare but as none seems to have bought him for anywhere near 1m i doubt his price has skyrocketed, u seem to have posted this surprisingly quickly for a 1 hour auction though, if it was a 3hr auction and a bargain it should have been snipped up by now. nyway if u have 650k u may buy him, i guess or fight in the open bids which have so far not crossed 100k"

FUTMobile,3bgv4x,unitedpugs,2,Mon Jun 29 04:06:56 2015 UTC,Once again supporting my argument that the stats of players in this game mean absolutely nothing.
FUTMobile,3bgv4x,treefitty350,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:20:36 2015 UTC,"I don't care the minor stats, but i do care about the big 6."

This game is fairly shittily made for such a huge developing company, the game play is a joke, If you take a longshot with any player wide open they go in almost every time for me. Their cards mean nothing. Regular Dani Alves constantly keeps up with TOTY Ronaldo for me, which is why I don't play this game anymore."

I was buying between 60-70 each, when he hit his first crash. He dipped all the way to 30k, I didn't sell, be came back up to 55k, I didn't sell. He then fell back to 30 and I finally gave up and sold my 40 cards for about a 1.2 million loss before tax. Not sure what he sells for now, I never bought another one of his cards and refuse to even look up his price ever since. It was one of my most important lessons though, it ended up helping me make more than I lost later on."

I'm actually at just above 600k, within striking distance of TOTS Hazard. My hope is I can catch him at a low point and snag him. I saw him once today at a 595k BIN, but I didn't have the coins yet. Since I had already made plans to hybridize, and just bought TOTS Naldo at near discard, I think I might sell my IF Lloris to put me over the top, and spend the time until the new FIFA grinding for TOTS Marquinhos, TOTS Diego Alves and IF Oscar to finish my hybrid squad, which would look like this EDIT: what would also help is if anyone wants the CAM Bolasie (to use as ST really), I have one listed for a 17.5k BIN with no contracts remaining. Currently lowest on market and I will relist until I pass out. Currently 2 am here"

FUTMobile,3ba06s,chitowncrazykidd,2,Sat Jun 27 05:16:09 2015 UTC,"Last i checked, thats what his TOTS went for"
FUTMobile,3ba06s,Kenya_West,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but his IF is a CAM, so you can play him as a 10 chem ST"
FUTMobile,3ba06s,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"Who cares about that? LF at Striker on 7 chem is good enough, and his TOTS has SO MUCH BETTER STATS, it;s not even a joke."
FUTMobile,3ba06s,vaow93,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:28:14 2015 UTC,"I know, but pre TOTS his CAM card was so pricey because of that"

AND USE SKILL MOVES MAN. They'll up your game 10 times, and you'll be able to ""make things happen"" with ease once you get the hang of 'em."

FUTMobile,3b7r2w,dangerdgm1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"I could do something like that, but would punishments/rewards be in-game or irl? Another concern would be the means of getting the packs, as I would likely have to buy coins or FIFA Points to do them"
FUTMobile,3b7r2w,doctoruranus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"Possibly. I'd also need another person to ply with, and they would need to record"

FUTMobile,3b6lsr,lingmister,2,Fri Jun 26 11:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say switch the Ligue 1 and La liga sides. Put Ligue 1 on the right and La Liga on the left, then use SIF Aurier/TOTS Marquinhos as RB, and NIF Alba, NIF Marcelo or TOTS Marcelo as LB."
FUTMobile,3b6lsr,vaow93,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:47:45 2015 UTC,Personally i can't get Griezmann to work well on the left despite his left foot. So I moved him to the right.
FUTMobile,3b6lsr,vaow93,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:26:13 2015 UTC,"Griezmann is a hit and miss for me. Scores 4-5 goals in ONE game on world class against good opposition, then stops scoring, or scores only 1 goal, for one or two games. Repeat. I found him most effective as an outright single ST in the 4-3-2-1, with NIF Ronaldo on the left and NIF Messi at RF."
FUTMobile,3b6lsr,anilkuj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:32:23 2015 UTC,Griezmann and him have similar stats. But the PHY really makes a difference. I now look for fast but PHY players.   Goodby Aubey.

FUTMobile,3b4mav,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Thu Jun 25 22:46:13 2015 UTC,I'd watch! I love me some gameplay vids
FUTMobile,3b4mav,ninjapotato59,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:14:28 2015 UTC,If people submitted/gave their videos to you or Dan for a community channel that'd be pretty cool. I think if we used Dan's it'd be better since he already has gameplay and subscribers. Then again if he wants it to stay as a personal channel you can create one for us.
FUTMobile,3b4mav,nannerbots,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:03:43 2015 UTC,"I meant uploading my own content, and if people would be interested in watching it. An idea could be for me to do some sort of video featuring good goals, bs stuff in game et cetera, almost like a viewer submitted highlights video that you guys could submit highlights to. Can't speak for what Dan would like to do for his channel"
FUTMobile,3b4mav,Danimalistic2782,4,Thu Jun 25 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"I would love to see any kind of gameplay. Thanks for doing this, I can't wait. The only reason I uploaded any at all was to inspire someone else to do it better, I'm not very good at the game, and my style of play is boring. No skill moves and low scoring games are not good to watch. Or whatever reason I really took a liking to doing it though, now I can't stop posting shit, even if no one watches I'm going to keep posting.  Let us know when you put something up I'll be an immediate viewer/subscriber."
FUTMobile,3b4mav,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:17:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best either. If I can get some viewers, I hope to make it more so on funny(ish) commentary and editing, and less on me beating the shit out of the other team because I'm so sick at the game. You also have the handicap of playing with bronzes"
FUTMobile,3b4mav,imarios,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:28:17 2015 UTC,"I wish that were the case. I think I play decently on the defensive end, its extremely rare for me to ever give up 2 goals. Offensively though I suck, no matter what squad I use. I actually win just as much or more with a silver, or bronze squad than I do a gold squad."
FUTMobile,3b4mav,imarios,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:48:59 2015 UTC,I'm planning to do the same. I have some questions for you: - What you are using Android or iOS (phone/tablet) - What screen recorder  I want to record online games against other people.

FUTMobile,3b4p7q,kev11111,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:59:54 2015 UTC,Tradeables. I may open 1m more if the first 3m net me a huge profit.

FUTMobile,3b4fnu,iLikeFatChicks,2,Thu Jun 25 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"I did it like 3 or 4 days after the game was released, as soon as I could afford to. I remember being all excited, and then equally disappointed. Still, even knowing what I know now, there is no chance I could ever resist opening them again if I had the opportunity. So my bad advice to you is, fuck yeah open them up right now!"
FUTMobile,3b4fnu,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"its meant as a means to get u started on a gold team for cheap, however its supposed to be bought by fifa points, not coins, if u nptice the coins points ratio is drastically different for that pack."

FUTMobile,3b2lyf,strikerhawkins,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure my advice has real merit, I'm just a chemistry freak. I would put hazard back on the left and Sanchez on the right. I would even get a RW version of him but that's my OCD kicking in. Inform RM Cazorla, and get motm Toure to put in the middle. Again, I seriously have a problem, I just have to have players in their proper positions. I know it really doesn't matter that much, so if this is what works best for you then by all means go for it."

FUTMobile,3b2im0,hobohawk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:14:20 2015 UTC,"I believe this happened because people were not opening as many packs when tots Marchisio was released in tots mc gold as when Pogba was released in the combined serie a ligue 1 tots.

FUTMobile,3b0vm2,DevilxAce,2,Thu Jun 25 06:05:13 2015 UTC,Congrats! Schurrle isn't even one of the more expensive players tho

Theyre computer programs/scripts which can search the whole market in milliseconds, thats why there's no beating them... If you put the better special cards at extremely low prices, theyre gonna get snapped up without a doubt imho... For example, I made a mistake the other day with TOTS Depay, he was at 215 BIN minimum at the time and I put him up, by accident, for 75k BIN, he was sold within a couple seconds :( that was 75k, so you can imagine its going to be the same if you're putting top cards up at that price, most special cards would go at that price as the Gold ones sell for more than 7k quick-sale..."

It will probably be any team with 100 chem, with similar rewards to the other tournaments, with 7k coins and an untradeable 50k pack as rewards. What would be interesting was if they gave out the untradeable pack as a 100k pack because it's the last TOTS, and possibly increased coin rewards? I don't think it will happen, but it would be nice just as a reward because TOTS is almost over"

FUTMobile,3b14su,Krishido,2,Thu Jun 25 04:10:08 2015 UTC,Never rely on packs as your source of money. I've wasted 5m on 100k packs at the beginning of tots and got nothing...there's a very very very low chance that you'll get a return on investment when you buy packs. You're better off trading.

FUTMobile,3b14su,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:28:53 2015 UTC,budget is currently 23K.  Issue is. packs that we get from featured tournaments are not tradeable.
FUTMobile,3b14su,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"I didnt realise u wanted a tots only for trading, and how are u going to buy a 50k pack with 23k,nyway chances are pretty low for pulling a tots this week, and if u just want a tots tgere are many sub 20k ones just check out the gold ones in non popular leagues or the low pace ones in the popular ones, in fact i think even the pacey ones bolasie, gradel are going at that rate."
FUTMobile,3b14su,kev11111,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:28:03 2015 UTC,"If you want the players, you have better odds of trading your way to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of coins by Saturday than you do of packing a 90+ TOTS, even with an increased odds 50k or 100k pack. While there is the possibility of packing a blue, remember that no matter of you open 1 pack or 100 packs, in each one you have the same chance of packing a blue as any other, and opening more only increases your chances because of the increased number of trials, not because the game sees you have opened more packs and deserve a good player for doing so. It's called the gamblers fallacy, the idea that a string of negative outcomes means a positive will happen, or vice versa. If I am going to flip a coin 5 times, I have a 1/32 chance of flipping 5 heads. It is important to remember that this is the same odds I have of flipping any other sequence of heads or tails, and there is nothing special about it, it is 1 of 32 possible outcomes, each equally likely. However, if I flip 4 heads in a row, my odds of flipping a 5th head remain 1/2, not 1/32, because what happened previously has no impact on the current trial. Because of the incredibly small card weight due to such high ratings, it is highly unlikely you will pull any blues at all with a limited amount of coins, as you won't be able to beat the odds that are packs, and it would be far more worthwhile to recognize this and use time to trade for the coins to buy 1 of them"

FUTMobile,3b0mm3,nannerbots,0,Thu Jun 25 10:47:06 2015 UTC,"It's hard for me to conceptualize this, but it doesn't matter what price you bought him at before since the only value that matters is what the player is worth on the market. If you paid 5 mil for Pogba, he's still only worth 440K. If you sell for 440K, buy another for 240K, and then sell that one for 440K, you will have 440K (minus tax) plus 440K (minus tax) minus 240K. Basically, if you sell Poggers now and make a profit while trading with his cards, you will have made a profit. He is only worth the current market price, and what you bought him for before has no influence on his value, except if it's personal. For example, I bought SIF Benzema for 1.3 mil when he first came out. I refuse to sell him because there is a personal attachment there. He is no longer worth 1.3 mil to anyone but me. So if I sell him (which I will never do), I can still increase my current coin total by buying another card for a lower price. I hope I did a decent job explaining this, if not let me know.  Edit: TLDR - yes"

FUTMobile,3ayi6f,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:29:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah my favorite is a-z screen recorder, its available in the play store. In order to use all the features you have to buy the full version for like 2 or 3 dollars. The other one I have is completely free to use, but they do ask if you are happy with it to donate $2 but it is your choice. It is called, Unlimited Screen Recorder. Also available in the play store. I'm sure by now there are dozens, these are just the 2 I have experience with.  My techy friend always roots his phones. He is really good at his job which is too technological for me to understand, but he says nits completely safe to root your phone if done correctly. The problem comes if you damage your phone or something it will not be covered by your warranty and most likely the phone company won't even touch it. If you back everything up beforehand, I guess you can reinstall it and unroot the phone to avoid this if it needs in servicing. Assuming that the phone is 8n good enough working order to perform this task, if not then you're fucked. Rare chance of this happening, but it does pose some risk so its something to consider.   Apparently its necessary to download a firewall and other security measures as well when rooting your phone."

FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Thebig1two,0,Tue Jun 23 23:27:54 2015 UTC,May as well discard for 700 coins. He's by far the worst 86+ rated player (along with Falcao)
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Tyson_Wilkins,3,Wed Jun 24 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here but I enjoyed van Persie. He's still behind Costa, Aguero, Remy, and Zarate in terms of Premier League strikers, but he does the job for me. What didn't you like about him?"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,nannerbots,2,Wed Jun 24 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"He feels clunky. He doesn't have fabulous pace for a striker, but he has bad agility and balance because of his size, so it feels like I have Pirlo up front. Even though he's petty tall, he isn't the best for headers, and can be muscled off the ball pretty easily. His main stay is his shooting, and even though it's decent, it doesn't nearly make up for his other attributes, and even then he has good finishing, not long shots, and barring a colossal defensive error RVP is never getting a clean shot in the box for that finishing to matter"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Wed Jun 24 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"Normally I prefer to make runs with my strikers, but when I use RVP I'm forced to run with my attackers. I've managed 22 goals in 27 games with him, which is my worst ratio for any of my strikers. I'm going to try him in this squad and make a final verdict:  http://imgur.com/iI4VNw7"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,nannerbots,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:22:01 2015 UTC,God damn that's a sick squad. There's no way that RVP is even going to touch the ball in that formation. He'll just hold the ball in the midfield and chip through balls over the top to Sanchez and Depay
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:28 2015 UTC,That team was so bad. Van Persie had two goals in three games ( one pen and one rebound ) but he was by far the worst player. Depay was disappointing and Sanchez seemed out of place even though usually he's great for me. Wijnaldum is a revelation. He was so good. I think I'll put him at striker and use SIF Sneijder. Van Persie is really bad
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,nannerbots,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"Wijnaldum is a sick player. I feel like a lot of skilled players get wasted by playing as wingers in this game, because they always ply very wide and try to pass the ball into the middle, hence why Wijnaldum was so good: he'd just get fed the ball in space by Depay. Try Depay and Sanchez either as a RF/LF pair in the 4321 or as 7 chem strikers. Try this squad to get more use of Sanchez and Depay. You can play Wijnaldum in the middle if you want, just that puts Van Beek on 6 chem (7 with loyalty) because Guardado is Mexican, and since silver TOTS are nearly extict/expensive as hell, you can also play TOTS De Vrij at a fraction of the price on 6 chem as well"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yessssss!!! I was struggling to think of a decent team/formation to play those dutch TOTS I packed apart from a 3-5-2, (which I dont like). Plus I also have all the other players so will be replicating this later... +1 for you also ;)"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,kev11111,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"Try to avoid van Persie, he wasn't as good as I remembered him being in October. Probably because I've been spoiled with all of these TOTS"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,nannerbots,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:10:21 2015 UTC,"I actually thought that... when I first played with him last November he seemed better than when I next, (and last), played with him a cpl months ago... strange... Trouble is, theres not too many other good dutch forwards in the BPL, or anywhere else for that matter... Huntelaars ok, so is TOTS De Jong but neither are exactly world class... may try Locadia there, he's quite OP for a silver... actually, does the CF in that formation even need to be Dutch?? wouldnt they all still be on max chem anyway??"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,kev11111,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:59:59 2015 UTC,"To answer my own question, yes they are still all on max chem apart from De Gea for some reason... few slight changes... I'm using Fonte instead of Koscielney, matic at CDM, Fabregas at CM, Costa at CF; fingers crossed"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,kev11111,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:13:08 2015 UTC,The CF doesn't have to be Dutch if they have strong link to RCM and RW. I tried Wijnaldum at CF and he was pretty good. I put Sneijder at  LCM.

FUTMobile,3aw1tp,kev11111,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:58:17 2015 UTC,"Falcao/Van persie really excel in two striker formations, as they are both good for hold up play. Btw I have used Falcao next to rg Aguero, and Falcao played better than him."
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Hijodeputa811,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:37:22 2015 UTC,"They may play decent in hold-up for the actual hold, but when they need to make runs after their team catches up, they don't have the acceleration to get a step on defenders. My big thing is, say RVP has passed back to Juan Mata and starts to make a forward run for a lobbed through ball. He doesn't even make defenders turn and run to cover him. Guys like Kompany, Koscielny and Vertonghen can easily backpedal, staying between RVP and their net, and watch the pass and intercept. If you have Aguero making that run, the defender will win a header straight up 9 times out of 10, but his first 3 steps take him up to full speed, an the defender either has to step up and hope he's offside, or turn around and track man, not ball. This means you can play into open space and have Aguero chase it down with his blistering pace, rather than hope he or RVP can get body position on a defender and take down the pass, and get past the defender. It's way too hard to do on a regular basis"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously? I've used both RVP and Falcao in this squad and they had been BEASTS for me, often better than my Aguero-Costa partnership in my other squad. IMO the worst 86 rated player is Cavani, despite his decent stats"
FUTMobile,3aw1tp,ninjapotato59,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:27:12 2015 UTC,"Cavani's another one I didn't list. I just hate strikers who are slow, bulky, and unagile. Costa is quite good because even though he has great strength, it doesn't hold back his freedom of movement for me, and he can accelerate, make sharp turns and has a great shot."
FUTMobile,3axau3,chitowncrazykidd,2,Wed Jun 24 06:28:14 2015 UTC,"The silver market, as well as the bronze, is not as straight forward as the gold. Due to the fact that some are extremely rare, they can be nearly priceless. Also they can be extremely rare, but nearly impossible to sell unless you let it go for next to nothing. They really are worth what someone is willing to pay.  The card you have was not difficult for me to get at all, although if you are building a silver squad with mainly English players he is an important one. Problem is that he has a tots, and about 2 months ago another RM inform also english, came out which has better stats, so I wouldn't pay over 70k for him. I'm basing this purely off my experience with silver informs, I don't know what his price is currently on the market.  Edit: looked at image after I wrote that. Tots, 250k, not unreasonable, but not something you would easily flip for a big profit either."
FUTMobile,3axau3,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:03:06 2015 UTC,Oh okay.  I picked him up for 15k thinking I could sell him for a little more. So should I just throw him on the market for about 50k or so?
FUTMobile,3axau3,Danimalistic2782,2,Wed Jun 24 07:12:19 2015 UTC,If it is the tots version you should be able to get over 200k no problem. If it is the regular inform I would ask a minimum of 60k
FUTMobile,3axau3,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:20:37 2015 UTC,"Silver IF's/TOTS's are really screwy because there are so few of them, but not many people probably want them either (other than Dan). The most expensive Harry Kane card on the market isn't his gold 86 TOTS (which I packed and is awesome), its his 74 SIF silver card because nobody opens silver packs, and if you did you had similar odds of packing his SIF as you did of packing Ronaldo because that card would be so rare"

Once the EAFC TOTS is announced, people will want to have as many coins as possible to buy all the best players and will start searching for players in their club that they can sell. Then they'll see that they can only use Eremenko with Doumbia and Tosic and dump him off, causing his value to plummet."

FUTMobile,3at3hd,ninjapotato59,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:14:35 2015 UTC,"yeah its true, i got a kdb and a sanchez for 100k discount each when servers went down for 10minutes last week, this time i tried bidding on tots ibra and was on 1.1m but i closed the game half an hour before it shut down(was 6hr auction) as it was already half an hour late, they give you the time in advance but never do it at the xact time, more as a warning not to sell at open bids, but be warned its still not easy as bidding wars take place all over the place with even 5 hours remaining, kind of funny."

I tried to do that and after writing out what I wanted to say I try to hit send and nothing happens, it won't let me send anything at all. I tried 3 times today before I gave up I'll try again tomorrow though."

In any song whenever they sing the word you or other words that rhyme with it, change it to dudes. It goes well with this song.  But that song is never gonna run around and desert dudes.

Danilo was a non performer though probably cos his chem is 7.   In terms a big gap in the middle, I did not feel that was too much as James is box to box. But I did get caught out at times with long lob balls as my defense tends to push up a lot.   Im planning to try Tello on RW and a Spanish RB. Will let you know how it goes."

I had those points transferred to 15m then a little while before toty I bought another $100. I got abwolutely shitnfrom that, especially the first 200 because I didn't know what to do with the players I got I didn't invest well at all from the coins made from selling the players.  I bought coins recently from a member of this sub, but I'm using those for the players I'm giving away, and also helped out a couple people who needed it. I am completely against coins selling and buying, it is what put us through the hell of not having a market for a month or so. The only coins I've ever bought were in the last month. Everything in my club came from trading, I hardly even play3d the game until the transfer market went down, I just traded about 30-36 hours a week."

Hulk,  totaly didnt xpect that at 280k.  5.la liga. this was a big let down, only approachable and op ones were james, griezmann and the fullbacks. neymar was a stretch, suarez was above rb ronaldo. james and griezmann were overshadowed by kdb and upcoming lacazette 6.bundes liga.only people of real intrest was kdb and boateng.aubameyang sent the pusles racing but turned out to be a one trick pony. muller and lewa did not excite me nor did the sized down totys  i think fewest of packs were opened for this. 7.tots mc. marcello and marchisso were nice appettisers and hazard would have made it very intersting 8rotw.depay and the gang were ok. 9alj/latam/football league. not my cup of tea but must have been very interesting for silver users."

I have some ways to determine whether it is the case though (won't reveal them here because then the people photoshopping would know what to avoid doing). Hopefully, everyone remains honest though, its pretty sad if you have to cheat to get 100k in a game, let alone a friendly competition where the money is supposed to be secondary to the competition itself."

FUTMobile,3anka8,ukplaying,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:43:57 2015 UTC,Could we solve this issue by making participants record their game play on video?
FUTMobile,3anka8,ukplaying,2,Mon Jun 22 04:59:58 2015 UTC,"That may be too excessive, both on the user's end, and on our end (for everyone, we would have to watch 10 games). Also, people on iOS can't record games because apple doesn't allow screen recorder apps :(  Hopefully, getting everyone to PM their results will mean that potential photoshoppers will not know what score they have to beat (this way they can't just wait until the very end of the competition and photoshop a score that is 1-2 points higher then the highest submitted score)."

FUTMobile,3anka8,yardiedeya,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:18:34 2015 UTC,"i c, but i am not sure if u understood my comment what i meant by annnouncing  at a time was giving a heads up like 12 or 24hrs, of course some wont be able to come at that time, but everyone will know about it(none will miss it completely) though its too late for this giveaway. nyway if you are looking for ideas ea fc tots is coming up u could do a prediction based giveaway u coud even make it a challenge plus giveaway page, where the guy/girl with best prediction gets the giveaway as well., i also advice charging a small fee like 10k per entry for certain giveaways, it will discourage false accounts and add whatever u got as entry fees to the giveaway pot(going by my wager thread many dont mind paying a small fee,  i guess much better chances and more fun than packs)"
FUTMobile,3anka8,oompaloompafifa,2,Mon Jun 22 07:44:04 2015 UTC,"the entry fee is not a bad idea actually! i like the idea of predicting the EAFC TOTS, is that coming up this wednesday?   In terms of the competition, i was thinking of doing some things based around in game skills and ability (like best replay awards, or highest score in a game, or goal difference like i am doing this week). We barely have competitions like this, so i think it'll be something enjoyable and interactive for everyone. Even if you don't end winning the prize, the goal is to have fun and to get better. Thanks for all of the input though, it's been really helpful.   As for the competition this week, I think announcing it ahead of time will not work, as it will still give people 12-24hrs to try to get the highest score. So they can play a bunch of tournaments, take screenshots of their best one, and then wait until ""the official time"" to post those screenshots. It would effectively be the same as the current format. If we do like a very quick heads up (i.e. i make an announcement that everyone has 1 hr to complete the task), then not everyone may be able to enter.   Although, I think a better solution would be to keep the task hidden, and get everyone to vote on a time that they can do the competition. When the time comes, I will announce the task, and people will have like an hour or something to finish it. This would actually be more intense and competitive I would think, as everyone would be doing it at the same time under a time limit. What do you think?"
FUTMobile,3anka8,oompaloompafifa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:52:17 2015 UTC,"when i said 12hr heads up i implied keeping the task hidden and annoumcing ""there will be a giveaway at""  nyway u got the point so thats ok, ea fc is expected this Wednesday but many things have not gone according to plan this tots, u could always add clauses to cancel it if things dont go according to plan and ur ideas seem good way better than pack openings(xept last 2 days i guess), another thing what is the ethical thing regarding attribute cards and app crashes, yeah its way better now but i still lose  a game a season because the game wont register it"
FUTMobile,3anka8,messimerizing,2,Mon Jun 22 08:12:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah makes sense. This wednesday is a little early, as i wanted to see how this giveaway will do in terms of turnout. We'll see what happens though"

FUTMobile,3alj1r,feverishbadger,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:26:26 2015 UTC,I've owned multiple versions of Messi and found that for my style (force my way through the defense) he is too small and easily knocked off the ball. TOTS James seems to be much stronger and scores just as well.

FUTMobile,3am3vg,chitowncrazykidd,3,Sun Jun 21 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"He's quick, he's fast, and he's got pace, but his finishing was a let down for me. I had him at LW in a 4-3-3 with TOTS Wijnaldum and Willems as links."
FUTMobile,3am3vg,nannerbots,5,Sun Jun 21 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"""quick, fast, and got pace."" Are those 3 different attributes? And if his shooting is a let down I ain't buying him, as it is I am let down quite a few times by long distance shooting from other TOTS. Thanks for your review! Upvoted."
FUTMobile,3am3vg,messimerizing,3,Sun Jun 21 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Hulk, IF Guarin, IF Hernanes, or TIF/MOTM Rakitic? Their longshots always seem to score"
FUTMobile,3am3vg,nannerbots,2,Sun Jun 21 16:02:27 2015 UTC,I can score out of the box shots with ease. It's the very long long shots that can be a problem. Like the ones from a little past the halfway line.
FUTMobile,3am3vg,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:14:35 2015 UTC,Depends on the definition of longshot.
FUTMobile,3am3vg,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:13:46 2015 UTC,SIF Sneijder and Pogba say hi. They score from the midfield very frequently for me
FUTMobile,3am3vg,Krishido,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"For me, TOTS KDB, TOTS Griezmann, Reus, Ronaldo, and Kroos would do best for longshots. TOTS Hazard's finesse shots from OUTSIDE the box have also been amazing for me."

FUTMobile,3am3vg,kev11111,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:40:44 2015 UTC,No. I just said that so people that have him can describe how good he is at dribbling past defenders and controlling the ball..
FUTMobile,3am3vg,kev11111,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"he's not 5 star anymore; he's 4 now, (only just noticed earlier). Not that it seems to matter, I've pulled off rainbow flicks etc with 1 star GK"

FUTMobile,3akviu,Krishido,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:55:33 2015 UTC,I think this would be good for fifa 16 because it would take a while to just set it up. It would make it easy if futhead or ea have a spreadsheet with all the players. another problem is people putting up high prices of a player they have to scam someone looking at the spreadsheet. only a few amount of people should be able to edit the document just so it could be a good list.
FUTMobile,3akviu,drkspace,2,Sun Jun 21 05:35:28 2015 UTC,Like a approved submitters kind of thing. But then the 'submitters' would have to have a google account to get invited to a google spreadsheet. Maybe set it up for FIFA16 since it's getting to the end of 15.

FUTMobile,3akvlu,tony_d47,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:01:42 2015 UTC,"Naww i didnt try him out, i just sold him right away, i should have though"
FUTMobile,3ake4v,nannerbots,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:40:25 2015 UTC,I have been using Griezmann as a CAM in this squad but he feels too weak for me and constantly loses the ball. I swapped him with Lacazette but I feel like Lacazette is being wasted in that position because he isn't scoring or creating very many chances. Thoughts?
FUTMobile,3ake4v,lingmister,2,Sun Jun 21 01:42:01 2015 UTC,Personally I'll drop BennyZ move Griezmann up to ST and move Payet ad Cam.   Griezmann is no good as CAM as he needs better passing and PHY. It's not to say his pass and PHY is bad. But Payet is better.
FUTMobile,3ake4v,lingmister,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is I like Griezmann on the right so he can cut inside and shoot across goal. Playing Griezmann on the right gives me problems at right CM because I can't play Payet there, and I like having Matuidi in the center because he plays a more defensive position there. Actually as I'm typing this I think I've found the answer in Pogba:  http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/34964269/  Maybe I'll swap Fekir for Pastore but I'll have to play with the squad first"
FUTMobile,3ake4v,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:03:55 2015 UTC,Yep this looks much better. Pogba and Mat will be very offensive as well so they could play box to box or wide. You might consider Mat as left CM. and Toulalan as center CDM. Then 4-1-2-1-2 can also work.   I've not tried Toulalan but last seasons TOTS he was a bargain buy as he was very solid.
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,Tyson_Wilkins,3,Sat Jun 20 17:49:03 2015 UTC,There's 23 players in EAS FC TOTS.
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"I though it was only starters and subs. Huh. You cant show the reserves on Futhead anyway, but I'd probably put Muller, James, Terry, Marcelo and Bravo on the reserves"
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:03:21 2015 UTC,they are not likely to release 3gks.
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:14:11 2015 UTC,Whatever. Personal opinion. Who do you think would make it?
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I am already pretty much done with my dream team. I kinda know who to buy but haven't bought all of them yet. I hope Silva makes it, since that would guarantee a drop in his TOTS price. And hopefully Dani Alves gets in and goes down below 450k, but even if he does I don't think I could be arsed to spend that much on a RB."
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 450k for a RB seems like a bit much"
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,ukplaying,2,Sat Jun 20 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"kane and lacazette will make it, ibra should also sneak in aguero has a high chance of not making it as he was on bpl bench last tym. i c tevez making it over him.i also expect a full msn rerelease they were outstanding.   7 strikers were released last time (including messi at cf) although no silvers were there last time i wont be surprised if dybala takes a spot.  btw do you think i should start a wager page on this?"
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"You could, and I know Kane had a Phenomenal season compared to Aguero, but EASFC was who EA wanted in packs, and not who had the best season. Because of this, they will likely pad the roster with high rated popular players. I actually left out Suarez, but he has a very good chance of making it, as do guys like Neymar, Diego Costa, Cazorla, Fabregas, Kroos, Matuidi etc."
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"I personally still rate aguero way over kane(he still got the golden boot) but if u look at last year's tots 1of the strikers was ciro immobile, i beleive kane will take his spot, they will give something to some of the lower rated guy and i dont think it will change the number of packs opened even if some stars are missed the only reason suarez and neymar wont make it will be due to disciplinary issues,even  though last yr only 1 each from rm and barca made it and i think player of the year of each of top 5 leagues (lacazette) made it last time(not 100pc sure though)"
FUTMobile,3aj1bp,messimerizing,3,Sat Jun 20 18:59:56 2015 UTC,pontificating shitrooster   Probably the most creative insult I've seen in a while

I live in Canada, so other than the MLS and Champions League, the only games I can see are games in the Prem, and mostly of the top 5 teams (Chelsea, Man U, Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal).

FUTMobile,3aic41,messimerizing,2,Sat Jun 20 13:45:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! I actually made this gif (along with a few others) wayyy back. I just wasn't sure if anyone in this sub would be interested in goals and gameplay vids
FUTMobile,3aic41,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sat Jun 20 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"How did you make the GIF? It's a decent goal, but this could be life changing for those who want to share goals and skills"

FUTMobile,3ah8up,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:19:51 2015 UTC,pace is op even in all round and lol forgot about suarez(have been try real hard since i missed a gr8 investment opportunity) tevez has better base stats but not enough to overturn 3star vs 4star week foot.
FUTMobile,3ah8up,DawnoftheSuarez,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:40:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 3 star weak foot has been my only complaint about TOTS Griezmann. Sometimes the guy misses sitters with his weak foot. At other times he's managed to finesse a shot from outside the box into the net beating Neuer, with his weak foot. Very inconsistent on his weak foot."
FUTMobile,3aicfp,marqueemessi,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:43:23 2015 UTC,He could be in the EASFC. Like 80 percent sure.

FUTMobile,3ahuhk,xx263xx,2,Sat Jun 20 09:02:59 2015 UTC,It looks very balanced. The only changes I would make is replacing Mangala with Koscielny and replacing some of the Non-IFs to their IF versions.

Some sacrifices have to be made. ;)  My suggestion for RB but the new Marquinos instead of dani. Much cheaper, though bot as good.   Move Griezmann to right ST.   Laca to left ST.   Mat to left CDM.   Payet for right CAM  Pogba for right CDM.   Should get you about 8 chem for most any maybe 9 with a French manager.   What do you think?"

FUTMobile,3ac02i,doctoruranus,10,Thu Jun 18 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"I wish they had showed what the UI looked like, such as the squad builder/transfer market etc"
FUTMobile,3ac02i,peter_goh15,7,Thu Jun 18 22:31:40 2015 UTC,"My First Impressions: 1. Better player modelling. Something I wanted to see. Not fabulous, but definitely better than 15, and a good baseline (they could remodel players and release it in an update. Just sayin' EA) 2. Reworked crossing. Prepare to sweat it out, now that crossing actually works. It may not be the most effective, but the crosses in the video looked quicker and more accurate than the current ones. They also got played into open space, which never happens now. 3. Celebrations. Finally. I'm sick of the cutscenes, let me customize. 4. Reworked UI. I'm talking specifically about the buttons and virtual stick, with them being redesigned. They look pretty sick, but I wish I got to see all of the different UI options, as well as if they somehow worked in through balls and skill moves together, maybe even that new driven pass they added on console. Perhaps a modifier button that could be pressed on the fly, sort of like bumpers and triggers on controllers are used for shot and pass modifiers. 5. Set piece customization. In the corner kick cutscene, he had the option to call a player short, and WAIT FOR IT CHANGE THE KICK TAKER IN THE MOMENT. HOLY SHIT. Finally. If I have a free kick, I always try to curl near post, but if I have a righty taking the kick in the right side of the field, I can't do that, I need a lefty. This hasn't been explicitly shown in a free kick, but why would they do it for corners only? Stuff I wish I could see/use for a better look: play with the characters to see how the game plays, and what's good. Is pace still OP? Is crossing deadly now? Did they fix defender/keeper AI? (God knows they need to). Controls. I want to see all of the possible buttons and button layouts. The one he used in the video was pretty basic. Goal celebrations, and what all of those modifiers do. There were at least 8 different options, and I'm guessing you the ""A"" and ""C"" are celebrations while running, while ""B"" is like a finisher, and these can be combo'd extravagantly. I'd also like a better look at players faces, to see if they did each one is individually, or if they did it similar to this years iteration. What do you guys think?"
FUTMobile,3ac02i,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Fri Jun 19 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"If it's free(which I heard it is), I'm playing it. Also, everything about the gameplay excited me. Hope we have longshots like they do on consoles. Then only will people start to learn the value of players like Pogba, KDB and Reus."
FUTMobile,3ac02i,messimerizing,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:29:02 2015 UTC,I guess we will have longshots because this is basically fifa 11+ engine with less impressive graphics.

FUTMobile,3ac02i,Gusrodlopez,2,Fri Jun 19 02:49:44 2015 UTC,they will never allow coins transfer(best you can hope for is allowing u to keep 1 untradeable player even chance of that is 1percent).players are initially very cheap and u will be able to hoard them and a new player will find it impossible ti trade.They might allow fifa points.

FUTMobile,3ac1xh,spikey190,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Cup. 4 games x 300 = 1200 plus 3K reward = 4200 coins in just 4 games (usually 15 minutes) That's about 16K coins an hour. Right now the TOTS tournaments are the best because the difficulty is semi-pro so you always win. Using the same formula as before, it's 6200 coins per 15 minutes so ~25K/hr"
FUTMobile,3ac1xh,nannerbots,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:59:56 2015 UTC,Thanks!
FUTMobile,3ac1xh,ninjapotato59,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"I second /u/nannerbot's comment. But when TOTS tournaments AREN'T in place, Ultimate league is the fastest way IMO if you have a 87+ rated squad (so you almost always win when simming in wc difficulty). Win the first 5 matches and quit the next (the one against Dortmund)  So 5 games x 300 = 1500 + 6200 reward = 7700. Each game lasts roughly 4 minutes. You complete a season in 5 x 4 = 20 mins. Hence, you can complete 3 seasons in an hour and earn approx 7700 x 3 = 23100 coins/hour."

FUTMobile,3abaze,ukplaying,0,Thu Jun 18 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"It will be a rare player pack, and there will be 4-5 players from Eredivisie needed. I am basing these requirements off the same LATAM TOTS tourney that you are talking about."
FUTMobile,3abaze,ukplaying,2,Thu Jun 18 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"latam had 4 leagues  bene has 2, bene tots is actually derived from benelux which had 3, the question is if u beleive they will release it without adding another  league if not 2"
FUTMobile,3abaze,ukplaying,0,Thu Jun 18 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"2 leagues is all. We don't have the luxembourg league in this game, I believe. And exactly, since BeNe has half the leagues as LATAM, no. of players from each of the two leagues should be twice the no. from each of the leagues in LATAM TOTS."

FUTMobile,3ab473,nyza,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:44:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry I sat down and passed out last night.  There are all kinds of things that make the ratings change in ways that don't make sense. Sometimes even changing reserve players will do it, even though its supposed to only be the subs that affect it. Then you can close the app and re open, and it will change again. There are definitely bugs in the ratings system."
FUTMobile,3ab473,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:57:36 2015 UTC,there are bugs in our apps but i dont think there are bugs in futheads calculator (his links).
FUTMobile,3ab473,ukplaying,0,Thu Jun 18 18:01:30 2015 UTC,yeah there is... I've noticed futhead get it wrong many times :)
FUTMobile,3ab473,kev11111,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"The weird thing though is that this also is happening on futhead. so i don't think its a game related issue, but more of a formula issue or something with how they calculate the overall team rating."
FUTMobile,3ab473,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"yes it is possible.Ratings is a slightly complicated formula which i dont remember correctly, but one of the factors is  rating of individual player in starting 11 minus  average rating. this value is then added to i think the average value. so in ur case tots boetang gave a less value in that factor. i hope u understood something. u maybe able to get the formula by googling."
FUTMobile,3ab473,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, but mathematically it should be impossible for a 93 rated player to give a lower average than an 86 rated player. It just doesn't make sense, unless EA does something weird to the rating formulas."
FUTMobile,3ab473,ukplaying,2,Thu Jun 18 18:02:44 2015 UTC,u didnt understand what i said imagine average with tots boateng is 90 without nif it is 89.5 now there is another factor from which each individual value is subtracted so in tots it is 90 minus 93 that is minus three and in nif it is 89.5  minus 86 that is 3.5. edit. slight calcultion error
FUTMobile,3ab473,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"But why do they pick an arbitrary factor (such as 90) to subtract all player values from? If this was the case, then adding any higher rated version of the same player will reduce the team rating (e.g. adding a 99 ronaldo instead of 92 ronaldo will reduce the team rating because the results for that arbitrary factor are -9 and -2). It just does not make any sense."
FUTMobile,3ab473,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"it is not arbitrary its ur squad rating so if u put 92 ronaldo ur average squad rating will also decrease and i should also mention this factor is an average(plus 9 sounds large) so individual variation of each player is taken and divided by 11. edit.as to why like this,  hey i am not ea but it is a way to give the bench importance and main squad more importance also maybe something to fight bronze benching although i cant figure out exactly"
FUTMobile,3ab473,Wogboy1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"yeah, i have no idea how they do it. If you can find a link or something explaining it, maybe it would help"

FUTMobile,3a6dh1,lingmister,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:37:07 2015 UTC,"He currently plays for Napoli, but you can also search for him at his pre-transfer team, Sampdoria. If I get his TOTS, you can have his NIF, assuming it's tradeable."

Assuming he's not a total flop, I'll put his Sampdoria NIF up for sale (my Napoli version is untradeable). Let me know if you want him."
FUTMobile,3a6dh1,mpassell99,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:33:14 2015 UTC,Not problem man. It's ok I've picked up his tots as well. Thanks for the offer.   Btw Murillo ST from the same team is awesome.

FUTMobile,3a6dh1,ukplaying,2,Wed Jun 17 17:25:56 2015 UTC,i think he will be similar to griezmann and aubemeyang
FUTMobile,3a6dh1,messimerizing,2,Wed Jun 17 17:28:26 2015 UTC,He's pretty much TOTS Griezmann with better physical in a worse league.
FUTMobile,3a6dh1,ukplaying,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:18 2015 UTC,dont hold me to it though i thought kdb will go for 260 and although i bin snipped him once for 320k he never went anywhere near it

FUTMobile,3a547u,peter_goh15,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:05:10 2015 UTC,Try get TOTS Marcelo and upgrade the NIF Marcelo then try to replace NIF Sergio Ramos with his TOTY version.

FUTMobile,3a4yj4,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:18:04 2015 UTC,I think the way it goes:  Short tap on pass - weak pass.  Medium press - medium strength pass. (Bar goes to about under half way)  Long press - lob pass. (More than half way.   I notice that the Ai only does auto through balls for you only for a player with 90+ passing on a medium press. Anyone else you need to go via the manual through ball button.
FUTMobile,3a4yj4,lingmister,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:39:45 2015 UTC,"you can do it manually by tapping on the screen, I've done it with silver players :)"
FUTMobile,3a4yj4,kev11111,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"through ball.  The most effective pass in the game for me is a hard through ball on the ground, which cannot be done with skill moves, because it lobs everything hard.  Lobbed balls don't get controlled quickly.  Ground through balls get controlled instantly"
FUTMobile,3a4yen,pellias,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"Don't hold me to this, bit prices on Messi and Ronaldo, are still much higher than they were over the previous 3 weeks before the tots. I'm expecting them to start dropping, if they haven't already."

Thanks everyone, she's telling everyone she sees already about it, and called her mom at work to tell her. Totally worth it to me.  https://youtu.be/9QWD2TRu2SQ"

When she's sees it on TV she jumps on the stand and waits for a chance to attack the ball. She usually only goes after the ball, every once in a while she will take a swipe at a player. She only does it with soccer too, I've had other ball sports on and she's not interested. I'll post it the next time she does it. Her brother couldn't care less about it, but he does do full on back flips playing with a toy we have."

FUTMobile,3a2ijr,ukplaying,2,Tue Jun 16 18:45:28 2015 UTC,If you are selling these to buy other versions of the card such as messi rw or ronaldo st i dont think its a good idea. The toty prices have been on the rise lately and may keep going back up now that people realize they're the best cards in the game
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,gimmethat____,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"oh, i will definitely buy them back i just want some capital to trade with i am pretty sure i can beat inflation and if not i have enough backup to buy them back. i am not really interested in the other versions i love ronaldo at st and messi at cam or 2nd st.I also foresee atleast 1 more crash if not 2"
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,gimmethat____,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:20:36 2015 UTC,admittedly i am down to only 900k myself and would also love some captial to trade with.. but both those players are in my current squad and I am trying to stay content
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,gimmethat____,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"yeah i get that. i dnt know which platform u r on but i am on android and the only way to keep going is to keep trying new players or just enjoying winning in the transfer market. last week i missed suarez at  5.2m now he is closer to 8m.i kind of expected it but didnt do anything, now its too late, in fact he may slightly recede as people may start to realise rb ronaldo is better and cheaper(not many can afford both).i dont want to miss out on ibra and/or tevez next week, if i buy at wrong time and they crash so be it,but i believe ea fc tots should cause a crash and is a decent safety net. if u want a capital maybe put 1 up at 3rd lowest bin or 500k above lowest bin with a chem card on a 3 or 12 hour auction before u sleep someone might just buy it."
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,gimmethat____,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:52:00 2015 UTC,I got one of those suarezs for 5.2! Haven't sold him yet because I'm afraid his price will just keep going up. I just sold my tots hazard and Sanchez to get to 2m. I've really wanted to make the move to rb Ronaldo but just can't decide
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,kev11111,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:58:12 2015 UTC,in ur previous post u said he(both) was already in ur squad.
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:05:07 2015 UTC,I meant the Toty Ronaldo
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"i dont know if i should be advising u on this as u seem to be a bigger trader, but switching toty with rb is something i did and never regretted. Financially both are at same value in fact i think rb is currently more, playing wise with a suitable  chem card u can easily max out shooting and pace and increase 1 more the st seemed to make better runs for me although that could be just a placebo or maybe because the midfield was better anyway he was no way any worse than toty at st.However the squad building options u have with him are much more, u wont play lw at 4 chem at st while u may play st at 8 chem st, so unless u play him at lw or lf with i guess suarez i suggest u switch him."
FUTMobile,3a2ijr,messimerizing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"it might be the chem card you have on him that send him off on runs... chem cards don't just add a couple of points, they dictate the behaviour of the player concerned, so although u may think its beneficial to add a cpl points to max out his shooting, it could have an adverse effect on your experience of him if it doesn't fit your playing style :)"

FUTMobile,3a3541,TheSuicideMachines,4,Tue Jun 16 21:34:52 2015 UTC,This sub doesn't really have to worry about this. If someone photoshops a pack to make it seem as if they pulled a Ronaldo that's their problem. It is nice to get a warning about it though.
FUTMobile,3a3541,nannerbots,2,Tue Jun 16 21:45:30 2015 UTC,The card next to it looks faded on the top of it. I noticed that earlier but didn't really think anything of it. Now it makes sense.
FUTMobile,3a3541,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Jun 16 21:24:30 2015 UTC,Ok? It's not like viewing a picture of a photoshoped card pack endangered somebody.

FUTMobile,3a0i1s,iiHeffronDriveii,3,Tue Jun 16 07:12:38 2015 UTC,"All I care about is the new cellys, I don't even give a shit about anything else /s. In all honesty, new, and especially choosable celebrations sound pretty cool. I hope they do a few other things with the game, such as: 1. Non-shitty character models. I swear to god every single black guy was modelled by one dude, they all look the same, and most characters look nothing like their card picture. 2. Redistribution of stats. Something that makes pace less OP. Make it worthwhile to own players with better card stats, rather than those with better pace. In this game, most people would rather use a 90 pace bronze CM over Xavi. 3. Fix game glitching. Android people may be a little salty that they have no Online Seasons, but you're not missing much. I would guess 40% of the games I play I get the disconnect glitch where the other player forces a disconnect and a loss. I might not be the best player, but it would help if I didn't get DC'd. Oh and the other 60% of the time, his ten is pure pace. 4. Add farmable pack rewards again. If their concern is people farming the free packs, at least let us get the coins, or even slightly more for taking away the pack"
FUTMobile,3a0i1s,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Tue Jun 16 12:26:40 2015 UTC,"There is an obvious joke there, but too easy. I think offensively they could make it so if a player is running at a certain pace then the dribbling skill lowers, or balance, or both. Similar for defense, balance, and defense drops when sprinting. I don't know something like that, I'm sure there are ways to do it. Absolutely, if online is what everyone describes it to be, I'm not even interested. The reason I've wanted to try it so bad is to face top competition, not go IP against people that can cheat the programming. I think they should make it significantly more rewarding to play the tournaments. I like the idea of being able to Sim games, but actually playing your way through should be a much bigger reward. Maybe make it so you can get the same amount of coins and the pack if you play, and only coins if you Sim. I also think that the tier system for difficulty level should be more spread out. Winning games on world class should get you a huge amount more than lower levels. As it is now there isn't much incentive to play a tougher difficulty."
FUTMobile,3a0i1s,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Jun 16 18:42:42 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Higher rewards for higher difficulty, and if they fix online seasons, possibly add online tournaments too?"
FUTMobile,3a0i1s,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"Hybrid Touch Controls sounds pretty cool. I'll still use the classic layout, though."
FUTMobile,3a0i1s,Takuno,2,Tue Jun 16 07:52:15 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it sound basically the same as what we have now?  The only new things I took from the post are celebrations, and console gameplay.  Now if the gameplay part is even partially true, then I am truly excited.   The celebrations past I am already hating. How much time and effort was taken a way from giving us a better game so that the immature showboats can take a fucking selfie or some shit, while watching the replay 3 times and wasting time. I hate that whole aspect of gaming, it only promotes bad sportsmanship, and helps create idiots like Terrell Owens, and any other asshole that puts himself before his team.  OK that's the 80 year old inbme speaking, he is taking more and more control over me everyday, and sadly I think I'm OK with that."
FUTMobile,3a0i1s,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:27:16 2015 UTC,"In a way, I agree, especially the people who use the ""shhhhh"" celebration, but I'm sure that online play won't be much different, when talking about replays, because literally everyone on online seasons on FUT iOS, and FIFA 15 PC. However, I can't wait for celebrations, but the main question would probably be, will they implement the same celebrations as FIFA 16, or the same as FIFA on psvitas?"
FUTMobile,3a0i1s,ukplaying,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"well they shut down the ds and vita branches so i believe  enough time was spend on us, i dnt care about celebrations i just want online features for android and hopefully an option not to watch replays and short cut scenes plus they have promised us new game modes so carrer mode and maybe the women are coming"

I'm not sure if I was just hallucinating or if they were testing something out. Have you guys seen this?

FUTMobile,3a0kju,pellias,3,Tue Jun 16 08:09:38 2015 UTC,Someone must have bid on him right before the transfer market went down.

FUTMobile,3a0kju,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Jun 16 08:14:56 2015 UTC,"i saw someone that bought messi for 800 coins!!  The most common way that this happens is when lats say that someone puts up messi for 150 bid for 1 hour. Then someone bids lets say 800 coins and then the  game suddenly crashes and the servers are temporarily down. During the time where the servers are down the time for the player continues and since no one else can bid for him cause the server is down, the guy that bid 800 coins wins him!"

FUTMobile,3a0smf,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Jun 16 10:07:04 2015 UTC,Silver are more rare than gold since more gold packs are opened than silver. Gold contracts are so abundant that their value drops and I personally think they're not even worth the minimum bid
FUTMobile,3a0smf,TheSuicideMachines,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:22:06 2015 UTC,nope people think silver is cheaper and search for it instead of checking out the gold
FUTMobile,3a0smf,ukplaying,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:52:19 2015 UTC,If people play silvers that get more contracts on silver players than gold contracts.
FUTMobile,3a0smf,lingmister,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:19:38 2015 UTC,no they dont its 24 each for the rares and gold has 1extra(11 vs 10)in none rares

If you're pressing sprint while receiving a pass it sends the ball so far from yourself to ""give yourself running space"" but to my knowledge its useless, horrible and just loses possession. Or i just cant use it properly.  its a fucking doubletap on sprint. You're sending yourself a through ball on your first touch. Useful in breakaway scenarios though."

FUTMobile,39zv6i,TheSuicideMachines,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:18:01 2015 UTC,i think thats cause they have TOTS forms now which raises their value

FUTMobile,39wn6m,messimerizing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:24:42 2015 UTC,"i sort of agree. But seeing how much Konami/PES have progressed this year, with PES 2015 winning over every magazine at gamescom, and more recently PES Club Manager attracting people who prefer the career mode type of gameplay, it seems that EA feel threatened. Think about it. When Price Ranges were released, PES 2015 was made more popular with its myClub gameplay. EA seemed threatened and released so many Ronaldo cards, and Messi cards. Even the hero items were released (imo) to win back the people with more special cards. EA Sports are gonna release so much this year, and I think that there is a true battle between PES and FIFA this year"
FUTMobile,39wn6m,messimerizing,3,Mon Jun 15 12:35:31 2015 UTC,"Let's hope so, but let's not get too excited either. So long as FIFA on mobile is free, I'll play it in my spare time. Simple as that. And I won't buy coins or fifa points. Simply play and try to have fun."
FUTMobile,39wn6m,Danimalistic2782,3,Mon Jun 15 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do spend money on it though. Over 500 million dollars last year in mobile revenue, with fifa being the main contributor. Projected sales increasing dramatically over the next ten years. If I remember correctly, they expect 15 million more mobile gamers next year. Its a g4owing market, whereas the console market doesn't expect anywhere near the same growth.  In wouldn't be surprised if we see gaming phones being developed soon. With buttons built into the top or sides of the phone. Like the r1 and r2 buttons on a super Nintendo controller."

FUTMobile,39uron,Killsranq,3,Sun Jun 14 23:28:21 2015 UTC,"Come lessons i've learnt, which u can apply for Fut 16 season when it starts in Sept:   Play/Sim tourneys/seasons to earn coins. Trade, trade and trade and build up coins. Open packs esp early on in the season. Your cards will sell more early on. Slowly upgrade to a gold card team, any cheap team that can play World class is good enough. Coin is king, delay your purchase of any dream team until TOTY (nov/dec?) when price plummets.   Playing the game, my choice of cards:   Choose a nice formation: 4-3-2-1, 4-1-2-1-2 GK Stats - Div, Reflex, Handling CB Stats - Def, Phy, Pace (at least 1 of them). H/M workrates least desired, but i still use them :P LB/RB Stats - Def, Pace. H/M workrates acceptable CDM - Def, Pace, Phy CAM - Pass, Pace, Sho, Dri CM - Pass, Dri ST/LF/RF - Sho, Pace, Phy. H/M is my fav workrate here. If you have 2 ST, make 1 pace, 1 Phy. If you have 1 ST, make it Phy. LM/RM - Pace, Pass, Dri   Chemistry rules, never have a card below 4. 7 is acceptable (e.g. Ronaldo playing at ST).  Trading:   Ascertain value of a card by checking the bidded and BIN prices Snipe BIN. Choose a price BIN that is 10% - 15% lower. Keep refreshing and snipe low, sell high. Bidding. Sometimes you may be lucky to just bid something lower than actual   Lastly, join this sub's giveaways !  Edit: Added LM/RM preferred stats"

FUTMobile,39uron,Krishido,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:36:53 2015 UTC,"What seasons do you guys do? What tournaments? do the manager boosts actually do anything? what about the game plans? if you do ""pressure"" do they actually pressure more?   Don't know what you mean by this series of questions.   What does the ""Dribbling"" stat really do? I know pace increases speed, and shot increases accuracy/power, but idk what dribbling and defending stats do. dribbling and defense are both really controlled by the player..   Dribbling is a combination of dribbling, ball control, agility, balance, and, reactions, all of which are stats out of 100 on their own multiplied by a decimal coefficient. The overall face stat gives you an overview of how smooth your runs should go.  Defense is a combo on marking, standing/sliding tackle, heading, and interception; how well your player can get somebody off the ball when marking.   Do all of the stats from actual cards go in the mobile game too? like curling stats, finishing stats, etc?   Yes   anything else i should know? Anything else you guys do to exploit the game?   Some people have glitched tournaments so they can get the pack rewards over and over again. Many others take advantage of the transfer market. Other than that the only real ""exploit"" involves doing the unspeakable action on this sub."

FUTMobile,39uron,kev11111,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"For seasons, the quickest way to make coins that many members exploit is simming division 1 offline, winning the first 5 games and intentionally losing the next game to get the coins for holding while saving 4 games from being played. For tournaments, the featured tournaments are by far the most lucrative, offering the most coins and often good free packs, needing often a squad consisting of players from a specific nation or league. Up until recently, tournament rewards were the same no matter how many times you played the tournament, making it an effective way to farm packs/coins, but they have patched this recently; so now only a lucky few who have a game glitch can receive unlimited coins/packs"

Every tots Boateng bought up instantly and then priced at 1.8m, like all of them. Only someone with an unbelievable amount of coins could pull off something like that.

If they have stayed the same or dropped I would say that would have to be due to something like bots.  Anyone know the recent trends in coin pricing?"

FUTMobile,39te0c,nsm883,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:22:14 2015 UTC,It's understandable when there are so many Ronaldo cards out there.
FUTMobile,39te0c,Krishido,2,Sun Jun 14 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"But, it is one of the best players on the game"
FUTMobile,39te0c,nsm883,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:44:29 2015 UTC,he has a toty what will he do with a tots?
FUTMobile,39te0c,ukplaying,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"I didnt know he had a toty, especially an untradeable one"
FUTMobile,39te0c,nsm883,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:35:56 2015 UTC,Were all TOTS players packed from 15k packs except for Ronnie?
FUTMobile,39te0c,Krishido,2,Sun Jun 14 16:38:04 2015 UTC,yep
FUTMobile,39te0c,ukplaying,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:48:18 2015 UTC,i am guessing you have a toty or st ronaldo?
FUTMobile,39te0c,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun Jun 14 16:41:02 2015 UTC,toty
FUTMobile,39te0c,nsm883,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"Is he tradeable, or was he another free pack pull?"
FUTMobile,39te0c,bitchfaceronaldo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:18:03 2015 UTC,free pack
FUTMobile,39te0c,sdesai77,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:20:36 2015 UTC,Waot so u have an untradeable toty amd tos ronaldo?
FUTMobile,39te0c,kev11111,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:33:25 2015 UTC,yiss
FUTMobile,39te0c,sdesai77,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"I opened ~175 untradeable packs and got TOTS Pique, TOTS Dani Alves, TOTS Krychowiak and 2 TOTS Pabon, one of which I had to discard. Was looking for Suarez or Neymar."
FUTMobile,39te0c,kev11111,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:40:07 2015 UTC,I feel better for not having scored a single TOTS player during the unpacking fiasco over the weekend!
FUTMobile,39sig3,chitowncrazykidd,2,Sun Jun 14 09:37:20 2015 UTC,"Search the market whenever you are playing the game. Take a certain player that costs anywhere from 10k to 25k, record his lowest BIN on a piece of paper, use the formula,  Buying price = ( Lowest BIN* 95/100) - Profit wanted(Ranging from 1k onwards, usually 2k or so, can be more).   Now go find open bids on that player and keep bidding to get him at your buying price. Sell for min BIN. Enjoy.  Another method would be to use the buying price as your max BIN, and keep searching and refreshing. If something pops up, hit Buy Now immediately. This works well if you have a speedy net connection. I managed to get a NIF Robben(who goes for 110k) for 70k using this method. But this takes a lot more luck.  Also use players from popular leagues, like one of the big 5 leagues. Try and use NIFs preferably, their values tend to stay strong through most periods of time. See if this helps you mate! :)"
FUTMobile,39sig3,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:56:41 2015 UTC,Thank you I will try it out :)
FUTMobile,39shy5,Danimalistic2782,2,Sun Jun 14 09:27:31 2015 UTC,"No kidding Dan. Indeed when I lost my entire account with the FB sync problem, I decided to just restart. And enjoyed the process.   What you also highlighted is something that will happen to all of us. After TOTS is over the game is over, there is nothing more we can use our coins for and FIFA 16 it all restarts.   So enjoy the game as it is, and as you say don't sweat the small stuff. Thanks for the reminder."
FUTMobile,39shy5,lingmister,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:40:22 2015 UTC,"Wait, you have a TOTS Robben stuck in your transfer pile? Shit son"
FUTMobile,39shy5,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:34:13 2015 UTC,"yeah, i have a costa stuck there since a week. i contacted ea and so far nothings changed interestingly i won the giveaway the same day, u win some u lose some i guess. i now watch the target screen when there is a player i am bidding when time is ending, as i lost costa while playing the game and so far it has not happened again. if u want to be realy safe i suppose u can start another account and split the wealth."
FUTMobile,39shy5,ukplaying,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:50:56 2015 UTC,"Had the same problem with TOTS Hazard (435k purchase). After contacting EA for 4 days via Email, I finally requested a call from EA Customer Support. The representative I talked to was very understanding and refunded the 435k I lost on ""stuck"" TOTS Hazard after I gave her my account info and screenshot of ""stuck"" Hazard in transfer target column. Hazard is still stuck to this day but at least I got my money back. So I suggest you talk to an EA Advisor via phone"
FUTMobile,39shy5,rambo864,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:48:00 2015 UTC,Yep :(
FUTMobile,39sn4h,ukplaying,2,Sun Jun 14 11:00:35 2015 UTC,His shooting is on par with TOTY Ronaldo and definitely beats TOTY Messi as a striker  http://www.futhead.com/15/players/40846/lionel-messi/compare/15-45916/15-40843/
FUTMobile,39sn4h,Kenya_West,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:56:29 2015 UTC,thanks though currently my messi is at cam.
FUTMobile,39sn4h,mpassell99,2,Sun Jun 14 17:09:04 2015 UTC,I just packed him last night (by far my best packed card ever). I'll let you know how he is.
FUTMobile,39sn4h,gimmethat____,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"Hes good, but not worth the 5.2 mil I shelled out to get him. I have used both and I think you shud get his TIF for a fraction of the price."
FUTMobile,39sn4h,gimmethat____,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:52:55 2015 UTC,"man if u got him at 5.2m he was definitely worth it u r already looking at 2m profit, i cant realy get him now. i'll wait till ea tots otherwise i guess he will be the one that got away"
FUTMobile,39sn4h,gimmethat____,2,Sun Jun 14 17:11:49 2015 UTC,Yea I was watching the market all week and saw an opportunity on Friday night. That seems to be the trend of when the tots players are at there lowest.  What is the ea tots?
FUTMobile,39sn4h,vaow93,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"well i think its called ea sports football club team of the season. its traditionally the last team of the season release, the ea development team chose the players they like and rerelease the corresponding tots cards. Suarez may or may not make it but prices are expected to crash(i was not there last time around so personally cant say) think of it like last two days of toty with full team release(i believe only 23 cards are released."
FUTMobile,39sn4h,vaow93,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:26:34 2015 UTC,That's dope I did not know they did this. Hopefully you will be able to get a more affordable Suarez then but realistically good luck having that much coinage left over after Lihue 1/ series A hahah
FUTMobile,39sn4h,vaow93,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"Suarez should make it. They take highest rated players from each TOTS and put them in to EASFC TOTS. So that list will include TOTS CR7, TOTS Messi, TOTS Suarez, TOTS Hazard, TOTS Boateng, TOTS Aguero possibly, TOTS Neymar, TOTS Neuer, TOTS Robben, TOTS Ramos probably, etc.."
FUTMobile,39sn4h,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"nope they choose who they like, not by rating.Last year only 1person each made it from rm and barca(guess who)besides seeing as they dropped aguero to bench in bpl tots i am not sure if he will make it."
FUTMobile,39sn4h,bitchfaceronaldo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"It might be those players who EA think performed exceptionally then. Like KDB, Lacazette, maybe even Kane, ha."
FUTMobile,39sn4h,mpassell99,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"immobile made it last year so i am pretty sure kane will make it what i am worried about is the polish guy, ea seem to be the only people that even knew him."
FUTMobile,39sn4h,mpassell99,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:47:14 2015 UTC,Polish guy? Krychowiak? What about him?
FUTMobile,39syf1,unisoulja,3,Sun Jun 14 13:43:35 2015 UTC,Maybe your a troll player.
FUTMobile,39syf1,KSearle21,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:50:18 2015 UTC,maybe yr a troll
FUTMobile,39syf1,Tyson_Wilkins,3,Sun Jun 14 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"Troll players are players that you think are one high value player, but are actually just shit. This can be because they have a combo of same name, nation or club. For example, troll Hazard is Thorgan Hazard, brother of Eden, who has the same nationality and last name as Eden, but is a 76 CAM in the Bundesliga. Another example is troll Messi, aka Javier Mascherano, because he is another Argentinian who plays for Barcelona"
FUTMobile,39syf1,DavidFish517,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"Also the fact that Messi is 93 and Mascherano is 83. Sometimes, the 3 pops up first when I watch the animation"
FUTMobile,39syf1,kev11111,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"Is Kylian Hazard classed as a troll then, or just thorgan because he's gold same as eden?? I've always wondered this for some strange reason lol"
FUTMobile,39syf1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"Kylian isn't a troll because he's a bronze, and therefore unattainable in gold packs/recognizable when packed"

I sincerely apologize for my comments. I made a poor assumption, which was unfair. I will make sure to choose my words more carefully in the future, and try to make sure I have the facts about a situation before I pass judgment. Again, I am sorry for this."
FUTMobile,39syf1,kenchenhappy,2,Tue Jun 16 18:24:54 2015 UTC,An example of this is when you search for TOTY Thiago Silva and TOTY David Luiz and Marquinos pops up. And when you search for TOTS Pique and Marc Bartra is there

FUTMobile,39svhp,chitowncrazykidd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:06:54 2015 UTC,Aguero looks expensive
FUTMobile,39svhp,Kenya_West,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:19:15 2015 UTC,Wow Aguero used to be over 300k. I know I paid around 400k for his NIF upgrade.
FUTMobile,39rs16,lingmister,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:08:13 2015 UTC,"Bund was worse ? Lewan, Muller is priced at god Aguero whereas Robben dropped to <1m when i last saw him. I agree BPL was most fun and accessible to most in terms of coins.  I hope Serie A will be like BPL."
FUTMobile,39rs16,pellias,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:22:44 2015 UTC,For sure. BPL was really good and I packed a number of them. With Laliga the super rare players formed the bulk of the release so packing them is hard.
FUTMobile,39rs16,nannerbots,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:24:15 2015 UTC,"I love krychrowiak (the Polish CDM). But I totally agree with you. I'd rather have TOTS cards for the lesser known players because they are more fun to play with. All of the best players already have amazing cards and the only difference to me is their card stats, how they perform in game is the same. This is why I love Bolasie and most of the TOTS Most Consistent players"
FUTMobile,39rs16,Krishido,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I can think of so many Laliga players that deserve TOTS as well. (Godin, Vela, Vietto etc.)   EA just wants to sell packs and nothing does that better than Messi and Ron.   Personally I'm wondering if I should play FIFA 16. PES manager is just starting out, and just like FIFA (in the beginning) it is a good time to sell the awesome players before the market is filled with them."
FUTMobile,39rs16,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:22:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the best players of this TOTS are so expensive. For example, I think TOTS ronaldo was floating around 3m when I checked 3 hours ago. Also, the fact that both messi, ronaldo, and Kroos have already had their TOTYs (better cards than TOTS) could contribute to the underwhelming feelings as 2 of the 4 major superstars of this TOTS aren't the best version of their card in the game.   The only ones I was really excited about was probably Neymar and Suarez. I also hoped for a stronger midfield because let's face it, LaLiga midfield in the game is pretty weak; you only have 2 groups of players: the maestros (iniesta, kroos, andmodric) and the powerhouses (khedira and perez). The only real attacking mid is James.   The defenders look really good tho. Pique and Otamendi seem like pretty good cards and Alves + Marcelo have really good stats, not to mention those GKs.  I think I agree with the BPL TOTS being much better. Aguero, Sanchez, Costa, Hazard; all great attackers at relatively cheap prices during the crash. The midfield was solid af with Hendo, Fabregas, Matic, and Cazorla, and the defenders too Azpi, Terry,and Clyne.   I'm gonna go and say that Serie A TOTS would be just as good, if not better than BPL TOTS. We've already seen the beast that Marchisio was and we still have players like Higuain, vidal, pogba, tevez, Chiellini, etc."
FUTMobile,39rs16,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:51:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. Now that is a tots I'm going to save for. Pogba and Tevez will be something we can afford, relative speaking. ;)"
FUTMobile,39rs16,ukplaying,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:18:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too sure about Tevez. Unless you got a million plus, it might be difficult to get him. I can only speculate though."
FUTMobile,39rs16,ukplaying,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"That's more or less the reason I took a liking to bronze, and silver players. It opened up a whole new area of the game for me."
FUTMobile,39rs16,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:19:00 2015 UTC,"as someone has mentioned messi ronaldo ramos and kroos have better toty cards, players below 80pace dont usualy generate hype that leaves us with the gks, fbs., griezmann, neymar, Rodriguez and suarez. the mechanics of the game is such that gks and fbs have minimum influence. suarez is outside budget of most while neymar would eat almost my entire budget. That leaves just griezmann and Rodriguez both are good but kdb overshadows Rodriguez statisticaly and is cheaper. bpl was the 1st real tots and it helped the hype plus the bpl trident were relatively cheap plus there were players like bolasie and clyne who were op cheap beasts.serie a should be good and if co released with ligue1 will be much cheaper."
FUTMobile,39pfrj,ninjapotato59,4,Sat Jun 13 13:50:52 2015 UTC,I think I've had my striker sent of upwards of 30 times due to that.  that or I'm a dirty player
FUTMobile,39pfrj,KSearle21,2,Sat Jun 13 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"Haha yes, it's the same for me."
FUTMobile,39pfrj,stere,2,Sat Jun 13 14:05:51 2015 UTC,YEP! THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS TO ME TOO!!!
FUTMobile,39pfrj,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:06:01 2015 UTC,1 out of every 5 goalmouth scrambles especially at corners.However never been sent off for it always juat a yellow unlike the opposite end where its a straight red
FUTMobile,39pfrj,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:18:08 2015 UTC,Agreed. That was a terrible user interface decision of theirs. I've had that happen so many times. It accounts for most (maybe as much as 90%) of the times I've been carded.
FUTMobile,39pfrj,mpassell99,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:43:47 2015 UTC,"Hah, my Rafa Marquez has more red cards than goals. And I only used him for the Tricolor tourney."

FUTMobile,39qy2w,mpassell99,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:44:47 2015 UTC,I figured why not there's no other position to fit him in and tots dani alves is like 500k and worse than bale
FUTMobile,39qy2w,Thebrea1000,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:16:30 2015 UTC,How is Tots Alves for you? Im planning on grabbing one
FUTMobile,39qy2w,treefitty350,2,Sat Jun 13 23:02:13 2015 UTC,Honestly as long as the players are rated the same their performance doesn't change for jack shit.
FUTMobile,39qy2w,messimerizing,2,Sun Jun 14 05:05:03 2015 UTC,Hes is the closest gk to Toty Neuer that I have experienced
FUTMobile,39pgff,tony_d47,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:59:23 2015 UTC,"Looks great. I just put Wilson Morelo in to satisfy the Liga Postobon requirement, but I've been pleasantly surprised with him - 7 goals in 4 games, which is more than Pabon."
FUTMobile,39pgff,mpassell99,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:48:51 2015 UTC,"This is a squad I created with players I already have, dont wanna buy new ones. Saving up for some tots players I wanna buy."
FUTMobile,39pgff,mpassell99,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:49:11 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I did the same thing. I needed to put in Morelo because he was one of the only people I had from Liga Postobon. I figured he'd just be space filler and wasn't expecting 15 goals in 8 games.
FUTMobile,39pgo2,hobohawk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:02:03 2015 UTC,currently around 11million coins.As for ur question it depends on players around u like if u r going to play messi at rw who is at st?messi has a toty at st so as an investment might be a poor choice try to get suarez as he is ikely to appreciate faster. I have not played with any of them so playing wise i cant advise you.
FUTMobile,39pgo2,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"Probably like Messi RF, Neymar LF and Suarez ST in the 4-3-2-1 formation"
FUTMobile,39pgo2,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"Get Neymar. Suarez is way too expensive, Messi won't do as well on the right as he would at CAM/CF."

FUTMobile,39pgo2,KSearle21,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:44:23 2015 UTC,Griezmann?
FUTMobile,39pgo2,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"""Out of the three""  Griezmann however is the man you want to get from this TOTS if you can't afford the MSN or CR7. By far."
FUTMobile,39pgo2,KSearle21,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:03:17 2015 UTC,I was saying from the the best upgrade standpoint.
FUTMobile,39pgo2,lingmister,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:21:08 2015 UTC,I'm in he same boat. Neymar is the cheapest. Messi is the best and most expensive.   I believe this applies to NIF as well.
FUTMobile,39peht,ukplaying,2,Sat Jun 13 13:35:58 2015 UTC,TOTS Suarez. TOTS Alves . TOTS Bravo. Not biased at all.

FUTMobile,39pcho,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:29:51 2015 UTC,I've been monitoring his prices for the last 2 days and he has been holding steady at about 230-250k. All BID prices I've been following have been purchasing him above 200k. So as the traders will unlikely flip him below 200k.   So unless an odd snipe I would not expect him do drop below 200k.   I also don't think people will be opening a whole bunch of new packs as most of us have already done so when the packs were released on sat.   So keep and enjoy him.
FUTMobile,39pcho,lingmister,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am doing that only. I sold the first one I bought for 268k BIN, because I had managed to snipe another for 220k BIN(0 games played, completely fresh). I'll be keeping the 220k BIN'ned TOTS Griezmann, because I don't see prices falling below 200k at this point in time, when most packs have been opened."

FUTMobile,39okcp,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just bank all the consumables and crap, and even with just one decent player I'm making back almost half. I'm over 100k packs, at least this round of them, I'm sticking to trading and 15k."

FUTMobile,39okcp,KSearle21,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:31:51 2015 UTC,Ok going to try a few 15k packs!   I wonder if they calculate the chances on per pack or chance per player pulled?

I don't know if its possible with the lack of defenders and/or fullbacks, so you can substitute the defense for other special cards. Also you can use any level silver bronze whatever.  Also still haven't found a way to make a squad around motm Tim Cahill. Maybe with the release of the hero cards, and new mls informs it could be possible. I went after that card for months, I still haven't used him because I can't make a squad work out the way I like them."

FUTMobile,39negn,pellias,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:05:55 2015 UTC,Would it be better to buy players on Sunday night then ( around 6-10 pm GMT)? Would prices be lower then than they are now?
FUTMobile,39negn,pellias,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:11:34 2015 UTC,its very hard to say for bundes it was cheaper on sat for bpl i think it was neck and neck towards the end of both days. i recommend you to monitor prices hourly for ur targets if you find them rising bin snipe them or bid them.
FUTMobile,39negn,unisoulja,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:20:45 2015 UTC,Neymar - 2.6m+; Ronaldo - 2.7m+  I am done with pack opening....

FUTMobile,39o7lh,kev11111,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:08:59 2015 UTC,I feel as though you probably should have kept Neymar and sold Ronaldo to buy his ST version and play him alongside TOTS Neymar. Just my opinion though. I enjoy playing with his TOTY so i assume his TOTS should be similar.
FUTMobile,39o7lh,unisoulja,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:32:33 2015 UTC,Ronaldo.... every single time... the difference between 4* and 5* is negligible apparently plus neymar gets beaten up too much by strong defenders for my liking...
FUTMobile,39mq1q,nsm883,3,Fri Jun 12 20:55:02 2015 UTC,Would he actually sell for 900k easily though?
FUTMobile,39mq1q,KSearle21,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:45:31 2015 UTC,Proabbly I saw one bought off for that price relatively quickly like 15 mins a night or 2 ago

FUTMobile,39nepb,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:11:35 2015 UTC,Okay yeah I just saw your other post haha. So how much do you think this will affect the market? I haven't heard of lucky packs until now and I've been playing for 3 years now lol. I might have not been paying attention though because I don't ever buy packs
FUTMobile,39nepb,ukplaying,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"no,  they are rare yet to happen on consoles this year i think. u have been playing ut on mobile for 3 years didnt think it was there that long back. Well i will tell u what happened last 2weeks and u decide. During bpl when they were out aguero and hazard were looosing atleast 100k per hour for first 4to5 hours sanchez also dropped not sure by how much and the cheaper ones i beleive halved in price or reached sub 20k.During bundes however they fell for 1 hour then stabilised , took everyone by surprise and rebounded."
FUTMobile,39l3hd,ukplaying,3,Fri Jun 12 14:09:36 2015 UTC,i have invested 80k in these leagues players including 10 pabons lets do this together bro 👍
FUTMobile,39l3hd,kenchenhappy,2,Fri Jun 12 15:53:20 2015 UTC,i bought all at 1.5 to 1.6k and i have a feeling he will go for a bit more than that because a.he is not in packs b.he is the best st and c.he is hyped due to tots and people knew him before tots unlike saudi league. i maybe wrong and the plan may backfire spectacularly especially if there is no tournament
FUTMobile,39l3hd,KSearle21,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"Well Pabon's low BIN is around 2200, so not much of a profit really."

FUTMobile,39mm93,iLikeFatChicks,2,Fri Jun 12 20:27:38 2015 UTC,It's a nice squad but the work rates on the midfielders and defenders! None of them are gonna want to defend. I personally prefer Otamendi over Ramos.
FUTMobile,39mm93,Forza_Milan_,2,Fri Jun 12 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"this. It's called the ""Lookout Defense."" It's when the forwards and midfielders all yell back to Pique and Bravo and yell, ""Lookout!""  yer gonna need some midfielders who can tackle, like IF Busquets or Perez"
FUTMobile,39mm93,bitchfaceronaldo,0,Fri Jun 12 20:57:26 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that Pique has High attacking workrates as well so its all left to Bravo and i don't know how he performs as i've only used him in one game and he conceded once.
FUTMobile,39mm93,Forza_Milan_,0,Fri Jun 12 21:03:09 2015 UTC,His NIF is quite good actually

FUTMobile,39lnaw,ukplaying,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"It isn't the reason, but to me, it seems kinda ridiculous to have a league with a single club just because a certain fan base would go crazy without them."

FUTMobile,39k05s,ukplaying,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:39:34 2015 UTC,is there any guarantee they'll be released this week?? I assumed thats why the 100k packs were up for 4 days... they seem to mix it up every week since TOTS began...
FUTMobile,39k05s,kev11111,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:49:30 2015 UTC,nope no guarantees but if released they should do it by tomorrow as is usual. it would look sort of weird if they didn't release it for la liga but did it for bpl and bundes. as to why 4days i think longer the 100k packs are on market more the number of people who will buy fifa points especially if they are lucky.They can't do it every week though as then they would lose rarity of 100k packs and people wont open any other packs but iam pretty sure their business strategy is to make as much as possible on tots weeks especially la liga.
FUTMobile,39k05s,ukplaying,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:02:12 2015 UTC,I think thats their business model all year round isn't it?? :)
FUTMobile,39k05s,kev11111,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:22:26 2015 UTC,nope they are a public company who dont give a damn about the money and thrives on the happiness and satisfaction of their customers and the vile on their twitter page(except for this week of course) :). damn that was hard to type with a straight face lol.

FUTMobile,39j2iu,KSearle21,2,Fri Jun 12 03:00:24 2015 UTC,There was also Jetro Willems and Sven van Beek. They'll probably all get re-released into packs if EA decide do the Dutch and Belgian leagues.

FUTMobile,39fkdo,kev11111,2,Thu Jun 11 11:36:34 2015 UTC,I have 1. How much are you willing to pay
FUTMobile,39fkdo,nsm883,3,Thu Jun 11 12:38:26 2015 UTC,"I dont mind paying a reasonable price, how much u want??"
FUTMobile,39fkdo,nsm883,2,Thu Jun 11 13:13:38 2015 UTC,Well his price is skewed atm lowest bin is an overpriced 400k. how much do u think he is worth.
FUTMobile,39fkdo,nsm883,3,Thu Jun 11 13:24:05 2015 UTC,"I know, crazily overpriced thats why theyve been permanently on the market for months lol... I could get IF Fonte and IF Yoshi for less than that combined; they were my 1st choice in my other team, I just cant afford them right now :( there was a gabriel on the market for 25k start and 30 BIN tuesday night but thats still too much imo -that actually went unsold... I've got a few of the top BPL silvers but ideally I'd rather have him because I play coquelin at CDM in diamond formation and they link up brilliantly... I'd value him at 10-15k depending on the chem card, (if he has one)... that price interest you??"
FUTMobile,39fkdo,ukplaying,2,Thu Jun 11 13:42:55 2015 UTC,"25? I mean I could probably eventually sell it on for 100k. I bought one for 50 to help you,but I don't want to just give it away you know."
FUTMobile,39fkdo,nannerbots,2,Thu Jun 11 13:49:44 2015 UTC,dude do you really think he didnt see that 1 before posting?
FUTMobile,39fkdo,nannerbots,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:07:59 2015 UTC,One sold on an open bid a couple of days ago for 10K

If you forced every other member of your team to play through one player and one player ONLY, you could net around 150 goals in 50 games with ease with that one player.

FUTMobile,39d8qo,SniperWolfX3,3,Thu Jun 11 00:00:11 2015 UTC,"Each coach adds to the total percent for his attribute e.g. fitness, shooting. When you apply consumables, the value on the card is multiplied by the percentage ( which I think is maxed out at 50). For example, if you have enough managers, a 50% increase will cause your rare gold contracts (originally 28 games) to be increased to 42 games. If you apply a +10 shooting card, you can get +15 with the max amount of coaches."
FUTMobile,39d8qo,nannerbots,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:05:29 2015 UTC,yeah it is 50% max for each...

FUTMobile,39d8f9,NotfromPoland,5,Wed Jun 10 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of players dont like to discuss things like this because its less profit for them, which is fair enough... My advice to you is don't get too hung up about this player or that player... Learn about chemistry cards, how they work, their value, the best type for certain positions and the types of player they are best suited to... thats the best way to make money at your level imho... By putting the right chem cards on the right player you can quite easily make double/triple/quadruple the profit you would make on a player without one- best thing is, the majority of them cost next-to-nothing... Its the case for most of the popular players... for example; theres a certain player who's average price is 4k but with the right chem card, you can quite easily sell him at 6.5-7.5k and you only need to list once... if you buy for 3k, you're looking to make 1k profit with no chem card, 3.5-4.5k profit with card applied... most of the cards can be bought extremely cheaply providing you learn/know when the best time to buy them... Training and position cards also often raise the value of players, but best to just concentrate on 1 thing at a time for now :)"
FUTMobile,39d8f9,kev11111,0,Thu Jun 11 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"Up vote for you sir.  I like to add, in terms of real coins, I usually add to my asking BIN: +1K for a chem card. +2K for a relevant chem card. +3K for a Catalyst / Shadow Card +3 - 10K for a Hunter Card +1K per position change. +2K per relevant position change.  For good tips check out this poster @Iamfrench on www.futhead.com.  He gives ratings on players in different positions, and some LM/RM are much better as a LW/RW/or even LF/RF.  Like TOTS Hermann 85 RM is better as RW.  Good luck."
FUTMobile,39d8f9,lingmister,2,Thu Jun 11 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"thanks for that, is appreciated... itll probably get downvoted shortly when the kiddies are up and about tho lol :) Frenchies also here on twitter if you prefer...   Just thought earlier actually, check out this article on Futhead about chemistry cards... I first read it a few months ago and was very dubious at first tbh, so started experimenting myself - the results of which totally convinced me that I needed to re-evaluate my opinion; since then, I've never looked back :)  upto 10k for a hunter?? wow thats crazy... must take a few re-lists until someone bites though, surely?? I wouldnt usually go any higher than +5 but then I don't like to have to keep re-listing players lol...  Packed ToTS Hermann last night, not had chance to use him yet, but heard some good reviews about him :)"

Since he's nonrare, you can pick him up for nothing from open bids and then dump him up for a profit on the BIN. Look for players like this, but try not to focus on players who go for 25K. Focus on players who go for 3-5K so you can buy and sell in bulk. Also, buy 18 nonrare golds for their quicksell value (300 coins) and create a squad with them. Sim matches until all players are out of contracts. Then quicksell the players and get the original coins back. The coins you make from simming matches is straight profit. Hope this helps!"
FUTMobile,3991pa,nannerbots,0,Wed Jun 10 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"WOW! Thanks for all these tips, though I still have some questions:  What are common trading phrases that are used, such as ""on the BIN"" and what do they mean?  What do I do after I quick sell the players? Just repeat the process?  What formation would you recommend?  Thanks for giving me such useful information."
FUTMobile,3991pa,nannerbots,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:50:42 2015 UTC,BIN= buy it now. After you quicksell just repeat the process. The game starts you out with a 4-4-2 but I prefer a 4-3-1-2 or a 4-2-3-1.
FUTMobile,3991pa,nannerbots,0,Wed Jun 10 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"What are recommended auction settings, such as how long I should make the auction, how much I should make the min. Bid, and how I determine the BIN?  Should I sim tournaments, seasons, or quick matches?  Sorry about all the questions but I'm just so confused on some things"
FUTMobile,3991pa,ukplaying,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:07:31 2015 UTC,"There is no way to change the auction length. Set the constraint to a max bid of 300 for the golds you will quick sell. If you are looking for a specific player, set the constraints for that player and then change the buy it now price until you find a max price that only yields a few results. If the player's value if less than 3K, when you list the player for auction set the price to be 200 coins less than the current max buy it now. This will ensure that the player sells and you can quickly use the revenue generated to buy more players. When looking for the player on the open bids, set the max price to 500 coins less than the max. It it now price. Add all of the players you see to your watch list. Then bid on the players up to the amount that is 500 less than the max buy it now. This is to ensure that you won't lose coins on the player. When simming matches with your team, I think the poor chemistry and the poor quality of players won't let you win any seasons or tournaments other than then mangers cup and the starters cup. Let me know if you have any more questions as I might be doing a bad job explaining things m. It's one of those times where it makes sense in my head but I can't express it how I want to."
FUTMobile,3991pa,fifamobile,0,Wed Jun 10 05:13:01 2015 UTC,Thanks a ton! Really cleared up a lot of things for me
FUTMobile,399p6d,United4Eva,0,Wed Jun 10 07:03:05 2015 UTC,"Shrugs, any reason why Hazard is up there ? If you really want him up front, change to 4-3-2-1 formation.  If you wanna keep your current formation, Kane as your ST and Angel as CAM.   The fact that you have 94 Augero means coin is not a problem, go fill up your midfield / defense with better players like Carzola, Terry, Api (TOTS LB guy) or De Gea, Kompany"

FUTMobile,393w95,nannerbots,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:14:53 2015 UTC,I've never used the MOTM but SIF Toure is better than any other midfielder I've used. If you're looking to build a Primer League squad make sure you get him in the midfield. The only problem is that he is going for ~500K which is 400K more than his MOTM

The coins will appear and then disappear when you go into the transfer market or restart the game. If you haven't been simming then EA is just screwing you over and there's not much you can do other than hope that the coins magically reappear

If I remember correctly, which doesn't happen often, at.the start of the season Neymar was well ahead of Messi's goal count, and they didn't have Suarez at.the time. So it was only 1 of 3 for some time.   If I'm not mistaken Hazard has a teammate or two who aren't half bad either, and a manager that has won a couple games."

FUTMobile,38zaca,lingmister,2,Mon Jun 8 05:46:08 2015 UTC,Nice. I'll suggest Naldo for left CB.
FUTMobile,38zaca,lingmister,2,Mon Jun 8 06:06:25 2015 UTC,"I considered, but he is also rising up in price ($70k?). But main reason is also because i don't want two CB with H/M work rates."

Even when I get trash in the pack I still can sell the players for about 30K coins. With the 15K packs most of the rare items I get seem to be consumables. Plus, with the 100K pack you have a better chance of getting an expensive player because you'd have to average 4 rare players per 15K pack and that never happens for me."

League, Bundesliga, that's it. Then just start looking through the pages, but you have to move fast.   I was over a hundred pages in a few different times, but never made it past 7 minutes remaining. You will find all sorts of tots that have bids lower than 5-6k, even bigger names for near or below discard. Now, these are not BIN prices so your not done yet. Bid on 6-8 or so quickly as you see them. Once you have a decent amount with bids then you need to go to your transfer targets and finish off the auctions. Some you will win with that first bid, others you may take a few more bids, and still others you won't win.   I picked up 7 Naldo cards under 20k. And 10-12 under 30k. I flipped them for 55 BIN, almost all sold within minutes of listing.   Hermann for some reason I never got as cheap as Naldo, I had to go up to between 32-42k. All of which easily flipped for good profits.   Bellarabi the lowest I got was 11k, most for 14-16k, again easily flipped.  The others that show up in that price range, a CB, a CM, a RB, I all found dozens under discard. Most of which I.....discarded for a profit. I'll hold onto a few to see if they go up very much later.  Oh and Castro I was getting for 15-18k and flipped 3 of, he was more difficult to find a bargain.  Stayed up until 5am, tried to into the higher price ranges ones with my profits, bad idea. I fell asleep 5 times or more, kept mixing up players in my head, and ended up buying a toty Neuer thinking it was Robben, and wasted a huge amount of my profits.  So yeah.....there will be a toty Neuer in the giveaway if it doesn't sell. 😭"
FUTMobile,38sjdq,Krishido,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:25:24 2015 UTC,How much do you flip these players for?
FUTMobile,38sjdq,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:13:52 2015 UTC,"Its different for each one. If I want to do it fast like last night, then I'll take almost any profit after tax. I could have listed the Naldo cards a lot higher, but I might still have them now. Last night was the best night of trading for me in months.I was nearing 1 million in profit when I made that horrible Neuer purchase. Its yet to be seen how far that will set me back but I think around 250k.   For times like I described I was going for quantity over quality.So many players coming off the line cheap, just sell them for a.small profit and move on. I bought and sold a couple hundred tots cards, over about a 6 hour session, exhausting."

Shocked how OP managed to get his hands on the most expensive card of that giveaway(except NIF Ronaldo, which johnybravo didn't give away). And then johnybravo goes and deletes his account containing 1.3 mil + NIF Ronaldo, plus a lot of other good cards. I could have done with even a 100k, and been happy."

I was made aware of this when I saw that he hadn't done the giveaway ""10-12 hours"" after his first edit, showing that he might be too busy, and thus too unpredictable with the timing of his giveaway. So I checked once every half hour, whenever I was free. Saw his last edit 10 minutes before he actually did it. Went online, search for a German GK from bayern munich, with min bin 2200 max bin 2400 for 10-15 minutes constantly, got him. As for my coin situation, it wasn't good at all, and hence I took great interest in this giveaway.  And I feel sorry if you got nothing, bad luck. Maybe there will be a next time soon enough."

FUTMobile,38s1r3,messimerizing,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:46:23 2015 UTC,johnybravo said that he was selling each of them at 2300 coins BIN. OP musta had quick fingers to pick TOTY Neuer up as soon as it was put up or something. And then he must have sold him for his going price?  I am jelly of OP. Really am.

FUTMobile,38pvyk,messimerizing,2,Sat Jun 6 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I did for the Stayin' Alive tournament. Made about 200k in a total of like 2 hours of effort. For that tournament, prices were very high for OGC Nice and Cagliari players..."
FUTMobile,38p3r8,califan6868,6,Fri Jun 5 17:50:11 2015 UTC,Neither. Just buy players off the market and trade that way. Most reliable and safest method to profit. Unless you have more than 10 million.
FUTMobile,38p3r8,messimerizing,2,Fri Jun 5 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"I agree  with this, except I'm not sure what you mean by, unless you have more than 10m.   Are you saying then you have enough to open enough packs to guarantee to find good players? If this is what you mean, then while it's true you will find them, will it cover the cost of the packs bought? It's possible but unlikely, unless it's Ronaldo or something.  10 million coins is the amount I have always considered to be what you need in order to make the ""easy coins"" in this game. When you have that much it allows you the ability to scan the market freely. You can look for.any player any time, and the moment when you see a mega deal (500k or more flip) you don't have to hesitate. There is basically nothing in the game you can't afford to scoop at a moment's notice. Trust me when I say those big deals are happening every few minutes of every day, I've landed countless, and I still see them all the time, I just no longer have the coins to get them."
FUTMobile,38p3r8,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously, the richer you are, the easier it is to trade. But when you have 10m plus coins, you can always spend a million or so on packs, and not be hurt if all the packs turn out ot be shit."
FUTMobile,38p3r8,messimerizing,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely easier, but there is a threshold, or at least that's how it felt to me, where it was like a switch was flipped. I went from making 100-300k per day, to 2-15 million per day. It was uh.....nice."
FUTMobile,38p3r8,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:48:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I said, more money, easier to trade!"
FUTMobile,38p3r8,messimerizing,3,Sat Jun 6 03:51:52 2015 UTC,Not sure about tots weights by packs.  Just a reminder that the 15k packs guarantee 7 rare cards not rare players.  You can expect to get ~3 rare players from a 15k pack.  That being said i have pulled a few tots and other informs lately in 15k packs.
FUTMobile,38p3r8,smockteleheli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Good point, thanks"
FUTMobile,38p3r8,peter_goh15,3,Fri Jun 5 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"15k packs don't guarantee you 7 rare players, it is just seven rare items, so you could get seven rare contracts. While 100k packs are guaranteed 24 rare gold players. As for the card weights in each pack, there is no difference but people think that 100k packs have better luck just because you have to open less packs to get a good player, but it costs way more. The only time pack luck weight is different is when ea announces so and there is a special symbol on the pack"

FUTMobile,38klb1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"Oh shit!! I'm all over it, this can only be good for everyone, including EA whether they know it or not. This will undoubtedly force them to make some decisions.   Improve fifa, in order to maintain dominance in the mobile market, which benefits not only the consumer, but if the product sells well, EA benefits too.  If EA cares as little about the mobile game as it sometimes appears, then perhaps this would be enough to make them bow out and focus on consoles. This would provide a large increase in customers and revenue for PES, which would afford them the ability to create an awesome product.  No matter what the competition is only good for the advancement of the mobile game, so I'm ecstatic to hear about this, thanks for posting this."
FUTMobile,38klb1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"Been playing it for a bit after reading this post.   Love the graphics within the the ""3D"" sim(wish I could control players because of how good it looks).   The management bit is good and well thought out, but I haven't played many football managers.   I don't mind not having all real players either, since I get to make a Japanese squad, which I can barely do in FIFA.   As the others here say, this can be good for FIFA players. I'm hoping it motivates them to improve ultimate team(graphically it might not change much so as to accommodate as many players as possible).   -I sort of wish they hadn't taken out career mode in FIFA"

FUTMobile,38i4a4,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:07:02 2015 UTC,Don't even get me started. Here's basically what i lost   TOTY Lahm SIF Hummels SIF Muller Full Bundasliga Team Roughly 30 TOTS that was for the giveaway. The most expensive were either 2 x Fabregas or Santi Carzola. It was worth 250k in QUICK SELL PRICES 500k worth in coins Roughly 500 players Roughly 4000 club items   So you can say that i lost a hefty ton and that the giveaway will definitely be postponed.

FUTMobile,38hscb,Danimalistic2782,2,Fri Jun 5 05:39:44 2015 UTC,well i sarted swiping recently for long shots its better and near shots its 50 50 i think adjusting camera zoom so that max area of pitch is  visible helps then try to end ur swipe in the goal post it maybe saved but it is rarely ever off target. p. s note all strikets i have used it with have 90+rating and shooting
FUTMobile,38hscb,ukplaying,2,Thu Jun 4 10:28:39 2015 UTC,I like swipe for sure.  For long shots long swipes seem to do the job.
FUTMobile,38hscb,smockteleheli,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:35:42 2015 UTC,How do I use swipe to shoot exactly? I've heard it's more accurate but none of my long shots are really on target
FUTMobile,38hscb,nantesfrance,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:18:20 2015 UTC,"Alright I made a version of this a while ago, hopefully this is slightly better. I am using a phone app, and have zero skills in this arena, so laugh at the amateur nature all you want, it is the best I can do in ten minutes.  http://imgur.com/jJtRe1U  The zones I drew out are where I like to swipe from, in order with 1 being the best area, to 5 where I find it impossible, but that might be me. I only swipe in the first half with any expectation of success, just how it feels comfortable.  Zone 1 if open, very high success rate. Zone 2 half as much as 1. Zone 3 higher than 2 I just don't make a clean arc as easily. Zone 4 just below 2 and 3. Sone 5....fuck zone 5.  The closer to the net you are, the more arc is required, and vice-versa. It doesn't matter what foot you kick it with, or what direction your arc is heading. I score just as many with the outside of the wrong foot, from the wrong angle, as I do with everything the way would want in real life.  The best way I can describe the power, is medium. 😕 If you swipe too hard it flies over the net, also if you swipe too straight. If you swipe too soft, the gk easily catches it, and the announcer says some bullshit that pisses you off.  The Black Lines represent bad swipes. You must make a smooth arc, if it is jagged, expect crap shots. If you swipe straight, expect crap shots. Nice big smooth arcs up close, gradually straightening out the further back you are, but never straight.  I don't use it real close to the net, maybe it works I don't know. I just don't think it's necessary so try it if you want.  I let my daughter play most of my shootouts, and I learned something watching her. She swipes with a nice soft arc for her shootout attempts, I don't think she really knows she does, but she scores more than I do. I only recently started trying it, but it's not too bad so far. So maybe try it sometime, you never know maybe a kindergartner can teach us a thing or two.  TL/DR yeah....sorry. look at picture....go swipe."

Personally, I guess it depends on how badly you need the money Peter.... If you can't buy Robben without selling sanchez first and Robben appears on the market at a nice price, whilst you been holding out on alexis, you may miss out because of it... on the other hand if you sell him too quickly or cheaply that could also have an effect on getting the shiny-headed tulip-warrior :D"

FUTMobile,38hfk5,kev11111,3,Thu Jun 4 10:01:17 2015 UTC,"In my mind, the rating system for TOTS is kinda screwed. The Castro guy with his TOTS rating is equal to Lahm... Despite how great he may have played in the Bundesliga, I don't think his card should compare to Lahm. As people have said, it's EA being greedy for packs. Hell, the overall ratings don't even seem to matter as much... In my BPL team, Schurrle outperforms Hazard every game."

FUTMobile,38hfk5,kev11111,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:22:15 2015 UTC,well ea has to sell packs as futmobile is free that is their only source and their peek time is toty and tots and with the horrible upcoming totws(i noe its a lovely time for a silver and bronze collecter) they have to give good tots cards. does castro deserve 87?i dnt know as i too dont follow it but if a player stands out among his peers for a whole season i beleive he deserves atleast a plus 5 upgrade atleast from base card as an end of season recognition as being in the top 18 at end of a season where what around 250 to 300 players  were used and a plus 2 in the next fifa(different rules for 90rated and above). well put it this he will play better than irl for 2months but his base card was shitter than irl for 10 months this was his compensation
FUTMobile,38hfk5,lingmister,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:52:08 2015 UTC,"I believe a.strong upgrade is called for also. Just not one so strong that he now is amongst the very best on the entire game, when before was hardly even noticed. And this isn't just for mobile so it's not the only way they make money. I just think it goes a little too far."
FUTMobile,38hfk5,nyza,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:55:11 2015 UTC,"Castro is surprisingly very good in-game I played him in a really obscure German squad with Baier a few times and they absolutely bossed the midfield, both really OP... their WR's are more like H/H than M/M... I'm  going to try his ToTS shortly so will let you know how that works out :)  I think yr reading too much into it personally m8, its just like ToTY, another massive money-maker for EA, the fact that he takes up residency on your TL because he's not as in-demand as others bears no relation to how he plays IRL which is how he earned the card... Tbh I haven't seen much of him play this season, but if he can be voted over someone like Schweini, then he must of had a very good season indeed... Btw, you try to sell him for 750?? Really?? I just normally - or used to - quick-sell cards like that, because with only 30 spaces to begin with, (minus the 2 stuck cards in my TL), the potentially minimal ROI on a player like him just isn't worth it imho..."
FUTMobile,38gjt9,Toobuckchuk,2,Thu Jun 4 01:43:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. The packs will probably be released Friday or Saturday evening
FUTMobile,38gjt9,nannerbots,2,Thu Jun 4 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, because just the fact that a new tots is here should lower prices. Also 50k, and then 100k packs are coming and that will lower them also.  I would say if you can sell for a profit, I would do it today or tomorrow. After 100k packs the prices will go up, but at that point people will either already have their tournament squads complete, or just not be playing the tournament as much.  TL/DR  sooner rather than later, whenever you can profit."

To my surprise, when I hit buy it now, I actually got it! I feel bad for the seller, but at least I plan to play Sanchez in a lot of matches, not just profit off of his/her misfortune. With that ridiculously cheap one in my club, I sold off the one mentioned in this post for 430k."

FUTMobile,388j6f,iiHeffronDriveii,2,Tue Jun 2 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"When 100k packs are available, people dump cards as low as 10-20% their normal value sometimes, and at 50% of their value constantly. This is the time to buy, then hold them for a couple days until the market regulates, then sell for a hefty profit. Make yourself familiar with a few players and stick to them, so you don't make mistakes.  When I traded at that level I used Gundogan, Abaumayeng,.and Bender as a CM not as a CDM. They are easy to search for being from the same club, and they are common in 100k packs, also regularly are sold well below 50% of their normal market value on these days.   Pick whatever players you are most comfortable with, and are able to switch between searches quickly. You need to be.constantly scanning, very fast. The more ground you cover the more likely you are to find them, they only stay up for maybe 10 seconds so keep your coin amounts specific when searching or there will be too many pages to look through efficiently.  T L/DR what DawnoftheSuarez said....."
FUTMobile,388j6f,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"Oooooo, and how can you tell when 100k packs are about to be released?"
FUTMobile,388j6f,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"They don't tell you when they are released, but they are normally on Saturday at key times, such as 6, 8, 10 or 11pm GMT, aka 1, 3, 5 or 6 pm EST, or 10 am, 12, 2 or 3 pm PST"
FUTMobile,388j6f,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:57:35 2015 UTC,"They used to always be released for Saturday, and Sunday.

Sorry I can't be more specific about that."
FUTMobile,387v8j,ninjapotato59,4,Tue Jun 2 14:02:36 2015 UTC,"Through ball, can't live without it, I've tried."
FUTMobile,387v8j,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Jun 2 15:15:13 2015 UTC,I am talking with reference to just offline gameplay.   SKILL MOVES FOR DAYZ. Seriously.
FUTMobile,387v8j,vaow93,2,Tue Jun 2 14:13:47 2015 UTC,Are there specific ones you prefer?
FUTMobile,387v8j,shell839,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"I love all of them. But the most efficient ones are roulettes, rainbows, turns a.k.a Ronaldo chops and MOST EFFECTIVE of all, change lane. Rolls, elasticos(flip-flops), backheels are some of the other fancy moves."
FUTMobile,387v8j,vaow93,2,Wed Jun 3 10:13:32 2015 UTC,"Strictly w.r.t offline play, Skill moves is the best. I was a huge fan of the through ball when it was introduced and got used to it very quickly. When I switched back to skill moves, I had hard time adjusting. I kept at it and now I love Skill moves. Like /u/DawnoftheSuarez mentioned, through ball is not particularly helpful in the long run (IMHO). With skill moves not only will you be able to pull off some killer moves while on the go but also have no dependency on a second player having to move into right position before the pass. With skill moves, the normal pass will allow you to pass the ball in blank spaces which accounts for through ball."
FUTMobile,387v8j,sdesai77,3,Wed Jun 3 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"Through ball. Good passing and calling for good runs, as well as not always sprinting can make up for beating defenders, and the lobbed through ball can be so overpowered in the game. If anyone remembers or has seen the KSI kickoff glitch from FIFA 14, you can newly replicate it by double tapping pass back of kickoff, waiting a second with the midfielder and lobbing a through ball at 2/3 power straight up the pick from just outside the half circle can give you some flawless breakaways, along with many other ways of using the through ball"
FUTMobile,3870c6,ninjapotato59,3,Tue Jun 2 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"In a final of a tournament 4 or 5 months ago I decided to put +10's on everyone for the win. They were all moving around so fast and strangely, I wasn't used to it and I got spanked, I never used them again."
FUTMobile,3870c6,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Jun 2 09:44:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're talking about the All Attributes +10 cards, or about the pace boosts (since you mentioned ""moving around so fast and strangely""), because last time I checked pace boosts were +8.  My question was about the latter, however."
FUTMobile,3870c6,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:16:56 2015 UTC,"It was the +10 to all attributes, sorry I was vague on that. I think it was almost 3am I hardly even remember it, I was half zombie at the time."
FUTMobile,3870c6,ukplaying,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:26:13 2015 UTC,from my experience the pace boost increases the speed but not as much as it says maybe around plus 3 or 4 when 8 is indicated

But as Barca won the title, I automatically assumed that Alba would get it...  However, It's possible, I suppose, that Marcelo may get benched...  If he gets in the BBVA TOTS his price will plummet.. If he doesn't, his price will rocket!  It's hard to gauge really... EA have been quite unpredictable this year, as has the market!.."

FUTMobile,384mmy,bitchfaceronaldo,5,Mon Jun 1 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"TOTS Aguero is pretty amazing imo. He's a bit faster than NIF Messi but Messi feels a lot smoother to use whlie Aguero has this ""hunk"" feeling around him; he basically just FEELS really strong when he's running.   In regards to shooting, I've only ever made shots with Aguero inside the box. Reason? He never needs to make long shots. He's fast and strong enough to get past defenders while Messi lacks a bit in strength but makes up for it with INSANE dribbling. Aguero rarely misses and his shot feels incredible; 95 shot power and 99 finishing will do that for you. Messi is also pretty accurate in his shots; more reliable than the likes of Suarez I would say. He could shoot in the box as well as take good long shots. But, as far as being a shooter goes, TOTS Aguero feels way better (I'm dead serious when I say that his shots are orgasmic. The way the ball goes in: it hits the net and just bounces right off, net isn't even rattled LOL).  Dribbling: I haven't really played enough games with TOTS Aguero to get an extensive review of his dribbling. However, in the games that I've played him, he was able to get around defenders fairly easily. 97 dribbling speaks for itself I guess. With NIF Messi, the dribbling feels really really good; it's part of the reason why he feels so smooth to play in the first place. He gets past defenders pretty well imo.  Passing: pretty good passing from NIF Messi, no complaints. As for Aguero: Passing? What passing? Why pass when you can just shoot it in ;)  Defending: Uhm well I've tried putting NIF Messi in goal for a few games and he was a pretty good keeper surprisingly...#1 defender confirmed.  Physical: Aguero feels a lot stronger than Messi; 79 strength to 60 strength is a huge difference. While it might not be Diego Costa high (guy has fucking 98 strength holy shit), it's enough to keep the ball most of the time. Messi just relies on dribbling imo.  Not a very detailed review but that's all I can give LOL. I would really recommend TOTS Aguero paired with a TOTS Cazorla along with SIF Sanchez and NIF Hazard at RW(yes it's 7 chem but it's sufficient when you play, trust me), or, if you have the money, go with the TOTS versions of Hazard and Sanchez. Would really recommend getting TOTS Aguero."
FUTMobile,384mmy,Krishido,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:20:41 2015 UTC,Super awesome review. My suggestion? Play both on a squad!

FUTMobile,384mmy,Krishido,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:02:23 2015 UTC,How do you dribble in the mobile version ? Just twisting/turning with the stick or use the skilled moves ?
FUTMobile,384mmy,pellias,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:07:07 2015 UTC,"both. Learn the skill moves, they are very useful. And Messi's dribbling is absolutely brilliant."
FUTMobile,384mmy,messimerizing,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"I paired Hazard, Sanchez at LF/RF with Costa (can't spend 1m just for Aguero when other TOTS is not even revealed !). These 3 itself already won me alot of games in Div 1 Offline.  Once Serie A TOTS is revealed, i may get the A-M-T (Aguero, Messi, Tevez) instead of my usual H-M-T(Higuain, Messi, Tevez) up front."

FUTMobile,381b5n,hobohawk,2,Mon Jun 1 03:11:43 2015 UTC,Actually the prices are lowest when there are lots of jumbo player packs. When you have special deals like increased chances the prices drop even more.   So the prices were the lowest on Sunday. By today the prices are already going up. Tots Sanchez and hazard are all trading about 100k above their lowest average price.  Fabregas is about 15-20k above the lowest average price.   This has been the trend and will go up towards wed before the new Tots are launched.   However the prices tends to stabilize after the new tots and totw as people just focus on the new one.   Good luck!
FUTMobile,381b5n,lingmister,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:27:43 2015 UTC,What is the price of tots Sanchez now?

FUTMobile,380183,PhantomMic,1 point,Sun May 31 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"For the ones I've tried:   Costa  Cazorla Sanchez Kane Fonte  Clyne  Bolasie Matic    Matic was absolute trash for me. Tried him at CM, CDM and even CB and every time an attacker would come at him he would create a pathway for them to run straight through and get a shot away. Sometimes he would even go as far as body checking my other CB so they couldn't get to the attacker either. Costa and Cazorla on the other hand turned out to be absolute gods. Cazorla does a perfect throughball that Costa always gets to and finishes it perfectly every time. The other good combo is Kane and Sanchez. Sanchez just shoots up the wing and does a low ground cross right onto Kane's foot. Fonte, Clyne and Bolasie were decent but nothing spectacular."
FUTMobile,380183,lingmister,2,Mon Jun 1 00:31:16 2015 UTC,I second this. Matic was just Meh for me. Worked a little better as a CM or in a CM role.
FUTMobile,380183,drkspace,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:18:17 2015 UTC,I use a squad of all tots bpl players (except Terry and fonte) and I used all of the major ones except Costa. 1. Sanchez  2. Aguero  3. Clyne/cazorla/matic

FUTMobile,380183,lingmister,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"oo I see. I'm planning on getting Aguero 1st and then Sanchez. Aguero because he's a beast and Sanchez because, well, BPL sorely lacks good RWs. His NIF hasn't been very impressive; has decent pace but can't really finish. Same thing with Navas."

FUTMobile,37zqgl,marqueemessi,3,Sun May 31 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"Well, do a little distance out of the box shots count as ""long shots""? Or are you talking about 35 yard plus screamers only?"
FUTMobile,37zqgl,vaow93,2,Sun May 31 19:57:28 2015 UTC,35 yard plus
FUTMobile,37zqgl,Tyson_Wilkins,3,Sun May 31 20:01:19 2015 UTC,Swiping is way more accurate that pressing the shoot button on long shots. Someone else will probably be able to give a better suggestion

FUTMobile,37zqgl,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/ilRETHHiCVo  This is what happens when I try to capture a swipe rather then just play. I thought I could do it and play naturally, apparently not. I either try to force my way into position, or if I'm in position, but the defense is in the way I still try to force the shot.  The game is horrible, unless you like defense, I did well defensively. Skip to the end because the shootout is epic, well maybe epic isn't the proper description, just watch it, at the very least you have to see how bad I can be and get away with it."

That's on either the second or third best quality resolution, and second best frame rate. The best settings take up too much space.   What I really like is it shows the touches, perfect for swipe videos. You can even put the front camera in a little box on the screen if you want, nobody is going to want to see me that's why I don't do it, but it's a.cool option for someone who wanted to really become a full blown mobile youtuber."

This game proves it horribly, then I get fucked over at the very end of the game. I do score a decent swipe from just outside the corner of the box.   I'm recording every game from now on and just deleting ones that have nothing. That way I might actually capture some naturally developed swipes."
FUTMobile,37zqgl,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:06:22 2015 UTC,Pick the right player. Rakitic TIF seems to be the most consistent long shot for me. 2 for 2 so far. Neymar possible but better with free kicks.   I also found strangely the LB/RB are good options.  Gaya and that RB 77 from Spurs is also good.

FUTMobile,380dfq,mpassell99,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad you got it."
FUTMobile,380dfq,mpassell99,1 point,Sun May 31 23:33:15 2015 UTC,"You got a very good deal. At some point, I tried to track down some La Liga managers and league-changing cards and they were ridiculously expensive.  Oh, and you avoided using the truly shitty market search functionality for league cards. That's probably more important than the coins you saved. ;)"
FUTMobile,380dfq,GoldenPone,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:18:28 2015 UTC,Lol I actually checked using the search functions but most of them were on bid with 2 days remaining and I didnt want to wait that long haha
FUTMobile,37zq15,mpassell99,2,Sun May 31 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"NIF Messi + NIF Ronaldo. TOTS Sanchez + TOTS Hazard. Both combos up top are motherfucking amazing. If you can, TOTS Sanchez/TOTS Hazard + NIF Ronaldo up top with NIF Messi at CAM would be imo one of the most potent attacks in the game. The IF versions of CR7 and Messi aren't really worth the extra amount to me, their NIFs are so good in themselves..."
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,2,Sun May 31 19:55:54 2015 UTC,Like this?
FUTMobile,37zq15,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun May 31 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"No, I meant either TOTS Sanchez or TOTS Hazard at ST along with Ronaldo at ST , and with Messi playing CAM."
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,2,Sun May 31 20:10:58 2015 UTC,Tho striker Ronaldo would give much better chem
FUTMobile,37zq15,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun May 31 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"First ST Ronaldo is going for under 1.5 as of last night. The RB ST Ronaldo was around 2.7, both insanely low prices. Might even continue dropping if this week is the bbva week."
FUTMobile,37zq15,Danimalistic2782,-1,Sun May 31 23:37:14 2015 UTC,"OOH! 3 chem points more! FANCY..... but seriously though, 3 chem points make no difference,atleast not a difference worth spending an extra 1 million+ on."
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,2,Sun May 31 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"I just hate players on crappy chem because I'm crazy like that. I know it makes no difference, I'm just insane and plus pretty colours on IF/RB"
FUTMobile,37zq15,Tyson_Wilkins,-2,Sun May 31 20:24:55 2015 UTC,Yep. Pretty colors any day over the ability to buy NIF Messi +NIF Ronaldo + TOTS Sanchez . /s
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,1 point,Sun May 31 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the color of the boot under their picture, it must be green!"
FUTMobile,37zq15,Danimalistic2782,0,Sun May 31 23:39:06 2015 UTC,I know right? /s
FUTMobile,37zq15,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun May 31 20:29:10 2015 UTC,How would you rank the BPL TOTS players? Like Top 5 or Top 6
FUTMobile,37zq15,Krishido,1 point,Sun May 31 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"I got TOTS Sanchez earlier today. I'm trying to visualize how to set up a squad as you described without a lot of red up front. The link between Ronaldo and Messi would be orange, but the other two would be red. If only there were more Chilean players."
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,2,Wed Jun 3 00:43:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the sample squad. The chemistry up top doesn't look great, but otherwise it's awesome."
FUTMobile,37zq15,gimmethat____,1 point,Sun May 31 20:11:30 2015 UTC,Read what I wrote above.
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,1 point,Sun May 31 20:12:38 2015 UTC,Saw it. Thanks.
FUTMobile,37zq15,vaow93,1 point,Sun May 31 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. With the insane state of the market, I might be able to get all of those players, plus TOTY Robben. Crazy!"
FUTMobile,37zq15,Danimalistic2782,2,Sun May 31 20:10:31 2015 UTC,Toty robben is a god at rw iknow he's not as glamorous as Messi or Ronaldo but he's definitely the best bang for your buck
FUTMobile,37zq15,Krishido,2,Sun May 31 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"Cool! I've really enjoyed his NIF, so I'll try to get either his TOTY or TOTS card during Bundesliga TOTS."
FUTMobile,37zq15,Krishido,2,Sun May 31 20:13:50 2015 UTC,DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN 10K ON ANY KEEPER.
FUTMobile,37zq15,lingmister,2,Sun May 31 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"Because it doesn't make enough of a difference? My one ""fancy"" keeper was Neuer and my phone's auto-complete of his name (Neuter) was very fitting. I was hoping it was just him."
FUTMobile,37zq15,Krishido,2,Sun May 31 20:18:50 2015 UTC,Just stick with any keeper with decent kicking and speed and who goes for 10-15k max.
FUTMobile,37zq15,lingmister,2,Sun May 31 20:19:58 2015 UTC,Alves is the one for me for gold players. Great keeper and versatile link maker.
FUTMobile,37zq15,Hijodeputa811,1 point,Sun May 31 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah. I used him for awhile in a La Liga squad, before trying out Iraizoz."
FUTMobile,37zq15,Krishido,2,Mon Jun 1 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"I second this. I've played with TOTY Neuer (statistically the best keeper in the game), and yet he's still only as effective as other rare-gold goal keepers like Bravo or Casillas. If you play on Android, any attacker in Semi-Pro difficulty or above will score on you if they get a decent shot in the box. Sometimes I feel like the AI Keepers are better than most of my keepers."
FUTMobile,37ytz1,Andrott,2,Sun May 31 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"Ouch man.. I'm experiencing the complete opposite!... I'm getting the 7k and the rare player pack every time!   Is it happening all the time or has it just started happening? If it's just started, you may have hit the 150k coin limit?"
FUTMobile,37ytz1,RedEyeJedi2303,2,Sun May 31 15:47:17 2015 UTC,Seriously? How many times have you won it?
FUTMobile,37ytz1,nannerbots,1 point,Sun May 31 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"Yeh, serious man... I've won it over 50 times over the past 3 days... Each time I win, instead of turning green and saying completed, it goes back to blue saying featured...  Got lucky I guess?!"
FUTMobile,37ytz1,RedEyeJedi2303,1 point,Sun May 31 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"It has been happening for the last 2 hours (as far as I know). Was not aware of the limit but to hit that I should have won 30 tournaments and am pretty sure I have played less (what with the shitty app crashes and server restarts in addition to managing the transfer market) =/  Edit: Also, if I had crossed the limit, couldn't EA have come up with a bloody message warning me of it instead of crashing the app and letting me continue wasting contracts in tournaments? Blaggards."
FUTMobile,37ytz1,RedEyeJedi2303,2,Sun May 31 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"EA be as helpful as an in game message... That's just wishful thinking? :)  I'm not sure, the daily limit was the only thing I could think of... It resets and 1am BST if that is what you're experiencing...! ;)"
FUTMobile,37ytz1,RedEyeJedi2303,1 point,Sun May 31 16:58:50 2015 UTC,I know. But still giving me the coins and then taking it away feels way too cruel.
FUTMobile,37ytz1,ukplaying,1 point,Sun May 31 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yeh, it's extremely frustrating, especially if you keep going without realising as you did... I'm lucky that I keep getting the pack, and as its a 50k rare player pack,(with increased chance till 11pm)  it makes it worth carrying on, even after hitting the limit. (Which I have, about half an hour ago) :)"
FUTMobile,37ytz1,RedEyeJedi2303,1 point,Sun May 31 19:48:11 2015 UTC,so what did u pull from 50 rare player packs
FUTMobile,37ytz1,RedEyeJedi2303,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"All BPL TOTS except Aguero... NIF's worth mentioning, Messi, Robben, Ribery.. The most painful thing about having this 'lucky glitch' is having to discard big pulls.. 3x Terry 3x Bolasie 2x Fabregas 2x Matic 2x Clynne 2x Austin ... And it's more like 70 rare player packs now (and still counting too!) :D"
FUTMobile,37ytz1,ukplaying,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"And here they are...  http://imageshack.com/a/img661/1700/mBqdq5.jpg  http://imageshack.com/a/img540/6069/X21pkI.jpg  Hopefully, I'll be able to add Aguero by Wednesday...   To add to the latest discard list, Jose Fonte and De Gea... :("
FUTMobile,37ykar,ukplaying,3,Sun May 31 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"Heh, I always have this player stuck and expired. But not TOTS card. Guess the same to someone somewhere"
FUTMobile,37y093,tevin16,2,Sun May 31 10:06:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, nice pull. And in a free 5k pack makes it sound even better."
FUTMobile,37y81q,peter_goh15,1 point,Sun May 31 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/33357466/  As long as you have loyalty, you should be fine with 100 chem. You can swap out players with the NIF or IF or TOTY even if you want. Probably isn't the best squad but that's what i came up with in 5 minutes"
FUTMobile,37y81q,nannerbots,1 point,Sun May 31 12:22:51 2015 UTC,Here's my attempt:  http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/33370117/
FUTMobile,37y81q,Tyson_Wilkins,0,Sun May 31 15:01:55 2015 UTC,http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/33356890/
FUTMobile,37x7e1,marqueemessi,3,Sun May 31 03:45:15 2015 UTC,http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/33333679/ This can be upgraded further
FUTMobile,37x7e1,aznc00kies,2,Sun May 31 05:02:06 2015 UTC,Koscielny for Silva for full chem
FUTMobile,37x7e1,nannerbots,1 point,Sun May 31 05:03:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't notice that when I building it"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,aznc00kies,2,Sun May 31 05:20:20 2015 UTC,"What formation? Never mind, I made you this cheeky BraziPLigue1 41212.  A manager or loyalty will up the chem to 100, and you can use any IF, MOTM, TOTS or TOTY cards you deem necessary to improve it further"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 04:15:57 2015 UTC,If you use Pelegrini will Aguero get to 9 chem?
FUTMobile,37x7e1,nannerbots,2,Sun May 31 04:57:17 2015 UTC,"Pellegrini will definitely give Aguero 7, possibly 8 chem, and the 10 game loyalty bonus will up that by another, potentially giving him 9 chem, plus chem for Pastore, Hazard, Ramires and Filipe Luis"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun May 31 05:11:05 2015 UTC,No he will be on 8 max
FUTMobile,37x7e1,gimmethat____,2,Sun May 31 05:44:16 2015 UTC,"So Pellegrini would only give him plus 1, a possibility I had stated"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 05:50:19 2015 UTC,"No, I think the manager only gives +1 chemistry, regardless if both the nationality and league are are compatible with the player"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,aznc00kies,1 point,Sun May 31 05:04:18 2015 UTC,Feel free to upgrade with IFs/TOTS:  http://imgur.com/LbiamdN
FUTMobile,37x7e1,nannerbots,1 point,Sun May 31 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"I know a guy who makes amazing squads, that's all he does. What are your requests besides the players? Formation, chemistry or anything else matter?  Let me know and I'll send him the info."
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 05:32:19 2015 UTC,Shhhhhhhhhh Dan.......let someone else win this once
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 05:51:15 2015 UTC,Lol I.didn't even read the coins part. I'll wait until there is a winner before I post one.
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Danimalistic2782,-1,Sun May 31 06:13:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm the only person who hates making hybrids without links between the 2 leagues/countries, and just having 2 separate parts with a bunch of red links between them. Futheads linkbot is actually the greatest invention of all time for this reason"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,3,Sun May 31 05:13:57 2015 UTC,I think I know a guy who hates not having good links.....
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 06:14:11 2015 UTC,"Not just that, but when you see, for example, a 442 with the left side Marcelo, Ramos, Ronaldo, Iniesta and Messi, and the right side is Boateng, Piszcek, De Bruyne, Robben and Lewandowski with Neuer in goal, that squad would probably get 100 chem and count as a hybrid, even though there are no links between the 2 squads. I mean, for the love of God, you couldn't have used Ter Stegen or Thiago? I just feel it shows no effort of even trying to make some semblance of a hybrid, and rather just cutting 2 squads in half and shoving them together EDIT: The rando squad I just listed gets 97 chem, and will hit 100 with either a manger or loyalty EDIT 2: If you use Schweinsteiger or Lahm instead of De Bruyne, you get 100 chem automatically"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 06:24:41 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, that's my absolute favorite part.of the game, even more than trading. Since the transfer market disaster the way I use the game is totally different, I play a lot more, trade less, and am broke because of it. Back then though when I wasn't trading, I was squad building. Part of the reason I didn't play often is because I could never find a squad I was totally satisfied with.   That's why I always go to the guy I do now because he is a master. That and he deals with my OCD and makes the squads just how I like them, redless, and full of informs, and he's fast."
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 06:30:29 2015 UTC,"Solid. I have a BPL starting XI with 5 (hopefully 7 or 8 soon) TOTS and 2 IFs. I also farmed up about 1.5 mill during TOTY, and have since spent all of it and haven't traded since, similar to yourself"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 06:38:12 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been trading, just not nearly at the rate I was. Now I trade just enough to buy the players I'm after. Before it was an obsession, just to pile up the coins, I was like a fucking oil barren or something. I'll dig up some screenshots of some of my hybrids I've used and post them."
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 07:07:26 2015 UTC,"I toyed around with some hunter cards to make a quick buck for a 100k pack, but other than that pretty cold turkey"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 07:23:29 2015 UTC,"You could also make.some defensive changes. Naldo on the right and Miranda on the left, with Alves at gk. Still a badass squad IMO, and much better chemistry, people.l have no creativity."
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 07:12:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think of the Brazilian linkage, which just shows how many ways you could hybridize a squad, rather than just shoving together the two halves. You could also use Kroos or Khedira in the LCM spot for links"
FUTMobile,37x7e1,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sun May 31 07:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, MOTM Thiago works as a good link if you prefer special cards like I do. Before him I always used Alonzo, it would be awesome if he got a tots then I could use him again."
FUTMobile,37xvxa,oompaloompafifa,6,Sun May 31 08:53:06 2015 UTC,PRAISE JESUS THEY CAME BACK. BACK TO BIDDING NOW
FUTMobile,37xvxa,Danimalistic2782,2,Sun May 31 08:53:55 2015 UTC,"Lucky man, it's not going that well for some people, who have had similar problems.  Edit: oh and by the way, I had nothing to do with it, so no need to praise me my son. 😜"
FUTMobile,37xvxa,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Sun May 31 09:07:51 2015 UTC,"Funny because Dan is essentially the God of this subreddit. He has everything, earned it completely legitimately, and sees the value in those who are lower rates, and prefers to use them"
FUTMobile,37xvx6,lingmister,3,Sun May 31 08:53:01 2015 UTC,"And you are using recent prices with your comparison also. Consider where the market was before EA began releasing tons of good players to create the initial crash before the market was taken down. There were dozens of players that went for 15m, and around 20 were extinct. To my knowledge there are no cards currently selling at 15m.   Aguero's FIF was hard for me to get, and I payed 13.9, which I thought was a steal. I just listed it for 230k.....minor loss. Costa's FIF was 8-10m. James IF got up to 7.5, it was crazy for a while. That's also when it was incredibly easy to make outrageous trading profits, millions per night could be had.  Ibrahimovic MOTM is almost extinct, I see one here and there, same with Benedetto's MOTM, the only truly extinct card is the one I don't believe actually exists on mobile.......Sammaratino, I swear if I ever see one, I'll sell my top 25 cards to have it."
FUTMobile,37xvx6,Danimalistic2782,2,Sun May 31 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"Agree Dan that this is a matter of perspective. Good point.   I guess in this game there is no such thing as a long term investment. The moment you buy something expect the price to drop.   It is sad, and I hope it changes, that we can only enjoy the game so late into the season.   Hopefully in future we can be better prepared. And such a community will help.   Thanks for your thoughts."
FUTMobile,37xvx6,drkspace,1 point,Sun May 31 11:28:56 2015 UTC,Ya I did the same for that Aguero and I lost my hat on him
FUTMobile,37xvx6,Boosterflex,2,Mon Jun 1 01:24:38 2015 UTC,"There was a spell when if investments went up. That disappeared a few months ago. I wonder if prices will now stay this low, or will they climb again before 16 arrives? If you look at the remaining Fifa 14 market most if's are frozen at very high prices.i don,t expect the same, but maybe some recovery? What do you think?"
FUTMobile,37xvx6,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 11:53:22 2015 UTC,"Actually that's not totally true. I bought SIF (I think?) Coutinho 83 for 10k bid, motm Quaresma for 25k etc. These will likely not get tots. Many silver informs are going at very low prices. Ie under 100k. Many below 30k.   The market is generally depressed.   Personally I do not think it will recover. It's the end of the season, people are going to move on after tots to FIFA 16. And the whole rubbish cycle starts again.   Thanks for sharing your thoughts."
FUTMobile,37xvx6,nyza,1 point,Sun May 31 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"I think it will be very difficult for it to recover very much. So many coins have been taken out of the market. People playing far less games, while watching the market, and dumping coins into packs. There are simply less coins for everyone to spend, so in order to sell you need to lower the price."
FUTMobile,37xvx6,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"dudeeeee, TOTY Ronaldo and Messi are about to drop below 3m!!!"
FUTMobile,37xvx6,nyza,1 point,Sun May 31 18:58:41 2015 UTC,You're alive!! Yeah I saw Messi below 3m a few times last night. I made what may prove to be a horrible move so I was watching his prices closely yesterday.
FUTMobile,37xvx6,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"yep still here lol.  And don't tell me you bought him! Wait until Liga TOTS to buy them, I think that's when they're gonna be at their lowest. Man like a month ago I said I would buy both if they dropped below 4m, now it's gonna be if they drop below 2m (which it looks like they are hahaha)"
FUTMobile,37xvx6,nyza,1 point,Sun May 31 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"No, I sold my MOTM Messi when I saw they released it again. I thought the price would fall, then for some reason it went from 2 1/2 pages of them with a low BIN of 2.9, to a half page with a low BIN of 3.5m. I sold mine at 2.85 and was planning to buy it back later much cheaper. I went to bed last night thinking I lost my best MOTM card. I haven't gone on yet today to see if it's true....I'm scared."
FUTMobile,37xvx6,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 31 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"Dont worry he'll keep dipping right now, because he's more expensive than the TOTY version. Just give it around a week and you should be able to buy him back for way cheaper"

FUTMobile,37xvx6,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:21:06 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking, because it's going to be the most popular TOTS (assuming ronaldo, messi, neymar, and suarez all get a TOTS card)."

Came fucking close though, I stopped bidding at 100k, then watched someone win it for 106k. Looking at the prices now, I should have went after it, even though it was over the 100k."

FUTMobile,37vrtz,marqueemessi,3,Sat May 30 20:27:36 2015 UTC,I honestly have no idea. I didn't expect Hazard to reach 4 mil let alone 500K. The only difference with Ibra is that he will be by far the best player in the Ligue 1 TOTS. So I think his price might be a little high because of that.
FUTMobile,37vrtz,nannerbots,1 point,Sat May 30 20:32:45 2015 UTC,i just want to know if it'll get under 2.5 mill cuz thats about as much as ill have once i sell my sir ibra

FUTMobile,37utbz,aaninja64,-2,Sat May 30 16:49:20 2015 UTC,well i said matic to limit chelsea players in squad otherwise one of the Southampton fbs (maybe clyne as he is a rerelease)  i think 3 players for a team finishing 7th is 1 too many as it sort of indicates that the other 8 players(main team) played horribly which wasnt the case.i feel they played well as a team but just ran out of legs for the 2nd half of the season but they had the 2nd best defensive record and u could argue with that and i respect that opinion too
FUTMobile,37utbz,Nando05,1 point,Sat May 30 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"I definitely thought David Silva should've gotten a TOTS card, he's one of a few players with 3 informs ffs."

FUTMobile,37vgaq,mpassell99,1 point,Sat May 30 20:44:09 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. Lloris will have a 5.5 rating and get a nomination because he didn't have to do anything all game

Drew Chelsea in the first round, then all easy games after that, won the final 5-0. The most I've ever scored on world class with a silver squad.  Ended up getting a tots, and an inform. Both of them were crappy, compared to yours. Nikoulo, and.....Spanish GK, can't remember his name, Sanchez maybe?"

FUTMobile,37sims,kev11111,1 point,Sat May 30 01:06:53 2015 UTC,You can still pack all of these guys. EA don't update a player's club until you see their card on futhead.  Mane is still silver:  http://www.futhead.com/15/players/39339/sadio-mane/  Assaidi is still with Stoke:  http://www.futhead.com/15/players/38697/oussama-assaidi/  Malanda is still with Wolfsburg:  http://www.futhead.com/15/players/29643/junior-malanda/
FUTMobile,37sims,nannerbots,1 point,Sat May 30 01:16:44 2015 UTC,So sad that Malanda passed.
FUTMobile,37sims,lingmister,1 point,Sat May 30 01:45:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, such a great young talent, world was at his feet :("
FUTMobile,37sims,nannerbots,1 point,Sat May 30 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"Assaidi is playing in Abu Dhabi, as I noted, his cards still on Futhead because it's still available in-game from the time he was at Stoke, they don't remove all the cards from the game when player's no longer play for a club represented in FUT, they just remove them from packs, (most of the time), the same goes for Malanda... As for Mane, I don't know the official reason his Gold card isnt there but I have seen scores of cards on Futhead - NIF's as well as special cards, that haven't been upgraded or updated, for example, some with no stats at all so I believe thats something to do with Futheads scripts personally; I dont accept that if it doesn't appear on Futhead it hasn't been updated, otherwise, by the mane example you listed, he wouldn't have a gold card in-game... Its just EA's Lazy programming, like when a player changes club or nation, they update the card but you can't find them on search unless you search using their old club/nation... Some players who have IF's in different positions can't be found unless you search using their normal NIF position - CDM Toulalan for instance can't be found unless you search for CB... Then you got the players they temporarily update, David Villa for example, they update his card for a week or 2, then the card changes back to their old clubs - no idea the reasoning behind that... Don't even get me started on why there's no KAKA or Ronaldinho on mobile - EA have really missed a trick on that one... Anyways, let's just hope they do a better job with 16 huh?? :)"
FUTMobile,37sims,gimmethat____,1 point,Sat May 30 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"Also, I believe its something to do with those Premium silver jumbo packs, because its only when they're on offer that I ever pack an unavailable card; I have opened thousands of silver packs since the updates and never packed a single one of the cards I listed; whereas before the updates, it was a regular occurence... Also, the number available on the transfer market increases once these packs become available... It's strange how this could happen from a programming point of view, but hey, if something doesn't make sense, you can count on EA to be in the mix somewhere lol"
FUTMobile,37sfyl,Definitely_Lies,3,Sat May 30 00:44:34 2015 UTC,"Slap on a Jordan Henderson on there, maybe Azpi and Terry as well."

FUTMobile,37sfyl,Krishido,1 point,Sat May 30 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"Hendo's really solid: good at offense and defense. Somewhat like a better version of Enzo Perez imo. Haven't tried Terry yet but I think the stats speak for itself: 97 defense, 94 physical; not much pace but I think his defensive stats make up for it."

FUTMobile,37qqbw,gimmethat____,1 point,Fri May 29 17:14:42 2015 UTC,Not sure how Toure works as a lone CDM but maybe TOTS Matic?
FUTMobile,37qqbw,hobohawk,1 point,Fri May 29 22:31:09 2015 UTC,Toure is pretty beastly and just shuts down the whole back middle for me. What do u think about tots matic on 7 chem instead of kompany?
FUTMobile,37qqbw,hobohawk,1 point,Sat May 30 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"Kompany wasn't too great for me and I used him for about 45 games. You could try it, but I think Matic is shorter than Kompany so that could be a problem. I have used Gustavo at CB and that was fine."
FUTMobile,37qqbw,vaow93,0,Sat May 30 00:43:46 2015 UTC,"I know it seems like I ran out of coins for defense, but I honestly have not found any better CB pairings for the BPL"

FUTMobile,37pd54,lingmister,3,Fri May 29 10:14:54 2015 UTC,Oh the Magician here is Rakitic. He is AMAZING. Precision passing and long shots from outside the box. I've never been so inspired to play because of him.

FUTMobile,37pvvd,RedEyeJedi2303,1 point,Fri May 29 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, I figured it was just a common glitch or error, but it happens a little too much, EA is really bad at keeping servers working on any game apparently."
FUTMobile,37p92m,kev11111,2,Fri May 29 09:13:43 2015 UTC,"yh it is - most of the time he heads that ball and its like an exocet, but occassionally, I think he forgets, because some of the headers he's hit have been more like an aghan bronzer, scared about his turban getting knocked off; other times they just go wayward :("
FUTMobile,37p92m,kev11111,2,Fri May 29 12:49:05 2015 UTC,lol... its the only thing I could think of to accurately describe it...

FUTMobile,37p92m,United4Eva,3,Fri May 29 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"He's a beast, definitely quicker than 77 and his heading is great!"
FUTMobile,37p92m,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Sat May 30 07:31:30 2015 UTC,"Falcao is decent at heading, but shit at everything else. If you want a more useful player who can take a header, get TOTS Harry Kane. He has 99 heading, 87 jumping, 88 balance and 83 strength to go along with some other sick stats"
FUTMobile,37ppa0,kev11111,1 point,Fri May 29 12:40:37 2015 UTC,"Pantillimon already got a 74 IF before, so his next IF is upgraded to gold."
FUTMobile,37ppa0,kenchenhappy,2,Fri May 29 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily... they normally only change their level once a year with upgrade cards, thats why people like Mane, (and many others), stayed silver when he/they got an IF because his/they're NIF was already 74... Also, Schmeichel got a hero then an IF both 74 rated as I already stated in my post :/"

FUTMobile,37pevj,ukplaying,2,Fri May 29 10:40:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I bought TOTS Sanchez for 554k. I'll try him out, might even try out TOTS Costa(going for 390k-410k), and tell you how those two are. I can't say anything about TOTS Hazard or TOTS Aguero though, don't have the coinage, ha."
FUTMobile,37pevj,vaow93,1 point,Fri May 29 11:14:02 2015 UTC,thnx ill be waiting
FUTMobile,37pevj,vaow93,2,Fri May 29 12:56:02 2015 UTC,"So, I tried out Sanchez. 5 games, 9 goals, and 4 assists. Every game was played on world class, against opponents from the BPL( was playing the BPL TOTs tournament by manually setting difficulty to WC). He feels fucking amazing at Left Striker on 7 chem. He is much more quicker than his NIF, his dribbling and close control is quite a bit better than his SIF. However two of the biggest positives of having TOTS Sanchez, are SHOOTING and that physical upgrade! His shots are fantastic, shots from outside the box went in or hit the post every time! And there is a large physical upgrade from his SIF. He was able to receive lobbed through balls quite a few times even when pressurized, and despite getting fouled, he would still be standing and running towards the ball, trying to get to it first. He played some nice passes, and he made some of the best runs off the ball that I have seen on this game, whenever he went forward. All in all, a VERY solid player, with the only real negative being the hefty price tag. His current lowest BIN varies from 610k to 645k, but if you are lucky, you can win a bid on him ranging from from 550k to 580k. That's quite a lot of coinage atm, in a market where 600k could net you 3-4 TOTY.  TL;DR:- TOTS Sanchez is an upgraded, cheaper(yet slightly expensive) BPL version of NIF Ronaldo."
FUTMobile,37pevj,aaninja64,1 point,Fri May 29 14:13:45 2015 UTC,wow thnx thts a detailed review i think i will pick him up if he hits 450k at the end of the week
FUTMobile,37pe3h,Bob_Domingo,1 point,Fri May 29 10:28:43 2015 UTC,coin limit??
FUTMobile,37pe3h,kev11111,2,Fri May 29 12:44:29 2015 UTC,"There is a daily coin limit - max amount of coins you can earn from playing games.. It's 150k! The ""Timer"" resets at 12am GMT. This question usually gets asked when tournament rewards are high as the limit is easier to reach. :)"
FUTMobile,37pe3h,RedEyeJedi2303,2,Fri May 29 13:57:44 2015 UTC,Yup.  Really stunk when there were those 10k tournament for St. Patrick's Day.
FUTMobile,37pe3h,Blued3vils,1 point,Fri May 29 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"Right, yeah,, its to hinder coin sellers apparently... The title of the post was quite ambiguous, I didn't know if thats what he was asking or something else, like, whats the max amount of coins you can have in yr account, for example... They should lift/raise it with tourneys imho"
FUTMobile,37pe3h,kev11111,1 point,Fri May 29 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can't earn more than 150k from matches in one day. It really sucked during the St. Patricks Tournament since the reward was 10k and i farmed the shit out of it. :D Could have earned wayyyyy more than i did"

FUTMobile,37obcb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 29 04:06:17 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's amazing!!
FUTMobile,37obcb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 29 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good for 1 pack but I'm still disappointed that I haven't gotten one of those BPL TOTS attackers (Costa, Aguero, Hazard) after like 3M coins spent"
FUTMobile,37obcb,lingmister,1 point,Fri May 29 04:05:27 2015 UTC,"Ouch, I could never commit to spending that much on packs. That's probably why I've never packed anyone spectacular."
FUTMobile,37obcb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 29 06:42:12 2015 UTC,I concentrate really hard before I open a pack. ;) but it never works...
FUTMobile,37obcb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 29 10:10:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but I mean its my first tots and I had some coins so why not have some fun?
FUTMobile,37obcb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 29 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"No by all means do what makes you happy. I'm just a tight ass when it comes to packs. I can handle silver and bronze because they are cheap. When it's 15k and up I cringe every time I buy one. Probably my negative attitude is why I have never packed a top player too, who knows."
FUTMobile,37obcb,vaow93,1 point,Fri May 29 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"Ooh. I've recently tried playing bronze and silver squads in those bronze+silver community tots last week. Needleaa to say, I think that bronze and silver players make th game a lot more...fun. Like you don't expect them to do much because they're worse than gold cards like Suarez or Neymar but that's exactly why I feel that they're more fun to play. Games feel more intense knowing that u wont win purely based off of the fact that the players you have are better."
FUTMobile,37obcb,vaow93,1 point,Fri May 29 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is the lack of pace, it slows the game down, creates more space, and provides for a lot more time on the ball to make decisions. It feels more like real football, not having to get rid of the ball before you even get it.   It really taught me that at least against the computer, pace doesn't really matter. I can't speak for online though, apparently it means everything, which is the only thing that makes me feel better about not being able to play online.  When I do play with a gold squad it is insane how fast they are, but it seems like they are so fast I find myself immediately running into a defender.  This new tournament coming out is a dream come true for me, I didn't even have to make a new squad. I have a couple I can choose from already."
FUTMobile,37obcb,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Fri May 29 21:29:57 2015 UTC,Do you have any good silver squads that you could recommend?
FUTMobile,37obcb,aaninja64,1 point,Fri May 29 21:33:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm the guy to ask to be honest, I make my squads not necessarily to be the best to win with. I make them fit my OCD personality more than anything. No red links, ever. Every player must be on 10 chemistry, and now that I've accumulated so many, they all need to be informs of some sort.  While they look awesome, they may not necessarily be the best, especially if you play online. I use a lot of 3atb formations. There are other people here who are much more versed on the actual game characteristics of the players. Perhaps /u/kev11111 or someone might give you some advice.  I did post the squad I'll be using in the new tournament in the thread about the same subject. I still have it copied to my clipboard so here it is.  http://imgur.com/yL79SmH  http://imgur.com/XnCCDwe"

FUTMobile,37kslj,United4Eva,2,Thu May 28 10:30:09 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure its a thing when playing offline because sometimes the AI will just guess your every move and your players will get amnesia and forget who they are or how to pass a ball. I haven't noticed anything like that online besides the lag sometimes but i haven't been able to win a game with a full IF team but when i play with an 80 rated squad with only NIF players i win more often.
FUTMobile,37kslj,doctoruranus,1 point,Thu May 28 11:33:26 2015 UTC,True thanks haha
FUTMobile,37kslj,kev11111,2,Thu May 28 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"Yh for sure, I believe 100% it does happen, but I really shouldn't get started on this subject, cause aside from angering me, I'd be here for hours just listing examples lol :D"
FUTMobile,37kslj,ukplaying,2,Thu May 28 13:00:29 2015 UTC,i only play offline on world class but i believe scripting exist if you are a goal behind at half time they start playing tiki taka and intercept every one of ur passes which would still have been fine if the halves were not so damn short. interestingly i found that the ai gets handicapped if u get a player send off early on as long as u dont concede from the free kick(dont try it against juve).
FUTMobile,37kslj,oompaloompafifa,1 point,Thu May 28 15:51:56 2015 UTC,Dude I can relate lmao. As soon as pirlo steps up you know its a goal haha
FUTMobile,37kslj,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Thu May 28 20:19:28 2015 UTC,"Offline: Definitely yes, no doubt about that. Online: Debatable. I'm in Division 1 so the pool of players isn't really wide and I can meet a opponent 3 or 4 times a day. Those who are much better than me and can score past me 4 or 5 goals, the result is still the same. Those who are on my level, some I win, some they win. But sometimes, I feel the game has some campaigns against me. WORST TIME: Score a goal, get a corner kick last week. Unbelievable."
FUTMobile,37kslj,fifamobile,1 point,Thu May 28 13:20:20 2015 UTC,"Offline, definitely. I have an easier time beating the computer on world class with one of my bronze, or silver, squads. The games are usually 1-0, or 2-1, but a win is a win, and they come more often, and with greater ease, with lower ranked squads."
FUTMobile,37kslj,kev11111,0,Fri May 29 19:01:40 2015 UTC,most definitely.  it always intrigues me when my TOTY team performs worse than my BPL sweat squad.
FUTMobile,37kslj,Blued3vils,2,Thu May 28 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it, I used  a Full TOTY squad to try it out - cpl players on 7 chem, the rest on 10... Out of 10 matches I done far, far better with bronzers :S"
FUTMobile,37lcg2,The_Kaafir,6,Thu May 28 13:40:53 2015 UTC,"They still have to be listed on the TM, there is no other way unfortunately... What I have done in the past is list them for average price then gave them back the coins by buying a crappy player way over the odds... only thing is, you lose 5% to tax on both ends of the deal :("
FUTMobile,37lcg2,kev11111,1 point,Thu May 28 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"Yup.  That's the best/safest way.  No question.  In certain situations you could try switching a player's position (IE from ST to CDM)  and listing it at a low low price, but BIN snipers may get to them first and it's risky...."
FUTMobile,37lcg2,Blued3vils,1 point,Thu May 28 22:18:38 2015 UTC,other than transfer market the only other way is give him ur account if ur account is not fake i do not recommend this and the only positive from listing on tm is the 5percent tax
FUTMobile,37l2mz,United4Eva,2,Thu May 28 12:21:57 2015 UTC,"Keep refreshing on a target bin price that is typically lower than any bids. Once in a blue moon, a card will match your BIN and you quickly buy it now."
FUTMobile,37l2mz,pellias,1 point,Thu May 28 12:26:33 2015 UTC,"lot more often that that atm... Lots high value players getting listed for crazy prices, for example, James Rodrigues was going for 4k BIN a few hours ago :)"

FUTMobile,37l2mz,Kenya_West,1 point,Thu May 28 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"It's when you get a player who is in high demand, for example, Hazard. He normally goes for 45-50k when the market is normal. The 'sniper' would set the filters to say below 30k BIN and constantly search and normally once something comes up, they will quickly click buy now. They would then sell it for the normal price."

I can understand being so far off on most stats having never seen the guy play. Pace on the other hand is much easier to judge, it doesn't take a member of Mensa to figure it out. Is he fast, or not? They shouldn't be off by almost 20 points on that one IMO. The rest of the stats you may not get an idea of until he faced a certain level of competition, with pace the only thing they need to see him face is the pitch, or a stopwatch."

FUTMobile,37k0d8,Danimalistic2782,2,Thu May 28 04:37:30 2015 UTC,This is the advice... i packed TOTY Silva and sold for 3.5mil on thursday or something. That funded my entire TOTY pack openings and got me 4 low/mid tiers TOTY as well.
FUTMobile,37jsus,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Thu May 28 03:31:01 2015 UTC,"Sell only the higher value players so that way if you ever want to switch back the Bundesloga squad you have a solid foundation for your team.  Also, if your getting BPL TOTS players, Yannick Bolasie is an absolute tank. Hes like a stronger Eden Hazard."
FUTMobile,37jsus,KSearle21,2,Thu May 28 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I'd also like to get one of the upgraded Hazard cards during the crash, because his IF or hero card will probably both dip below 400k during 100k packs on Saturday/Sunday"

FUTMobile,379u65,Krishido,3,Tue May 26 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that trading isn't very profitable during this time because of TOTS. Expensive players are pretty cheap right now because people are all anticipating/predicting for their TOTS which would come later on. At least point, I think that it's best to either utilise the consumable market (buying and selling contracts/fitness cards), hold on to your money and go on a TOTS pack run (I know this isn't recommended but come on, we're nearing the end of FIFA 15 and you should have some fun, shouldn't you?), or, cash out and try some players that you really like (CR7, Messi, TOTY Robben, SIF Neymar, etc)."
FUTMobile,379u65,lingmister,1 point,Tue May 26 01:35:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree, the consumable market is very down at the moment. In the pass you could sell a silver for 800-900, for now you will be hard press to get 400.   The OP suggestion is the best currently but very tiring and time consuming."
FUTMobile,379u65,kev11111,1 point,Tue May 26 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yeh I gotta second this, normally I would recommend this way, as I been doing consumables for months, but its fkin dire atm... nobody buying cause they're all opening packs for TOTS and getting most of the consumables they need... If you could pick them up close to their minimum price you may be able to sell at a small profit, but tbh the ROI really isn't worth the time and effort!!!"
FUTMobile,379u65,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue May 26 03:57:58 2015 UTC,"When big players are released, and 100k packs are out, you can find crazy deals. People dump players for half their values, if you have the coins you can buy them. Then wait until the market settles back down and sell for huge profits. It's a simple strategy but to pull it off successfully takes a lot of time and a ton of patience."
FUTMobile,379u65,Boosterflex,1 point,Wed May 27 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"Dodgy time to buy big players,Messi, Ronaldo,if Rodriguez, Suarez, etc. all might fall heavily in the next 2 weeks. If you can't pick up players for near discard its a risk. Best bet is in low risk, smaller profit flips, or higher cost items thrown away hastily. But beware that 250 k bargain  that gets stuck on your transfer list and the price keeps falling,I've done it too many times. I'm resisting various temptations because they might be half the price very soon."
FUTMobile,379wdv,elroypaisley,8,Tue May 26 01:36:22 2015 UTC,Gotze at CAM and Auba at ST please. Also use a 4 atb formation preferably...something along the lines of a 4-3-3 variant
FUTMobile,379wdv,vaow93,4,Tue May 26 02:32:52 2015 UTC,lol I agree...that auba-gotze placement is kinda bugging me haha
FUTMobile,379wdv,oompaloompafifa,3,Tue May 26 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah my advice would be similar. Gotze to CAM, but SIF Muller at ST, if it's in your budget. I would recommend the 4-1-2-1-2, but I suck, so take my opinion as the last option.  For the Spanish squad, if you want to use Iniesta, and want to stick to 3 ATB. I would switch to 3-4-1-2 and swap Khedira for Kroos. If you want to stick with the 3-5-2 for defensive reasons. I would put Khedira on the right and swap Iniesta for Busquets. You lose some offense with Iniesta but he doesn't work well for me at all at CDM. Again, I suck, just my opinions."
FUTMobile,379wdv,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue May 26 04:41:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. When I use 2 strikers, I use 41212 and when I have 1 striker I use 4321..and you can take my word for it lol im more of a ""player"" rather than a ""trader"" haha"

FUTMobile,379wdv,punchy00,2,Tue May 26 11:07:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on your budget, you could try and get TOTY Robben"
FUTMobile,379wdv,mpassell99,2,Tue May 26 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"Odd as it may seem, I think NIF Boateng is even stronger than SIF Hummels, so I tend to put Boateng in the center and Hummels on the left. Slight tweak, I know."
FUTMobile,379wdv,Krishido,2,Tue May 26 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"TOTS or SIF Muller at striker instead of Gotze and I think boateng in the middle would be slightly better. For BBVA, Enzo Perez instead of Iniesta imo, and maybe an IF or SIF Otamendi instead of Pique. You could also get TOTY Ramos as well as NIF Messi instead of Benzema. For GK, I think Bravo might be a better choice, but it's your preference really. IMO, I think it's better if you change your formation to a 4321 or a 433(4) or (5). The BBVA Wingers (AKA Bale and Neymar) are a lot more useful when they're up and running down the wings and crossing to a long-shot mid-fielder or a lone striker like suarez."

FUTMobile,379wdv,Boosterflex,1 point,Tue May 26 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Griezmann and benzema up front, Benz on the left. Toty ramos is much better, put cassilas in goal. If otamendi, Pepe or Miranda better than pique or if godin. Rodriguez at cam over Isco, but if you want 352 then iniesta at cam, bring in busquets at cdm, or Perez. Iniesta is better further forward, his skill is attacking.I would really recommend front 3 of Rodriguez, sif benzema and tif Griezmann. Nif suarez is not as fast, haven't tried the latest variations. Ps. Found Neymar likely to disappear."
FUTMobile,379wdv,kev11111,1 point,Tue May 26 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"Also Toty Kroos is a dominant cm, goes well with iniesta or modric and a cdm in a 3 man midfield."
FUTMobile,377c8a,Macburl,4,Mon May 25 13:58:33 2015 UTC,"A thing I find good is ground crossing. If you cross to the far post, a player making a run will have a tap in. Best used on fast breaks when the box isn't crowded"
FUTMobile,377c8a,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Mon May 25 16:00:34 2015 UTC,Try ealry crosses that bounce to the 6 yard box. Goalies never move for them
FUTMobile,377c8a,nsm883,2,Mon May 25 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"If I'm trying to get a head on the cross, I'll tap the ground like 15 yards behind the player I'm aiming at, like towards the other sideline. Otherwise they always end up too short. The target man boost helps, but you never know where it's going to go."
FUTMobile,377c8a,Csusmatt,1 point,Mon May 25 23:01:18 2015 UTC,A good way is to just tap on the player or on the ground where you want the ball to be. Not perfect but about 50% chance.
FUTMobile,377c8a,lingmister,1 point,Tue May 26 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"Make sure you have a good crosser to cross the ball, then make sure you have a tall player who can jump and run, then cross early. This is the most consistent way of crossing. You won't win everyone but you have a better chance than before."
FUTMobile,378e6k,FIFAforlife735,3,Mon May 25 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Don't switch to high work rates whenever you're losing. If you see the opposing team's players popping up more than yours, switch between the work rates until one causes your players faces to pop up more. It's pretty unpredictable which one will help, but high isn't always better than low/medium."
FUTMobile,378e6k,treefitty350,2,Mon May 25 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"Medium is almost always the best, at least for me. High just results in players shooting from midfield, rather than taking it to the box."

FUTMobile,37893o,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue May 26 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of when I was 16. I went to the movies with a friend of mine. We waited in line for popcorn and other crap. When we got to the front he turned to me and covered his mouth, then motioned towards the guy taking our order and whispered ""look at his name"" in shock. I looked, and it was, Jesus. He says dude it's fucking Jesus!! He was pronouncing it like Jesus from the bible, not the way it's pronounced in Spanish.   I live in southern California, we have a huge Latino population, and Jesus, is one of the most common names around. His family was rich, so he was fairly sheltered, but around here, to not have ever heard of that name in any other way than the biblical pronunciation is outrageous. He was seriously shocked, and I was equally shocked at his reaction."

FUTMobile,375ri4,Tyson_Wilkins,0,Mon May 25 03:00:31 2015 UTC,Havent got around to using him sorry but if u want a review of his normal at rf here it is.  Messi at RF - I dont like messi anywhere and rf he was ok. Not worth the coins and felt soooooo weak and sluggish. His only decent attribute was his passing. His finishing was even inconsistent. 2/10 would not recommend
FUTMobile,375ri4,vaow93,1 point,Mon May 25 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"How can you not like messi ig? His dribbling is absolutely brilliant, great close control, his shooting is amazing, he can pass very well, and his acceleration is IN-fucking-SANE!"

FUTMobile,375ri4,fifamobile,1 point,Mon May 25 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe its his position or chem card - if he has one... I felt exactly same until I changed his position to CAM and he was phenomenal every time I used him after that... Pretty much same with Ronaldo, the 1 I bought had been converted to LM and had a guardian or gladiator card on him, (no idea why), he was useless, always going missing, losing the ball far too easily.. I changed his position to LW, applied a catalyst card on him and he was much better, even better at LF with an engine card, he's fkin unstoppable..."

Would reccomend for 200k   TOTS Hendo - I was really excited for him but left dissapointed.  He didnt fell that musch better than his normal and would rather get someone like ramsey or IF Herrera   Berardi - Havent used sorry"

FUTMobile,375ri4,kev11111,3,Mon May 25 03:44:57 2015 UTC,I actually just bought him last night so only like 10 games with him   http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/32903638/ my team  Pace and dribbling are phenomenal.  He also felt really strong on the ball. Dybala had great positioning so he won quite a few headers.However his finishing and passing were very very inconsistent.  Dybala 8/10 if u have enough coins get him. If u are cutting it close just get his 70 card.
FUTMobile,375ri4,Takuno,1 point,Mon May 25 14:39:02 2015 UTC,"for the price ppl are asking for his 70, you might snag his 74 UP card :)"

It was a while. And the 74 tots is much better. P.s. lowest buy now is 75 k cheaper. Than next."

Waiting for TOTS Marcelo to drop and prob want to get rid of Ramos too but everyone's currently on full chem(9 or 10). Blasyczczczski might turn you off but he has a good long shot. I have TOTY Iniesita but I'm trying to sell him since Rakitic feels more well rounded and fits for my tallish midfield.

On the off-chance its not, I don't think rafael is best suited to ST with those WR's, more like a CM than his original CF position... I actually play MOTM De Bruyne in that false 9 position with deadeye chem because it suits his clinical finishing and helps him drop back deeper to be a playmaker and make runs into the box when needed...

FUTMobile,36z293,Krishido,1 point,Sat May 23 14:16:44 2015 UTC,I gave up and bought a 15k pack and packed TOTS Clasie. Looking at your comment makes me more determined to get that Henderson. I guess I'll have to sim more games.
FUTMobile,36z293,JXBA,1 point,Sat May 23 14:51:35 2015 UTC,The lowest I got those two is 20k. Yes of the lot they are the hardest. Henderson is a beast btw. Amazing box to box.

FUTMobile,36y5r0,hobohawk,1 point,Sat May 23 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"Aguero is sick, but he's too small to be a lone striker. He gets beat for headers, and you can't play long balls up for him, he'll just lose it. He may be better in certain situations, but Diego Costa has the strength, jumping and heading that make up for 9 pace lower"

FUTMobile,36y5r0,vaow93,1 point,Sat May 23 09:29:31 2015 UTC,"I have. Lloris's speed over Courtois (65 vs 38...I think) makes him worth it. I want IF Lloris, but I can't buy him AND TOTS players"
FUTMobile,36y5r0,vaow93,1 point,Sat May 23 13:06:51 2015 UTC,"Walker for Zabaleta, Koscielny for IF Jagielka***, Courtois in goal, upgraded Aguero instead of Di Maria, IF/Hero Hazard for NIF Hazard, SIF Sanchez at 7 chem instead of NIF Sanchez, Ramires instead of Matic, and change your formation to the 4-3-3 that has a CAM(for Aguero to fill)."

I hope to get Koscielny, but TOTS Koscielny rather than his NIF, even though it's a sweet card. Zabaleta is fine, I don't ever feel like he's too slow to keep up with attackers, hence why I haven't used Walker yet. Di Maria is doing fine as is, and Aguero can't pass for shit, if I'm honest. I would love to get one of Sanchez's IFs, MOTM or (hopefully) TOTS, as well as Hazard, but their NIFs are good for now, so if I have coins left after upgrading other positions, I will, and I refuse to touch my TOTS Matic. I know Ramires is fast, but Matic is infinitely better, and pace isn't everything. Thanks for the tips!"

FUTMobile,36vdww,Kenya_West,1 point,Fri May 22 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"I may be reading this wrong but...   If you're saying you have an account/players/items that aren't associated with a facebook account and you want to log into facebook to use the transfer market and also keep those players, the answer is actually unfortunately no.  You will have to start over as those players will not carry over to your facebook login.  EA will probably tell you the same, as I had the same problem early on.  Sorry buddy."
FUTMobile,36vdww,Blued3vils,2,Fri May 22 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"See my answer above. I had the same problem, EA told me it couldnt do anything, and then I tried making a completely new FB account and signed in with that, and all of my players on my guest account were transferred over. I had a completely new guest account, and my new facebook account became my old guest account. I even still kept my original facebook account. The way you switch between the two is through signing in and out of the actual facebook app on your phone.  Sorry if this is confusing, i can clear it up if you guys are still having trouble!"
FUTMobile,36vdww,nyza,1 point,Fri May 22 16:34:35 2015 UTC,When you log into facebook at that phase it will ask whether you want to play current club or Log into facebook.

FUTMobile,36p5bp,gimmethat____,1 point,Thu May 21 00:48:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks man.  There is a possibility.  Play a Wolfsburg player a LCM, I'm thinking Luiz Gustavo... but if I'm not wrong Reus would suffer in Chem.    But you know what?  De bruyne is fine with 7 chem.  I'm quite suprised."
FUTMobile,36p5bp,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Thu May 21 08:29:14 2015 UTC,Do you want advice on ways you could improve the team?
FUTMobile,36p5bp,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Thu May 21 00:57:50 2015 UTC,Sure thing!  Always looking to improve.
FUTMobile,36p5bp,vaow93,1 point,Thu May 21 08:26:09 2015 UTC,"In that case, the first thing I'd do is replace Reus with Ribery. Though I love Reus, this would be done for chemistry reasons with Lacazette. Then you could get a better RW, either in the Ligue 1 or French. Some I would recommend are Lucas or IF Hamouma. Maybe even IF Cabella, but that would probably mean using a BPL right side to go with your Bundesliga left. I'd switch Gundogan for Lahm or his IF, which are both great cards and not to pricey. TOTS Gonalons and Veratti are currently in packs, and I'd get one of them to replace Matuidi if I could, and Neuer too. Any Bundesliga Hybrid has to have Neuer"

FUTMobile,36p5bp,vaow93,1 point,Sat May 23 13:05:08 2015 UTC,Reus plays much better than NIF Ribery mate. Long shots and pace on point for Reus. Not so much for Ribery.

He bosses the midfield, stops counter attacks, feeds my strikers with throughballs, and chips in with the odd longshot. Another player is Ramires at defensive mid. His pace is something else.

FUTMobile,36fm2k,kev11111,1 point,Tue May 19 23:37:51 2015 UTC,"I like 3-4-1-2 can you use defensive type CM with proper work rates, to produce similar results as the 3-5-2?"
FUTMobile,36fm2k,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 22 08:40:51 2015 UTC,"yes 3 atb is very ineffective online because of pace being so dominant, they could just run trough the sideline and then cross for a good chance at a goal"
FUTMobile,36fm2k,doctoruranus,4,Tue May 19 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"3-5-2 is actually a fantastic formation for D1 if it's built properly.  The problem with it is that most players use the wrong wingers in their 3ATB.  If you're using Robben/Neymar, you're definitely going to get blasted down the wing.  3ATB is almost the same as 5ATB, and the wingers must defend the wing extensively like wingbacks.  When you look at a 3ATB team like Juve, you'll see that they use wingers like Lichtsteiner and Asamoah, who play great at fullback as well. The only popular choices that really fit here are Bale and Cuadrado, though H/H workrates are preferable to H/M.  I went undefeated in consecutive seasons of D2 and D1 using Bale and Turan on the wings in this squad: http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/32454968/  A good option is to 7 chem a fullback or CM for the wings.  In my experience, the best 3ATB wingers in the game are TOTY Lahm and SIF Danilo.  I'm using TOTY Di Maria in my main squad and he's brilliant at shutting down the wing bc of his workrates.  Now that there's a defensive midfield boost it's a lot easier to plug guys in -- with the boost and Sentinel chem I can get Di Maria up near 80 defending."
FUTMobile,36fm2k,PaulGawdba,2,Tue May 19 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"All formations are playable as long as you got the right playing style to best utilise it and you have a well-rounded, balanced team..."

FUTMobile,36aboc,oompaloompafifa,1 point,Mon May 18 05:04:53 2015 UTC,How do you like ST griezmann btw? Ive been debating about whether I should get him or not for a really long time because I use a 1 striker formation and I already have suarez but I havent been able to decide yet
FUTMobile,36aboc,oompaloompafifa,1 point,Sun May 17 23:56:52 2015 UTC,"Stats-wise he's really good but imo I think Suarez is better. With Griezmann, you're just a bit faster, but for me, it feels as if can't finish. His dribbling doesn't seem as good as Suarez's either. I'm not kidding when I say that Suarez is probably the best striker in the game; you'll realize that he's so reliable once u start trying out other strikers. He's got basically everything: long shots, good dribbling, good finishing, decent pace."
FUTMobile,36aboc,peter_goh15,1 point,Mon May 18 02:50:18 2015 UTC,Ok sounds good. I feel ya - toty di marias a beast but he just cant finish either lol
FUTMobile,36aboc,vaow93,1 point,Mon May 18 06:10:06 2015 UTC,"He feels very well-rounded, does it all with style! I got griezmann so that i could have a reliant and cheapish striker to go along with Suarez. Seeing as you only use a single striker in your formation, there really is no need to replace suarez unless you get ST Ronaldo or an inform."
FUTMobile,36aboc,vaow93,1 point,Mon May 18 05:03:45 2015 UTC,Hmmmm sounds good. Hopefully ill be able to get a st ronaldo sometime in the future
FUTMobile,368ct9,KSearle21,8,Sun May 17 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"Basic rule: DO NOT buy packs apart from 400 coin bronze packs and 15k packs sometimes.   Bronze pack method: Buy 400 coin bronze packs and pretty much sell everything at 150 starting and 200 BIN, but be careful because pacey players (90+) might sell for a lot more. It's a bit slow but it'll get you started  15k Pack Method: Buy a 15k pack and sell the things inside. Gold rare contracts for around 1000, Gold non-rare for around 700 - 750. Non-rare gold players for around 750 - 800 depending, but there are some expensive ones who are from good clubs. Rare Gold players, depends on the person but normally sell for 1000, but make sure you know what players sell for otherwise you might sell something for way less then you could have gotten.   Those are a few ways, so i hope i helped you ;)"

I had never thought about the 400 coin packs other than buying one or two in hopes of Mathis Bolly (I do know a little bit about fast people).

FUTMobile,368ct9,peter_goh15,3,Sun May 17 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"The consumables are the ones that bring in the most money sometimes, and also, some badges and kits sell for a bit. Oh and the rare gold managers for major leagues can sell for a quite a bit."

FUTMobile,368ct9,FIFAforlife735,1 point,Mon May 18 07:59:21 2015 UTC,"Quick Simulation Method   One way to do this is to pick a tournament which can be farmed and play it again and again while quicksimming. You can easily make 50k-75k within an hour.  Another way is to get into a high division in single player seasons (Divisions 1-4). This is ultimately a more lucrative method, but it is more unpredictable to win. Just quicksimming these and you will make 100k in an hour if you already have a good team.   If you already have a decent team, try out the divisions method. If you are losing too many games , switch to the tournament method. Hope I helped!"

FUTMobile,368ct9,FIFAforlife735,1 point,Mon May 18 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"Nice, and this is the easiest way I've found. You can also trade using your coins using the silver player method. A few months ago, I was able to reliably make 75k in less than 20minutes. All you have to do is find a popular silver player (I used Okore) and find buyitnows of them a large amount less than their average selling price. I was able to buy Okore for 2.5k and sell him for 22k. As silver players are not used by the majority of FUT players, they can be traded with easily."

FUTMobile,364jkn,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Sun May 17 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't planning on making a thread of it and making a big deal, it was originally just a reply to a single person, and to my huge number of subscribers on YouTube....4? I woke up this morning and checked the sub and saw the thread, so don't think I was trying to mug myself lol that was hard to say/type.  As far as all the duplicates goes, that is directly froyo related to my goal I made early on in the game. I first wanted to collect every card in the game, then I looked it up and saw there was something like 15000, that was the end of that dream. So then I set my sights on every gold inform, I didn't care if I had first-fifteenth of the same player at the same position, I wanted them all.  Now that my focus again shifted to include bronze, and silver's, the thought of selling some duplicates has crossed d my mind a few times. In the last week I did actually sell off my most expensive ones, multiple Robbens, multiple Suarez, and some others I can't remember. When it comes to ones such as Silva, and Sneijder, and others rated similarly and below, they aren't worth enough for me to let them go. I know what I lay d for them, and the work put in to get them, and there is no way to convince me to let them go so cheap. I don't even know what they are going for, I won't check, I know it's probably less than 5% of what I payed originally. Especially Silva, who I know I was trading his FIF for 2.2-2.75m before it tumbled when his SIF came out.  About the video, I will take your advice, and remake it much slower. I didn't think people would really want to look at so many cards, so I didn't want it to be long. I'll make the whole length version then just split it up into however many parts it needs to be. Plus after some of the comments I am a little scared of being back d now, so I'll cover up my tag.and what not, it's already out, but less will see it in the future hopefully.  I'm using a-z screen recorder I think it's called, I also have unlimited screen recorder. Both are good, the second one is lacking a feature I like, don't remember what now, I've used a-z for a while. They both are awesome though, I kept the unlimited one because it only asks for a donation if you like the app, you get all features for free. A-z makes you pay to use all the features.

Lets face it, there aren't going to be enough of these players going around unless more packs are opened imho... But, if they hadn't removed the market there might still be 1.5M players listed instead of the standard 600-700k atm...  Will post my squads soon as I'm done :)"

TOTS has been postponed indefinitely, we don't know when it's out. Soon, FIFA 16 will be out. By continuing to save until TOTS, you'll probably be killing a lot of the joy you could get from trying some of the better players now, when prices are so low. Try those fancy SIFs and TIFs that were previously going for millions, like SIF Neymar, SIF Tevez,  Hero Hazard(if you can get another 200k), any of the TOTYs bar CR7 and Messi, so on and so forth.

Without that, all your claims of greatness seem empty. Posting screenshots of a seasons record could be attained dozens of different ways, same with your tips. If you had a video where you say hi this morning s yazzie, then you go into div 1 and destroy someone while scoring from mid field. Well then I would believe everything you spout off much easier, and would be more willing to suffer through your cocky attitude.   Until then, I have to say I'm with the rest of the people on here.

FUTMobile,35vzvy,YoungGamer19,1 point,Wed May 13 23:44:10 2015 UTC,so if you sim for 2 hours 2x50=100k You do this every day 100x7=700k Minus contracts (I buy contracts to make everyone 99) -150k So in one week you can get 550k just in time for TOTS  This is an estimate.....
FUTMobile,35vzvy,Krishido,1 point,Thu May 14 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"50k an hour? Assuming that each match takes at least 3 minutes to sim and DIV 1 ultimate league takes 6 matches to finish w/o getting the packs: That's 1 round of ultimate league in about 18 minutes AT LEAST, which nets you about 7.5k coins iirc. In an hour, you could do about 3 rounds of ultimate league, under the ideal conditions, which is still 7.5k x 3 = 22.5k coins; nowhere near 50k. Care to explain how you get 50k?"

FUTMobile,35vbna,elroypaisley,2,Wed May 13 20:34:26 2015 UTC,Yea just timing for skill move but about the free kick idk I've been wondering the same thing myself
FUTMobile,35vbna,Patmeng,2,Wed May 13 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"For the free kick, it is all related to the bottom of the screen. If you are close enough, when you direct the free kick to the front of the net it will say SHOOT at the bottom of the screen. As you rotate away, it will eventually say PASS. If you swipe when it says SHOOT, it will be directed low, at the net. While you may score some flukey goals like this, with me, I'll forget to rotate and my pass will just drill a defender in the chest, and the other team will counter attack. A better strategy for me is the Miniminter Free Kick, where you lob a pass to the far post just outside the 6 yard box, and have your CB head it across to the near post"
FUTMobile,35vbna,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Wed May 13 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"To do a hard and low free kick, try touching your finger down on a spot on the turf right in front of the goal. You need to make sure you don't touch on a player or you will lob it to that player."

That would explain why I got stuck with 25 of them that I payed between 60-75k for, when he began dropping. He never came back above 50 when I was at that point in the season, I held onto hope for a while then dumped them all for a loss of almost 1m.

FUTMobile,35nqsf,YoungGamer19,4,Tue May 12 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think switching up the mid-field could be a good idea. imo, I think Enzo Perez as a CDM is one of the best in the game. Pair that up with a Powerhouse chemistry style and put him in the mid-position and basically have your whole midfield covered. As for the other 2 spots,I'd put SIF Rakitic under neymar, and TOTY iniesta under Bale. Other than that, there's not much left to change imo. If you want a stronger backline, you might want to consider SIF Diego Godin instead of otamendi. You trade a bit of speed for more defense and physical. Dani Alves vs Carvajal is something else that you may want to consider. Alves might have good offensive stats but imo, carvajal feels a lot better to use; wins the ball every time for me and is such a beast imo."

FUTMobile,35mvms,taiwanisacountry,1 point,Tue May 12 00:35:17 2015 UTC,How effective is kroos at cam?
FUTMobile,35mvms,braden26,2,Tue May 12 01:37:35 2015 UTC,"He has 90+ shooting, passing, and dribbling, so I say that he's pretty good.   Also, if you want, swap out Perez with Khedira, Otamendi with Pepe, and Alves with Casillas for a lot more chemistry in the back."
FUTMobile,35mvms,taiwanisacountry,1 point,Tue May 12 04:08:09 2015 UTC,"Dude, gotta disagree, he already has 100 chem and Perez is a fkin Demon at CDM... Imho Kroos dont have the pace for CAM he's perfect at CM being the best passer in the game... btw, the guy your replying to there isn't the OP :)"
FUTMobile,35mvms,kev11111,2,Tue May 12 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"True. I mostly look at things from a chemistry standpoint-- the better the chemistry, the better the performance. I mostly play Kroos as a CM as well, but he is frighteningly accurate when he shoots."
FUTMobile,35mvms,taiwanisacountry,2,Tue May 12 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, fair enough... but once you hit 100 its not affected any further, whether you have an orange, green or strong green link - the most any player can get is 100/11 which is somehow 10 lol and yeh that shot of his is dynamite, granted... I wouldnt say he's not good at CAM if u have no other option he can do a job, I would just say theres better players can be used especially in this team ie; messi or Suarez... think someone else may have said it, but Iniesta is blinding at CAM, seriously on a par with Messi..."
FUTMobile,35mvms,kev11111,1 point,Tue May 12 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the chemistry bit. 100 chemistry is great, but having all players on 10 chemistry allows for optimal performance from each one. Furthermore, hyperlinks (same nationality and club), though not officially a thing, do tend to make passing and player coordination much better."
FUTMobile,35mvms,taiwanisacountry,2,Wed May 13 00:01:48 2015 UTC,"help me out here please dude... You're saying players on 10 chem play optimally, but << here >> you talk about your players playing badly if they have red lines between them... I'm confused, does that mean players play optimally on 10 chem as you just posted above or is that only as long as they have NO red connections?? Or are you saying its not possible to get 10 chem with red connections?? I only ask because all official sources and (supposedly) highly regarded authors in this sphere, that I've seen, suggest otherwise and they shouldn't be really doing that if its incorrect"
FUTMobile,35mvms,kev11111,1 point,Wed May 13 01:21:14 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, player chemistry affects individual performance whereas line color affects player-player interactions. For example, if you were playing Ronaldo as a 7-chem striker, but had all green lines around him, he wouldn't play as well than if he were on 10 chem, but would pass accurately and work well with the players around him. Conversely, if you played Messi and Ibra as dual strikers up front with both on 10 chem but with a red line between them, Messi and Ibra would play really well individually. However, their passing to each other and positioning relative to each other would suffer."
FUTMobile,35mvms,taiwanisacountry,1 point,Wed May 13 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"right, cant say I've ever had that problem tbf... I played CR7 as LM on 10 in all Real Madrid squad and at LW but think he plays much better at LF, (even at 7 chem in ST position), in mixed BBVA squad I sometimes use << here>> (for some reason Futhead has CR7 as 5 chem and Thiago as 6 when its actually 6 & 7; 7 & 8 with loyalty bonus)... the way you describe, looking at that squad youd think thiago would be really poor because he has 2 red lines... he's actually quite good in my experience although he does wander off to the side a bit if I play Casillas instead of Alves. On the other hand Neymar, in the right position on 10 chem with no red lines is a real disappointment and I have to actually search for him because he's constantly missing and he's got Catalyst chem card... I've never played Ibra and Messi, I will try that one, I have played Ibra and Suarez in a split-team which wasn't too disastrous but wasnt too impressed with some of the surrounding/connecting players so ditched the squad... I have played messi and Muller/Lewandowki << in this team >> which didnt produce any link-up problems between the 2, although as I've already stated, I'm just not impressed with Messi there, although that may be down to my playing style, plus, I havent actually used his TOTY there, but his NIF... I will try that now I do have his TOTY though as I'm interested to see if theres any improvement... I assume that explains that, like the large majority of players, I dont really buy the whole red line thing being detrimental if players are on 10, or green lines being better than red when a players on 10... Even EA have intimated thats not the case and that when a players on 10 chem thats the max regardless... I am open-minded though and am interested to hear any thoughts you may have on the above especially if you think you can convince me otherwise... if not, then I think it best we should agree to disagree, put it down to playing-styles or something :)"
FUTMobile,35mvms,kev11111,1 point,Wed May 13 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"So who do u think I should play at can and striker For CAM I can play iniesta, Suarez, or Messi ; the way I see it Suarez has the strength for striker so that's why I chose to play him at ST and Messi at CAM"

FUTMobile,35mvms,kev11111,1 point,Fri May 15 20:09:59 2015 UTC,I'll have to try this the only thing I'm hesitant about is that I don't think that Ronaldo will be as involved in the game at lm than at striker and I want to get him as most exposure as possible since he is my best player
FUTMobile,35mvms,braden26,1 point,Tue May 12 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"he's shit at LM m8, take it from me, prolly one of worst decisions I made lol... I rate him far more at LF than LW, even playing him in the ST with 7 chem, yr right he's always right in the thick of it..."

RB Ronaldo, I really don't even want him. I sold a ton of my informs that are first or second, and kept their best versions, in order to go after RW Messi. I couldn't bring myself to pay over 7m, when I saw him for 5m a couple days previous. I also didn't want to re-buy what I just sold for a big loss, so I went after record breaker Ronaldo. 3 1/2 hours of refreshing the search and looking through seven pages of ST Ronaldo's. Finally found one at 59:55, for 4.5 and grabbed it.   Was after igbouhn* just a little while ago. I had a hair over 1m left over from the Ronaldo situation. I felt like it would go higher than that, so during the bidding, I was quickly switching over to transfer list and trying to sell stuff real cheap in order to add more coins to give me a better chance. I pushed the limit on time too far, I came back one time and he was gone....😭  One on the market right now 5.5m, first owner, no games played. It's like a virgin unicorn, I want it so bad!!!! Hmmmm maybe I'll sell the record breaker, ST, 97 rated, Ronaldo, in order to buy the 73? rated, Nigerian, silver card. I'm sure that wouldn't piss anyone off. 😜"

So yes you are right packs are not worth it. My 2 million coins are for open market purchases.   Couple more tips. Don't buy MC tots as they will be released during their league releases as well and will be doubly cheap. The prices also follow the IF cycle with the cheaper prices during rare player packs and just before the next launch.   Oh one last thing, even tots will be cheap towards the end of their launch cycle, especially the second tier players."
FUTMobile,35cln6,lingmister,1 point,Sat May 9 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"I feel most of the purchasing of TOTS is based on a few principles: 1. It's a blue card. Don't fight me on this, special cards other than IFs look pretty, and distinguish themselves from other versions 2. It's the last hurrah for the year, as people know the season is over and there will be no more performance based card upgrades left, so they may as well spend the coins they have to try and get these ones. No more IFs, MOTMs, or anything else 3. Since the game is ending, when the updates stop coming and FIFA 16 is on the horizon, coins will lose all value as people switch over, and all that will be left is playing the game with the players you have in your club, without the market as nobody will be selling anything, so may as well spend what I have on something nice"

Make sure you choose players that are not likely to make the tots, because those cards will probably drop further in price.   I would stick to lower priced cards, 300k just doesn't allow you to do much IMO. When I was trading with less than 1.5m I watched 2 players for the most part. Gundogen, and Abaumayeng (sorry about the spelling) also Bender as CM, not as CDM. At the time they all regularly sold for 7000-7500 during the week.   When 100k packs hit on the weekends you could buy them all day long for under 4000. Sometimes you could snag them for under 1500. Then once Monday came around they would start selling again at normal price.   I did those 2 cards for a long time and made a bundle, I didn't move to higher cards until around 2 million. I still traded them for a long time even when I began going after bigger trades, because while I was going into uncharted territory I would make mistakes sometimes, so I kept a steady flow of income with my old regulars while I learned my new targets."

FUTMobile,353jkv,oompaloompafifa,2,Wed May 6 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"I doubt it because his toty is 98, his next highest is 96, and the need to keep a 97 for his tots. Unless they re-release hid 96 as a rw, there wont be one."
FUTMobile,353jkv,drkspace,3,Wed May 6 20:51:07 2015 UTC,Cant they release the MOTM as a 97 and release TOTS as a 99?
FUTMobile,353jkv,oompaloompafifa,2,Wed May 6 21:08:56 2015 UTC,No because the toty should be he highest rated.
FUTMobile,353jkv,drkspace,2,Wed May 6 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"^ This, but he has been released, and you were right first time bruv, he's RW!!! Just goes to show, if its marketing gold, EA will find a way, next move probably would have been a TOTY upgrade lol"

Gotta say tho, EA and their stupid logic strikes again... what ever possessed them to release his TOTY as 98?? I know Ronaldo won the balon D'or but, come on, this is messi for crying out loud!!! Well they've well and truly mugged themselves off lol"
FUTMobile,353jkv,kev11111,1 point,Wed May 6 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"REST IN PEPPERONI EVERYTHING. There's 93 Suarez (he has some MOTM, not sure what IF this is), RB ST 97 Ronaldo, 96 RW MOTM Messi, Hero 90 Hazard, 84 Dani Alves and Hero 80 Kane. These packs are unreal, and we still have TOTS in a little more than a week IMO, meaning we'll have Diego Costa, Aguero, Hazard, Kane, David Silva, Matic, Sanchez, Terry, Koscielny and others to pick up after this"

Find a rare player that you actually would want to use, spend awhile learning exactly what his lowest BINs for and what his open lists go for.  Usually: buy the cheapest open bin that slides through and list it at a higher BIN.  And just work that player or two.  My big busts have all been going outside my knowledge for a ""sure thing.""

There is no other person/entity, that operates like this h sides your local smack, or coke dealer.  At first they are so nice, giving you the best stuff even some for free. (Free informs for totw tournaments) If there is a problem they take care of it. (live chat used to actually get you somewhere)   Then after you are hooked and reliant on them things start to change. They make you wait sometimes forever stringing you along saying I'll be there soon but won't give a time. (transfer market fiasco) If there is a problem with the product, you are on your own. (how the live chat is now) They are always bragging about how good their stuff is, and how they have this new stuff coming up that will blow your mind. When really it's just the same shit over and over in a different color baggy.  At this point you know it's bullshit, and you don't care. You are craving it now, so you will take anything he has, whether or not you even like it. You need it, so you tell him how awesome the one was in the green bag and how you want more, and more, and more and..........ahhhhhhhhhh god damn you EA!!!!!!!!"

Note: Pace + shooting boost + counter attack is the only one I have found to have this success.  KEEPING their STAMINA (90% and above) up this team wins 80% percent of the time. 80-85% fitness  brings you iffy results.  For 99% success however, BEFORE every start of the tourney, DO swap player Peralta for J dos santos and the reverse for the next torney. Don't ask me why but it works.   Now go sim the tourney pls as it's the only one worth spending time. If a rare players pack with 12 players is worth 50000, imagine the amount you save with 100 plus packs.

FUTMobile,34uzsh,Boosterflex,2,Mon May 4 20:01:06 2015 UTC,IF are generally better than NIF. But not all IFs are equal. For example SIF Aguero is better than SIF costa at least for me.

FUTMobile,34uzsh,ukplaying,1 point,Tue May 5 08:23:02 2015 UTC,"Isn't t it a bit hit and miss? Or maybe it's to do with how many points of an increase is given. A one point boost isn't much and sometimes the balance of the nif card can be disrupted. On the other hand 4 or 5 points increase is a lot for a particular attribute, eg pace. I used to think the black cards were automatically better in game, now I don't think so."

FUTMobile,34t9id,aquillaroja,2,Mon May 4 16:21:06 2015 UTC,The ball you use also appears on the simulation now.
FUTMobile,34t9id,Boosterflex,1 point,Mon May 4 16:57:58 2015 UTC,What do you think of the new boosts and tactics?
FUTMobile,34t9id,califan6868,1 point,Tue May 5 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"I liked the side overload because my midfielders and attackers would actually move around (eg. Reus didn't just stay on the left wing, he drifted into the middle and sometimes to the right) so I liked that since it was more realistic. It made my attack feel more connected from midfield to front 3 and I found my fullbacks got more involved but when it goes wrong, your attack becomes really muddled and crowded.  Didn't notice anything with zonal marking since that's how I try and defend regularly - manualy controlling my three midfielders to be right in front of the back 4 so I can't say anything about it - sorry!  Flat back 4 really helped to stop long balls and the defense felt really organized."
FUTMobile,34t9id,califan6868,1 point,Tue May 5 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"Didn't notice anything with the attacker physical boost - maybe my crosses are shit or I send them in too late, but my wingers seem to lose possession less when tackled  I liked the defender passing boost, my fullbacks sent in much better crosses and balls into the box. I haven't tried the midfield defense boost yet - hope I could help."
FUTMobile,34t9id,unslick,1 point,Tue May 5 18:11:30 2015 UTC,There's one huge change that I don't know if anyone else has posted about: I used to be able to do quick simulation and get the exact same result every single time as long as I used the same squad and settings. Now that is no longer true. I had it figured out where I could win Ultimate League every single time by using the right squads for the right games. Now it's a crap shoot.
FUTMobile,34t9id,mpassell99,2,Mon May 4 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, sneaky EA!"
FUTMobile,34sahm,PopeJamiroquaiIII,2,Mon May 4 03:15:34 2015 UTC,"Early tournaments gave out untradeable gold packs with contracts. This meant that players could endlessly simulate these tournaments  because after a 4 game tournament they were getting rare contracts (42 games or 10 tournaments with the 50% boost) and non rare contracts (19 or 5). With the coin bonuses, you could easily make 100K a day and from then on people started to play the market. Trading usually nets me ~250K a day but it's a lot more time consuming. I hope this answers your question. I've never bought contracts on this game because of the tournaments and I have ~6mil in match earnings because it's so easy to sim."
FUTMobile,34sahm,nannerbots,1 point,Mon May 4 03:36:24 2015 UTC,"It's FIFA. There's no such thing as a sensible price. As for purchasing him, you'd need to trade or buy coins. Considering the markets already in the shitter and sliding deeper every second, players will be at their cheapest to buy, but trading will be negated by continually falling prices of all players."
FUTMobile,34sahm,Tyson_Wilkins,2,Mon May 4 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"Theres still consumables tho bruv, theyre always gonna be needed whilst the games still being played... You can make a tidy profit if your willing to put the work in..."
FUTMobile,34sahm,kev11111,0,Tue May 5 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks both.  I have been spending more time on the transfer market, buying just to sell for profit whereas I used to only buy players I needed at the time. I guess I need a bit more practice though as I'm not getting anything like the returns mentioned on here."
FUTMobile,34sahm,Toobuckchuk,2,Mon May 4 08:10:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that things were different a few months ago. Prices got incredibly low around TOTY as people sold off to be able to buy packs when TOTY was released. That was also before EA started really cracking down on coin sellers, meaning that there were a lot more coins in the market for people to spend freely. I sold many TOTY investments for 10x profit. With the market falling now, it's almost impossible to get that kind of return without BIN sniping, which is not fun or easy. Simming is probably still your best way to go. You might try picking one card and following it for a few days. The time of day can cause a card to swing pretty substantially. Buy low, sell high."
FUTMobile,34sahm,Toobuckchuk,0,Mon May 4 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"While we're at it, any suggestions for how else I can improve my current squad? (Starting line-up, subs)  Ideally, I'd have Ronaldo instead of Neymar and Messi where Rodriguez is. I'd switch Benzema and Suarez too, purely to keep everyone at 10 chemistry.  I can't see much more I can change without the chemistry dropping off (currently all players are 10, other than Ramos, who is 8 but he would increase to 10 if I could get Ronaldo) other than trying to get my hands on more IF versions of the same players."
FUTMobile,34sahm,Toobuckchuk,2,Mon May 4 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"NIF or TOTY Iniesta at CAM, Bale at 7 chem ST (might have to make some other moves to make it work). Neymar at 7 chem ST over Suarez, IF Pedro at LM."

FUTMobile,34q0c4,nannerbots,1 point,Sun May 3 15:25:48 2015 UTC,he is unlikely to be in totw directly maybe they will add him as player of the year and give him a pink card. he was in the team 2 weeks back and he is going to be in bpl tots  and player of the year so i doubt he gets this week just 4 a goal
FUTMobile,34q0c4,ukplaying,1 point,Sun May 3 19:53:37 2015 UTC,Read from somewhere that if a player who is supposed to be in TOTS MC gets an inform card he's removed from TOTS.

FUTMobile,34pls9,Tyson_Wilkins,4,Sun May 3 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"If that's your current squad, use the 10k to buy some combination of Hugo Lloris, Jan Vertonghen or Laurent Koscielny while the market is down. I used to use this squad to farm coins in tournaments, Division 1 and Online while I traded around TOTY. With the money I made, and continuing trading, I got this squad and this squad to fool around with, and that doesn't include the ~750k coins I have for TOTS. Regardless, those three players were world class for me when I needed them, and I recommend them highly to anyone, especially teams on a budget."

The strikers will always make automatic runs and, if you time it correctly, will get into break away positions.

I don't, my OCD won't allow it lol I've already made 450k on silvers and bronzers since I found out about the tournament 3hrs ago... when people say buying packs doesn't work out, they may be right in the short-term, but long-term, I gotta disagree - I just dont usually broadcast it because ppl wouldnt be so quick to burn them and thhere'd be less in the market making them less rare, and in turn, less valuable for me :)  Anyway, yeah you can cheat the quick Sim, don't know whether its a widely known thing but it's something I was doing when I was building my club up and its still possible now, maybe because its not widely talked about... In order to keep it that way, and also not too ruin any innocent players fun of the game, (who may stumble on this post), I'm not going to tell you!! Not here anyway...

FUTMobile,34iso8,vaow93,1 point,Fri May 1 14:45:48 2015 UTC,The prices will be 10 mil plus at the very beginning but I can see most of them settling in the 3-6 range.
FUTMobile,34iso8,nannerbots,1 point,Fri May 1 14:50:18 2015 UTC,10 million plus for each of these? WTF....  And 3-6 after settling? Never mind then.
FUTMobile,34iso8,nannerbots,1 point,Fri May 1 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just speculating here. You named the high profile players and I think their prices will be high. Some of the less desirable players, e.g. Terry, Matic, Ba, Gonalons, Garay, Schniederlein will probably be less than a million."
FUTMobile,34iso8,nsm883,1 point,Fri May 1 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know, thanks for your insights. I guess it was probably a good thing I spent 2.8 mil to buy NIF Ronaldo + NIF Messi + NIF Bale then, seeing as I can't afford one of my most favorite players IRL."

FUTMobile,34j6m3,oompaloompafifa,7,Fri May 1 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"Neuer at CB would be a bronze card at best. That's what they did in FIFA 13 with a player called Felipe Melo,a CDM by default, when he saved a penalty in the 90th minute to win the game for his team by 1 goal. EA gave him a GK bronze inform rated 64.   EDIT: The keeper had been red carded and the team seemed to have used all their subs, hence Melo had to go in goal."
FUTMobile,34j6m3,vaow93,3,Fri May 1 16:37:14 2015 UTC,Aw man It wouldve been pretty funny to see a 91 rated gold neuer as a CB haha
FUTMobile,34j6m3,kev11111,2,Fri May 1 19:54:38 2015 UTC,"wow, ya learn something new every day lol... thats mad.... Why would Neuer be a bronze CB tho?? Surely a silver at least?? :)"
FUTMobile,34j6m3,seanhemi,1 point,Fri May 1 23:50:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely would never happen, but keep on dreaming. They would take a player from FCB II before doing that. But Guardiola always has something up his sleeve."

Btw, I think messi is much better at CAM than CF and certainly ST in my experience..."
FUTMobile,34j2z6,kev11111,1 point,Fri May 1 22:57:14 2015 UTC,I did mention NIF Bale/NIF Neymar. The slash indicates either of the two.

FUTMobile,34h0sb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 1 03:51:17 2015 UTC,Is there a reason as to why these bronze IFs are so expensive?
FUTMobile,34h0sb,Krishido,1 point,Fri May 1 05:13:40 2015 UTC,No one really buys bronze packs
FUTMobile,34h0sb,nannerbots,1 point,Fri May 1 05:15:49 2015 UTC,"its not necessarily that, a lot of traders only buy bronze packs because yr guaranteed ROI albeit in small margins... I've opened many, many thousands of packs and have never packed a single IF..."
FUTMobile,34h0sb,kev11111,1 point,Fri May 1 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"Part.of it is how rare they are, I would bet they are amongst, if not the most rare cards in the game. Beyond that is the bronze and silver markets are very corrupt. People buy up all of them cheap when they are released, then sell only one here and there. If you want to have one you have to pay their price. You will see in the players bio that most of them have 2-10 owners, and usually 0 games played, if that's the case you know who you're dealing with. If I have a choice I always buy from someone who has used the player in game."
FUTMobile,34h0sb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Fri May 1 05:21:40 2015 UTC,me too and someone who's not too greedy...

FUTMobile,34h0sb,kev11111,0,Fri May 1 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"His lowest BIN right now is 1.2 million-ish. You will have to be ""looking to spend"" a little more than 500-600k."

FUTMobile,34gta2,iLikeFatChicks,-1,Fri May 1 01:18:39 2015 UTC,Yea ik but the mobile market usually mirrors that of the pc and consoles
FUTMobile,34gta2,acao94,3,Fri May 1 01:35:52 2015 UTC,"Since he's a much older totw, his price will be higher since he's no longer in packs. Also since there's non on the market people will tend to sell players for much more than they're worth."

FUTMobile,34ecjc,kev11111,3,Thu Apr 30 13:32:42 2015 UTC,Can just imagine someone having a breakdown after losing this card... And someone wetting their pants at landing it!!! On the market now for 4888000 BIN wi/ catalyst card and 39 contracts...
FUTMobile,34ecjc,nannerbots,3,Thu Apr 30 13:33:17 2015 UTC,"When EA took the market down all of the bids stayed on the cards. So if someone bid 250 on a Messi with 2 days 22 hours left, they ended up winning it."
FUTMobile,34ecjc,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:04:35 2015 UTC,I assumed it might be something to do with the market going down or ''maintenance'' why would you set his start price so low though knowing such things are possible... sheeesh...
FUTMobile,34ecjc,Krishido,1 point,Fri May 1 20:10:30 2015 UTC,well could have been a giveaway or some sort of cardbuying u noe when toty messi was not on market
FUTMobile,34ecjc,Krishido,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:18:14 2015 UTC,I think itd be really foolish to do that tho... autobidders would snapped it right up in a fraction of a second...
FUTMobile,34ecjc,Krishido,1 point,Fri May 1 20:56:06 2015 UTC,I don't think autobidders are that fast. I've successfully transferred about 7 TOTYs by setting them at 5k BIN each without any problem
FUTMobile,34f08m,bitchfaceronaldo,2,Thu Apr 30 16:30:16 2015 UTC,Same but dynamic I haven't played with it too much but as high and zoomed out as possible to see the most of the field
FUTMobile,34f08m,FIFAsweatsquad,2,Thu Apr 30 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"I recently switched to End to End.  I can shoot so much better being able to see the goal head on.  Took several (read: lots) matches to get used to it, but I prefer it now.  Much better view of the action, and I can see what's happening up field.  Height is half, zoom is 7/10 bars."
FUTMobile,34f08m,suprslow,2,Fri May 1 02:22:44 2015 UTC,the problem with end to end is that playing the first half is completely different from playing the second half

FUTMobile,34e73b,JXBA,3,Thu Apr 30 12:42:26 2015 UTC,yeah i did... my squad rating was 85 then suddenly it changed to 86..and i know that the rating does not depend whoever is in ur reserves but when i removed someone from my reserves my rating changed

FUTMobile,34e73b,kev11111,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:54:46 2015 UTC,I think there is a bug. My 87 rated team became 86 when I added Messi into the team replacing SIF Griezmann
FUTMobile,34e73b,jk_here4all,2,Thu Apr 30 13:36:05 2015 UTC,"There is definitely something wrong there. EA, what in the world are you doing? Instead of adding Apple Watch support which not a lot of people might have, fix your bugs."
FUTMobile,34e73b,jk_here4all,4,Thu Apr 30 13:39:48 2015 UTC,An making the Messi more messy .
FUTMobile,34e73b,ukplaying,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:43:32 2015 UTC,that need not be a glitch the way the rating is calculated a lower rated player may increase the rating

FUTMobile,34cf37,bitchfaceronaldo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:11:30 2015 UTC,With the injury he didn't get enough playing time to deserve one IMO.
FUTMobile,34cf37,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:30:58 2015 UTC,He should do. He got injured so has only played 25/34 matches so far (probably 29 by the end) but has maybe been the best midfielder in the league after Modric. It's not just about game time - players like Costa have had fewer games and he'll definitely get one.
FUTMobile,34cf37,peppermintschnopps,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:39:32 2015 UTC,most likely no

FUTMobile,34cf37,bitchfaceronaldo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"James had a very good year. I think it's a numbers game. Isco and Kroos have been outstanding for RM, so I think they get the nod over James. If RM had run away with the title, then maybe they heavily tilt it towards RM, but they didn't, so... I can't see Rakitic missing out.  Parejo has been class, so maybe he gets a nod.  Also, there's no quota on RW/RM/LW/LM, so they might have an oversupply of CM and ST, since at forward there's Nolito already in MC TOTS, Messi, bitch face CristianA , Neymar, Griezmann, probably Vietto, maybe Suarez, maybe Benzema.  I'd love to see a TOTS Modric, too, but I don't think he played enough this year."
FUTMobile,34cc4q,nsm883,5,Thu Apr 30 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't what you are looking for, but my advice is to wait until TOTS."
FUTMobile,34cc4q,bitchfaceronaldo,3,Thu Apr 30 00:53:46 2015 UTC,Im gonna wait to buy it until tots but I just wanna know what im going to buy
FUTMobile,34cc4q,bitchfaceronaldo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"so, since you like CB Alaba, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you prefer the BuLi. Right now, on iOS anyway, TOTY Lahm is super cheap, under 450k BIN. He is class.  His CM card is at 420k BIN. TOTY Neuer is at 800k BIN. SIF Hummels is going for 170k BIN, and he probably won't make TOTS. I have SIF Naldo, and he's the best CB I've played with this year. He's at ~45k BIN. He's better than TOTY Luiz, TOTY Silva, and TOTY Ramos. He should get a TOTS, so wait for that. It will be bonkers. Boateng should get a TOTS, and it will be insane. His NIF is insane.  TOTY Robben is going for 1.6 mil BIN.   You will have plenty left over to buy whoever else you want."
FUTMobile,34cc4q,mpassell99,2,Thu Apr 30 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the Bundesliga, do you think Müller will make TOTS? I'm thinking about when to replace the SIF Müller that I sold off earlier. I probably won't be able to afford a TOTS Boateng, but that would be nice... At least, as you said, even his NIF card is awesome."
FUTMobile,34cc4q,bitchfaceronaldo,2,Thu Apr 30 15:04:46 2015 UTC,Muller is pretty much a sure thing for TOTS. I'd be shocked if he didn't get it.
FUTMobile,34cc4q,mpassell99,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I guess I'll hold off on reacquiring him for a bit, then."

FUTMobile,34becq,acao94,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:22:34 2015 UTC,"I was just looking at his ST price. It's around 4 mil. I have TOTY Ronaldo and he's the most frustrating player I have played with. I know this sounds insane, but he feels slow. The IF Neymars all feel faster, 91 SIF Suarez and TIF Griezman, too.   Anyone else out there who has 99 Ronaldo feel this?"
FUTMobile,34becq,bitchfaceronaldo,2,Thu Apr 30 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem. My NIF Ronaldo struggles compared to my NIF Neymar. Assuming IF are just upgrades of NIF we could extrapolate from there.   My NIF Ron gets pushed off the ball, tackled and often invisible. Kinda similar to the Ronaldo IRL. Lmao."
FUTMobile,34becq,lingmister,0,Thu Apr 30 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"I dont think there is much essentially, all depends on how good a player you are... If you already have LW, I wouldnt waste yr coin tbh :)"

FUTMobile,34a9ln,kev11111,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:21:16 2015 UTC,Good to know. Didn't realize that was a thing that happened
FUTMobile,34a9ln,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"yeah it happens quite often with me dude, both on Android and iOS so assumedly the problem is with the app... I find it happens more when you're checking market price... if your seazrching for something important to you, I would suggest re-booting and searching again :)"
FUTMobile,34a9ln,kev11111,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:18:18 2015 UTC,"I got my MOTM Ronaldo on a fourth search, he had 17 minutes left, so it's not like he was just listed when I searched the fourth time. The search is just buggy. It's important also when you think you are seeing a great deal, but you are not really knowledgeable about the players pricing, not to jump on it without a second search or you can get burned."
FUTMobile,34a9ln,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"don't I know it m8, been burned myself before like that, in fact funnily enough, what you just described happened to me 10 mins ago with TOTY CR7... First time I searched 7 pages came back, all Plain NIF CR7s... 2nd time 11 pages with some IF's... 3rd time 14 pages with a TOTY Ronaldo that I'm in on right now on open bid... same search parameters each time... If I'd left it first time like most, I would missed out :( Like ya say, don't jump in on it, put him on ya watch list and search again at least another twice... Fut is both buggy and muggy lol"
FUTMobile,34a9ln,lingmister,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yep alwYs search at least twice, occasionally you will find strange things on even a third or fourth search."
FUTMobile,34a9ln,kev11111,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:32:31 2015 UTC,I agree with you Dan. Sometimes I switch the search criteria by about 20-50k and cards appear.   For example of a card is available at 300k BIN and if I set my criteria min at 200k and max at 350k it does not show. But when I move either my bottom to 150k or my upper to 400k it shows. Strange huh?

FUTMobile,346gtb,aquillaroja,2,Tue Apr 28 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"I try to change my team every so often (I've used every NIF 85 or higher) and I find that I always end up doing the best with the same style team regardless of the league: Single striker, pacey wings and box to box midfielders.  Any thing else and I definitely play worse regardless of the quality of players.  Can't see to pair up two strikers and pace doesn't seem to matter as much anywhere but the wing.  Team I always go back to is my silver BPL"

FUTMobile,346gtb,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"Don't know why but I find the opposite, anyone I put at LM/RM disappears.  I tend to counter alot so I'd much rather have someone with a H/M or H/L that I don't want to track back"
FUTMobile,346gtb,FIFAsweatsquad,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"Yeh, lm and rm are never that great for me unless it's more defensive or really buccaneering. I get drawn back to the narrower formations, with cm's and cams. Do you find 442 better for bpl teams? How do you balance midfield numbers with sufficient attack? I'm using 4312 at the moment with a cdm in the middle, that's not bad, but I bet I'll move on again shortly. Do you tend to keep the same formation whatever your opponent puts out, or do you change to suit?"
FUTMobile,346gtb,Tyson_Wilkins,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"I personally like the 4231(2). It allows my RM and LM to play more like wingers on the attack, but brings them back on defence. With the formation I need to have a ST who is somewhat strong, with good ball control. I use Diego Costa and Lewandowski for my PL and Bundesliga squads. The outside midfielders need to be quick (Hazard, Sanchez, Reus, Robben), and the CDM's should be strong, with some decent passing as they start and often continue the attack (Toure, Matic, Schweinsteiger, Lahm). No matter what league or nation, as I use many for tournaments, most of my squads play like this"
FUTMobile,346gtb,FIFAsweatsquad,2,Tue Apr 28 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yaya is one of my favorite players, he always seems to be right where I need him at CDM, I just don't like any of the BPL CBs so hes never on full chem when I use him"
FUTMobile,346gtb,Danimalistic2782,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"You play Yaya at CB? I personally use Kompany and SIF Jagielka, but cheaper and good options are Cahill, Vertonghen and Koscielny"

FUTMobile,345aua,kev11111,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"Just OCD bullshit, it goes further than that even. All my players must be in their actual positions, no CB playing as a CDM for me. All players chemistry must be at 10. Once I accumulated a large amount of informs a new one appeared, all players must be informs or MOTM as well as the previous requirements. I have some squads that are entirely MOTM. My premier  clash tournament was like that.  It's not as real as I make it seem, can I play without these obsessions, absolutely. I just don't like to, it's part of the fun for me, building the ""perfect"" team as I see it. You will rarely if ever see me with a squad that every player isn't at 10 chemistry, all inform, no red links. Right now for the Spanish tournament I have a RM playing RB, and I hate it. I wanted the squad to be all bronze or silver, and there ilatent any Spanish informs in either bronze or silver. In this case the level took precedent over my other crazy needs so I'm playing one out of position.  How the hell did you get to 9000!!!!! I'm so jealous, I'm at 4600 something, I think 4629 now. I have a lot of catching up to do."

Well JUST shoot the same side you were sprinting towards, hold the power level till 70% ( takes some training ), BOOM! goes right up the roof  Once again - GURU of ONLINE DIV 1 signing off 😎"

FUTMobile,347cm9,Boosterflex,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"The subs getting ever more popular but I'm not trying to drive OP or anyone else away for that matter... hes got as much right to use this sub as I have... Its not like he's a bad troll, although his posts do incite a high level of negativity... Forums like this attract all sorts of personality types, thats a given, its also what makes them interesting and fresh... People will clash because of this fact, thats another shoe-in, I fully understand that and have no unrealistic expectations at all, he's not winding me up, whether he's trying or not, although tbh, I do sometimes get a little frustrated at senseless things I can't understand; for example, why someone would join a forum and go out of their way just to annoy people and make oneself a target... As for the minimal 'Expert' help he gives, its nothing a 5 second search on Google, Futhead or /r/fifa wouldn't unearth or alternately, many of the lesser mortals on here could provide... finally, if its not already clear, whilst I appreciate and respect yr opinion, you're correct, I do disagree - along with the majority of users on this forum it seems - and whilst it may be noble that you blindly defend him, you're the only one that has done so far, which speaks volumes in itself :)"

FUTMobile,347cm9,Tyson_Wilkins,9,Fri May 1 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"You definitely come off as arrogant at times. As I've stated before, you are offering good advice, with important details. I'm not too proud to learn something from you, or anyone that offers helpful information. If you are really as good as you claim, then a certain amount of, let's say confidence should come along with that.   Perhaps calling yourself the guru, a title that should be bestowed by others, is where you touched a nerve with some people. Perhaps while we learn from you,  in turn you can learn from us as well. There is always someone bigger and better out there, so the more you learn the better prepared you will be for the day when you meet him. (Me) 😜  I like the updates, keep them coming, I'm not ""hatin"". Just keep an open mind that there may be more to the game then you knew, it can only help."
FUTMobile,347cm9,nyza,3,Tue Apr 28 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"Well said. To expand, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Confidence is posting advice, giving helpful hints, and being skilled at the game, while arrogance is just being showy about it, and thinking you are better than everybody else, even if you are more skilled. Also, it probably doesn't help the showboat image that every one of your titles has your username and the ""Guru of Division 1"" mantra. It is a little unnecessary, as people could just see your Reddit username in the post, and if you are a good player, then the part of you being good is unnecessary as people will know you're skilled already. Dan doesn't title every post ""Danimalistic: FIFA Collector Extraodinaire"". Other than that, the tips are worthwhile and I have tried a few with success. Keep up the good work"
FUTMobile,347cm9,Tyson_Wilkins,4,Tue Apr 28 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"""Danimalistic: FIFA Collector Extraodinaire""   He should totally do this"
FUTMobile,347cm9,nyza,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:27:51 2015 UTC,I would pay him to do this

FUTMobile,347cm9,kev11111,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:21:19 2015 UTC,Give me a name and it shall be done. I will actually spend all of my coins on bronze packs just so you have to title you're posts in this format

FUTMobile,3454ov,peter_goh15,2,Tue Apr 28 11:41:43 2015 UTC,Alright then. What do you think anybody would be willing to pay for him?
FUTMobile,3454ov,peter_goh15,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:45:38 2015 UTC,"Well, since the only one on the market is at 15 million. So Dan might take it for less, but it is a guaranteed buy and its helping the community out. But you're choice, you could list him on the market publicly or you could make a deal with someone here."
FUTMobile,3454ov,kev11111,2,Tue Apr 28 12:13:16 2015 UTC,"I think he has... imho, dont think he'll go for anything near that, you will either see that other card permanently on the market or it'll keep getting reduced... whats his start price??"
FUTMobile,3454ov,kev11111,2,Tue Apr 28 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't listed him up yet. Are you interested? If so,name your price, and we'll try and work it out from there."
FUTMobile,3454ov,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Apr 28 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"no, he's not for me dude, thanx for the offer doe... was asking the other cards start price so I could possibly advise you the best strategy..."
FUTMobile,3454ov,Danimalistic2782,2,Tue Apr 28 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"I bought him last week for like 450k, I don't know why he would be so expensive now."

FUTMobile,3441qt,mpassell99,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:51:46 2015 UTC,I haven't applied it yet. Everything go smoothly? I partly ask because my phone is so full that I may need to first uninstall in order to install the update. I wish the app wasn't so big.
FUTMobile,3441qt,mpassell99,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:15:44 2015 UTC,It downloaded fine and game is working ok. One issue I have is when you are listing things it no longer maintains the openeing bid price. So you have to manually enter it every time. It may not seem like a big deal but when you are listing a lot of the same item it is extremely annoying.
