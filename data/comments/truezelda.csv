truezelda,3e1igd,1V0R,2,Tue Jul 21 09:15:57 2015 UTC,"They're both different in their own ways. Seasons is much more action and combat oriented, where as Ages is all about the puzzles.

If i have to choose I think I'd say Age  Emulating is possible of course, maybe you should play OoS again as well after OoA to keep a fresh experience with OoS, the game is a little different when linked.

It was so badass, and generally I don't choose in advance what enemy I'll target first, I usually just attack whichever enemy I target.  When it comes to Bongo Bongo, I'm pretty sure you can toggle Z to switch between his hands."
truezelda,3e1igd,creative_sparky,2,Tue Jul 21 08:20:04 2015 UTC,"Bongo Bongo was a problem because when you stunned both hands and he came at you, you had to z-target him then get an arrow ready then shoot it in like .3 seconds.   I'm exxagerating but that's what it felt like because I couldn't ever find his eye till it was RIGHT THERE.  Farore's wind helped a lot but it was frustrating nonetheless.

truezelda,3e1igd,nastynate66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:44 2015 UTC,There also should be an option for z-targeting to toggle or hold. I always use hold because of that reason. If I want to target something I like to untarget it quickly.

It's technically a sequel, although disconnected enough that you could also play it as a standalone game. But since you've already played OoT, it just makes MM the next game logically.  After that, whether you play TP or WW first doesn't really matter. Most people would suggest release order I think, so WW then TP, but pick whatever you want.  MM, WW, and TP all reference OoT a lot but not really each other, so the order you play through them in doesn't matter too much. Release order works well because of the feature progression, and MM straight after OoT works well because of their similarities, but that's about it. Just make sure you do at least try them all, since they're all great games and worth playing."
truezelda,3e1igd,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:31 2015 UTC,What would you say has the more challenging puzzles/bosses?
truezelda,3e1igd,robotortoise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:20:31 2015 UTC,"I would say out of MM, WW and TP that MM is definitely the hardest (and best) in terms of puzzles. TP also has some pretty difficult and interesting puzzles, but it's not quite on the level of MM I would say. WW probably has the easiest puzzles, they're still interesting but imo the easiest to solve.  For bosses, TP is widely regarded as too easy. It's easy to argue the difficulty of the bosses is a disappointing part of the game - while they're often quite unique and interesting, if you like challenging bosses then many of the ones in TP may be a little easy for your tastes.  For my most recent WWHD playthrough, I played on hero mode so I'm not sure, but I think on normal mode the bosses are similarly easy if not easier to beat than in TP. Not sure on this though, the bosses in WW could also be a little (but not significantly more) difficult than those in TP.  Disclaimer that this is all based on my possibly incorrect memory, but I can say that if you're looking for a challenge that, out of those three, MM is definitely the one for you."

truezelda,3e1igd,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:19 2015 UTC,"TP is actually my favourite game (and it's not that disliked), with MM being my second favourite Zelda game after it. So if your preferences are anything like mine, you're in for a good time. Be warned that TP has a slow start. How much you'll like the game is down to a lot of rather subjective factors, but most people at the very least like the game.  P.S. Remember TP has two versions, GameCube and Wii. GameCube version is rarer and more expensive, but is the original version. The Wii version is the port and uses motion controls. This post highlights most of the differences.  Oh, and then there's the N64 version of MM versus MM3D for 3DS, plus WW for GameCube versus WWHD for Wii U, but since you don't have a 3DS or Wii U you'll have to go with the originals for these."
truezelda,3e1igd,jwcoffeeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Did you play on GCN or wii version? And if  Wii: did you think motion controls were clunky?  GameCube: did you think z-targeting/combat was clunky?  If both what did you prefer? I read that post, that's extremely helpful, I think I'll end up going with whatever ends up feeling smoother."
truezelda,3e1igd,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not a motion control person. I own the Wii version, but emulate the GameCube version on PC. Like the guy in the post I linked does. It's sort of the best of both worlds, you can play in widescreen HD, use whatever controller you like (assuming you can connect it to your PC) and customise the control scheme.  So because of that and my dislike of motion controls, I'm not the best person to ask. Emulating the GCN version though, I can say that while overly easy most of the time and sometimes repetitive, I still find the combat fun. TP has a more diverse combat system than most Zelda games and I've always found the Z-targeting (or L-targeting, as it is with GCN TP) to be rather good.  It's hard to say, it can be a little clunky still I guess, especially for a certain element of the game which I won't spoil although you might know about already. Thinking back, I believe TP's combat system can originally feel clunky, but once you get used to it it's much better. Maybe that's just me though."

OoT is more of the ""sort of prequel"" to WW, with WW often referencing the events of OoT but not other games."

It says he appeared, slayed Ganon, does not mention how or why he disappeared, and then he did not reappear when Ganon rose again.  Also, the whole purpose of the Child/Adult split was that Ganondorf would never conquer Hyrule and Link would not defeat him, and since Majora's Mask is inarguably in the Child ending, it's impossible for Wind Waker to be after Majora's Mask unless the Wind Waker opening does not describe the ending of OoT."

The events of MM and WW take place in two completely separate timelines and have nothing to do with each other.  Still, those are the two I would suggest playing next. If you want a shorter game with lots of fun side quests and a very immersive world with many memorable characters from OOT, play MM first. If you want a much longer story with lots of pirate action / adventure fun (and a talking boat companion), play WW first.  However, both MM and WW have beautiful remakes for the 3DS and Wii U that I would suggest over the originals. The updated graphics and controls of each game make the gameplay much more enjoyable and they add new mechanics in order to improve upon the gaming experience of the originals.

Lanayru Desert I could see becoming either Lake Hylia or Gerudo Desert or both. Over hundreds of years, rivers could change paths, possibly even more so in fantasy. I've always thought Lake Floria was too far away / wrong direction to be proto-Lake Hylia.   BUT, I'm going to hold off on theorizing myself until Zelda Wii U launches. My hope is that Zelda Wii U will act like Skyward Sword in a way - Skyward Sword brought the Origin Story and unified Zelda Lore with the Hyrule Historia Timeline; Zelda Wii U could bring the Open-World and unify or mostly define Zelda Locale with a Hyrule Cartography (-ia?).  Or just add another map. I hope the former though.  Anyways, I'll delve into Zelda Theory again once Zelda Wii U brings some new stuff to the table.  I'll edit in some reference images when I can."

Wolfos, dodongos, and tektites only have 2 claws on their limbs, so that alone pretty much rules them out. Wall/floormasters have five claws. None of the other enemies really have claws to make a scratch like that. Of course that's assuming that whatever made those marks is something that we see in OoT, which wouldn't necessarily be the case.  They could also be man-made, with some kind of blade.

truezelda,3dvrjg,LostDeku,9,Sun Jul 19 23:00:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with your assertion that Zelda Maker would be ""too hard"" for a console.  Mario games at their core may be simpler than Zelda, yes, but the really good Mario Maker levels are going to be something people spend days making - similarly to how one might spend days building a fully-working, professional-quality Zelda Maker dungeon.  Still, the idea to have the level designer also available on a portable device is a good one.    The main qualm I have with Zelda Maker is whether there is a necessity for an overworld.  A Zelda Dungeon Maker would be a lot easier for everybody involved, but it would unfortunately feel like it was missing a lot.  However, including overworld tools would make it incredibly complex.  I think a Dungeon Maker where you could string dungeons together into quests would make a good system, at least for a first try.  It'd be nice to get the mechanics of Zelda 1, ALttP, Minish Cap, and ALBW all in one.  Also, explicit content would be a problem for Mario Maker too - it's pretty easy to build a penis out of bricks.  I'm sure Nintendo is prepared to moderate (they do a pretty decent job with Miiverse already)."
truezelda,3dvrjg,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"Really, I think it would have to be a dungeon maker, but the biggest problem I see with that is arsenal and health. Health could be standardized like in Four Swords or Tri Force Heroes, but that still leaves arsenal, which could either be a boring pedestal system like Four Swords, or maybe a ""Big Bag"" system like BS Zelda used, where it gave you your arsenal in a ""big bag"" at the start of each session.  As for the ""missing something"", I'm sure that if there is no overworld, one could implement those exploration elements into the dungeon. Heck, for another example of merging the two, look at FS, FSA, and SS. It can be done, and done well. Is it as fun as having a full overworld? No. But is playing a Mario Maker level (or several levels) as fun as playing a world in a full Mario game? No. But still, Zelda 1 style dungeon crawling is very fun, and it would be well complimented with the puzzle possibilities of ALttP/LA/ALBW."

I could see it being ""give the player 3 items at the beginning, with a 4th in the dungeon"", while health stays constant, just to help eliminate overhead and tedium.

However, people such as myself don't have that kind of time to sit down and plan levels. I might not get to finish a Zelda quest if I cannot take the planning around with me.

The LittleBigPlanet series' stage building tool is amazingly complex, but the users have created thousands (if not millions) of stages across the games and a lot of those stages have crazy amounts of detail. So I'm not worried about a complex system at all. I understand the concern with the amount of content and the sheer overwhelming amount of items and NPCs across the Zelda universe, but just look at all the mods and hacks of Zelda that have been released. The truly dedicated people will spend months perfecting these stages and they'll look gorgeous and work well.   I do agree with OP that there should be some kind of leader board or voting system so users can leave input on which ones are the best. Just so you're not wasting your time with 20 incomplete builds that are Link swinging his sword around in random areas and the completed and good ones rise to the top. That would solve content issues too because people who just build a giant Hyrule Castle of dicks will get bad reviews/votes/whatever and an 18+ NSFW tag. But other than that, I don't really see a huge problem with a Zelda builder at all."
truezelda,3dvrjg,solaris1990,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:59 2015 UTC,I do like the idea for using mobile devices to link with the home console experience. I feel like that is an appropriate possibility that Nintendo could use (in general) to extend their experience beyond/between devices without going the route of just porting games.   I am also in favor of A [Zelda] Dungeon Maker over a Zelda [Game] Maker. I think breaking the game down into smaller and less complex products would do for a better experience in both production and consumption.
truezelda,3dvrjg,meisi1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"I think its really interesting that you prefer a Dungeon Maker to a Game Maker. That's the first I've heard of that, but I think I see your perspective somewhat."
truezelda,3dvrjg,androsphere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:22 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing too. It wouldn't be hard for an established story to incorporate custom dungeons within it's structure. As you go through the main story instead of playing default dungeons you could play custom made ones played by others and picked at random (or by rank, etc. some system that would work) and skinned to suit the story's dungeon theme.  You could also offer narrative justification for a changing dungeon or 'dream' dungeon or something that you can revisit and which functions as a 'challenge mode'.  It would be especially easy to implement on the 2D handheld versions (memory issues aside) and could pave the way for a more ambitious 'Zelda maker' in the future."
truezelda,3dvrjg,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"That is true. It would be a great way to introduce the idea so that later the ambitious installment could be released. I actually think that may be the best course of action. The only thing I wouldn't want is to have a mainline Zelda game be replaced by this Zelda game incorporating custom dungeons. However, I think that problem is easily manageable. I would eventually like a full-blown Zelda creator along the lines of Zelda Classic."
truezelda,3dvrjg,jpw1510,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've really addressed the main issue, which will be the quality of the content. Mario levels are much easier to make, the games have simple mechanics, and are mostly about platforming. Zelda is about various items and puzzles. This makes level design a lot harder. This is why we get one Zelda game with 8 or so dungeons every few years, but Nintendo can pump out a Mario game with more than 50 levels each year.  So the issue isn't only that making a dungeon would take longer, it's that making a dungeon that is fun and worth playing is much much harder. The majority of levels published in a Zelda Maker game would be terrible."
truezelda,3dvrjg,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you raise a very good point. I may make an edit soon. ty"
truezelda,3dvrjg,henryuuk,0,Tue Jul 21 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"One thing to take into consideration is which game it would play like. Mario has the advantage in that its 2D mechanics (jumping and swimming) rarely change, whereas 2D Zeldas have three different combat methods. Mainly because Zelda 1 and 2 are different from every other 2D Zelda combat wise.  Also, puzzles have become a core part of Zelda, and a puzzle making system may result in very generic puzzles (like Skyrim)."
truezelda,3dvrjg,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Jul 20 08:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think Zelda 1, ALttP, MC, and ALBW are similar enough with some tweaking that it could work.  Obviously the mechanics between Super Mario Bros. and New Super Mario Bros. U are actually fairly different."
truezelda,3dvrjg,iliekgaemz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:08 2015 UTC,"I was thinking ALTTP/Minish Cap style of puzzle. And a puzzle making system, while it could be generic, if done right, it isn't. Have you ever used Zelda classic?"

He's defeated Ganon twice, wielded the true Triforce and, most importantly, he can jump at will. Two of his items grant invulnerability, and one of those also makes him invisible. He has powerful magic, several unique and powerful blades, mastery over time and the seasons, and is really, really great at crushing dreams.  Edit: Oh, and Link's Awakening's Red Tunic, flat-out doubling damage fully negates the half-damage buff many Links get."

Fierce Deity Link is certainly a force to be reckoned with, but would the mask even work? We don't know anything about it's in-world limitations, so the mask might refuse to work for any number of reasons.  Even if it did work, I think the Hero of Legend has the right items and enough skill at his disposal to triumph.  Of course, if we're disallowing items and making this a contest of strength alone the answer is entirely different. The Hero of Twilight would end all comers, easily."

truezelda,3dusmc,kaybee41906,6,Mon Jul 20 01:20:45 2015 UTC,Nice one. This is essentially the answer right here.
truezelda,3dusmc,henryuuk,30,Sun Jul 19 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"SS Link has all the pieces of the triforce to his name, has the best sword control, sword beams and is the most manouverable. He defeated something that Hylia ('said' to be a literal goddess) could not defeat, and did so in an honorable 1 on 1 sword fight.    He forged the very sword most of the later Links use.    Out of the 3D Links, he is probably the strongest. Just look at all the final fights and how much help each Link got.    OoT ""hero of time"" Link : 6 Sages helping him and Zelda herself MM : Nobody (Everyone if you consider fierce deity) WW : Zelda TP : Zelda and Eldritch abomination infused Midna SS : No one.    Meanwhile he was fighting the origin of what most of the other ones faced.    When we consider 2D Links, I'd say the two heroes of the four sword would do better then most people might think at first, simply because they turn 1v1's into a 4v1.    but A Link to the Past Link is also notable. Fought (and won) against a ganon with all 3 pieces of the triforce, something no one else has ever done (admittingly, no one else has had the chance to 'try') then went on to defeat Onox, Veran, Twinrova and a resurrected Ganon. Then defeated a nightmare and saved the windfish.    If he were to get all his items from all 4 games, he would have by far the biggest selection of stuff, including some very unique items like the magnet gloves, seed shooters, an animal partner to call upon, ability to warp into the dark world, etc..."
truezelda,3dusmc,henryuuk,16,Sun Jul 19 19:38:21 2015 UTC,SS Link's gear is the worst. TriForce would be great if it wern't fully sentient and thus outside help. TP Link is best swordsman. Hylia DID defeat Demise.
truezelda,3dusmc,CuccoPotPie,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"TriForce would be great if it wern't fully sentient and thus outside help     Actually want to point out : Does this mean OoT/MM Link can not use Navi/Tatl, and is therefor incapable of focusssing on anyone? Since the L-targetting in that game ""requires"" outside help"
truezelda,3dusmc,henryuuk,2,Mon Jul 20 10:53:36 2015 UTC,"Navi/Ta are fully sentient are outside help since they're fully sentient. L-targeting is a game mechanic.

truezelda,3dusmc,CuccoPotPie,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"L targetting in OoT and MM only works BECAUSE of the fairies, when Navi can't help, you can't L target."
truezelda,3dusmc,henryuuk,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:59 2015 UTC,I am aware how it works in-game. What I am saying is that it's ridiculous to assume someone can't do something based off of a game mechanic.
truezelda,3dusmc,CuccoPotPie,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"She sealed it, SS Link destroyed it.     TriForce would be great if it wern't fully sentient and thus outside help.     Only time we ever see this is in the Oracle games, in which it could easily have been a pseudo-sentience created by Link's wish. At no other point has the triforce ever shown sentience, and it has actually acted in the opposite way more often then not, working fully automated.    SS Link has more control over his sword, and at the end he is so strong that just swinging his sword against enemy shields is enough to break their guard.    That said, TP is definitly a good choice if we make the sudden (out of nowhere) 'rule' that the triforce doesn't count."
truezelda,3dusmc,henryuuk,3,Sun Jul 19 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Sealing counts as defeating. Otherwise, a ton of Zelda games endings were complete disasters. The Triforce shows full sentience in ALTTP when it chats with Link. SS Link doesn't have more control over his sword, you do. SS Link is also physically one of the weaker Links since he has no strength enhancing items. TP Link would also lose horribly against most Links."
truezelda,3dusmc,CuccoPotPie,5,Sun Jul 19 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"Uhm yeah, several of the endings ARE disasters. Most notable OoT, which is such a disaster wrought game (storywise) that it broke time and space into 3"

truezelda,3dusmc,Kshaard,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"It has also shown sentience by outright neglecting Users, Ocarina of Time has Gannon posess the Tri-force and it break apart because it detected evil.

truezelda,3dusmc,fistful_of_assholes,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:46 2015 UTC,"The triforce did not break apart because it 'sensed' evil, it did so because Ganon's heart was inbalanced.

truezelda,3dusmc,henryuuk,10,Sun Jul 19 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how 'strength' is defined.  If we are talking pure brute physical strength, then it's TP Link hands down. He's able to wrestle Gorons with only his hands and a pair of iron boots, which only add weight, not strength.  If the context is about emotional strength, then it's a bit harder to decide. ALttP Link definitely went through the most trials, though OoT/MM Link's entire life is a shitstorm of trauma and bad luck."
truezelda,3dusmc,Foyet,6,Sun Jul 19 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"TP Link saw some really messed up shit and kept his sanity, so emotional strength might be his victory."

Bonus: I know that it's too slow against another Link, but I love the ball and chain too. Maybe it's an effective strategy against the MM link wearing a Goron mask!   Edit: I just thought that with the shade skills too, he really is the best sword fighter. He can dodge around, roll and stab down from above. Dude has skillz."

Zora is decent, but his fighting is melee, not really in an advantage over a sword, and his only special skills are having big boomerangs and an electric shield.    Swordwise MM Link isn't really that good off either, His sword itself is pretty good, but his use of it is pretty limited, and WW Link adn TP Link would pretty much dominate him with their better swordskills.    Most of his items are also shared with everyone else and aren't really that dominant.    WW Link and TP Link have ways to become invunerable for extended periods of time for example, something MM Link misses.

Termina field is gigantic, still can't use fierce Deity, main pillar room in snowhead is gigantic, no fierce deity, miniboss room in Stone Tower is about as big as Odolwa's room, no FD, etc... Cause Fierce Deity is a mask MADE to counter Majora, therefor it only works against Majora (the 4 masked beasts are part of him/made by his power, as the remake makes clear by adding the eye)     Giant Mask : Can't be used outside of Stone Tower Desert boss room.    Stone Mask : somewhat ok, but TP Link his Wolf Senses can pick up on invisible enemies, and there is still no guarentee the Link's can't see through the effect, as all major enemies in MM aren't affected by the mask.    Aside from those, what masks are actually fucking usefull in MM ? Bunny hood makes you slightly faster, ok, but not great. Blast Mask is just an instant Bomb that hurts yourself, etc...     On top of that, there is more than just the 3 main masks plus the Feirse Deity mask. Think of the Giants Mask. Think of the Stone Mask.

That leaves Blast is suicidal, not that strong, and on an immense cooldown, and all other Links have bombs too. Stone is most likely not that effective in a fight against a trained swordman, as all enemies that aren't beasts don't fall for it. Giant doesn't work outside the boss room.    So please, do ENLIGHTEN me with all the amazing uses MM Link will get out of his mostly useless pile of face warmers.

And it's totally legal since they are both items of the Hero of Time.     Hero of time during his strongest point in OoT and Hero of time during his strongest point in MM make a big difference. If we just instantly give him OoT adult body and master sword and then add the MM items/forms together then he'd do somewhat better, sure. But there is never a point in his life where he has all of that at the same time that we can see."

truezelda,3dusmc,LLLLLink,3,Mon Jul 20 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Like I said; gameplay mechanic. I'm not trying to be rude to anyone, but I think it's a little hypocritacal to say that one Link gets to use something from and endgame cutscene but another cant.   I disagree, it's all about what they can use based on PROOF given in the game. Stone Mask and FD don't work outside of specific areas, therefor there is no way to use them in a 1v1 against a fellow Link unless said fight would take place in those locations.     The thread title was 'Who is the Strongest Link?' The Link from OoT and the Link from MM are the same guy, with the same experiences. The Hero of Time. I had assumed we were looking at every Link at their strongest with all their possible gear. I'll tell you this much; if I (Link) thought I was going to have a fight to the death with beings as strong as me, I'd go pick up every item that'd give me an edge, especially since I know where every one of them is.     THis assumes the Links KNOW they will be fighting. And either way, adult Link at the end of OoT, does not have the same stuff available to him as Link after MM. Stuff like the Master Sword and the gauntlets aren't available to him if he were to be in his 'state' directly after MM.    MM Link has all the experience of his time in OoT, but not the items, sage support (which admittingly doesn't do much AFAWK) or the adult body to support him.      Saying we just take 'everything' they ever had and giving them to them at the same time sorta removes the point of using the idea of : ""Them at their strongest during said games""    if we do that, we can also start making shit up about what happened after the games. OoT Link his strongest point would be somewhere between MM and his death and becoming the hero's shade, are we suddenly counting that ? I hope not, cause that would be fucking stupid.    If a fictional character loses his power, and then gains a different power, then you count both 'states' as different 'character' for the sake of ""who is strongest"" The later version will always have more experience than the former, but if his power (in this case available items) is lower, he could still be weaker, and thus should be treated differently, and not as if he still had his first power.    Take Gaara from Naruto as an example. Before the extraction of the One-tail and after. ""non-jinchuuriki Gaara"" is the older of the two, and the more experienced. but you wouldn't count him as being in the same 'state' as ""jinchuuriki kazekage Gaara"", and you wouldn't use both him having the one tail, and him using some new shit he learned afterwards under the same ""character"" for a hypothetical situation, cause that wouldn't make sense.     The Mask of Truth has the ability to peer into the hearts of others, per OoT. Seems relevant to me.     Not the same mask (just like the other shared masks don't work the same in both games). Even if it was though, if ""peering into the heart"" is done the same way you listen to animal's thoughts, then it is wholefully useless in a BATTLE scenario. With the 'hero of time', it's the exact same situation, thing is, OoT Link has a different ""most powerfull moment"", with specifics that he can't have/reach in MM, At which point he has OTHER specifics that the OoT version didn't have. If you have a character with seperated ""most powerfull moments"", then you count both ""states"" as different characters, cause it wouldn't make fucking sense to give 'MM Link' the stuff he was only able to obtain during OoT, and vice versa.     Yet again, it's a gameplay mechanic for the enemies, however, I will give you the pirate's noticing the Stone Mask. That is true. Although I should remind you that even Tatl wasnt able to pick up on the soldier's actual whereabouts.     yes she can she hovers over his location in the same way she does on scarecrow spots. And EVERY SINGLE 'sword trained' enemy you fight can see through the mask. The Garo's, the lizal and dinoflos, the ikana swordmen. Even the gecko's can see through it IIRC.    AKA : anything that isn't a mindless beast and is focussing on you doesn't fall for it.    Stone soldier was sitting still, and said that he was always a ""unnoticed"" person and in both cases is sitting somehwere with only 'grunts' style enemies.    Stone mask is one of the few masks actually usable, but it wouldn't be good for a lot more then sneaking away or maybe one sneak attack. both of which are unlikely to give him that much of an edge over some off the other Links."

truezelda,3dusmc,LLLLLink,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"I stand by my point that its a gameplay mechanic. It wouldnt be much of a challenge if the let you spam god-mode throughout the entire game, hence, the limitation. Mere programming.     Guess we disagree then. Fierce Deity is already said to be the combined spirit of the people of Termina, essentially gathered from all the masks and everything Link solved throughout the game. Saying it only works on Majora is far from far fetched imo, but whatever.    Yes, if we say FD counts for MM Link but the triforce doesn't count for SS because : it said some shit some time, then sure. (PS : following the ""no sentient help"" logic means TP Link can't use his boomerang, doesn't change his power ranking a lot, but interesting to consider) Then MM Link wins on the fact that he is the only one that got an item infused with all his outside 'support', as opposed to getting the support directly.    Though the point still stands that it has very little to do with MM's items, and just cause he has a single overpowered as fuck item.   I see now that you haven't had too much experience doing character battles, so you wouldnt know about how these things work exactly. No worries, I'll show you the ropes.

He simply asked who the strongest was.     So far for no condensending then.    You always assume 'at their strongest' based on what we KNOW. Here are some reasons he ""can't just gather it all up"" Megaton hammer : Treasure of the gorons he was only allowed to take because of the volvagia crisis. Several other items : No way of reaching them Master Sword : would be opening up the sacred realm again    And you should always base yourself on what is SHOWN, not what is 'possible' AKA : we never see him get all his stuff back. Saying he can 'just go get it' is imo about as logical as saying batman could win cause : ""randomly pull kryptonite out of somewhere"" in a continuity where there hasn't been any kryptonite shown. So in your logic, ""hero of time at strongest point"" suddenly implies an adult Link with the masks, all the items from both games, and items no longer bound by their SHOWN limitations. And why ?  Cause : I want that Link to do better is essentially all the reason I am hearing from any of the people here.    Suddenly ignoring blatant weaknesses of his items and ignoring the absense of other items/stuff simply because it tends to be usefull for him, while placing rules about what is allowed on the other Links.     Side note: Hero's Shade is NOT HoT. Nowhere in any game does it state that he is.      We have had WoG (That means Word of God and implies the creators ICUDn'tK) that Hero's shade is in fact OoT Link.     Tatl couldnt tell if it was Link who called out to her or not.

Stone Mask and FD are still not shown outside of those bossrooms in a cutscene or something either. And neither of the two are even required to finish the game, especially FD mask, which would fall into your own B-tier since it isn't something that has to happen"

truezelda,3dusmc,princekamoro,2,Mon Jul 20 00:50:21 2015 UTC,"Gauntlets helping the sword swing would probably take time to get used to anyway, since he would swing with more force than necessary and lose his balance."
truezelda,3dusmc,Enhasiac,2,Mon Jul 20 10:42:10 2015 UTC,"I'll break ""strength"" into some smaller catagories:  Raw Physical: TP link lifted and threw a gorron several feet (maybe a yard even, IDK imperial system, just works better for estimations) no other link has come close to testing this feat without assistance (like gold gauntlets). SS link did use that giant sword, but I'm not sure if he had assistance in that, or even if the sword was heavier than a gorron. TP + 1  Speed: MM link - play song of inverted time = everything but link slowing down to half speed (so in everyone else's perspective, he was twice as fast) this includes in-battle movement too. then he puts on the bunny hood for 2x speed making him 4x faster (outside of battle, still 2x inside) MM + 1  Skill: two candidates, Hero of time and Hero of twilight. the hero of time and twilight have similar skill, as the hidden skills taught to the hero of twilight was taught by the hero of time, though the hero of time was doing advanced acrobatics in MM in just his basic movement (like jumping ledges) and it can only be assumed he improved from there (he was like 13 in MM, we  know he lived at least long enough to father a son, which given his hero complex, he probably spent a lot of time training/maybe even military stuff for the royal family). Hot + 1  Tools: Tool load-outs don't carry over to sequels, so a single tool set from a single game should be considered, not total tools they have used. for this I'd say the candidates are: ALTTP, or MM.  ALTTP has a pretty basic load-out with only a few things going for it (though the useful ones are very useful) he has 4 bottles, and 3 magic spells that do more or less very similar things (damage or weaken enemies, mostly) and the magic cape and cane of Byrna, both make him invincible. the problem though, is that these all take Magic, and the magic meter in ALTTP is quite small. if he want's to abuse these items, he'll need a lot of green/blue potions (which he can only have four of).  MM link however, has all his masks, and some very nifty Items as well: stone mask makes him invisible just like the magic cape of ALTTP (and requires no magic as well), the Bunny hood (2x speed outside of battle),Giant's mask (uses magic to become Huge, with appropriate increase in strength),bomb mask (reusable bomb, hurts link if his shield isn't raised, and has recharge time), and the transformation masks, which require no introduction (though I will say the deku mask is pretty useless, and the Fierce Deity it OP as heck).  he also has some good Basic Items: he has a sword that is equal tier to ALTTP's sword (the fairy sword) and  the helix sword that is one up both the golden and fairy swords (though he has to use the fierce deity mask to use it). he also has light arrows (that are essentially silver arrows) and fire and ice arrows, the mirror shield (just like ALTTP has), Seven Bottles (three more than ALTTP), Cheateu Romani (unlimited magic that lasts until he rewinds time ( or at least more than 2.5 days, since that's the longest we see him with that effect)) and the Ocarina of time (the song of inverted time is especially Useful). he could have one bottle of chateu Romani and six fairies (if he didn't drink the milk beforehand and got a seventh fairy) for unlimited magic and 6/7 revives (plus fairies completely refill links health in MM, and only 8 in ALTTP).  ALTTP also has a tunic that halves damage, and a second that helves damage again, MM link has had his defence buffed in OoT to halve damage and another upgrade in MM, so they're on equal footing when health is concerned. I'd say MM takes the tool category. MM + 1  Experience: hero of legend has got many more games under his belt than any of the others, HOL + 1  most adorable: contrary to common belief, little kids wearing train conductor costumes are scientifically proven to be more adorable than kids wearing green pyjamas. Hero of Trains + 1  Total:  Hero of Twilight = 1  Hero of Trains = 1  Hero of Time = 3  Hero of Legend = 1  tell me if I could use any more categories."
truezelda,3dusmc,Crim_drakenya,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"Obvious answer:  OOT Link Child Timeline. He trained TP Link so has all those sword skills(if not in the games he is actually in), has access to the transformation masks including fierce deity (so massive raw power there and versatility). I mean imagine Fierce Deity using some of the TP sword techniques.   However, in terms of raw 'strength' its probably OOT Adult Link as with the golden gauntlets he can toss huge pillars. If we don't include strength enhancing items probably TP link as he throws goats about for a living.  However, Hyrule Warriors link also has a lot of raw power behind him though he's non-canon so not sure if he should be brought into the debate."

Blast is suicidal, and just an instant bomb.

truezelda,3dpwxs,henryuuk,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:54 2015 UTC,In a way whether it is canon or not doesn't matter as its essentially pulling people out of their times and returns them. Its possible their memories are even erased when they are sent back

truezelda,3dkp1y,LSPismyshit,3,Fri Jul 17 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh. I got my friend to start going through WW, too, and it's going even more painfully than this. We started when she got her Wii U a little over a year ago, and she bumbled her way off of Outset and onto the pirate ship. She got to the swinging lanterns and gave up. I couldn't get her to play again before I left for 6 months for an internship. A couple days after I'm gone, I talk her through the lanterns over the phone, and she stops when she gets to the fortress. That was last June. I finally got her to pick it back up this June.   She's good at solving the puzzles and stuff, but is just not good at controlling video games in general, especially 3D games. The camera is always an issue, I think she'd have an easier time with OoT-type controls.  Anyway, in two sessions, she finally leaves the fortress and makes her way to Windfall. I think the next session was spent entirely there. One more session and she makes it to the end of Dragon Roost. I was so happy that she stayed with it for an entire dungeon. She gets the boss key, I tell her to find the skull on her map, and she says she's done for the day.  GOHMA IS RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN GET THERE SO FAST RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT HER IMMEDIATELY THE NEXT TIME WE PLAY.  That was like 3 weeks ago and we haven't played since. She had just started to get the hang of the grappling hook, and now she's going to go into the boss fight that uses it with no chops for it. Ugh.  I want her to like this game so badly, but she never takes enough time to be comfortable enough with it that she can quit focusing on the controls :(  It's frustrating."

She enjoys the game when she's not focusing on the controls.   She wants me to get her to play more because she keeps doing things like buying a Wii U and a bunch of games when she barely plays video games in the first place. So she wants her purchase to be worthwhile. She finds nothing about any game intuitive because she didn't grow up playing them, but she really wants to play them anyway because she feels like she's missing out."

I don't think I could say a bad thing about it.    Ganon's Castle tests your puzzle skills that you learned throughout the game, and uses all the items you collected. Ganon's Tower has the toughest enemies in the game, testing your combat skill. Ganondorf, the castle escape, and Ganon are all the perfect lead up to the epic ending.    Say what you will about OoT, but it definitely knew how to end a game."

You finally get to the top of the stairs, and while you've been fighting enemies left and right, what had the big bad been doing? Chillen, playing the pipe organ.   I loved those small little touches Nintendo added. It wasn't just background music, it was actually what Link heard as he made of way to the top. Of course the music would get louder the closet he got to the source, just like of course his boots sound different when stepping on the cold stone floors vs stepping on the carpeted areas.."

truezelda,3dghn8,MarianoAlipi,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"lol yeah.  Guess young me was pretty dumb? I dunno, something about that first large room w/the floating platforms that required magic, where you had to light the torches. Just couldn't do it. I'd run out of magic and got annoyed constantly leaving the dungeon to refill.   Going back to it years later on the GBA, it was a breeze, but something about it the first time around made it difficult."

truezelda,3dghn8,g_lee,4,Thu Jul 16 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"Wait are you serious? Light arrows is the ""intended"" way to beat him since it stuns the longest and basically the devs were like well if you run out of magic and use up all the refills in the pillar youd be kind of boned so they made the rest of Links weapons stun him as well.  you can actually beat ganon without using any items other than the Kokiri sword lol"

truezelda,3dghn8,g_lee,2,Thu Jul 16 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can either door of time skip with adult link to never formally pick up the sword or you can do a wrong warp to get to ganon as kid link right after you kill ghoma. The game engine assumes at this point that you have the master sword anyways so ""actually having"" it is unnecessary. You can beat him without even having any sword by using a deku stick (+ ISG if you don't want it to break). Of course this requires getting past Mido which can be done with a number of tricks as well."

truezelda,3dghn8,Enhasiac,13,Thu Jul 16 10:03:56 2015 UTC,"and for everyone saying it's nostalgia goggles, I was 10 months Old when OoT came out, and grew up during the Ps2 Generation, I only played OoT on an emulator a year ago (after playing a majority of 'today's' great games like GTA V and the like) and I have to say this game even though it was 16 years old and made in the dawn of the 3d era it still is amazing.  it has aged greatly, the 3d models while not the most technically impressive can convey a level of emotion at times that I find modern games failing at times (looking at you Bethesda).   The music is awesome 90% of the time, and while the story isn't the greatest in the series (though I'd argue it and MM have the best stories on the n64) it was very solid and I think conveyed the way a silent protagonist should be conveyed. link did have personality and wasn't a completely blank slate but still gave enough room in him to allow the player to become him more or less. I really think most links shouldn't really be silent protagonists (not that I can imagine him with a voice), but OoT and the original three are the only one's that I'd hate to see talk fluently. it also built on everything that was started in ALTTP to make the worlds Lore a truly magnificent world to lose yourself in, (ALTTP introduced some key zelda themes but OoT is what refined it to what it is now). and because of it's influence is one of the most pivitol entries in the series and a hallmark in the lore.  TL;DR: as someone with no nostalgia goggles, can confirm OoT is great, and even one the best."
truezelda,3dghn8,WhoahCanada,5,Thu Jul 16 10:39:25 2015 UTC,"I have a similar story.  If OoT isn't considered the best game of all time, then FF7 is.  I only played that about two years ago and think it rightfully deserves every bit of praise it gets.  Both games get hit with ""nostalgia goggles"" comments, but I could never defend OoT since I was 11 at release and played it at release...  and N64 was my first system, lol.

And Target Locking was already a feature of many shooters at that point in time, so it was only a matter of time before it was applied to melee combat. None of its ideas were new."

I think the people who think it's overrated (either because they felt the 2d games were better or some of the 3D games were better) Problem is Ocarina is the reason we even had 3D Zelda games in the first place. It's not better because it's 3d, it's much much more deserving of being revolutionary and innovative than some of the 2D Zeldas (except Links Awakening and Adventure of Link) the original was a kind of glorified prototype with some of the worst enemies, puzzles and bosses and the most asasine mediocre clunky rupee/collectathon/grinding I have witnessed, most of the secrets were pointless filler.

truezelda,3dghn8,henryuuk,2,Thu Jul 16 07:08:34 2015 UTC,"Eh?  I've found most final bosses in the series except Demise and Yuganon to be quite boring.  Most of them are short and easy.  I never got that feeling you describe from Ganon at all.  What I get is: ""Punch his tail, aaaand -- wait, he's dead already?  That was it?""  This is kind of the case for a lot of final bosses in the Zelda series.  Wind Waker Ganon is epic, but really easy.  Twilight Princess Ganon is long, but even easier.  After you've played through it once before it's really kind of boring, because the most interesting thing about it originally was the feeling of ""Holy shit, what next?""  Majora is pretty boring too, since it's mostly just a spamfest.  Actually, I think Malladus was pretty good - it was a multistage battle that actually required a decent amount of effort and had some creative mechanics.  Then there's the 2D bosses, which really are just a spamfest most of the time... Find a sweetspot, mash B, move to a new sweetspot, repeat.  The reason I enjoy the Demise battle is because after the buildup, he is actually fairly challenging.  It also helps that there's an entirely different boss battle right before him, making the whole final encounter feel longer while being totally different mechanically all the way through.  The difficulty of the final boss himself might be because I was unaware of the lightning ability when I first played it, but even with that, I still find that he requires me to actually pay attention and try to use my sword properly.  We can thank the wonderful Motion+ controls for that beautiful bit of gameplay.  Yuganon is a bit mashy too, so he might drop off my list of ""bosses I like"" eventually, but I thought his battle was pretty creative and fairly difficult."
truezelda,3dghn8,CuccoPotPie,14,Thu Jul 16 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"The Horde battle, followed by the final battle with Ghirahim and finally Demise is definitly one of the best ""final battle sets"" in the series imo.

As for where to start, this probably isn't the community to help with the technical side. But we'd love to help you brainstorm/troubleshoot your ideas. Start with the storyboards, the concept art, and the level design. Take inspiration from how they were designed back then (and the lessons they've learned in the years since) to transform the familiar world of OoT into something new and exciting that will make players feel like they've slipped into a lost set of levels.  Once the gameplay is fleshed out, You will also certainly find folks here who can help you develop the story that the gameplay will serve. How will these new locations and items progress the timeless tale? Will this iteration lead into the Fallen Hero timeline? If the new ideas are good enough, you could eventually create a new boss battle with Ganondorf.   With no knowledge of coding or modding (how bout Gameshark cheats?), it may not be realistic for you to do it yourself. But if you present your ideas and concepts, you may find someone who is willing to work with you to turn them into something playable.  Good luck!!"

Any diseases they have are probably 'curse' bound or otherwise under control by the populations. Stuff like the zora prince getting sick only happened cause he was away from home for so long.    Also wouldn't be to strange to think the Hylian's natural magic does passive things like keep them healthy."
truezelda,3df7o4,henryuuk,4,Wed Jul 15 21:32:54 2015 UTC,LttP's bug-catching kid was bedridden with some unspecified illness. The fact that he was shown having recovered during the ending implies that it was something quite serious that you wished away.  I think in general it doesn't show you a lot of sick people is because you're a monster killing sort of hero and it's a bummer to see people who have troubles that are beyond your means to solve.

Hell, I think even Bill, Reggie or the late Mr. Iwata (R.I.P.) would have really been a solid source.

You forgot to count Four Swords and Four Swords Adventures, which have been recently confirmed for canon, and I believe have long been tie-breaker type games (as in, you look for it for the slightest bit of edge for your argument, but it isn't for drawing main information). Heck, you possibly have 18 since technically Hyrule Historia acknowledged the existence of Ancient Stone Tablets, yet didn't put it in the timeline since it was only ""link's adventures"" put in that."

It said, quite simply, that the timeline followed Link, and only Link. Thus, a game's inclusion or lack thereof in the timeline is not the sole determiner of it's canonical value. There are times when we must look beyond the timeline to determine things. If it isn't on the timeline, and also does not star Link, one must ask if it directly conflicts (and at a fundamental level, mind you, not just a ""he said, she said"" series of events that differ from each other slightly) with established canon. One must also consider who made it. A Zelda game is made by, or supervised by, Nintendo. This is quite obvious, but needed to be stated to weed out those canon-faithful fan games. Thus, there is no real reason to say that AST is ""non-canon"". Should it be used as a main source of canon? No, but then again, neither should any other one game in the series. Can it be used as a tie-breaker? Sure, and there's no reason it shouldn't be."

truezelda,3clneh,fishandchips20,27,Wed Jul 8 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all but one ""gap"" I've wanted to see filled have been filled at this point, actually, but I have other ideas for later titles.  The one gap remaining is, of course:    The Story of the Flood:  There was a Hero - we know this because Hylia's Curse states that they will incarnate whenever Hyrule is in danger.  However, since the people of the land were expecting the Hero of Time himself and knew nothing of the incarnation cycle, they did not help the Hero as they normally would.  Remember, pretty much every Hero ever goes from humble beginnings to being told that he is the Hero of legend.  What if he wasn't told that?  What if the Sages and Zelda didn't want to help him because he had no way of showing to them that he was the Hero of Time (and he wasn't - he was a new Hero)?  He'd likely fail, and history doesn't remember failures.  But someone sealed Ganon's powers in the Master Sword before Wind Waker.  So, I want to see that tragedy told.  We could even meet Laruto and Fado, if they were alive at that time.    Repercussions of Twilight Princess:  Here's an idea I had once - what if Ganon wasn't truly killed in Twilight Princess?  He was basically stabbed in the soul with the Master Sword.  What if he became a part of the Master Sword and corrupted it?  It would go unnoticed for centuries until perhaps the next Hero went to use it - then BAM, the Master Sword is suddenly corrupted in some way or simply shatters and frees the King of Evil as a spirit.  That would make for a pretty cool plot.    Brand New Potential:  We NEED Lorule to be massively expanded.  I want to see whether they destroyed their Triforce in the other two timelines (I think the destruction event is a parallel to Hyrule's Imprisoning War, so it didn't happen in all 3 lines).  I want to see whether Hilda and Ravio are on their own incarnation cycle or if they just happened to be parallels to the existing Link and Zelda at that time.  I want to see the politics of those worlds interact.  We have a brand new world that promises to have just as rich of a lore and history as Hyrule does now.  It would be incredibly wasteful to not pursue stories involving Lorule.    Speaking Of Potential:  More New Hyrule.  The Triforce is gone, Ganon is dead, and Hyrule is reborn.  It's time for a new primary villain who gets the Adult Timeline as their domain.  I want a new incarnation of Demise who will become just as renowned as Ganondorf Dragmire, including all the resurrections and sealings/unsealings that it entails.  But this time he doesn't need to be focused all around the Power - he can be smarter.  He can be wittier.  Maybe he is even the leader of a neighboring country and tries to take Hyrule by regular old military conquest.  Maybe he's a hero in his own right - to his own people - and has a cadre of companions who follow him and actually like him!  There's so many ways they could go with stretching Hyrule to its greatest limits in New Hyrule since it isn't constrained by the old traditions anymore.  The only ingredients we even need are the Hero, Goddess, and Demise in some form.  No Master Sword, no Triforce, no Four Sword.    And A Return to Twilight:  We need a game to revisit the Twilight Realm.  I haven't thought extensively on this one, but it stands to reason that there is more than one portal to that dimension.  It would be incredibly short-sighted by whoever built the Mirror of Twilight to make it not only the only portal, but destructible.  So we should be able to see the Twilight Realm again in some form, maybe this time without all the evil!  I'd love to see the Realm itself have its geography and layout explored some more too, in an adventure that isn't just a one-off dungeon format.    Competitive Dungeoneering:  Oh right, I thought of this one recently.  More of a gameplay concept.  I want to see a game where Ganondorf actually has to try to accomplish his goals instead of having everything already done offscreen.  What if Ganondorf was hunting one of the MacGuffin Relics at the same time as Link?  What if Ganondorf entered the dungeon a few minutes after Link did?  There could be entire dungeons designed around the competition between them, with the two taking different routes through it but interacting with the environment to try to hinder each others' progress.  It could culminate in a boss battle (one of those natural beasts, not Ganondorf's minions) that requires them to pay too much attention to it to be able to focus on fighting each other, so they're forced to ""work together"".  The aftermath of that would be really fun and tense, I think.  This whole concept could tie more into making Ganondorf seem like an actual person - still wholly evil - who actually has a job he wants to do rather than sitting on his bum waiting for Link to come stab him in the head.    The World Dungeon:  I remembered another idea.  Skyward Sword touched on this - the whole world is designed like a dungeon.  It was great, but I can think of something that might be even better.  Imagine a quest that starts with Link entering a massive underground complex.  He steps off a staircase that wound for miles and finds himself in a huge chamber that almost looks like its own overworld, except it's all dungeon.  Puzzles, keys, monsters, maps, items, everything, all there.  You'd have a general process you go through - find a path you're able to take with your current gear, follow it, and see if you can solve what it throws at you.  You might get to a point where you can knock down a drawbridge to make progress elsewhere, or you might find a door that leads to a completely different dungeon - yes, the main overworld dungeon, with its variety of sections, items, maps, and bosses, is merely an overworld, and there are ""real"" dungeons attached to it too, with their own items and bosses and everything else.  I think this would be fascinating.  It could create a feeling of isolation and hostility in Zelda, something that is lacking in most of them.  I think for the plot, it would be an excellent fit to take place after Adventure of Link, where the Hero from that game had his remains entombed in an immense, guarded dungeon to keep them safe from Ganon's minions looking to use his blood to resurrect their master.  There could be word of stirrings in the burial chamber, and the final boss could be a possessed, demonic Hero corpse, reminiscent of the Dark Link battle."

truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"Some problems:   The flood is explained as to have happened due to no hero being present. You can't have a hero for the flood since it's a direct result of adult link missing from existence. Thus it skips a generation to windwaker when a new link is finally born, and ganondorf weakened by the flood rises to power again after the ignorant new link obtains the master sword. This is explained in both Windwaker and Skyward Sword. The sword seals the evil within itself, and the master sword is pure and cannot be corrupted because it literally was once goddes hylia's sword. What removing the sword from the pedestal does is release evil's full power, but in the hands of the hero it's his job to take out the evil present over the land and reseal it. Lorule does not exist in the other timelines! The Dark world has a different form in each, just as the Light world does. Fallen Timeline: Lorule Child Timeline: Twilight Ream Adult Timeline: So far none, since Ganondorf never got far enough in this timeline. Also after Windwaker, there is neither a master sword or ganon anymore. Link must obtain new legendary swords, to defeat new legendary evils since demise can no longer reincarnate as ganon anymore (due to the master sword permanently sealing a dead ganondorf at the bottom of the ocean).  All that said, it's still possible to expand on Lorule. It just only exists in the Fallen timeline. I actually kind already explained this one in #3. The adult timeline is pretty much evil's fallen time. It's the one where evil failed completely. As a result Demise's new incarnations are mindless beasts similar to Ganon. Because the giant beast Ganon never actually existed in this timeline, the new incarnations skip the cunning human-like form that caused them to lose most of evil's power, and go straight to a beast form that this timeline's Link never had to deal with before. A lot of the good side's power is also lost due to the fate of the master sword, but fortunately Link forges and discovers new blades to defeat evil with. The adult timeline also has another major theme, showing the ramifications of having a more involved zelda that doesn't sit around. She is a major character always there with Link instead of some untouchable royalty Link hardly interacts with. This theme is also the opposite of child timeline link, who always has a different love interest than zelda because zelda is never really there until the end game. I'd love to see the Twilight Realm again, but it's very unlikely unless the sequel to TP becomes a Majora's Mask situation where Link tries to find a way to get there and reunite with Midna but ends up trapped there and partially incapacitated by a new enemy. Since the Twilight Realm is home to the creators of Majora's Mask this is actually a plausible story to add as its own interesting game. This is actually a really cool concept. It's been sort of done before with Agahnim, Ghirahim, Yuga, and Zant, but you take the idea a logical step further with actual mid-dungeon interference. This was done in Phantom Hourglass. The temple of the ocean king was 13 floors deep and had to be repeatedly visited. Although it is too small and cramped to be considered another overworld, it's basically an expansive area that's all dungeon. Also you could explore Windwaker's world and find things like dungeons in the regular environment. Skyward Sword gave a lot of freedom to move outside, while having the outside portions still be a part of the overall dungeon."
truezelda,3clneh,aeroblaster,2,Wed Jul 15 10:55:48 2015 UTC,"The flood is explained as to have happened due to no hero being present. You can't have a hero for the flood since it's a direct result of adult link missing from existence.   The Flood is said to be generations after OoT, the Hero of Time being removed from the timeline has nothing to do with it.  He would have been old or dead by the time it happened.  Just because an in-world legend passed down verbally (by a civilization that doesn't even remember Hyrule was a real place that existed) says that there was no Hero doesn't mean there wasn't one.  Why do you think their legend is flawless?  What verbally-passed information do we have on Earth from 1000-2000 years ago that has not been tainted by time?  On the other hand, we have Hylia's Curse, which states that she and the Hero will incarnate whenever Hyrule is in danger.  I am more willing to believe her than some legend.   the master sword is pure and cannot be corrupted because it literally was once goddes hylia's sword.   I realize this, however it's possible that it could be corrupted when the Master Sword loses its power over the centuries.  Recall that Ghirahim was able to hold it when it was just the Goddess Blade.   Lorule does not exist in the other timelines! The Dark world has a different form in each, just as the Light world does.   That's complete nonsense, sorry.  Lorule is not the Dark World, the Dark World is the Sacred Realm.  Aonuma actually outright stated pretty early on in ALBW's advertising that the Dark World and Lorule are not the same place; I can probably track down the interview if you want me to.  The Twilight Realm is also not the Sacred Realm.  There is a chance that the Twilight Realm and Lorule are the same place, and the Triforce Destruction Event was before the timeline split, so the Twilight Realm is further degraded than Lorule, but I find that unlikely.   demise can no longer reincarnate as ganon   Demise is not tied to Ganon.  Demise will incarnate whenever the Hero and Goddess appear.   due to the master sword permanently sealing a dead ganondorf at the bottom of the ocean   Do you have any evidence that this is the case?  He's dead - Four Swords Adventures tells us that a dead Ganondorf can actually reincarnate himself as a new Ganondorf.  That isn't to say I want to see Ganondorf again in the Adult Timeline, but there's absolutely nothing stopping Demise from appearing and being intelligent just because Ganondorf is dead.   a result Demise's new incarnations are mindless beasts similar to Ganon   What's your evidence for that?  Malladus is able to speak just fine.  I believe Cole is the incarnation of Demise for the Spirit Tracks era anyway, not Malladus, since Malladus is implied to have existed before the Hylians reached New Hyrule.   The temple of the ocean king   I don't think that fits my suggestion, as it's not the entirety of the game (and not big enough to be the entirety of the game).  I just want the game to be a nonstop dungeon crawl."

The reason the great flood happened was because there was no hero, since Zelda warped OoT link back to what is now the child timeline. So a pre-great-flood game wouldn't have much to do."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,6,Thu Jul 9 08:39:06 2015 UTC,since Zelda warped OoT link back to what is now the child timeline   Why would that prevent a new Hero from being incarnated?
truezelda,3clneh,GallantBlade475,3,Thu Jul 9 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"When Zelda sent Link back to his childhood, the unbreakable Spirit of the Hero went with him. He couldn't be reincarnated because in that timeline he no longer exists.  That's what makes the Hero of Winds impressive. He wasn't chosen by the Gods, he didn't have the Triforce of Courage, he's just a kid who wanted to save his little sister and inherited a huge responsibility in the process."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"He wasn't chosen by the Gods, he didn't have the Triforce of Courage   Heroes are not chosen by gods, they are incarnated when Hyrule is in danger.  What evidence is there to suggest that they are chosen by gods - besides the one from Skyloft who Hylia chose with her prescience?  And the Triforce of Courage is absolutely not a requirement to be a Hero...  Unless you mean to say that the Minish Cap Hero, Four Swords Hero, Four Swords Adventures Hero, and Spirit Tracks Hero are not, in fact, Heroes.  And don't forget the Hero of Man, there's no word of the Triforce in his lifetime, either.  Also, the reincarnation cycle continues just fine during and after Wind Waker.  How do you suggest that happened if it was actually broken?   the unbreakable Spirit of the Hero went with him   The Spirit of the Hero isn't a literal ghost, it's a personality trait.  Someone who has the willingness to do good will appear when Hyrule is under threat.  The fact that the Hero's Shade exists - literally the Hero of Time's spirit - separate from the Hero of Twilight is solid evidence of this.  ALBW also implies that Gramps is a previous Hero, and he's still alive, even.  Triforce Heroes might also prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt if we see three Heroes rise at once.   he's just a kid   Please note that this is the case for almost every Hero.  One of Link's defining characteristics is his humble beginning."
truezelda,3clneh,GallantBlade475,3,Thu Jul 9 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"Heroes are not chosen by gods   In Twilight Princess, both the Hero of Time and Twilight are referred to as ""hero chosen by the gods.""   the Triforce of Courage is absolutely not a requirement to be a Hero   You're completely right, but my point was that his courage and determination were entirely his own, and not magically gifted to him.   Also, the reincarnation cycle continues just fine during and after Wind Waker. How do you suggest that happened if it was actually broken?   The fact that the cycle was broken is completely cannon. That's why the world had to be flooded in the first place. My theory is that the Hero of Winds was chosen as a new hero, and every subsequent Link is an incarnation of him rather than the original Hero.   The Spirit of the Hero isn't a literal ghost, it's a personality trait.   SS establishes the Spirit of the Hero as a singular force which may or may not be separate from a Hero's soul. It may be possible for it to manifest in multiple people at once, but again WW's story hinges entirely on the absence of the Spirit of the Hero.   Triforce Heroes might also prove this   From what we know of Triforce Heroes's story, I'd be hesitant to say any of them have the Spirit of the Hero, considering it manifests in times of danger. An ugly dress isn't really life-threatening.    he's just a kind this is the case for almost every Hero.    What I was trying to say is that he started his journey with no magical aid or special destiny. No one asked him to save the world."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,5,Thu Jul 9 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"both the Hero of Time and Twilight are referred to as ""hero chosen by the gods.""   What knowledge would any of the people who say that have of the intent of gods?   his courage and determination were entirely his own, and not magically gifted to him.   That is the case for all Heroes.   The fact that the cycle was broken is completely cannon.   No - you're using an in-world legend as factual canon, which is folly.  The legend at the start of Wind Waker is told from the perspective of Hylians.  Nobody has any idea how the reincarnation cycle works in-world.  The legend itself PROVES this, because the people of Hyrule believe the Hero of Time himself - not a new Hero - is supposed to appear and save them.  They have no idea there are multiple Heroes.  They have no idea they get reincarnated.   the Hero of Winds was chosen as a new hero, and every subsequent Link is an incarnation of him rather than the original Hero.   What occurred during Wind Waker to begin a new reincarnation cycle?  Nothing even remotely implies that that happened.   WW's story hinges entirely on the absence of the Spirit of the Hero.   No - it only hinges on the fact that nobody was able to successfully stop Ganon before the Flood happened.   No one asked him to save the world.   No, King Daphnes quite literally does ask him to do that.  It's the same story it always is - Link goes on a quest to help someone, whether it's the kidnapped Ordon kids, Zelda in danger, or his sister Aryll.  He quickly becomes wrapped up in something bigger than him, seeking the divine artifacts to deal with the threat he encounters.  The Hero of Winds shifts from ""saving his sister"" to ""Get the Master Sword to beat Ganon"" immediately.  Remember - the King brings him to get the Pearls from the start of the game.  What do the Pearls do?  They unlock the Master Sword, by extension of the Tower of the Gods.  King Daphnes starts his quest by tasking him with slaying Ganon.  He doesn't tell you that until later, but that is absolutely what he is doing."
truezelda,3clneh,GallantBlade475,3,Thu Jul 9 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"What knowledge would any of the people who say that have of the intent of gods?   Sorry, I forgot to say the Light Spirits called them that.   The legend itself PROVES this, because the people of Hyrule believe the Hero of Time himself - not a new Hero - is supposed to appear and save them.   True, although it is supported by the King of Red Lion's comments on Link not being the Hero, he may be making the same mistake.   What occurred during Wind Waker to begin a new reincarnation cycle?   Divine intervention? Assuming the cycle had been broken, it seems reasonable that a new cycle would begin as soon as a worthy individual presents themselves.    Nothing even remotely implies that that happened.   The existence of Spirit Tracks seems to.   only hinges on the fact that nobody was able to successfully stop Ganon   Given an established instance of a Hero failing in the Downfall timeline, I'd say you're probably right.   King Daphnes quite literally does ask him to do that.   Really? My bad.   All-in-all, I think you're right. I wish more internet arguments were like this."
truezelda,3clneh,Phoxxent,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"True, although it is supported by the King of Red Lion's comments on Link not being the Hero, he may be making the same mistake.   I'm just gonna chime in here and say that the king said Link is not the hero of time, not that he isn't the hero. Just like Korra isn't Aang. In fact, it's quite the similar story, of the next guy in line having to make a name outside the shadow of his/her predecessor."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot to say the Light Spirits called them that.   I don't think the Light Spirits are all-knowing, either - even if they're the same entities as the deities in Skyward Sword, those deities talk about ""[Hylia's] chosen hero"", not ""the three goddesses' chosen hero"".  It doesn't seem like anybody has had direct contact with whoever the Old Gods were since Hylia was alive.   he may be making the same mistake.   This, definitely.  If the King knew how the reincarnation cycle worked, he probably would not call Link a nobody kid who isn't the Hero.   Divine intervention?   The problem with divine intervention is: why wouldn't they just divinely intervene during the Flood to cause a Hero to appear?   The existence of Spirit Tracks seems to.   Right, it shows that it keeps going, but it doesn't show that it was ""restarted"" somewhere.   I wish more internet arguments were like this.   The civility is appreciated!  I do enjoy debating about this series."
truezelda,3clneh,GallantBlade475,2,Thu Jul 9 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Light Spirits are all-knowing, either   Probably true, but if anyone knows the will of the Gods it would be them or the Sages (who don't do much).   why wouldn't they just divinely intervene [before] the Flood to cause a Hero to appear?   You've got me convinced, so I'm playing devil's advocate at this point. With the Hero gone, there's nobody worthy to be even a hero. The Flood was them divinely intervening, preferring to destroy Hyrule than let Ganondorf have it."
truezelda,3clneh,Enhasiac,8,Thu Jul 9 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"I think they could manage it, perhaps there was a link at that time but he failed, thus nobody remembers him, since he Wasn't hailed a hero like the others.  Edit: to quote /u/Serbaayuu (who said exatly what I mean 10x better than me):   There was a Hero - we know this because Hylia's Curse states that they will incarnate whenever Hyrule is in danger. However, since the people of the land were expecting the Hero of Time himself and knew nothing of the incarnation cycle, they did not help the Hero as they normally would. Remember, pretty much every Hero ever goes from humble beginnings to being told that he is the Hero of legend. What if he wasn't told that? What if the Sages and Zelda didn't want to help him because he had no way of showing to them that he was the Hero of Time (and he wasn't - he was a new Hero)? He'd likely fail, and history doesn't remember failures. But someone sealed Ganon's powers in the Master Sword before Wind Waker. So, I want to see that tragedy told. We could even meet Laruto and Fado, if they were alive at that time."
truezelda,3clneh,Izitnu,6,Thu Jul 9 08:41:26 2015 UTC,People want a game where you play as Zelda. Perhaps a game lacking the hero could be the cause. You play as Zelda and work your way up to the events leading to the flood from her point of view.
truezelda,3clneh,HylianHal,5,Thu Jul 9 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"The community at large would lose their shit if, in the series' first game with a female lead (technically second), we see Zelda fail, in comparison to all the times manly masculine Link has saved the day."
truezelda,3clneh,Izitnu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"See, I thought of that too, but I feel it could work. She doesn't have to fail. Maybe she has to oversee some sort of mission from the gods to ensure that the world floods but the history and knowledge passed down and it's inhabitants are safe. I don't know if I agree with Link being a female so they'd have to make the game revolve around her without him in some way. That or do a spin-off which people would complain about anyway."
truezelda,3clneh,HylianHal,2,Thu Jul 9 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"The distinction isn't important. I mean, it is to us, but not to Them.  They'll just be angry. Can you imagine the blog headlines? ""Zelda series finally touts female hero; everybody drowns"" etc.  You have to frame these ideas according to how loud, outspoken groups will see them, just as Nintendo does. It's a shit show and it rarely doesn't end horribly, but they manage it."
truezelda,3clneh,brody3060,2,Thu Jul 9 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'd rather a game set during Link's seven year stasis in OOT.  seems like there could be a cool game there, Zelda being trained by Impa and than having to spend seven years under Ganon's rule without being captured, helping out Link when he gets stuck and finishing when she 'accidently' gets captured by Ganondorf."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"What would you actually do in that game?  Zelda cannot gather any artifacts except perhaps the Goddess Harp.  She doesn't carry anything else important aside from that.  She can't help the Sages, because Link does that.  At best she could help evacuate Castle Town, but that's not a full game.  Also, intense ninja training probably was most of those seven years... it didn't happen in a week.  [Insert rant about her deciding to stop using those ninja skills at the end of the game.]"
truezelda,3clneh,Izitnu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:03:21 2015 UTC,I have heard of people suggested a game following Zelda through Skyward Sword. I thought about it and it would basically be the same story and you'd just redo the dungeons except you wouldn't have any cool weapons or items (that I know of).
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the game would end in about a third of the time SS does...  I mean I guess these would be nice ideas if Nintendo was in the practice of doing DLC for their Zelda games."
truezelda,3clneh,Enhasiac,2,Fri Jul 10 13:18:24 2015 UTC,yes! that would work!!
truezelda,3clneh,Ziazan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"I almost burst into tears at the thought of this, every damn time. It's just too epic. a Zelda game where you actually play as Zelda and instead of sword and shield you get sword and spellglove and greater agility and a short/mid range teleport and dins fireballs and nayru's love is your shield and ugh I want this so bad.  I don't think I want it in the flood timeline though. I think I want it in a future timeline, much further down than we've ever seen yet, the world being futuristic but in a magical, corrupted way. I want it to be dark. Dark as fuck. Darker than Majoras Mask. (In theme, not lighting.)"
truezelda,3clneh,Izitnu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"I think she would have to learn new spells. Maybe Zelda is still young and hasn't fully developed her skills yet so she is forced to travel around and learn new abilities.   As for dark, how about Ganondorf (or whoever is the bad guy) learns through magic who Link is as a young child and kills him. So now there's no hero and Zelda learns later as she gets older that the hero has died and she must take up his place."
truezelda,3clneh,TheGiik,6,Mon Jul 13 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"Going by WW's intro, it never mentions anything of someone trying to defeat ganon, it's just that he never showed up. OoT's Link was supposed to be the incarnation to defeat that Ganon, but he's stuck in the other timeline, where Ganon never rose to power."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,4,Thu Jul 9 08:44:47 2015 UTC,OoT's Link was supposed to be the incarnation to defeat that Ganon   The legend telling of the Flood itself states that generations passed between the Hero of Time beating Ganon and Ganon returning.  The Hero of Time would have already been dead.
truezelda,3clneh,TheGiik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:21:09 2015 UTC,"oh, hm. I didn't take that into account...Since WW Link exists it's definitely not a case of link's bloodline being removed from the timeline or something. I dunno!"
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 17:39:30 2015 UTC,"No, his bloodline got removed - the only Heroes we know are related by blood are Twilight and Time."
truezelda,3clneh,Rosario_Di_Spada,2,Thu Jul 9 18:32:15 2015 UTC,(And WW / Phantom Hourglass Link and Spirit Tracks Link are probably blood-related too.)
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but with the implied romance between Tetra and Link I'm still only 50/50 shot on that being a thing.  If they ended up founding New Hyrule together and marrying, their descendant of only 3 generations later probably wouldn't be a train engineer and there's also some chemistry between ST Zelda and ST Link so there's some relatively close incest there to deal with too (not that it matters one iota genetically being that far apart, but people still think it's gross for some reason)."
truezelda,3clneh,Jinketsu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"Doesn't explain Link's statue in Hyrule Castle.  EDIT: Misunderstood the post. Took it as Link had never shown up at all, not just during Ganon's takeover."
truezelda,3clneh,Izitnu,3,Thu Jul 9 11:55:46 2015 UTC,The statue was build when the Hero of Time was still known and just sat there. There are statues that are hundreds of years old all over.
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 13:30:04 2015 UTC,That's the Hero of Time - the people of Hyrule thought that the Hero of Time was a true time traveler who went to different eras and helped people and they absolutely worshiped him.  Which is why the actual Hero of that era had no chance to succeed.
truezelda,3clneh,tstarboy,3,Thu Jul 9 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"They could make a game where you play as Hyrule Knights or some other willing-to-fight-but-not-Link character and complete mundane missions in a perfectly happy post-OoT Hyrule, but slowly revealing Ganon's revival."
truezelda,3clneh,zillegas,3,Thu Jul 9 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this a lot. I'd love to see a flood game, especially for the fact that we could get one more chance to have an extremely badass version of Ganondorf as the villain without it being contrived.    Have you played Halo Reach? I think a flood game could play out the hero like that. In Reach, you ""won"" by getting Cortana off the planet. Your victory was in the face of a larger scale loss, but the heroes of the story made a huge difference. In a flood game, I imagine your ""victory"" being something along the lines of facilitating the escape of the people, or doing some favor from the Gods or something that prevents Ganondorf from outright annihilating everyone and everything. There would be plenty of ways to set up a meaningful victory for a hero, and still being able to justify the idea of people not knowing about him. There are several Links where the people were generally ignorant of their savior. The ""hero did not appear"" thing could simply be chalked up to the unreliable narrator.    But alas, it will never happen."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"We know somebody sealed Ganon's powers in the Master Sword before the Flood, actually.  There's your sacrificial victory right there."
truezelda,3clneh,TheBigKyurem,6,Thu Jul 9 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"I want a Lorule story with Ravio as the protagonist, since Lorule most likely has its own version of Demise's Curse"
truezelda,3clneh,HylianHal,5,Thu Jul 9 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"Unless Demise is Hylia's Lorulian counterpart!  See: inverted Triforce on his blade, also SS's intro showing his minions rising from the underworld via cracks very reminiscent of LBW's dimensional rifts between Lorule and Hyrule."
truezelda,3clneh,TheBigKyurem,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:53 2015 UTC,Woah.
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"And he was banished for trying to abuse their Triforce, which is why he hates humans and desires Hyrule's Triforce."
truezelda,3clneh,TheBattler,11,Thu Jul 9 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"Everybody has an idea for a game just before the Flood but I have an idea for it that I haven't seen anybody else come up with.  I want to see a Zelda game with multiple characters like Majora's Mask was. Different characters with different abilities, except here they will be separate characters in storyline rather than transformations.  Ganon comes back, but he's only partially powerful. He finds out that the Hero of Time was sent back in time and he has no descendant; he's very excited at hearing this and instead of working behind the scenes, he makes his conquest of Hyrule very public and uses fear of what happened during OoT to bring people in line. It takes him approximately the same amount of time (7 years) to conquer the world again. The game takes place in like year 6 or something. So everyone knows who and what Ganondorf is, and they think the Hero is coming. A bunch of people claim to be the Hero. The sad thing is, none of them are.  4 ""Heroes"" come together, each tasked by their race to stop Ganon. Something something about coming of age and being the same age as the Hero of Time. One has to be a Hylian, who is primarily a spellcaster and uses the elemental arrows. One can be a Goron, and I have a hard time choosing between a Sheikah, a Gerudo, a Deku, or a Zora. The Heroes must go through co-operative dungeons and use their differing abilities.  In the end, Ganon reaches full power and is nearly victorious. At some point, the King of Hyrule manages to cast some sort of crazy ass spell and drowns Hyrule in rain. The 4 Heroes help evacuate the Hyruleans to the mountaintops and fight Ganon in a losing fight."

truezelda,3clneh,BlueJoshi,3,Fri Jul 10 01:53:41 2015 UTC,"See I feel the other way around! Don't get me wrong, being Sheik would rock, too (and switching between the two forms would very much fit the series' gameplay trends), but I'd much rather play as Princess Zelda. In particular, I've always really liked the idea of her fencing and overall being more... elegant, I guess? than Link. Hyrule Warriors actually does a decent job reflecting that, IMO. Add in some magic (like, somewhat ironically, Sheik in HW), and I think she'd be super fun to play as!  Like, don't get me wrong, a sneaky ninja game as Sheik would be super cool and I'd love to play that. But I'd love it even more if that wasn't the only playstyle."
truezelda,3clneh,madmaz186,3,Fri Jul 10 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"That would be pretty neat! Since she doesn't have a shield, you'd have to rely of parries and quick movement in battle."

truezelda,3clneh,Grantus89,4,Thu Jul 9 10:53:04 2015 UTC,A world that's a combination of Twilight Princess and Skyrim.  Controls and movement that's a combination of Skyward Sword and Assassins Creed.  Quests of Majoras Mask.

Especially if it establishes Hylia's Curse without a shadow of a doubt.
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,3,Fri Jul 10 16:00:03 2015 UTC,I think a prequel story for Majora's Mask showing the story for the existence of the fierce deity and it's connection with majora would be pretty cool.  There's never really a Zelda excluding the whole Hero saves the princess from ganon or ganondorf scenario except for Majora's mask.
truezelda,3clneh,CyonicWolf,7,Thu Jul 9 01:22:15 2015 UTC,Aonuma spoke on the Fierce Deity mask recently - he said that it's an entity that was created by the combined power and feelings of all the people in Termina.  Hence being created by spending all the masks that they gave to Link.
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Jul 9 02:18:18 2015 UTC,oh do you have a link for this i'm curious to read it!
truezelda,3clneh,CuccoPotPie,6,Thu Jul 9 02:22:59 2015 UTC,poof  Obviously he still leaves it open to interpretation but it's fair to say that that's how he wants us to interpret it.
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Jul 9 02:31:31 2015 UTC,So you're carrying a whole city's desire for VENGEANCE! Seems Batman-y

truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:37:03 2015 UTC,So it's not a deity sealed into a mask like majora?  it was created at the moment when link gets it?
truezelda,3clneh,B3N1GND351GN,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:53:00 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the case!  At least, that's how Aonuma likes to think of it."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:42:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but that is very dull to me.  A mask supposedly representing a deity that is strong enough to defeat majora's mask but doesn't have it's own true origin just seems like a deux ex machina.  it'd be a little different if there was a backstory for it like there is for majora's mask."
truezelda,3clneh,Zerra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:02:18 2015 UTC,"I quite like the idea of the feelings - all the pain and hope and love - of everybody who gifted Link a mask in Termina coming together and taking their vengeance on Majora, defending their home from it, casting it away from their land.  It's a lot more meaningful to me than ""There was some angry god sealed in here too once""."
truezelda,3clneh,henryuuk,3,Wed Jul 15 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"After Ganon's latest physical demise, his spirit is sealed into the Twilight Realm and, with no way to escape, reincarnates as one of the Twili after so many decades.  Paralleling the OoT royal plot, Twili-Ganon works his way up the tiers of power until eventually claiming the throne for himself. But he discovers that only one of royal blood - see Midna, or offspring - can open a passage to Hyrule, and he's disposed of them all.   Alone, borderline-permanently trapped, he schemes.  What he can do from the seat of power is look across into Hyrule as day fades to dusk, and night fades to dawn. And it is in doing so that he searches for an outside-answer - the Hero, still young, still pliable to concepts of good and evil, weakness and strengths.  The Hero comes to regard the shadowy presence speaking to him - that no one else can see - as a friend. As the Hero grows they interact that much more and the Hero grows sorrowful for his 'trapped friend', with notions planted in his head to be an adventurer and find the keys(Mirror Shards) that can release him.   As a young man the Hero departs on that quest, now moderately bent in the mind toward a darker disposition on life. He is not cruel, but less willing to step out and lend a hand to a stranger. He is transformed from a man that could have awoken the Triforce of Courage and drawn the Mastersword to a figure lacking that purity.  After completing the necessary trials and uniting the shards, releasing Twili-Ganon into Hyrule, in their first eye-to-eye meeting the next twist emerges; for all his scheming and dedication decade after decade, Twili-Ganon does not bestir the Triforce of Power, but that of Wisdom. His accumulated knowledge triumphs over his inherit greed. This Ganon is not the same as the Gerudo who would have conquered Hyrule centuries earlier, not from the same ways.   Using his influence over the Hero, Twili-Ganon sets into motion the dissolution of any surviving artifacts the youth might turn against him again, by gradually insinuating themselves into each respective country - the Gorons and Mogmas first, then the Zoras, and consolidating tacit alliances while playing them against the Hylians.   But for all his searching, the Mastersword remains elusive.  After seven years the Hero has now become a Dark Hero. Moblins and their ilk, the typical villainous monsters in the way of the purer races, are set to be exterminated from each domain, and who should be in the forefront, learning and adapting and growing more mature yet gradually desensitized to death? The Hero turning to Darkness.  The General to Twili-Ganon's Chancellor at the end of this period, wielding a modded sword for each occasion subtly enchanted with Twili-magic and, in time, armor likewise modded, gaining or losing particular benefits from additional race-based niche upgrades far removed from the Gear of the Hero of Time.  Come the Hylian Coup, those people are hemmed in from every side with enemies. The falling Hero is dispatched to infiltrate them and see first hand the atrocities they commit - unaware of the magic corrupting him, or the other agents Chancellor Ganon has set to further his purpose. Skirmishes engaged in the next few months nearby, word of mouth worrying over what is to come - all the falling Hero hears and sees is twisted out of context.  At last the time comes to sabotage the city gates as the gathered armies of the People of Hyrule march against the Hylians. The end result is Hyrule Castle crumbling, the townsfolk put to the slaughter, and the Dark Hero face to face with the last Sheikah as Chancellor Ganon assumes the Hyrule Throne.  In the harried combat between the Fallen Hero and the Sheikah, each awaken the remaining Triforce pieces - Power for the Hero, Courage for the Sheikah. Disoriented and confused as Ganon's Twili magic is resisted, but not overtly broken, the Hero disengages and reports back to his old friend and ally while the Sheikah escapes into the wild - the ancient Kokiri Forest, long forgotten about by the other races.  From there the months that pass show the Fallen Hero sent out for clues of the last Sheikah. When next they meet it is she wielding a nominally diminished Mastersword, much rusted - for the blade is tied to the Hero - and in need of being forged again, yet suitable to parry the bastard swords he is wielding, as he fights unknowingly against Ganon's entrapment's. They break away as the Mastersword cracks at the end, and she escapes once more, albeit with only the hilt and two-quarters of the blade, leaving the remaining tip embedded before him in the ground. Abandoning the Sheikah to answer the strange cry in his blood, the cold chill breaking across his skin, the Fallen Hero reluctantly picks up the leftover sword; and a moment of crystal clarity slices through his atrocities down to the boy he was, long ago, before he met his 'shadow friend'.  In anguish the Fallen Hero vows to right what went wrong - yet in his own ways. Power burns in his body now, not Courage. It is Power that he will heed.   On the other side of things, the Sheikah laments the ruination of her last true weapon against the Alliance of Hyrule. The secret lore spoke only to 'seek the forgotten forests' and thus she has. In time she finds ancient ruins and a dying tree that guides her to the empty Lanayru Desert upon denoting the broken Mastersword. A handful of Gerudo tribeswomen still survive, still training. While no match for their combative prowess she is taken in and taught their ways, and they who, eventually, examine and try, at her pleading, to clean and prepare the Mastersword to be forged again - in the process, disturbing the slumbering Sword Spirit within.   From there; the Sheikah would be sent out into the world under stealth missions to infiltrate each of the other domains, acquiring a necessity for making the repair. Din's Fire from Death Mountain, a source of heat great enough for forge; frozen ore from the Zora's icy caverns, and thunder-struck ore from the forbidden corners of the Desert. The Light of Hylia is added from the Triforce itself, giving strength, however temporary, to dispel the Dark Magic of Ganon. With the Gerudo aiding under the Mysterious Spirit's advice and singing, the Sword that was Broken is Renewed, tempered to the Sheikah's hands.  By that point the Fallen Hero has been gradually awakening from the Twili and Triforce of Wisdom's distortions and looking for cracks in the Alliance to exploit. His problems are that, since taking the Throne of Hyrule, Chancellor Ganon has extended his controlling magic to all the people underneath his sway. The Fallen Hero will find no allies within the court; but he has discovered a side-effect of the Triforce of Power, and that is how to raise and control the monsters slaughtered so indiscriminately. Under the guise of hunting for the Sheikah and keeping his skills sharp, the Fallen Hero goes out to find servants among the deep-dwelling monsters of the land.   Acutely aware of the odds of spying, at least at day-end and day-begin, he spends most of his time doing as he's said; but in the remaining hours he treks far and wide, and fights against the great monsters of olde. With each he defeats, but not slays, he forces obedience from them with the Triforce.  He in turn uses them to terrorize the people left behind in each domain, and with the Triforce's sway, snap the Gorons, Mogmas, Zoras, and any others out of Ganon's mind-control.   Thus, toward game end, having amassed a vast array of monstrous allies and the peoples he thought he was fighting for all those years for his army, the Fallen Hero marches upon Hyrule Castle again. The Sheikah, with a floating spirit at her side and the reforged Mastersword in hand, meets him on the way; she flees ahead while the spirit stays behind to speak with him, and, regretting what has come to pass, he sets aside any grudge toward the Sheikah- at least until their end-goals of putting down Chancellor Ganon have reconciled.  Ganon tries to reassert his mental whammy and Twili-magic on the folk. The Fallen Hero breaks it with the Dominance of the Triforce of Power. In the end they two become locked into a clash of wills, and the Sheikah delivers the crippling blow to Twili-Ganon. Striding up at that point, the Fallen Hero lays his hand over hers to strike the killing blow together.  At that point, either the Triforces reassert themselves accordingly, or, more realistically, as Ganon dies, each - Hero and Sheikah - must make amends and clean up the consequences of their actions in the aftermath, more specifically from his end. The Sheikah unveils herself as the rightful heir and Princess, banishes the Hero from Hyrule - with all his surviving monsters - and begins the horrific task of diplomacy.  At the end the Hero departs Hyrule a villain. He redeemed himself at the end, or so he thought, and the spirit of the sword follows him to act as a moral compass in the wastelands across the desert beyond even the forbidden lands."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Jul 9 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"Gameplay wise Four Swords like multiplayer game with a third person Zelda game.  (doesn't have to be 4 player per say though)    Or, a game in which you have several helpers you can swap between controlling (like with gongoron in PH and Spirit Zelda in ST) BUT, a second player can take command of the helpers.    Or a foursword like game where everyone is a different race/has a different set of abilities (sorta like taking triforce heroes even further then just items and passive abilities)  Story-wise : A game in which many generations after New Hyrule, people go back to the ""great sea"" above old hyrule, which is now a vast landmass connected by the seeds of the great deku tree, with interconnecting waterholes inbetween them. Waterholes allow for travelling ""underground"" (and later open up fast travelling and stuff) Would require them to find a way to make underwater sections work well though. (as in : well enough to be that game's ""dark world"")"
truezelda,3clneh,Crim_drakenya,2,Fri Jul 10 09:20:09 2015 UTC,"Would require them to find a way to make underwater sections work well though. (as in : well enough to be that game's ""dark world"")   That'd be cool, if they built the game heavily around swimming, maneuvering, being able to breathe underwater and stuff like that.  They could recover some old zora relics or something and make it happen.  I like that idea."
truezelda,3clneh,MarvelousMagikarp,3,Fri Jul 10 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"I want a game which removes the need for 'hammer space'. Instead link has five/six items: sword, shield, tunic, boots, gauntlets hat(this is why i said /six). As a bow wouldn't take up too much space maybe a bow and quiver as well.  The player then finds gems which they can equip to a specific item (kind of like how fire arrows work in my mind) in order to transform it to provide the effect of other items.  For example, equip the shield with the 'light gem' and it gains the ability to reflect light. Equip it with the water gem and it can function like a boat.   Equip your sword with the 'earth gem' and it becomes a large hammer. Equip it with the wind gem and it becomes the gale boomerang."
truezelda,3clneh,androsphere,5,Tue Jul 14 08:55:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to play as OoT Link in later life, to expand upon what we saw in Twilight Princess.  Where'd he get that armor? How did he lose his eye? He claimed to have regrets, but what were they? Did he die before seeing his child(ren) grow up? Was he a poor father?   Where did all the Gerudo go? They appear later in the timeline, so we know they didn't go extinct. Did they move away for a while? Did they get banished? If so, why?  So many little details and events I want to experience.  It's probably a bit too heavy and mature for a Zelda game, but I'd love to see it nonetheless."
truezelda,3clneh,zillegas,2,Thu Jul 9 03:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about what he went through to find Navi, or the events that convinced him to give up looking for her.   Although, the ending of MM slightly suggests that Link should fondly remember his adventure with Navi, and accept her departure from his life.  If Link followed that advice, his journey back to Hyrule could be interesting. If not, he could have gone very far."
truezelda,3clneh,CuccoPotPie,2,Thu Jul 9 08:31:35 2015 UTC,"I think this is the resolution of MM. It's a game that, thematically, is all about growing up, accepting loss, and appreciating relationships for what they are when they're in your life, and remembering them fondly. I don't think Link needs Navi by the end of MM.    However, that's not to say that there isn't 1,001 things that could be explored in the rest of his life. I'd like to see another chapter in his life."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"It'd probably be in the middle of T. It would be fun though. I just thought how great it would be to play as Old-Link with an eyepatch so he's very Deathstroke-esque. Also, I never realized I wanted Dual-Wielding in LoZ until now. I'm also hyped for that Time-Slow mechanic they showed in the ZeldaU trailer."
truezelda,3clneh,HiNutty94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"but what were they   He wasn't recognized for his heroics and apparently wasn't able to pass on his skills, probably because the realm was peaceful.  I don't think there can be another actual game about the Hero of Time without breaking his already-established character arc, because it's established that he pretty much couldn't do anything important at this point."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 11:23:05 2015 UTC,"I always took his ""regrets"" as trying to pass on his skills to his children, who may have had no interest in swordplay or was afraid of fighting, decided not to push it, but later wishing that he did. I'd love to know where he got those skills though. That could be made into an expansion pack maybe?"
truezelda,3clneh,HiNutty94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"Judging from his gear, he likely ended up in the military in some way.  It's very ornate and not something you'd get as a ""standard adventurer"".  But, if Ganondorf was captured and executed while Link was away in Termina (also, they're not going to let an 11-year-old hunt down the King of Thieves with the rest of the Royal Army), it's suggested that Hyrule was then peaceful until the Era of Twilight.  So, even if he did train and learn new skills from his mentors and eventually become a captain himself, he would never have had the chance to actually use those abilities and be recognized as a hero."
truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"And since his skills are apparently really special, that means that he may have possibly not even learned them from anyone in the army, but somewhere else. Or maybe he had a father/son relationship with someone else in the army and he decided to teach him his skills. That's a cool way to reference TP Link's training with OoT Link too."
truezelda,3clneh,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I'm not sure how that would make a very good Zelda game, since by necessity he can't be learning them for any grand purpose to defeat evil.

truezelda,3clneh,TheAllStarrBand,5,Thu Jul 9 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"So this is my idea.  I want Ganon to conquer the kingdom, rule with an iron fist, and Princess Zelda escapes into exile.  Hyrule is going to be a little darker with bandits and other mundane threats plaguing Link as he goes about his adventure but otherwise the same place except everyone hails Ganondorf as king.  So the game opens up with Link in a small village near whatever wilds or forest is around far from the big city.  He's a slightly angrier Link with a bit of a temper now but his heart is in the right place.  His village is attacked by a shadowy figure at one point who deliberately attacks him and him alone.  The rest of the villagers flee and Link is taken down after a fight.  As the figure stands over him the triforce of courage appears on his hand and reacts.  The figure is revealed to be Princess Zelda.    Zelda apologizes saying that she thought he was an agent of Ganondorf.  Must be some bad intel, blah blah Link joins up with resistance after some tests or whatever, gets the sword, blah blah.  Mystic prophecy blah.  All while he's doing this he sees statues built around the land of Ganondorf's queen, just some woman from what everyone says.  Before the last battle, Zelda asks Link at some point if he knows how he came to that quiet village (many of the games simply don't care and even a seasoned Zelda fan probably wouldn't question it until now).    Link doesn't know, and Zelda tells him to take care of unfinished business so he goes back and the town has been burned to the ground.  He asks around the survivors and it comes out that someone from Hyrule Castle brought him, probably a knight of some sort, and charged the people of the village with raising him, even leaving some money.  Link returns and Zelda concludes that he must be the son of a loyal knight.  Link and resistance stage an attack on the castle.  Zelda holds off attackers while Link goes to kill Ganondorf.  In the throne room Ganondorf walks toward Link with sword in hand and says, ""You remind me so much of your mother,"" and then it all falls into place.  Why this Link is angry, maybe darker complexioned and with darker hair.  Ganondorf tells story of his victory when no hero came.  The elation of success, taking a Hylian woman for his queen who dies in childbirth.  Personal tragedy then followed by the cruelest joke the gods could come up with; that his son be born the hero to defeat him.  In his grief he could not bring himself to kill the child of his beloved, even if it would destroy him.    He walked until he found a town where no one recognized him and there he left the child.  Certain to keep tabs on him as he grew.  When his spies reported that Link was attacked and taken away he ordered them to burn the town in retaliation.    Ganon says he was a fool to have been so weak and they fight.  At the end when Ganon is beaten, battered and weary he steps forward despite his wounds, drops his sword and tells him to finish it.  Link is hesitant and looks down, Ganon rushes and Link doesn't react in time.  Ganon impales self on Link's sword, grabbing him in an embrace.  ""Don't let your guard... down.  Don't...  be weak... for... your mother's... sake...son."" Then Ganon dies.    Honestly I just wanted a story where Ganon is more important and central to the narrative and has more character than, ""I am bad and do bad things.""  We saw a tiny smidge of that in Wind Waker, but not all that much.  I know I could have just said,  TL:DR Ganon is Link's father!  But honestly then people would just say, ""Star Wars did it.""  I think that reveal would be a lot of fun, and an angrier and less in control Link would be interesting to play."
truezelda,3clneh,eyejack,3,Thu Jul 9 04:03:51 2015 UTC,Jesus man. Its pretty good but that's dark as fuck.
truezelda,3clneh,HiNutty94,0,Thu Jul 9 14:58:37 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah I guess.  At the end I think you could have Link make a wish on the Triforce (since he brought it together) so that Ganondorf was never his father.  Then while the ending credits are playing you see a regular old link playing the game, going through cut scenes without the anger issues and then just defeating Ganon like usual.  I thought it was neat."
truezelda,3clneh,georgie_exia,2,Fri Jul 10 04:53:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a little iffy about the whole ""Link, I am your father"" thing, not for myself, but for the rest of the fanbase. Other than that, that's a pretty good idea."

truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 9 10:06:00 2015 UTC,"Well, since DeNA is on my mind right now: Puzzle The Legend of Zelda.  It's a typical match-3 type puzzle game in a vein similar to puzzle and dragons or puzzle quest, where each match correlates to an action. You have the 4 directional blocks, a gear block, and a sword block. You use these blocks to do a quest similar to the original Legend of Zelda. Match the blocks to preform an action, and you can change gear in real time (because who wants to have 8 different item blocks to use?), but the general game is turn based.  Aside from that, I'd like to see Hyrule Fantasy: Legendary Kingdom, a game where you take on the role of Princess Zelda during the events of any other legendary quest. You are not exploring dungeons or fighting monsters, but running the Kingdom and commanding your troops. You must protect your people, as well as keep them happy and possibly ignorant of the coming darkness. You can also get aid from the legendary hero, but for the most part he's off adventuring.  Finally, as something more fun: Hyrule Fantasy: Link's Eternal Quest.  This is basically what would happen if you had a never ending dungeon in a Zelda game. It just keeps going, and is probably randomly generated. You get respite stops every 10 floors, as well as a boss to face after said respite. It would be in a more top-down view and design, though I could also see it being 3D. It'd probably have multiplayer capabilities or something as well, because it can."

truezelda,3clneh,louhiatar,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"Either playing as Ganon OR seeing a corruption to the established lore and legends.  The magic that perpetuates the battle of good and evil and those involves fails, resulting in an age where Ganon and Link exist, but do not fulfill there established roles. The Hero of Time strays from his path and becomes the agent of evil, while Ganon is forced into a position of saving the land. If there is no Hyrule, he cannot conquer and rule it.  So I guess it becomes a sort of anti-hero story. And it would be interesting to see the world react to a figure they expect to be evil saving them from a figure they do not expect to be evil"

Sheikah: Young Sheik Back story to what happened at the shadow temple, kakariko village, Bongo Bongo's story, the lens of truth... and maybe the Interlopers being connected to the Sheikah and the Fused shadow. (even though this is debated)  Gerudo: Young Nabooru Use Nabooru to follow Ganandorf's rise to power. More on the Mirror and Arbiter's grounds. Back story on the Gerudo and their deity. Maybe more story on Twin Rova.  Kokiri: Saria or the Skull Kid Back story to the forest temple and the Poe sisters.

truezelda,3clneh,Serbaayuu,4,Sun Jul 12 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"This isn't anything new or original, but a game following Zelda during the seven-year gap in OoT would be pretty damn cool."
truezelda,3clneh,milhouse92,5,Wed Jul 8 22:02:42 2015 UTC,"By necessity of plot she really wouldn't be able to do anything significant at all.  She can't rescue Sages.  She might be able to help people out of Castle Town and whatnot, but that's hardly a Zelda game anymore - not that I am against unusual spinoffs, but it doesn't feel meaty enough for a full game.  Zelda's seven years is basically a training montage."
truezelda,3clneh,Lostner,5,Wed Jul 8 23:06:36 2015 UTC,"I imagine it would combine her wizard/ninja training, evading Ganondorf, and trying to protect the people of Hyrule. Would be very ""side-quest"" heavy like MM and feature much more stealth gameplay. The beginning of the game could be her learning from Impa while they try to protect the temples from falling to Ganondorf, followed by a period of fleeing from Ganondorf while retrieving important items like the harp and maybe hiding others like the three spells. Part of the game could be focused on preparing for Link's arrival and distracting Ganondorf. Tons of possibilities. It wouldn't be a traditional Zelda game, but I wouldn't expect that of a game that doesn't star Link."

Starts out with an archaeologist finding a cave with the mask which then takes him over. Majora tricks link (who has no idea is evil cause nothing says so) into helping him get to this temple thing and fight a guardian of a volcano or spring, either way, the guardian knows the thing is guarding is what can free him from his mask and majora/link suceed (oops). He raises army, hyrule kinda has a small army started which helps and link fights alongside, wind waker gets a powerup to create a wind sword, wind shield, wind attacks, ect until some final fight transformation or something. Was contemplating majora releasing ganon and killing him maybe absorbing his powers, maybe corrupting the master sword, not sure. After reading that comic of majora origin I know he has a beast form so that could be cool to fight."
truezelda,3clneh,starships_lazerguns,2,Thu Jul 9 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see the Mask in the other timelines.  We already know it somehow ended up in Hyrule during ALBW, but it's lost during the Adult Timeline - possibly buried with Hyrule?  We have no idea where the Happy Mask Salesman went in that timeline.  It's possible he never even found the Mask himself, since the events of Majora's Mask would only be possible in the Child Timeline due to the timing of Ganondorf attacking Castle Town.  The Mask could have ended up in someone else's hands, traveling Hyrule as an oddity in shops and whatnot, waiting for the right person with the right influence and the right mental state to touch it and get corrupted.  But MM also doesn't make it very clear if the HMS found the Mask before or after OoT - personally I have always assumed it was shortly after he left his shop, probably to some hidden location he discovered that kept it sealed, and was on his way to another place to purify it/use it in some other way when he had it stolen from him."
truezelda,3clneh,neonrideraryeh,3,Thu Jul 9 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"You know, I came with this thought like four years ago and somehow timelines never occurred to me. I was thinking it would be in some mountaintop island cave because of the obvious ocean with him finding a cave full of masks but j didn't really think too much on that, if anything it would make most sense if it was in a vault on top of a mountain because before the ocean that would be difficult to get to but was found after mountaintops became reachable. It all really depends on pre OOT story."

truezelda,3cke08,upbeat_addict,11,Wed Jul 8 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty basic; still good.  I would argue against Link never meeting any of the other people, especially the Sages - in my mind he'd have some reason to at least go meet them again in the new timeline since they were friends previously.  And Ganondorf had assaulted the various tribes before the timeline split was created, so those situations (Jabu-Jabu and the goron famine) would still occur.  However, with Link's warning to the Royals, they probably sent aid to the tribes and helped them out themselves instead (they're not going to let a 9-year-old into a dungeon even if he says he's done it before).  I also disagree about Zelda even being a viable option for Link's partner.  The only times I have ever felt any kind of romantic connection between the two characters is in Wind Waker, Spirit Tracks, and Skyward Sword (and AoL of course).  In the rest of the games, Zelda treats Link more like an honored ally than anything else.  She clearly does care about him, but the impression I have always received is that it's because he is the legendary Hero, not because she likes him (and why would she - she barely ever speaks to him)."
truezelda,3cke08,Serbaayuu,7,Wed Jul 8 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"In all fairness to OoT Zelda, she talks to Link more than any other character, aside from Navi and possibly Kaepora. Even if most of that is under the guise of Sheik. That doesn't mean there is or isn't a romantic connection of any sort there, but figured I'd point that out anyway."
truezelda,3cke08,stryker101,2,Wed Jul 8 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"More than Saria or Rauru?  I don't know about that.  And most of the time Sheik is talking at Link, anyway."

truezelda,3cke08,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"Well, everyone is talking at Link, so that doesn't mean much.  Saria would be close, might have a few more lines, since you can talk to her at any point. I didn't think about that because I was just thinking about in person conversations. Pretty sure Rauru is confirmed to be Kaepora, so I was already considering him. But for as much as he yammers on, I still think Zelda has a bit more. Mostly because he pretty much disappears when you're an adult, and that's the majority of the game.  Anyway, not really important. Zelda is easily among the top five characters that speaks to Link the most, so it's still not the most compelling argument."

I'm so tired of everybody shipping these two because of it's the hero/princess thing, so obviously they're love with each other right? Except for these titles, TLoZ if anything tries to get away from that trope by not pinning them together. It puts focus on other things, like the adventure or the plot. It's one of the reasons why I like the series, in that it does it's own thing while having these elements."
truezelda,3cke08,HiNutty94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that Zelda is pretty flat as a character in the Fallen Timeline, OoT, and Twilight Princess, so if there was actually meant to be any chemistry there it's kind of lost on the fact that her entire character is ""Concerned Prophet""."
truezelda,3cke08,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Jul 15 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"Their point about ""incest"" is kinda weak. The games are all set hundreds of years apart. Even if they were both descendents of a previous Zelda+Link pairing it would be like two people being related to Charlemagne. Practically everyone of European descent is related to Charlemagne but it's not incest for two white people to get together.  Link having Epona and knowing Epona's song really only implies relation to the Hero of Time. Also Link only works on the ranch while Fado owns it, which for the whole ranch family business argument to work wouldn't Link have actually inherited property rather than living in a tree on the edge of the village and working for some other guy's ranch? And where would rancher Hero of Time get the armor the hero's shade wears? What would a rancher need armor like that for?  I know this is a popular theory on this sub but it's just not convincing to me. Zelda and Malon are the only named characters that possibly got with Link but they're both on equal ground as far as I can tell. As far as actual content - like the flashback in Majora's Mask, the dramatic glancing at the end of OoT - Zelink is actually more likely since Malon is really not that central to the story. A bastard descendant or just kinda fading from royalty (like most descendants of Charlemagne) is just as likely an explanation as any of the arguments for Malon.   You people just like her cause she's hot."

truezelda,3bvwa9,Serbaayuu,15,Thu Jul 2 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, why not?  Majora's Mask (*and Phantom Hourglass) suggests that it's plenty possible to ""stumble"" into parallel worlds, and if you believe that Termina and Lorule lie within the same dimension, there's your proof already that this is not unreasonable.  Personally, I find it less likely that two parallel worlds wouldn't have contacted at some point.  Now what I do hope we see at some point is an expansion on Lorule in the various timelines to learn its history.  As for how that specific shield got there, we know that the original was made by Lanayru, and the following ones are basically replicas of that.  During Ocarina of Time, they were seemingly mass-produced and used by the military.  So, a plausible explanation might be that during the Hyrulean Civil War or earlier, around the time when those shields were popular, an adventurer escaped the war by accidentally or intentionally ending up in Lorule via some portal we don't know about.  Eventually this person may have made their way to Lorule's Death Mountain where they perished, or the shield was stolen from them and stashed away, or something to that effect.  And yes - this is total speculation, and there is no evidence whatsoever for how or why that shield appears right now.  *But it does seem to be the case that the Hylian Shield went out of style in the Fallen Timeline, so I actually think that lends some credibility to my hypothesis that it came from much earlier in the timelines."

truezelda,3bvwa9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:21:55 2015 UTC,Hilda had an obsession with Hyrule so maybe that spread to the people who lived there and someone made a Hylian shield in tribute to them.
truezelda,3bvwa9,Cillendor,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"In my headcanon, they've been in contact a lot. The Zuna (FSA) are descendants of Lorulians who followed Demise into the other world (Hyrule) to take the Triforce. But they refused to continue when they saw that there were other Humans there. Perhaps some of them went back to Lorule with the shield. I dunno."
truezelda,3bvwa9,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jul 2 19:04:49 2015 UTC,The Zuna (FSA) are descendants of Lorulians who followed Demise into the other world (Hyrule) to take the Triforce.   That's a really long time for the zuna to go unnoticed in Hyrule.  Still an interesting idea; I somewhat follow the Lorulean Demise theory but I never really thought about people following him.
truezelda,3bvwa9,Cillendor,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"Well the Zuna live even further out beyond the Gerudo, so my thought is just that they ""fell of the map"", so to speak.  To elaborate more, I view the planet of Zelda as being flat, similar to this but with land on both sides. The goddesses created Hyrule intentionally, but Lorule was created as an accident at the same time. Whether they even knew about it or not is debatable, but it was made nonetheless.  Just as Hyrule consists also of Labrynna, Holodrum, ""New Hyrule"", and the lands to the north and east seen in The Adventure of Link, Lorule includes both Lorule proper (to the east) and Termina (the western coast) which are separated by a swath of harsh, barren desert.  Anyway Hyrule was created as the ""Middle-earth""; the Sacred Realm was the ""upper earth"", and the Twilight Realm was the ""lower earth"". Lorule had identical layers.  The people of Lorule early developed their magic, which they focused in masks. This became a prominent feature of their society. Sometime prior to the great upheavals I'll shortly describe, colonists from Lorule settled in Termina and established the Ikana Kingdom. There was no further contact between kingdoms because the desert was nearly impassable. [I'm still trying to figure out a role for the Garos in the mythology. My guess is that they splintered from the Ikana Kingdom, or perhaps from the original settlers prior to founding a kingdom.]  The act of creation by the gods produced similar Force Gems in Lorule as the Triforce in Hyrule, but again the gods forsook that land. The people of Lorule coveted their Triforce and warred over it, but the royal family of Lorule led by Hilda (not the same one from A Link Between Worlds) destroyed the Triforce rather than simply sealing it away. This led to great turmoil as the world became unstable. This instability opened rifts between Hyrule and Lorule, but no-one knew of them yet.  So there arose Demons—the three chiefs being Demise, Majora, and Malladus—who appeared to the people claiming to be their gods. They promised peace and stability to the people if they would worship them and obey them. The people swore an undying oath of fealty.  Demise and his minions set out to seek the Triforce in Hyrule. When he arrived, however, the Lorulians with him refused to attack the Humans of Hyrule. They had believed Hyrule to be uninhabited. They surrendered to Hylia, but Demise would not let them return because they broke their oath. So they traveled far west across the Lanayru Sea, where they settled in their own oasis.  Malladus also crossed the void, but he arrived in the land later known as ""New Hyrule"". [I've toyed with making New Hyrule part of Lorule as well. The idea is that the Realm of the Ocean King is on the border of the sea; as Tetra and her crew were chasing the Ghost Ship, they went over the edge without even realizing it, but Tetra and Link themselves were trapped in between worlds. Doing this would balance out the land masses a little, and would be another interesting story element, but I haven't decided on it for sure yet.]  Majora chose to travel west in pursuit of the Lorulians who'd already left. Unlike those in the kingdom of Lorule, those in Ikana were not under oath. But when she arrived, they did not trust her; they had already befriended the Giants who guarded that land. So a powerful sorcerer among them bound Majora to a mask using their strongest hexing ritual. (The Happy Mask Salesman is a descendant of this man.) Ikana eventually fell to war with the Garo, and a few centuries later Clock Town was founded. The trade from Clock Town was such that the Zoras and Gorons even migrated closer to participate in it. Termina had peace until a certain Skull Kid from Hyrule stumbled upon a rift between worlds and began wreaking havoc.  So back to Hyrule, the Lorulians in the desert wouldn't fight the Hylians, but they were still otherwise loyal to Demise due to their oath. When Demise was sealed within the Master Sword, they sneaked into Hyrule with a weapon reforged from the Dark Master Sword, this being the Trident. Hyrule was thriving and the people didn't expect Demise to ever return, so these certain Lorulians were able to use their magic to awaken Demise and bind him to the Trident instead of the Master Sword. This event is what caused a sudden explosion of monsters in the Minish Cap backstory.  [My mythology requires placing Four Swords Adventures between Four Swords and Ocarina of Time, as was originally intended by the creators prior to Hyrule Historia.]  A couple hundred years later, Vaati escaped but was kind of insane, so he kidnapped Zelda to marry her. Link imprisoned him again. During that time, though, a young Gerudo prince was touring the nearby kingdoms. He fell in love with Hyrule and secretly coveted it. Then he met the Zuna, descendants of the Lorulians. (Hyrule ignored them because they were so far away, but the Gerudo had some communication with them.) Ganondorf stole the Trident from the Pyramid, and Demise recognized him as a worthy vessel to possess.  And at this point I gotta stop because this is getting really long, but I have more worked out."

Also termina is a parallel universe and not sharing in the same plane as that of hyrule.   Also pretty sure that maroras mask is closely tied to the twilight realm because of the design similarities. Even look at the fused shadow mask that midna wears. It's very very similar to majoras mask. This leads me to believe that it is a hyrule artifact stolen from the mask sales man who is hylian but the theft had happened in termina.  And last thing. Most of your details are huge leaps like people leaving lorule and settling across the lanyru sea where there is little evidence to say that had happened. I think this would be nice as a fan fic and not treated like cannon.  Edit: cleaned it up a bit.
truezelda,3bvwa9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"Well the fact that we know that Mushroom kingdom and hyrule are on the same planet and that Mario's world is in fact round (super Mario Galaxy) then the flat hyrule is impossible.   What? Seriously, what? Where was that ever confirmed? Just because Nintendo likes to throw a few cross-referencing Easter eggs into their games does not mean they're from the same planet or even in the same universe. That's ridiculous. They have nothing in common besides castles and princesses and a few recycled enemies. But you'd probably also say that Soul Caliber and the CDi games are canon too.   Also termina is a parallel universe and not sharing in the same plane as that of hyrule.   So Mario, which has NOTHING to do with Zelda's world, just has to be part of the same planet because of a few Easter eggs, but Majora's Mask, which IS part of the Zelda universe, can't be part of the same world? Makes sense.   Also pretty sure that maroras mask is closely tied to the twilight realm because of the design similarities. Even look at the fused shadow mask that midna wears. It's very very similar to majoras mask. This leads me to believe that it is a hyrule artifact stolen from the mask sales man who is hylian but the theft had happened in termina.   Now who's speculating? The only way to get into the Twilight Realm is through the Mirror of Twilight. Where's the Mirror of Twilight in Majora's Mask? How can they be related if they're completely different worlds with nothing in common?  You do have a good point with the Fused Shadow, though. While I didn't mention it because it wasn't particularly relevant, my theory explains its existence better than trying to equate Termina with the Twilight Realm. Please read:  I said that the Lorulian people were skilled with magic in creating masks. Those who migrated to Termina used that magic to bind the Demon Majora to a mask. In Termina, most people had very little skill with magic and thus their masks were very weak. The exception was the Happy Mask Salesman, who was a direct descendant from the magicians who trapped Majora. He still remembered their powerful spell, the Song of Healing, which he taught to Link. Meanwhile, those in Lorule Kingdom had completely forgotten their magic, but they still used masks for ceremonial purposes, as seen in A Link Between Worlds.  As for the Fused Shadow, it was made by the same culture. The Lorulians made it prior to following Demise through the portal into Hyrule. The Demons were going to use it to obtain the Triforce, but it was banished along with them into the Twilight Realm.  Back to your alternative, sure that's plausible, but that by no means makes it more solid than my idea. You say that my details are huge leaps, but that's exactly what you're making here. You're just putting your opinion up against mine, which is fine and all, but not particularly authoritative.   And last thing. Most of your details are huge leaps like people leaving lorule and settling across the lanyru sea where there is little evidence to say that had happened. I think this would be nice as a fan fic and not treated like cannon.   Really? Connecting the Lorulians with the Zuna is a huge leap? Here's an even bigger one: claiming that the Mushroom Kingdom is part of the same planet as Hyrule because of a few obscure paintings in Hyrule Castle that are clearly Easter eggs.  (By the way, The Wind Waker and A Link Between Worlds both feature Easter eggs from Majora's Mask even though they're all on different timelines. But if Easter eggs are gospel truth in the Zelda universe then you're stuck because those Easter eggs conflict with the official timeline in Hyrule Historia. Whoops.)  You know what is cannon? A giant, metal weapon that shoots heavy, iron balls at enemy forces. As for the Zelda canon, it most certainly doesn't include anything from the Mario games.  You are right, though. There isn't any direct evidence that the people from Lorule settled across the Lanayru Sea. There's also no direct evidence that the Fused Shadow has anything to do with Majora's Mask. Both are fanfic material. But my goal is to arrive at a cohesive mythology for Hyrule that spans all of the canon games. The games contradict themselves so much that it is impossible to do this without making some concessions and ignoring minor details here and there.  As for the Zuna, I'm trying to figure out where they came from and what role they play. Besides Four Swords Adventures, there are two other games that might reference them: A Link to the Past and Oracle of Ages. Aghanim and Veran, respectively, both have blue skin. The Zuna have green skin. Also, the Zuna have strange faces, but those could be masks worn to protect them from the sun. (It's incredibly hard to make out any details on those tiny sprites.)  While their blue skin color isn't the green of the Zuna, it is a lot closer than the various shades of brown sported by Hylians. So it makes a lot more sense that they would be Zuna than Hylian. (I know that Veran only attacked Labrynna, but she served Twinrova, so it stands to reason that she was from Hyrule as well.)  If they are Zuna, then the question becomes, why would they want to help Ganon? Well if they are descendants of the Lorulians who originally swore allegiance to Demise but broke their oath to avoid fighting against the Hylians, then suddenly it makes sense why some of them might still have loyalties for the Demon King. Veran's connection with Twinrova bolsters this even more because the Zuna live west of the Gerudo Desert, and Labrynna is even further west of that. So Twinrova would've had to pass through the Zuna's territory on their way over to Labrynna in the first place. As for Aghanim, given the close chronological proximity between their games, Aghanim could have been Veran's mentor. Perhaps Twinrova first enlisted him to bring Ganon back from the Sacred Realm and then recruited his disciple to resurrect Ganon after Link killed him.  So of course, this is all a fanfic. Nintendo will never publish my theory even if I write it up as a 300-page novel. But their own attempt at a timeline, Hyrule Historia, is chock full of contradictions and loose ends. My vision is to achieve a history of Hyrule that approaches the depth of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion. I will never, ever be as creative as that man or as good of a writer, but I still think the Zelda series deserves that kind of treatment. So go ahead and shoot down my theories if you want, but until you actually come up with one that is better (i.e., one that doesn't involve the Mushroom Kingdom), please keep your opinions to yourself.   Edit: cleaned it up a bit.   Really? o.O"

It even tells you the price of the ticket.  The kanji for Sonobe is 園部 (そのべ）and the kanji for Kyoto is 京都（きょうと）if you're looking at a train map that doesn't have English on it. You should be able to get an English (or at least hiragana) train map at Kyoto Station. You can also look up and print off maps from the official Japan Rail site.  I wouldn't be surprised if Kyoto had some English-speaking staff at the desk by the ticket vendors as well, considering it's a major tourism hub. In a pinch, there will be many other foreigners around, some of whom will undoubtedly be able to answer your questions or translate for you.  It might be harder to find people who can help you in Sonobe, though, as it's a small rural area. Also, keep in mind that while Sonobe Station still exists, the town of Sonobe itself was combined with two other towns to form a city called Nantan. So, technically, the name Sonobe is obsolete...  Bigger cities in Japan have some English signage around their train stations, indicating station names, but Sonobe may not.  You can also look up ""Sonobe"", ""Nantan"", ""Sonobe Tourism"" or ""Nantan Tourism"" on Google to find a little more information about what sort of things you can see there. Here's some stuff on Trip Advisor for Nantan. You could also try using Google Maps' Street View or Satellite View to get a feel for the area.  Hope that helps."

Clever.  Ravio, as far as I can tell, is just a mashing of Rabbit and Violet- not only is a pink/violet rabbit Link's animal form in LttP, Ravio is dressed in a violet rabbit suit.

Contrary to popular belief this is not the color for Link's tunic in Zelda 1, but it is the color of many scenery objects in the game, like walls and trees. Telma and Louise are a reference to the movie Thelma & Louise. Fyer & Falbi: Fyer is an obvious play on fire, as he runs the cannon at the lake Hylia. Falbi might come from fall, as he runs the Cucco minigame, but this might be a bit of a stretch. Yuga: Yuga is Japanese for oil paintings. Furthermore, Yuga is apparently an era in Hindu philosophy in which the prosperous world degenerates overtime, similar to Lorule. The Lokomo's names are all references to trains in some way.

It's fair and well designed and just requires practice, playing defensively and making use of all the tools you're given (also see: Dark Souls). I'd recommend ignoring the save states, since you constantly are leveling up and getting better at the game, and all you lose at a game over is your current EXP (so sometimes it's not a bad strategy to do a bit of farming on your last life to level up if you're close to the next level). It seems sucky at first to be plunked back at the beginning when you run out of lives, but shortcuts ensure that you're never more than a couple minutes away from the temple. Just look at it like NES Dark Souls, except that it's actually a way easier and more forgiving game than Dark Souls.   People already mentioned that Shadow Link is the same across all the versions - you can often beat him by just crouching in the corner and stabbing repeatedly. If you try to fight him normally, sometimes he's easy and sometimes he's brutally hard. It's not the most satisfying battle in the world.   Some additional tips for new players: Farm the statue at the beginning of most temples for red jars that fill your magic (and therefore, your life once you get the life spell). If there's no jar or an enemy appears, exit and come back.  More importantly, USE YOUR MAGIC. Shield cuts damage in half, and jump can make tricky areas much easier. Finally, learn to beat Ironknuckles properly by blocking and attacking head on, retreating when necessary, with a focus on defense, since these guys seem to give people a lot of trouble and I'm always seeing terrible guides showing up telling people to downward thrust or do weird tricks to get past them. If they give you trouble, practice blocking first without attacking, then when you get decent at that, start throwing in attacks of your own."

Music which is designed to fit a certain theme (medieval, fantasy, etc) will always sound similar to other songs of that sort of theme, because well... they're designed to be that specific way.  There's only so much you can do within one theme of music before it becomes something else entirely. Composers typically take influence from other composers, especially when they're both in the same field/genre.   Pertaining specifically to your example, the Light World dungeon theme is a pretty 'basic' musical concept, and will therefore be found a lot, in pretty much all music.  Three notes repeat three times, then go down a key and repeat.  You'll find this sort of thing... pretty much everywhere."

In that vein, Naviless OoT and Fi-less SS will certainly be popular, in addition to mods that neuter the drawn-out tutorials of TP and SS.  Further, fixing flawed mechanics unique to games would probably have a fairly high precedence, like the things tweaked in Wind Waker HD and Ocarina of Time 3D (e.g. mapping iron boots to a button, swift sail).  The only other thing I think would take precedence would be restoring cut content, such as the Greatfish Isle section in WW or the medallions in OoT, and maybe adding the Stamina Meter to some of the retro Zelda titles.  Aside from these things, I'd love to see original items/dungeons/bosses, and that's probably what would get the most attention from fans.  Oh, and wicked hard puzzles.  Oh, and collectible retro Zelda cartridges you can put in your house, with an emulator included so you could play Link's Awakening as Link and such.  Oh, and options for enforced advanced rulesets, like Hero Mode and three heart runs, swordless/shieldless runs, etc.  Geez the ideas keep coming, this could get out of hand."

Rather, what would be nice is if navi never forces control away from the player to listen to whatever obvious or pointless thing she feels like saying at the moment. It would always just be that ""Hey! Listen!"" where you could choose to listen to her. But here's the thing. Have her actually say interesting things that develop her as a character. Give her dialogue that an actual person with feelings and thoughts would have. Make her someone who actually exists in the world around her as a participator rather than an observer. If it's done right, then they player could become conditioned to get excited every time he/she hears the ""Hey! Listen!""."

There are several instances between Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask of textboxes that appear without interrupting the flow of gameplay, in addition to simply decreasing the frequency of her interruptions. But what I'm more interested in is giving her more character development. I always did like Navi, but I always felt like she was just there and never had much effect on the story. Tatl from Majora's Mask would be a great template for Navi to follow. Tatl was a major character in the story, has probably some of the best character development in the entire series, has a visibly growing attachment to Link to the point where their separation in the end has a much greater emotional impact, and quite frankly tends to interrupt us with trivial shit much less frequently while having more to say during crucial parts of the story that really add to her character."

I mean, obviously if the current developers just continued to release the game anyway, Nintendo's next step would likely be filing a lawsuit against them. So if the developers were to, hypothetically, send the code to someone else and have them work on it, they might both end up sued since they knew they were working around a C&D order.

truezelda,3b3wtw,silvershark76,2,Fri Jun 26 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, on the surface it makes sense. Odds are, no one's going to play your Zelda mod unless they've actually beaten Zelda before, so starting off with levels at a low difficulty is unnecessary and might bore the more skilled players, so you absolutely have a struggle to balance that with a fair difficulty level and a constant difficulty curve. On the other hand, there's no fun or challenge (opinion, of course) in a game that can only be completed with mass savestating, and where sane and enjoyable level design is non-existent.  Ninja Edit: Hit submit halfway through a sentence by mistake  Secondary edit: For anyone who does like mods or straight up hacks of Zelda games, I recommend Zelda Randomizer, Legend of Link, and Zelda Outlands for the original; Shadow of Night (the newest update, that somewhat fixes the insane and unfun, grinding difficulty of the older versions) for Zelda II; and Parallel Remodel or maybe Goddess of Wisdom (if you're fine with using savestates and walkthroughs) for A Link to the Past. Zelda's Birthday is also an interesting quick hack for Ocarina of Time, but very short and it plays more like a test of what could be possible to hack into the game in the future.

My mother (who knows nothing about the games) attended it with me and was thoroughly unimpressed when we left, going as far as to say that it didn't even seem like ""real music."" All of that being said, the nostalgia was so very strong with me and I'm pretty sure I had an idiotic grin on my face for at least half the show.  ---Warning: Only marginally-related rant incoming---  The one thing I very much did not enjoy was the crowd that the show attracted :/ I've never been to an event with so many (noticeably) poorly behaved people. The people behind us and those to the right of us were talking the entire time, and four different people across the aisle were recording the show with their back screens on.

The concert was performed in an auditorium that had just been built and was blessed to sit in the auditorium's sweet spot.   Since then, however, the direction of the production has changed a lot. The original team of the performance had been kicked out and the show is on its way to be run into the ground by the original producer. From what I've heard, the quality has dipped significantly and the attention to detail isn't there anymore as the passionate crew is gone. The producer, Jason Michael Paul (the man with three first names) is stated by many to be a money-hungry producer with no passion for Zelda or the performance so none of this is a surprise to me.  I'm sure the experience will vary from performance to performance. The arrangements were great but for some it could be hit or miss from what I've been reading."

You stand in one area, you'll hear just a few instruments dominating the air.  Stand in another and it's another set of instruments dominating the air.  It doesn't mix well.

I don't know about anyone else, but when it comes to cleaning up the game, I rather enjoy being able to do things more quickly because I've explored the area 12 times already, if there's something left just tell me.

truezelda,3b1rxp,Unwholy_Wholf,7,Thu Jun 25 13:16:17 2015 UTC,It's also not much different from Super Metroid marking all the upgrades on the map for you.   That is a perfect comparison.

truezelda,3b1rxp,Phoxxent,10,Fri Jun 26 02:06:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everything.   The game has hours of tutorials that you can't skip. This is so annoying and needs to stop.   Any difficulty with puzzles is lost when the camera zooms in on your solution, or Fi just tells you what to do.  Dowsing is literally the opposite of what a zelda game should be. No exploration, puzzles, anything. Just following an arrow showing you where to go.   Motion controls are subjective. If you like them cool, but I don't want to swing my arms around while playing games.  I mainly hate how frequently I was interrupted in this game. Fi telling you where to go, telling you that you got a bug, you got a ruby, your batteries are low, Fi telling you not to jump into a pit filled with lava, Fi in general not shutting up. It was so frustrating."
truezelda,3b1rxp,Remioli,3,Thu Jun 25 15:17:46 2015 UTC,Fi telling you not to jump into a pit filled with lava   I had a good laugh with this.

Fi telling you not to jump into a pit filled with lava   Again never happens."
truezelda,3b1rxp,Serbaayuu,5,Thu Jun 25 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"I just thought dowsing was dumb.

truezelda,3b1rxp,henryuuk,3,Thu Jun 25 22:23:58 2015 UTC,I also thought some parts of the game would give you tasks that felt more like obligations instead of something exciting.  For example  I didn't enjoy collecting the note-fish underwater.  I thought twilight princess had some of this too - sometimes collecting the bugs just seemed like an annoying task rather than something really interesting.  That's just me though.
truezelda,3b1rxp,pseudoredditer,10,Thu Jun 25 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"I can honestly say I've never felt like Skyward Sword held my hand.  Maybe I just think about the games differently.  Maybe I only focused on the puzzles that were actually puzzles, and don't really care if the game has a 3-second cutscene pointing out the obvious to me.  But the game certainly didn't explain its puzzles (the fact that it took me 2 hours to figure out you could stab the splashfruit is testament to that).  Dowsing is an interesting thing, because it would not be fun running in circles looking aimlessly for kikwi or whatever.  It gives you a direction to go on, and I suppose if you spam it, you can be directed exactly to the item, but I never did that.  I just saw what direction it pointed me in and then went there and figured it out.  The idea to have hints instead is not unreasonable, though.  Also, I don't think dungeons being compact is really a bad thing.  Do you remember every single room in City in the Sky?  How about the Wind Temple?  I don't really, and many of the rooms are not that important: you enter, solve an essentially unrelated puzzle, and leave.  I remember every room of the Sandship and the Ancient Cistern and all of them were very important and felt like you were actually making significant progress toward your goal.  I think that concept is something Skyward Sword focused on a lot in all of its environment design: compactness, which is not a bad thing in games.  You say yourself that many of the dungeons were superb, and they should be fairly memorable, so what does it really matter if they're small or large?  They took me just as long to play through as other dungeons because most of them use significant amounts of backtracking (usually in the form of entering the same central area multiple times and ways).  Personally I think that is good design.  Being able to do something like that in a small space is impressive."
truezelda,3b1rxp,Serbaayuu,4,Thu Jun 25 11:51:12 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for taking the time to engage with my lengthy post and offer some contrary opinions. I feel like we might just disagree on some things, not that there's anything wrong with that! Just curious, how many times have you replayed Skyward Sword, and when was the last time you did so?   Dowsing is an interesting thing, because it would not be fun running in circles looking aimlessly for kikwi or whatever.   I feel like I should clarify and split some hairs here. I can totally understand your point in terms of dowsing for the Earth Temple's key shards, or looking for the sail that attaches to the windmill in Skyloft-trying to look for those without any idea of where they are would have been a nightmare. For those, I don't think that dowsing is necessarily a bad thing. However, where I think dowsing fails is in the game's constant reminding that dowsing is a thing and how the game instantly beeps at the player to dowse for an objective as soon as they have the ability to do so. For example, in the Isle of Songs, Fi tells you to go look for the Silent Realm gate in the designated area. But the moment the player is in control of Link again, the game beeps at you to dowse, and doesn't stop until you do use dowsing. But the only thing dowsing in the Isle of Songs tells you is that the way to the Trial Gate is through the little hole Links crawls into. Why does the game insist on the player dowsing at that moment if that's the only information they can glean from using it? Again, this goes back to the ""little things"" I talked about in the OP. I wouldn't have such a problem with dowsing if it was presented as a useful but optional tool instead of a mandatory ""find this right now"" tool.  Concerning dungeons- I think that one thing we can agree on is that Skyward Sword definitely marked a change in dungeon style from the other 3D games. Maybe I'm just sort of stuck in the past on this, but I think that one of the things I appreciated the most about games like Ocarina is the complex dungeoneering involved.    You say yourself that many of the dungeons were superb, and they should be fairly memorable, so what does it really matter if they're small or large?   Again, I apologize for being rather unclear in my OP (I wrote it late last night and it looked good to my 2:30 AM brain). I did enjoy the dungeons, but there was something that had bothered me since my first playthrough, something that I thought was missing. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned and the Skyward Sword-style compact dungeons are going to be the norm as Nintendo ""re-think's Zelda's conventions"", but I really, really enjoyed feeling a little overwhelmed at the size and scale of a dungeon that I acquired. To answer your question, yes, I do remember almost all of the rooms in the Wind Temple and the City in the Sky, but to be frank I couldn't say the same about places like the Fire Sanctuary and the Sandship, and the only reason I could say that about places like Skyview Temple, Earth Temple and Lanayru Mining Facility is because there were so few rooms. I think that we might just have to agree to disagree because it seems like we might like two different styles of dungeon exploration."
truezelda,3b1rxp,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jun 25 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how many times have you replayed Skyward Sword, and when was the last time you did so?   Sorry, didn't realize there was a direct question in there.  I've played it three times and I don't quite remember but I think the latest time was about two years ago now.  The first two were right after it released.   where I think dowsing fails is in the game's constant reminding that dowsing is a thing and how the game instantly beeps at the player to dowse for an objective as soon as they have the ability to do so.   That's a fair complaint."
truezelda,3b1rxp,HylianHal,2,Fri Jun 26 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, regarding compactness; I've always favored the term ""density"" for that aspect of Skyward Sword's design. It's all densely-packed exploration."
truezelda,3b1rxp,skywardocarina86,-1,Thu Jun 25 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with this especially with the hand holding and compactness. Yes there was a bit of hand holding here and there but compared to some other Zelda games it was so benign. Fi never spoiled any puzzles, the game gave you plenty of moments to figure things out on your own and it required some intuitive thinking. Yes the heart warning and shield warning were kind of dumb but your I could pretty much ignore them by recovering hearts or fixing your shield.  You want to talk about hand holding? Midna was far far worse (I have a list of reasons why she is bad)  ""Dungeon 1: Midna interrupts you 4 times throughout the dungeon to tell you to follow monkeys. Dungeon 3: Midna tells you you can knock down stalactites. Dungeon 5: Midna points out that a statue is missing and you need to find it. Dungeon 6: 1. You find a pumpkin and Midna tells you to return to the yeti. 2. You find cheese and Midna tells you to return to the yeti again. 3. You find the bedroom key and Midna says it's about time. Dungeon 8: 1. Midna asks to continue hiding in your shadow. 2. Midna tells you that the twilight people aren't enemies. 3. Midna explains that the black fog turns you into a wolf after it turns you into a wolf. 4. When you encounter a sol, Midna explains that it's the source of power for this world and instructs you to take it back to the entrance. 5. When you place the sol in one of the two slots, Midna tells you there should be a second one and tells you to look for it. 6. Midna repeats that the sols have powered up your sword. Dungeon 9: 1. Midna reacts to King Bulbin talking.    You enter the twilight-covered Lanayru Province and Midna reminds you she has to help you, reminds you what you are looking for, and hints that there might be a plot twist coming soon. Midna points out that Hyrule Castle is the castle you were at earlier and tells you the game will get harder. Midna tells you the bridge smells funny, tells you you are trapped when the bridge is on fire, then remarks on how small Lake Hylia is when you jump into it and reminds you you are looking for the spirit's spring. Midna takes control of a bird monster and tells you you can use it to reach Upper Zora's River. Midna tells you that bird sure was useful and reminds you to look for the village of the Zoras. Hints that it's getting cold. Midna points out that the Zora village that is frozen is in fact frozen. Midna tells you you need to warp and find a way to melt the ice. Midna tells you the Zoras are now safe and that you should leave. After being told that you will be given the ability to swim by Queen Rutela if you help her, Midna reminds you that she just told you that she will grant you the ability to swim if you help her. Midna tells you that the water current is extra fast due to the melted ice and will take you straight to Lake Hylia. Midna tells you you are right in front of the spirit's spring. Midna points out that the last tear of light has shown up on the map and it's different from the rest. Upon leaving Lake Hylia, Midna reminds you that you need to help Queen Rutela find her son because the fused shadow is at the bottom of Lake Hylia. After getting the Zora Armor, Midna reminds you that the last fused shadow is at the bottom of Lake Hylia. Midna pops up in the dungeon to tell you you can knock down stalactites. ""  Don't get me started on some of ALBW hand holding cough Ravio explaining how items are used, Hilda constantly telling you to look for the sages every time you enter the dark world, Most of the game telling you the solution to a puzzle by having the solution on the wall *Dark Temple"" or really really obvious solutions to the puzzle *throwing the eye lens onto the eye switch thing"""
truezelda,3b1rxp,aeroblaster,5,Fri Jun 26 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"It's well known that Skyward Sword is a bit odd for a Zelda game. There's a lot of the game blatantly treating you like an idiot, as if it was geared to a younger audience.  Also as someone who has played all the Zelda games, Skyward Sword felt the most disappointing to me compared to any other Zelda game in the entire series. Reaching the near end of the game and I still felt like I was in tutorial mode... it was really bothersome and the game just never dropped the hand holdy act.  The story was fresh, it was cool, and awesome overall, but most of the time the gameplay left something to be desired."

truezelda,3b1rxp,randomnonwhiteguy,-2,Fri Jul 3 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"Wholeheartedly agree, this babying was endemic to the entire game and it is what made SS the worst Zelda I have ever played. Fi's constant interruptions to forcibly explain the obvious were so disruptive to the flow of the game that I started to miss Navi. And remember how a diagram the controls were permanently affixed to the HUD with no option to turn them off for the first several hours of the game? Most areas of the game were extremely linear, dungeons and otherwise, with dozens of checkpoints along the way, with dowsing to offset any scrap of exploration somehow left intact.    That linearity was also a function of utter laziness on the part of the developers. The idea that I could not freely transition between the woods and the volcano without going back up to the sky was absurd, this was the first Zelda I've seen besides 2 without an actual open world. But the biggest shock to me was when, after completing the first three dungeons, I was told that I needed to go and re-do very slightly-altered versions of all three of those dungeons and the linear fields preceding them. The gall it took for the developers to recycle a paltry three dungeons rather than creating a reasonable amount of unique dungeons truly made me feel as if I had been ripped off for 60 bucks. Both the hand-holding and the content recycling were completely insulting to my intelligence, and shook my trust in Nintendo to the core."

I'm sure designers and developers have drawn inspirations from real-world locations for in game locations (although not to the extent of Pokémon's in game worlds, which draw heavily on a specific region's geography), but it seems incredibly likely that Nintendo actually considers it a part of our planet for many reasons (existance of magic, progression of time doesn't match up, entire world was flooded etc.)"

As Christianity was used for the first three games, since Japan loves using it as symbology and such. So you see a lot of that sort of thing (crosses, christian mythology, etc) in the downfall line. Which then happens to later mention that most people are clueless about the triforce (which is deliberately hidden).  Mostly it's LTTP doing this stuff, since the earlier games don't have much story, and the later entries don't mention christianity at all (instead opting to use the Zelda mythos).  So the general idea that comes across is that it was used as a cover-up to hide the triforce. Not so much as a deliberate quote or anything.   Come on man, let's not do this here.

truezelda,3azv79,SriBri,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"It's mostly due to the retconning of Christianity as the official ""Zelda religion"". The first game used it heavily, when there wasn't any mythos or lore. So it was a lot of christianity symbology, mixed with a few Zelda things. The second game just sort of did it's own thing. And then LTTP sort of did a half/half. Ultimately what ended up happening was that LTTP had a ""hiding the triforce"" backstory (which is ultimately supported by more games later on), and the Christianity mythos was dropped due to Zelda lore working better for Zelda. So ultimately every game but the 'hide the triforce' arc doesn't mention it at all.  Ultimately the appearance is that Christianity was used as a cover up.  As far as IRL goes, you can find a lot of correlations in the bible and other christian materials that tend to relate to actual Zelda stuff (the flood, for example). Ultimately in terms of Zelda lore you can, again, point out how it's detailing the actual history of hyrule, but the christian elements were used to cover up the existence of the triforce (the actual history/mythos).  Ultimately what this means is that you can literally enter religious debates, and use Zelda mythos to generate a better argument than Christianity can. And you can simply point to how Hyrule mythos overrides and explains why Christianity is a thing.  In reality it's just because Christianity has some cool symbology, Japan likes that symbology, used it in the early Zelda games, and later scrapped it as the series got more popular."
truezelda,3azv79,Kafke,3,Thu Jun 25 05:47:47 2015 UTC,"Your second to last paragraph still does a good job of dumbfounding me.

truezelda,3azv79,SriBri,0,Thu Jun 25 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"It's not like you can knock holes in creationist history by explaining Hyrule history.   Both are fiction, so there's not really an argument you can make for either. However, accurate historical sources will usually mention other materials and such. That's how we know a lot of the bible is indeed fiction: other historical resources don't mention anything of the sort.  Though as I said, it's just a fun little thing you can do. When you're dealing with fiction, the material that includes more than just a single story typically dominates the canon.  It's more of like arguing for the Flying Spaghetti Monster. You know it's fiction, and that's not really the point. The point is that it's a bit ridiculous and that it has as many valid arguments as other popular religions. Likewise goes for Zelda (which also has the benefit of explaining away Christianity as well)."

truezelda,3axe09,HylianHal,3,Wed Jun 24 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"Part of being involved in the Zelda fandom means exposing yourself to the more... questionable theories that people bat around.   I believe debunking and poking holes is almost more valuable than outright discussion in many ways, because not only does it encourage critical thinking and analysis, but it stimulates debate on both sides, should anyone choose to defend, rather than debunk, a theory. (Note: This concept applies to many things, not just fandom.)  This one, posted by Protomario and M Productions, details the history of the Triforce in Hyrule and in particular how those details imply that the Goddesses purposefully set up an unending cycle of conflict to curse the people of Hyrule, purely out of malice.  So check out the video - it's really five minutes with a few of padding - and point out any inconsistencies, errors, or logical fallacies that jump out at you.  I'd like to start out by pointing out how selectively they pull out references- it's all very cherry-picked, ignoring many sources of exposition that shed light on the Triforce's history, most notably any mention of Hylia."
truezelda,3axe09,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Jun 24 07:17:43 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% that the Old Gods do not care about the mortal world of Hyrule, at least.  Whether they actually created it or not, they left, the Triforce (and possibly Hylia and Demise) were left behind, and they have not interfered since - any ""divine intervention"" in the series is easily explained in other ways.   it's a floating pair of three triangles   kek  Well, there is information on why exactly the Triforce was created.  According to Hylia, the Old Gods left it to give mortal beings a source of hope - presumably, their intent was for Hylia (and Demise, if he is a god) to remain as stewards of the world, meaning that mortals would be living alongside the divine, giving them a reason to want to be able to match them if necessary.  And we saw that it WAS necessary - Link had to combat Demise (the entity who I believe is a god, left behind by the Old Gods) and the only way to destroy him was using the Triforce.  If he did not have that, Demise would be unstoppable.  At its core, the Triforce is a failsafe and it ended up being used exactly as intended.   The Goddesses set up Hyrule as a world that would never see peace   No, that was Demise, the being who caused the failsafe to be necessary.  Without the Triforce, he would have conquered the world (while part of his goal is the Triforce, he also expresses world domination as his intent).  The only person who still seeks the Triforce for evil is Demise, technically.  Also, I am not sure where the speakers are getting the idea that the Triforce was threatened during the Era of the Flood.  Ganon obtaining the Triforce isn't a ""threat"" to it, he's just going to use it.  They completely ignore the fact that that exact thing they claim the Goddesses tried to prevent happened in ALttP.  Also, yeah, judging from what we learned with Lorule, it seems likely that there is a core importance of the Triforce that holds the world together.  This video is pretty much an exercise in:   What if everything we thought we knew was wrong, and the good guys were evil!   which has been done to every piece of fiction ever.  But Zelda isn't that ""complex""."
truezelda,3axe09,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:36:01 2015 UTC,"I will take issue with your claim that demise is a god by offering up the fact that gods can't use the triforce, which is why hylia gave up her divinity. If demise was a god, he could not use it, and thus his seeking it would be pointless."
truezelda,3axe09,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 24 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"He's got Ghirahim.  Maybe Demise only wants it to prevent people from using it to beat him.  He never says what he's going to use it for, iirc."
truezelda,3axe09,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"But girahim is just a sword. I don't think something like that could use the triforce. I know it isn't explicitly stated anywhere, but I get the feeling that you, like, need a soul or something to use it, and that's why you don't have some mouse sneaking into Hyrule Castle and making the world into cheese. Plus, I don't really think Girahim is all that balanced of heart."
truezelda,3axe09,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 24 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"What's to say he doesn't have a soul?  He's clearly some kind of mortal-ish entity.  Presumably demons can use the thing just as well as humans, as well as gorons and other species too...  I think the only thing you actually need for the Triforce is sapience and, by extension, willpower, so that would prevent animals from accidentally activating it.  It does seem to take a concentrated effort to actually make the wish.   Plus, I don't really think Girahim is all that balanced of heart.   Yeah that is true though."
truezelda,3axe09,TeekTheReddit,3,Wed Jun 24 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"It's not a very good theory. They assert that the motivations of the goddesses were malicious without any actual evidence.  They also seem to have missed a crucial point. The fact that Lorule couldn't sustain itself without a Triforce, and the assumption that Hyrule works the same way, seems to suggest that the Triforce is a necessary component to sustaining Hyrule.  In other words, the Triforce is, at worst, a necessary evil. It wasn't created to put Hyrule into chaos, but because Hyrule couldn't exist without it."
truezelda,3axe09,stryker101,2,Wed Jun 24 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say Ocarina of Time clearly proves this to be false.  The Triforce splits the second Ganondorf touches it because he's evil and only desires power. The other two pieces go straight to Link and Zelda, who are clearly not evil.  If the Golden Goddesses or the Triforce were evil, then creating such a fail safe makes absolutely no sense whatsoever."
truezelda,3axe09,Serbaayuu,2,Fri Jun 26 04:56:48 2015 UTC,"because he's evil   No, it's because his heart is imbalanced.  If his heart was balanced between power, wisdom, and courage (all of which can easily be construed to evil), he would have gotten the whole thing.  And don't forget, he does own the whole thing in ALttP.  If the Triforce was ""good"" and intentionally avoided getting used by evil people, it wouldn't let that happen, either.  In fact, why would it even allow Ganon to keep the Triforce of Power?"
truezelda,3axe09,stryker101,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"He only owns the entire Triforce when he steals the pieces from other characters. Meaning the good guys failed to do their part. Not really any different to WW where Ganondorf steals the pieces from Link and Zelda at the end.  I also disagree with your other statement, because I don't believe an evil person could have those three traits in balance.  For one, evil and wisdom do not mesh. Wisdom isn't just intelligence, it's understanding, reason, and good judgment among other thing. Evil, and particularly the hatred that comes with it inherently go against those traits.  Courage is a stretch as well, especially if moral courage is considered as well (and considering Link is always ready to jump in and do the right thing, that's very likely).  The odds of any evil being having those three traits in balance are ridiculously low, thus making that failsafe quite useful."
truezelda,3axe09,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"Meaning the good guys failed to do their part.   So the all-powerful relic has a failsafe specifically to avoid getting used for evil, but can still be used for evil afterward anyway?   it's understanding, reason, and good judgment among other thing   It's very possible for that to exist within evil.  You can understand other people and still believe yourself superior to them or not care.  And hatred does not necessarily come with evil - what of pure conquest or desire for power?   Courage is a stretch as well   Not really.  The courage to go to extremes to get what you want is an easy way to twist that into evil.  The courage to hurt other people who stand in your way.  The courage to put a target on your own back by being a villain."
truezelda,3axe09,skywardocarina86,3,Fri Jun 26 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"Also you can have the Wisdom to understand, reason, and good judgement and still be considered evil because your judgment and understanding may be different then others, you might believe the Gerudo are pure evil and must be wiped out because they will try to take the Triforce and logically it's better to remove a threat. Hell Machivellan qualties are a type of bad wisdom.  Courage can be straightforward as simply never surrendering and seeking conflict. A courageous villain would be a warlord of some kind."

LttP clearly states that the Triforce does not choose between good and evil, only that it acts a scale to see if the three virtues are in balance.  The Triforce is an omnipotent and omniscient golden power; the only check to this power is the Master Sword.  I encourage everyone to read the translated Japanese LttP manual. Very enlightening."
truezelda,3axe09,henryuuk,5,Fri Jul 3 18:36:22 2015 UTC,So they mean the goddesses their intent was evil. Not the actual triforce. Cause the triforce is neutral. It simply doesn't care.

truezelda,3axe09,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 24 07:57:05 2015 UTC,"Does it really? Only time we ever see the triforce 'decide' something is in the Oracle games, and most likely that was because of that Link's subconsious wish to save people/go where he was needed."
truezelda,3axe09,henryuuk,3,Wed Jun 24 08:03:45 2015 UTC,"Consider the manner in which the Triforce judges its supplicants: anyone who lays hand on the Triforce has their heart and mind evaluated to determine their worthiness of the entirety. In addition, when an imbalances heart lays hand on the artifact, the Triforce must choose two individuals to bear the opposite two pieces elsewhere in Hyrule.  Less blatantly, if we're to take into account the Goddesses In Absentia theory, someone had to've made the decision to flood Hyrule pre-WW, and presupposing the Goddesses haven't intervened directly in Hyrule since its creation, that leaveas the Triforce as the only obvious candidate for enacting their wishes as a representative of their divine will in Hyrule.  ..And I feel like I'm forgetting something, but I'll let you know."

Far as we know, power wisdom and courage are some sort of measurable 'thing' for higher beings. It could very well be that the triforce decides as easily as you would be able to divide some trophies based on what color people are wearing.    It could be as simple as detecting their 'amounts', going : not equal > split up , and then scanning the land for the highest value.      WW was most likely not done by the triforce, as it was split."

Right, which is why I qualified it as rudimentary AI; even if the decisions it makes aren't complex, it still independently enacts the Goddesses' will, unless again you count things like OoX.   WW was most likely not done by the triforce, as it was split.   Valid point, but again, we don't know enough about how the Triforce operates to determine whether its split status matters.  /u/Serbaayuu, care to weigh in? I know you've some opinions here."

truezelda,3awjyi,HylianHal,4,Wed Jun 24 07:43:57 2015 UTC,"I would think that Hylian would sound similar to German if we compared it to real world languages, two of the most important series' characters have German names after all.

But a little goes a long way, and too much of it would be really annoying. Plus, the only reason I think it worked so well with Midna was because she was such a foreign and exotic character. Having everyone do that would feel completely alienating to me, and it'd be horribly difficult for me to get immersed in the game.  On a side note: even if they make it a ""real"" language, it'll always be gibberish to me. Same as Klingon or Elvish- I'll never be invested enough to learn it.  I'm in the camp that'd be perfectly happy if voice acting never came to Zelda.  I like reading the dialogue at my own pace, imagining their voices however I want to, and even pronouncing things how I want to. It's really jarring to play a series for decades only to hear someone say one of the commonly reused names in a way you've never heard before. I also feel like having the lines written out rather than spoken lends to the feeling of each game being a legend.  I also have no confidence/trust in Nintendo to do it well, and it'd be incredibly easy to screw up. It could easily be too over-dramatic, a line with the wrong delivery could ruin a serious moment by making it unintentionally hilarious, or two voice actors with zero chemistry could ruin an entire story arc. Also, while I enjoy the text in the games, I don't think a lot of it would work very well if it was spoken. I think that Star Wars (mostly the prequels) had that exact problem, some lines work fine on paper, but they just don't work out loud."

truezelda,3awjyi,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:35:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I was saying. Despite the fact that they would never make a Zelda game, they are second party developers for Nintendo.  Additionally, your second point strengthens my overall point: Nintendo stands to lose nothing in attempting to enact voice acting for the Zelda series, because if it seems subpar in nature, they will simply scrap it rather than risking alienating fans of the series, most likely. Too, they may have already undergone this process once or more so far in the series' development.  You could argue that Other M and Mario Sunshine would suggest otherwise, but Sunshine is by now a hard-learned lesson many years past (with regard to voice acting, at least), and Other M was less of a risk than a mainline Zelda series entry, wherein they felt they had more room to experiment."
truezelda,3awjyi,HylianHal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:59:17 2015 UTC,"I thought StarFox 64 was pretty well done. That being said, I agree with stryker101 that Zelda does not need voice acting. The whole original premise with Link was that he was void of personality so that the player could fill in the gaps how they saw fit. He was literally supposed to be the ""link"" between the player and the game. I also agree with him in that most video games have terrible voice acting. Look at the Resident Evil games... could those characters have any less emotion? I don't have faith in Nintendo to do it right either. I like being able to do the voices in my head, and I like the little bit of gibberish that Nintendo has added in the games, like Link's yells in OoT, to Midna and such. In fact, the only dialogue in the whole series I didn't like was the way Fi talked. The whole computeristic tone of her words killed it for me, as if she wasn't annoying enough already."
truezelda,3awjyi,noopenusernames,2,Sat Jul 4 11:18:46 2015 UTC,"Do you speak Spanish? How about Swedish? Maybe Portuguese? If not, does that make those languages gibberish?   To me, yes, because if I don't understand the language, then it's essentially gibberish to me. I suppose I could have been clearer by saying ""it'll always sound like gibberish to me"" instead.  For example, I can say: Hablar vaca dulce. Quiero ir al cine.  If a person doesn't know Spanish, then none of that makes sense to them, and is thus meaningless to them. If a person does understand Spanish, then they'll know that one of those sentences is nonsense and the other isn't.  Saying it'd be gibberish to me doesn't devalue the language itself. Mandarin sounds like gibberish to me, that doesn't mean I think the language as a whole is meaningless or nonsense, just means that I don't understand it. Does carboxymethylcellulose sound like gibberish to you, because it does to me. But it's a real thing.  Let's go back to Midna- it doesn't matter if what she's saying is literally gibberish or a real language, we can't understand it, so to us it is.  And despite veering off topic... I don't agree with most of the ""Speak American dangit"" crowd or many/most of their arguments. However, there is some merit to the idea that if you decide to live somewhere, you should make an effort to learn the dominant language, and shouldn't get upset if your neighbors don't learn your language just so your life can be more convenient. I wouldn't move to Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, China, Japan, Russia, etc. without putting serious effort into learning their respective language, and I wouldn't get mad at the locals there if they didn't learn English. I still think it's good for us to learn other languages, and for Texas- Spanish is absolutely a useful one to know.   Your faith comment was rebutted well enough by another user, so there's no point in me rehashing that."

He also has the Cane of Byrna, which grants him invulnerability as long as his magic keeps up. He conquers more dungeons than any other Link, including dungeons in the Dark World, the center of Ganon's power. Finally, he straight up kills Ganon, who had the complete Triforce and in that timeline had defeated the Hero of Time himself. And all this isn't even considering his other adventures in the Oracles (where he defeats Ganon again) and LA.   ST Link is probably the weakest. His quest is relatively short and he gains few powerful items. He doesn't learn powerful sword techniques like MC Link or have access to the Four Sword like the Links of FS and FSA.

The Hero of Skyloft is the most athletic.  Thanks to the stamina system he can sprint & jump & climb quickly and all of that much better than some of the other ones can.  The Hero of Time can do flips when jumping, but he's much slower at everything else.  The Hero of Skyloft also stood toe-to-toe with Ghirahim, essentially a parallel incarnation of the Master Sword, which is impressive.  He also defeated a god or godlike being as well as earned the full Triforce (which is a rare feat).  I think the weakest would be the Hero of Spirits (Spirit Tracks), whose greatest feat of strength is swinging his sword.  Zelda does most of the heavy lifting in that game as a Phantom, and she even helps him slay Malladus with his sword at the end.  This makes sense; the Hero of Spirits is originally a train engineer, not a fighter.  None of the items he uses require any particular athletics - probably the boomerang is the one that requires the most strength to use.  Also, even though he defeated Malladus, it was Malladus in an already-weakened state in a desperate attempt to destroy before his body ripped itself apart."
truezelda,3auemm,Serbaayuu,8,Tue Jun 23 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"This was refreshing- I like that you gave actually reasons for ST Link being the low man, instead of just ""Snrrk TRAINS"".  That being said, I believe we do have to count Phantom Zelda as part of his base of power, since it's a resource he has access to and uses to great effect, regardless of whether HE personally controls her; we, as the players control her, and she is therefore inexorably linked to Link and his quest."
truezelda,3auemm,HylianHal,2,Wed Jun 24 07:23:11 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point; with Phantom Zelda as an ally, he could probably stand his own against many of the other Heroes."
truezelda,3auemm,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:14:41 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, Phantom Zelda could probably obliterate all other Links, with the exception of WW/PH Link, assuming he still has the Phantom Sword."
truezelda,3auemm,LordCharco_iii,19,Sat Jun 27 09:03:01 2015 UTC,"In terms of physical strength, I'd say TP Link seems the strongest to me. For one, he can wrestle with gorons, and even with Iron Boots that has to take a ton lot of strength. He can backflip off Epona. He can whirl the ball and chain over his head. Plus, he can overpower Ganondorf when their swords clash and they're both trying to push the other back. In a sword fight I think he'd win (he also seems to have the longest range with the Hawkeye mask).  Magic gives the OoT, MM, and LttP Links a big boost though. If MM Link could the Fierce Deity Mask, then I'd give him an edge.  I'd say the weakest are the Links in the Adult Timeline. WW Link can barely fight Ganondorf, so I think it's safe to say that putting him up against other Links in a sword fight wouldn't end well for him."
truezelda,3auemm,stryker101,22,Tue Jun 23 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"WW Link can barely fight Ganondorf   He's got some damn good agility on most of the other Heroes, though.  Also don't forget he can still pick up and handily wield Darknut swords.  I think the Hero of Winds has a harder time with Ganon mostly because Ganon is a fucking tank during that fight and just doesn't let you get hits on him."
truezelda,3auemm,Serbaayuu,11,Tue Jun 23 18:52:58 2015 UTC,That and this Link is just a child. The fact that he beat Ganondorf at such a young age is just an example of how powerful he will be when he grows up.

In WW, people almost never call you a kid, don't question you to be out on a boat alone, don't question you having a weapon and you even get a fucking house. Tetra is considered old enough to have 'feelings/lust' for by the pirates, considering they were talking about them getting a child together which made Gonzo blush at the thought. Size isn't really important, cause there are many different sizes for different people in the WW artstyle. Grandma is the size of Link and 3 of the pirates are the size of Link/Tetra despite being adults. The chancellor in Minish Cap (same artstyle) was also the same size as Link, while clearly being an adult. In the same way, we see that the lineage of the pirates also had 3 of them being a small size back then, despite being adult. etc... The ruto's I(specifically Quill) even consider you a ""fine young man"""
truezelda,3auemm,henryuuk,3,Thu Jun 25 22:04:11 2015 UTC,"Why would it be at the time the Hero of Time started his quest?

They would not be aware that his quest started 7 years ago, then he went to sleep for 7 years, then he saved the day - that doesn't match with the idea of him being a true time traveler.

Don't forget that before the battle, Wind Waker Link actually LOSES to Ganondorf in a couple of hits, in spite of having the Triforce of Courage.  On the other hand, I always see people arguing that aLttP is powerful partly due to the Cane of Byrna; Wind Waker Link has the longest invincibility time by far with the Magic Armor, in addition to 3 Blue Potions and 1 Grandma's Soup, plus he gains double attack power with Grandma's Soup. aLttP has a stronger Master Sword and possibly 4 Blue Potions, so Wind Waker could barely edge him out with the 2 drinks of the Soup."

He's conquered more foes, saved more lives, acquired more items, posed for more pictures, tormented more chickens and smashed more pots than any other Link.  He can handle a boat, he can run like the wind and he can summon a bird for transportation. He's mastered the seasons, tamed time and outright killed a fully powered Ganon. His arsenal not only contains most of the items the other Links use, it also contains some supremely powerful items unique to him, such as a cape that grants invisibility and invulnerability, fearsome magic spells and, oh yes, the power to jump at will (I'm serious, only one other Link can boast that).

Also consider that his death in LoZ was caused by the same weapon as in ALttP, and that Ganon is brought back to life in AoL if you die, showing that it is possible to bring him back to life.  My understanding of things now that the timeline exists is that Ganon died in ALttP, was briefly resurrected in the Oracle games, died again and was brought back to life ""off screen"" before the events of LoZ.

He likes to throw out a lot of unsupported assumptions and guesswork, despite the games directly contradicting what he says.   It seems somewhat biased and it throws everything out the window, making some unsupported assumptions to give a plot twisty end that doesn't make sense.   That's Game Theory in a nutshell.   Also, i think we should consider only one itemset per game (OoT Link can't use MM items and vice-versa, consider them different Links from different times).   I don't.

But honestly I'm gonna follow with what the game told us and say it was actually just a Minish artifact of great power, essentially the Minish's attempt at making a 'triforce' (as in : strong source of power) of their own. The lightforce is just a powersource, it doesn't grant wishes (the hat Ezlo made was what that was))    As far as we have seen, a triforce can't be 'drained' You either have it, or you don't. The light force on the other hand, was drained for about 90% or so away from Zelda.    Hell, maybe it was something the minish originally made to 'fill' the triforce up, with them thinking the hole in the triforce was something that had to be fixed or something. (it's totally not an actual 'tetraforce' piece though, and that theory is malarky)      .    I'd say it is a Minish-made object, meant to help humans, which was based on the triforce, and was probably and strengthened variant on the force gems. It could also be (some) Force Gems are made out of/in the same way as that gratitude crystals form, as both have had instance of appearing when people are helped with something. Some people even theorize that Vaati absorbing most of the lightforce, and then being defeated might have scattered the power of it into the thousands of force gems we see in some later games down the timeline."
truezelda,3aq07r,henryuuk,7,Mon Jun 22 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"According to the Historia, the Light Force is a source of energy that originates within all living things.  Presumably, Zelda contains a lot of it because she's divine.  Apparently, in the original Japanese, both the Light Force and Force Gems are simply called ""Force"", which strongly suggests that they're tied together.  We also know that any random person can create Force Gems, as proven by Spirit Tracks.  So I think basically the best answer we have is that it's a vague mashup of ""souls"" and ""emotions"" and ""magic"", but it doesn't do anything particularly special aside from be very powerful if you get a lot of it."

The developers have explicitly rejected the existence of a fourth Triforce piece, so that theory doesn't work either. I think the Light Force was an intentional imitation of the Triforce created by the Minish. Following the Era of Chaos, both the Master Sword and the Triforce had been sealed beyond the Door of Time, so the Hylians could not use them to fight the forces of evil in MC's backstory. Seeing the plight of the Hylians, the Minish forged two weapons that emulated the tools the ancient hero had used to defeat the Demon King: the Picori Blade modeled after the Master Sword, and the Light Force modeled after the Triforce. The Hero of Men used these to defeat the evil forces threatening Hyrule. In the absence of their predecessors, the Picori Blade and Light Force became the new objects of veneration in Hylian culture."
truezelda,3aq07r,Dismas423,2,Mon Jun 22 17:52:55 2015 UTC,The Triforce was locked away in the Sacred Realm between SS and MC and it remained there until OoT   Only as far as we know.  That's an easy retcon.
truezelda,3aq07r,Serbaayuu,3,Mon Jun 22 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"But it hasn't been retconned and there's no evidence that anyone opened the Door of Time between the Era of Chaos and OoT. Under the current canon, the Triforce was in the Sacred Realm during MC."
truezelda,3aq07r,Dismas423,3,Mon Jun 22 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"Again, ""as far as we know"" - it hasn't been explicitly stated.  Anything could have happened during the time between SS and OoT, which could also be expanded to be ANY immense amount of time.  Just knowing something is the case at Point A and Point B is not enough information to claim what happened in between."
truezelda,3aq07r,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Jun 22 19:08:36 2015 UTC,"Well I guess we can't say with absolute certainty what happened between any of the games. But as it stands now, the Triforce was placed in the Sacred Realm during the Era of Chaos, it was still there in OoT, and there's nothing suggesting it was moved at any point during the interim. The best conclusion is that the Triforce was in the Sacred Realm the entire time. The people at Nintendo are welcome to add new events concerning the Triforce if they so desire, but as of right now they haven't."

truezelda,3aixfq,darkaxe,23,Sat Jun 20 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"TP had a bunch of minigames, fishing, poe collecting,etc... It put its replay marbles in a different jar.    Personally I played the hidden village shoot out hundreds of times, and I also loved messing with random 'blins on hyrule field and snowboarding with Yeto.    It would have been cool to have something akin to the figurines collection that fit more with TP (maybe some sort of sketchbook or something, TP Link seems like the sort of guy that would have drawing talent)    But the figurine collection was also for a big part because there was no companion to give you names, details and tips about enemies (unlike all other 3D zelda games : Navi, Tatl, Midna, Fi) They could have given that function to the Gossip Stone Fragement and the King, but decided not to do so."

On a replay years later I got them all but man, the single biggest oversight in Twilight Princess to me is a tiny little icon letting you know you found them all in an area, like the ones for the Skultulas in OoT. Love the game but throwing 60 collectibles in a world with zero guidance sort of kills the fun of searching for them when you get down to the last ones."

I gave up after my third time retracing every poe in a guide and never found it, so for all I know the game glitched and one disappeared or never counted or something. That's what I tell myself anyway."
truezelda,3aixfq,seluropnek,17,Sun Jun 21 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"My initial reaction is that TP is a more complete game in the first place. It had a full set of dungeons and a huge amount of heart pieces to find. Plus it already had alternate tunics, so a NG+ outfit wouldn't really work."
truezelda,3aixfq,GengarWithATriforce,3,Sat Jun 20 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"I think there could've been ways to spice up end game or replay value.   I believe they knew this was an issue, and had deadlines to hit for a timed dual release.  My guess is they said something to likes of ""make a heart container consist of 5 pieces, and find new hiding spots, that should add 5-10 hours of play""  Some games don't need to add tedium to make re-play value.  Some games shouldn't be replayed right away.   I love SS, only played it once.  I'll buy the remastered version in 5 years and love it again.  Purposefully adding objectives can take away from a game I feel, unless the tedium is actually fun in itself.   The worst offender is metroid prime getting all scans possible in the game to 100% it."

truezelda,3aixfq,Serbaayuu,5,Mon Jun 22 12:37:37 2015 UTC,"I know it's different for others, but personally those things in Wind Waker aren't really incentives for me to replay. The figurines just seem super grindy to me and it's lame that some of them can be missed permanently if you don't get a picture in time. The amount of time going back and forth to exchange pictures for figurines, even in the HD version, seems extremely tedious. In this case the effort versus reward is way out of wack for me. Eventually, I'll probably replay Wind Waker, but because I liked the game not for the incentives.   I think Twilight Princess has a lot more incentive to replay it because there are just a lot more fun things to do. More games, meatier dungeons, more to look at in the overworld, etc. It feels a lot more fleshed out (though it's a bit padded at times).  Besides the gameplay itself, the only replay incentives that entice me are things that change up the gameplay like increased difficulty or a different character with a different play style (like Super Mario 3D World). If I replay Wind Waker, it's most likely that I would play Hero mode and completely ignore the figurines again.   And it's not that I'm against figurines. I enjoy betting on Smash Bros replay matches to win gold to buy trohpies, but I already enjoy watching the replays and fake gambling. So the effort put into getting the trophies is something I probably would do even if trophies weren't involved. And in this case, I feel like the trophies give meaning to the gold you win. It actually enhances the gambling because you feel like there's a bit more at stake. Kirby Triple Deluxe is another example. I enjoy replaying it and I enjoy finding secret items in games. So it's nice that even though I've already found the secret collectibles, it gives me a chance to see new sprites unlocked. Unlike taking pictures and sailing back and forth from the figurine maker, finding secret collectibles in Kirby is something I'm gonna do whether or not it unlocks new sprites. The new sprites are just a cherry on top.  TL;DR   Collectibles only really appeal to me if the gameplay that gets them for me is entertaining by itself."
truezelda,3aixfq,BaltarForPresident,2,Sun Jun 21 16:42:50 2015 UTC,I think for me the pajamas really did a lot for me. Along with getting the deluxe picto box at the start. WW has such a smoother intro as well. I have a much harder time getting back into TP with its atrocious intro. An added incentive like a different shade on his tunic even would make me like it more.
truezelda,3aixfq,BaltarForPresident,2,Sun Jun 21 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"Different strokes for different folks. I like the idea of photography in the game, and I'd be more likely to do more if you had unlimited picture slots and you couldn't permanently miss stuff."
truezelda,3ahov2,TheHynusofTime,16,Sat Jun 20 07:26:57 2015 UTC,Gerudo Fortress
truezelda,3ahov2,Crim_drakenya,4,Sat Jun 20 10:46:42 2015 UTC,Hell yes. This is probably the best map for any fps. You have multiple levels of indoor locations plus the roofs. Then you have the wide open desert space on the other side of the map. If anyone here has played insurgency the gerudo fortress kinda reminds me of the map verticality.  Edit: I just remembered the really high locations. The ladder leading up to the top of the gate to the desert and where Link gets thrown into jail  are great sniping positions. Also there were a bunch of crates in the fortress both inside and out which would be great for cover.
truezelda,3ahov2,madmaz186,2,Sat Jun 20 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"I've just messed around with this idea, and I don't think it'll work how the game has it layed out. If you actually try and map out all the tunnels, they end up intersecting one another. Unless I'm just messing up somewhere."
truezelda,3ahov2,Crim_drakenya,2,Sat Jun 20 19:45:19 2015 UTC,Hmmm that would be difficult.
truezelda,3ahov2,stryker101,2,Sat Jun 20 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"Check this map.   Here's a top-down one.  Seems like it should fit together ok, though I suppose you might have to take a few liberties with some of the tunnels."
truezelda,3ahov2,madmaz186,5,Sun Jun 21 16:34:49 2015 UTC,I think Hyrule castle from wind waker would be pretty sweet for a halo map. It kinda reminds me of Epitaph from Halo 3 with the second level balcony above a single large room. There should be limited access to the outside to loop around and have the master sword room be open for the power weapon location!  Another good one would be inside the deku tree. There should be one of those boosters that launch you into the air where the web in the center would be to reach the higher floors.
truezelda,3ahov2,1upIRL,5,Sat Jun 20 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time: Gerudo Fortress, Kokiri Forest, Kakiriko Village, Goron City, Castle Town  Majora's Mask: Clock Town, Goron Village, Pirate Fortress, Ikana Valley  Wind Waker: (I haven't played much) Windfall Island, ""Forsaken Fortress""  Twilight Princess: Hidden Village, Kakiriko Village, Castle Town, Ice Dungeon mansion place, Ordon Village, Hyrule Castle  Skyward Sword: Faron Woods, The SandShip, Skyloft  Basically anywhere there is a lot of structure in a small enclosed area. My favorites to play in Halo would be TP villages or SS Faron Woods.   When I played through Twilight Princess, the Shootout in Hidden Village just screamed First-person Shooter to me. The TP Kakiriko village was another thought because it is essentially two long structures on either side of a canyon, but not in the traditional Halo way. Faron Woods might be hard to duplicate in Forge, but it sure is well platformed and very pretty. I think the Gerudo Fortress from OoT might be the easiest to create in Forge, and Kakirko/kokiri from OoT next. Clock Town might be my favorite Zelda Locale personally, and if you google search ""Majora's Mask Clock Town Map"" you'll find a pretty good guide image as well as minecraft recreations.  And the cool thing about forge is you can tweak it how you want! If you don't want to exactly recreate something, you can adjust it, adjoin two different areas, or blend ideas from two or more."

truezelda,3ahov2,stryker101,3,Sat Jun 20 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"I think OoT's Zora River would make for a kickass CTF map. Decent for some other modes, too, like KotH or Infection. It's linear but with several routes, there's a solid amount of vertical range, and it the two sides play to different strategies with the high end being more open and the low end being more confined and there are lots of blind spots in the middle. It would need to be tweaked a bit for balance but it's got a solid framework."
truezelda,3ahov2,dacalpha,3,Sat Jun 20 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"Empty Lake Hylia/Water Temple in Ocarina of Time seems like a good one to me.  On the outside you have the Lakeside Laboratory, the fishing hole, and a ginormous hill in the middle that overlook everything outside, then on the lakebed you could have a ""maze"" of rocks/boulders to make it a little more interesting. Then on the inside you have three floors, a largely open middle room with a bunch of tunnels shooting off from all sides leading to different floors, and possibly have some connecting to the laboratory/fishing hole/the secret passage to Zora's Domain."
truezelda,3ahov2,seamonster131,3,Sat Jun 20 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"The primary central room of the Great Deku Tree would be pretty sweet. It's a cylinder with two or three levels, and you could have some booster things to get you from level to level."

truezelda,3aaaxn,HylianHal,25,Thu Jun 18 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"I have felt that Nintendo has consistently done really well with their E3 Digital Event presentations the last couple of years, despite low Wii U sales. However I felt that this one was their weakest yet.   It's nice to see Reggie address the lack of Zelda and give it a justification but I don't see how last year it was fine if the game was gonna come out 8-16 months later, but you can't do it this year. When you make a promise to have a game come out in 2015, it's more relieving to see footage of its progress so that we get reminded that ""oh, right! It's gonna be a stellar game"" and keep the hype going. This gave many viewers the impression that Zelda is in a worse state than it was when we last saw it a couple of months ago and not everyone is gonna see this interview to witness THEIR justification for it.  I'm very excited for Zelda Wii U, but seeing games like the 3DS Zelda and Metroid games being shown instead of the promises they originally made to their fans makes me feel let down and pushed to the side.  On a side note, I was unimpressed by the new announced games. I feel like Star Fox did not have the same graphical polish that Mario Kart 8 had and the 3DS titles look like childish/kiddie versions of the games many of us wanted. Nintendo has some hits and some misses and I'm patiently waiting to see how it all turns out."
truezelda,3aaaxn,athanc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"They did a sort of poor job selling it this year. Like, they gave out the impression that Tri Force Heroes is a quick side project because they need money. Whether it's true or not, it was just randomly buried in the event and they didn't hype it at all. It gave off a pretty negative impression, despite my excitement for another 2D Zelda that plays like ALBW.   Game wise they had some home runs in Fire Emblem: Fates and Xenoblade Chronicles X, but FE was a trailer we already saw in Japanese and Xeno was the highlight of the event yet it was buried in the middle of everything. Star Fox, their lead, just under delivered in that it doesn't look different from the N64/3DS game (and it may have less features to in regards to coop). Mario Maker was pretty cool, but we already knew about it, and familiarity with PC's sort of just makes it look like full priced mod tools. Now, it's a great idea, but there are still questions (can we create a full campaign or world or is it just levels, etc.)  They just needed to restructure and hype more. This felt like they were trying to get through it instead of actually get us excited for something. They were on glide, and it just didn't really work out.   I understand holding Zelda off. They can show it at a random event on their own terms and it'll explode the internet. At E3 it can get buried in all the other news, especially with MS and Sony upping their game this year and Zelda just being ""more information"" rather than a huge reveal."

I sure wanted to see Zelda U at E3 this year, but I realized it was a long shot, and I'm thrilled that we're getting a (actually new) title in between (even if it's non-canon) when I expected nothing.  I have always been fine with waiting to see a game until it's ready.  It's good to hear that they believe they are committed to the Wii U and 2016 with this game, too.  I think that supports the idea that we won't see the NX until after 2016, which would ideally calm down a lot of the doomsayers (it won't actually though).  I think the hate for Nintendo this year is mostly due to the fact that they blew a lot of the hype on the titles coming out late this year last year.  If we didn't know about Yoshi, Star Fox, and Mario Maker until this week, people wouldn't be flipping their collective shit.  If they've decided to only discuss near-future titles from now on at E3, that will be good for them - we just have to wait until next year's E3 for it to actually be good because they wasted this year's E3 last year."

We don't know if they're still expanding on what we saw last year or if they've scrapped the game entirely and gone back to the drawing board. We don't know that Nintendo isn't going to delay this game further or pull a Twilight Princess and make it a NX launch title. (Not that I think this is likely.)  We don't know any of this because they didn't show the game.  What Reggie says about their current plans has no value because, as he said himself, things change.  So right now, the only thing we do know is that Nintendo needs anywhere from six months to a year of extra development time. Which means somebody, somewhere down the line, screwed up hard.

The fact of life as a gamer is when a developer states something like ""We are going to put it on Wii U"", you have to take their word for it until it actually comes out.  Otherwise you are just pulling random speculation out of your ass for the sake of having a panic.

What we don't know is if the screw up was in misjudging the amount of development needed to do the game right or if there was an unexpected problem.

You're the one speculating that this is going to be the ""biggest Zelda ever.""   No, they've kind of told us that.   I just what to know what the current state of the game is.   In development and not dead.  What else could possibly be worthwhile to you?   without a corroborating video all we have to go on is their word, which as we have already established, means diddly squat.   Again, the video would also mean ""diddly squat"", considering what they originally believed was a 2015 release quickly changed to a 2016 release even after the video."
truezelda,3aaaxn,Serbaayuu,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"Really? Because I saw a trailer and what looked like a late alpha or early beta build of one small section of the map with some advanced but unpolished movement. That could have been anywhere from 2-4 years out from a finished game pretty easily. There's no subtitle, we have no idea what the progress is on the stories, dungeons, various weapons, other gameplay mechanics outside of riding and shooting, 75% of the world map, NPCs, magic abilities, or dialogue.   The point is that we actually know less about where they are in development than we did six months ago.   No, they've kind of told us that.   They told us it was going to be out in 2015 too.   In development and not dead. What else could possibly be worthwhile to you?   Subtitle, story, dungeons, various weapons, other gameplay mechanics outside of riding and shooting, NPCs, magic, abilities, dialogue...   Again, the video would also mean ""diddly squat"", considering what they originally believed was a 2015 release quickly changed to a 2016 release even after the video.   But we would at least know where they are right now with the game. We currently don't even know that much."

The only pieces of information that are actually useful to us as gamers are the release date and the price point and maybe the final title.  The game will get done when it's done, regardless of what we know about it."
truezelda,3aaaxn,Serbaayuu,0,Thu Jun 18 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"The only pieces of information that are actually useful to us as gamers are the release date and the price point and maybe the final title.   If that were true, E3 wouldn't exist. Heck, I'd be willing to bet you don't even believe this. Tell me which game you last bought knowing nothing more than the price and the title.  The fact that they didn't show the game, in spite of having multiple reasons to, opens the door to all kind of speculations and the fact that they are lying about why they didn't show the game isn't helping matters.  If they wanted to avoid frustrating consumers, they failed.  If they wanted people to remain confident in the game, they failed.  If they wanted to reduce speculation that this was still a 2016 game, they failed.  If they wanted to assure people that this was still a Wii-U game, they failed.  Heck, if they wanted people to walk away from this year's E3 with confidence in the Nintendo brand, they failed. All the awesome goodwill they generated on Sunday with Smash Bros, Mother 1, and  the World Championship, and they pissed it all away on Tuesday with an E3 showing where the most exciting thing was Puppet Shiggy.  When the game was announced, everybody figured Holiday of 2015.  When the delay was announced, everybody figured Q1, maybe Q2 of 2016.  Now we're 12 months from the announcement and Holiday 2016 is looking not only possible, but likely.  So they've been working on this game for a full year and they, very literally, have nothing to show for it. You can't say that's not unusual or a little disconcerting."
truezelda,3aaaxn,TeekTheReddit,0,Thu Jun 18 20:13:04 2015 UTC,"If that were true, E3 wouldn't exist.   E3 is for investors, not gamers."

If anything, this only furthers my concern that Zelda U isn't being delayed just for more development time in general, but more for actual development trouble: Difficulty choosing a direction, what they want out of the game, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if none of the things we saw in last year's reveal (except the art direction and maybe the new tunic) actually end up in the final game."
truezelda,3aaaxn,xwatchmanx,3,Fri Jun 19 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Argh, can you imagine how frustrating it would have been if they had shown new Zelda U footage??? ARRRRGGGGGH"
truezelda,3aaaxn,StoicBanana,0,Sat Jun 20 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"This logic would have been sound had they not already shown Zelda at E3 2014.  They could have released a CGI trailer, or immensely curated teaser, or just SOMETHING. They clearly have assets and material. They didn't just scrap it all, that would be unbelievably stupid.  They mishandled this year's E3 horribly. I don't buy Reggie's excuses on this one."
truezelda,3aaaxn,IThoughtThisWasDigg,-2,Fri Jun 19 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"This is encouraging, because I don't want to wait around wondering if that awesome game I saw at E3 2014 is going to be massively different and on a system I may not buy."
truezelda,3a8uiv,Knoxisawesome,6,Thu Jun 18 03:37:26 2015 UTC,My only question is if you play multiplayer does it HAVE to be 3 player? I'd like to play this with my gf but none of my friends has a 3DS so id have no other player to play with
truezelda,3a8uiv,SMKM,5,Thu Jun 18 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"There's these..ehm, ""mannequins"" that you can switch to when you're playing on your own. I don't know if you are able to fill gaps with them in multiplayer mode, but it's a possibility I guess? The only thing that would speak against it would be the question who gets to control that third character if you're only two players.   Maybe you two could/should try to just find a third player online tho.     Anyway, I'm really liking how the game looks. The costumes are a pretty funny addition in my opinion (Link in Zelda's clothes killed me) and if they're changing up how you play the game it's even better. What do you guys think are the chances for something similar to happen in Zelda Wii U? It would be pretty cool if they had several different attires again, that alter Link's abilities ever so slightly. They should, of course, not add anything too goofy like the dress or the pajamas (god..I love how those and the other costumes in Triforce Heroes look :D )"
truezelda,3a8uiv,Tsurii897,3,Thu Jun 18 05:04:00 2015 UTC,I suppose.   Hopefully the mannequins thing works online.   I already know I'd control the third character. She's admittedly not very good at playing games but I'd still love to play this with her as its my favorite video game series of all time :) plus she sort of likes Zelda I think (we play Hyrule Warriors together from time to time)
truezelda,3a8uiv,SMKM,3,Thu Jun 18 05:10:40 2015 UTC,Its one OR three players I think.
truezelda,3a8uiv,SMKM,3,Thu Jun 18 12:21:59 2015 UTC,It was confirmed in an interview with the developer that you can play with only two players.
truezelda,3a8uiv,robotortoise,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:04:01 2015 UTC,Like just 2 player coop? Or do you mean two OTHER players. (You're wording is a little confusing given the context)
truezelda,3a8uiv,robotortoise,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Two people total with one doppel (nonperson doll Link). EDIT: Seems as though that is only in Coliseum (Arena) mode, I think. May not be the same in story mode."
truezelda,3a8uiv,henryuuk,4,Thu Jun 18 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"OP, you forgot to mention it's in 60 FPS like ALBW was!"
truezelda,3a8uiv,robotortoise,2,Thu Jun 18 07:38:38 2015 UTC,Added it. Forgot to put that since I don't think they actually mentioned it out loud.
truezelda,3a8uiv,Anonymac,2,Thu Jun 18 16:09:32 2015 UTC,"No, they didn't. But if you look at the treehouse vids its obvious.  Oddly enough, the trailer was at 30 FPS...."
truezelda,3a8uiv,atown1z,2,Thu Jun 18 16:50:35 2015 UTC,It's to get that more cinematic experience offcourse !
truezelda,3a8uiv,xwatchmanx,2,Fri Jun 19 05:35:14 2015 UTC,"I know you're joking now,  but it really IS odd how the trailer was in 30 FPS. The StarFox Zero and Metroid Prime Fed Force trailer was at 30, too.  Which is odd because other trailers, like the Super Mario Maker and the Mario Tennis Mega Mushroom Edition and previous Nintendo trailers were at 60 FPS....  Some videos editor just got lazy, I think."
truezelda,3a8uiv,LyfeBlades,4,Fri Jun 19 05:40:17 2015 UTC,"Players don't share the magic bar. It is separate for each player and is used for all items, like Link Between Worlds (which Triforce Heroes uses for base mechanics), and recharges slowly when not in use"
truezelda,3a8uiv,LyfeBlades,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:13:58 2015 UTC,"Huh, I thought they mentioned it being shared. I'll edit that. Makes sense though, I could imagine it getting really annoying waiting for it to recharge because of other players."
truezelda,3a8uiv,henryuuk,2,Thu Jun 18 12:21:23 2015 UTC,"I really like how it seems that the outfit mechanic is sort of a buff system like the armor in Splatoon. So, you can wear what you want, and you don't actually need them to complete a dungeon.  Also, was there any word on a general estimated length of the game? Will there only be a small set of dungeons and that's it? Could it have dungeons that can be generated post story completion that would allow you to play dungeons that at least have a different layout?"
truezelda,3a69j0,RetroTrigger,2,Wed Jun 17 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic. Don't suppose there's a way to dismiss those text boxes, is there? Maybe a work for an emulator rather than a gameplay video, but the voice acting is good enough that you don't really need ""subtitles."""
truezelda,3a69j0,TRB1783,2,Wed Jun 17 18:43:45 2015 UTC,Boy do I wish. I took out the game audio just so I could have seemless scene transitions with no tear in the music xD. Sadly there really aren't any emulators for Wind Waker HD.
truezelda,3a69j0,DangTaylor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic! I've thought of trying something like this myself actually. It's great to show others the potential of the series if they added voices.  I think you did a pretty decent job with the voice acting. Its challenging when the timed cutscenes create awkward silences (like when Aryll goes to find link,) but gets a lot better when you had more control over the timing (like when he was talking to the pig woman.)  You should cross-post this on some other subreddits to get it some more traffic. r/zelda, r/nintendo, r/voiceacting, r/machinima, heck, even r/gaming."
truezelda,3a25eh,watties12,18,Tue Jun 16 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"Looks really cool!  I like the concept of three people fighting to be proven as the Hero.  It seems like it will probably be a spinoff, but maybe not.  In any case, should be a good buffer between now and Zelda U.  (It does make me think Early 2016 is a bit optimistic for Zelda U at this point, as a result of that.)"

I understand people are disappointed by nintendo's e3 but by looking at the gameplay this looks a genuinely fun zelda game. It might not be groundbreaking like Zelda U is hyping up to be, but it's got multiplayer and local play and some interesting mechanics and just looks like a fun and a bit different zelda game. I wasn't expecting anything zelda at e3 to be honest and a four swords-esque game with online multiplayer seems cool. I'll pick it up, I reckon it'll be a solid 8/10."

truezelda,3a25eh,Serbaayuu,10,Tue Jun 16 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"No they won't. They're exactly the same as the lot on GAF who were saying ""they haven't shown StarFox, therefore it cannot have a 2015 release"", and ""they haven't shown much Zelda, it can't be far in development"". I haven't seen very much of the new Star Wars film, so by that logic it can't be releasing in December."
truezelda,3a25eh,Phoxxent,2,Tue Jun 16 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually having footage will probably make it take even longer to make."

truezelda,3a25eh,bryanvickersband,4,Wed Jun 17 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"Games aren't finished before they're tested, it's all part of the process.  I don't have any real-world experience with this sort of thing, but generally for a 5-year game it'd go something like:  Year 1: Design work, get publisher, get funding, etc.  Flesh out a concept, get a working demo basically with some of the important features.  Year 2: Build more features, get the design complete.  After this you're working toward a final goal.  You probably have a playable pre-alpha at this point missing a lot of details.  Year 3: After the pre-alpha where all the mechanics work is where you would start adding the major details, the serious art style, characters, etc.  Some developers might integrate this throughout the process depending on their skill level and dedication to artwork.  Year 4: Still alpha but getting there.  Bugs are getting ironed out.  QA testers work every day to find more stuff.  Content is still getting finished.  The game is incomplete but there are a few places where if you blocked off the rest of the game it'd seem finished.  By the end of this you have your content mostly done and you're basically in beta.  Year 5: Polish forever.  Crack down on every bug you can find, make the game shine, finish any leftover content, make any last-minute design changes (hopefully there aren't many).  Here's where feature creep can kill a game.  Once the game is polished you go gold, spend a few months in manufacturing and then it goes out.  That's VERY simplified but overall I guess the point is a dev waiting to release a game unless they're going for a really specific hype date (11/11/11) is rare.  Games get released when they are done - and usually before they're done!"
truezelda,3a25eh,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 17 00:18:05 2015 UTC,Games aren't finished before they're tested   Microsoft is calling

truezelda,3a25eh,Epicfaillord,9,Thu Jun 18 03:07:06 2015 UTC,I am avoiding most of the nintendo related subs for this reasons. I understand the gloom in Metroid an AC communities but we all knew Zelda U was a no show so I do not get that one.   This was completely unexpected. The demo played by the Treehouse guys sold me on it. Online multiplayer yes.
truezelda,3a25eh,love_the_octopus,6,Tue Jun 16 21:39:59 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for the developers of those games (Zelda, Metroid and AC) tbh...  Yeah, it's not what most of us would've expected, I'm pretty letdown by AC myself, because I'm part of the crowd that prefers playing the games at home and would've loved to see a main series game on Wii U, but people are so f***ing hostile towards Nintendo atm...it's awful.   Metroid and the Zelda game look like great additions to each series in my opinion: that Prime spin-off is probably going to FINALLY flesh Metroid's universe more out outside of some notes about civilisations that died off centuries ago and Triforce uhm.. Heroes(?) looks like a genuinely fun multiplayer game and the previews/impressions, I've seen all point towards a decently challenging game that really relies on cooperation between players. It's a great evolution of the 4 Swords formula.   The best thing one can do right now is staying the hell off certain subs on reddit and a lot of the forums and stick to the places where people are actually able to talk about these games without jumping at each other's throats."
truezelda,3a25eh,Tsurii897,3,Wed Jun 17 12:50:35 2015 UTC,"The AC I can actually understand, because they both are rather dissappointing. But the single player of the new Prime spin-off seems fun, and will give some nice exposition on the world of metroid outside of Samus. It also looks to have a Monster Hunter type gameplay structure to it, based on the Treehouse showcase of it."
truezelda,3a25eh,Phoxxent,3,Wed Jun 17 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I tought the same. It's not a Metroid game... but rather a new game on the Metroid universe.  And the Zelda game looks so good to play with friends, even online... I do not get the people that are pissed off about no Zelda U. They said MONTHS ago that Zelda U was not going to be there. Some people have told me that everyone expected that not to be true. I still do not understand."
truezelda,3a25eh,love_the_octopus,3,Wed Jun 17 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"But in my mind those mean the same thing, just like ""Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland"" is a Zelda game."
truezelda,3a25eh,Phoxxent,2,Wed Jun 17 00:16:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe I should check that out. I'm not sold on it yet, though I'm trying to be optimistic. Any word on what online gameplay will be like? It looks too complex to do without voice chat, and I'm certainly not confident that will be in there. Maybe it will have single-copy local multiplayer, but I'm not going to hold my breath."
truezelda,3a25eh,nickc122,3,Tue Jun 16 22:43:30 2015 UTC,"You're problem is you are on r/Zelda. r/truezelda is sooooo much better, but even they overanalyze and get irritating. In really, if you are a hardcore fan of anything (like you wear Zelda shirts, draw Zelda all day), you have a higher chance of being irritating and narrow minded."
truezelda,3a25eh,squeezyphresh,12,Tue Jun 16 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"I find it's the mid-rangers that get annoyed at everything.   The causals don't care.  The hard core embrace most things and spend 10 years figuring out where every detail fits into canon.   The mid-range fans cry and bitch about every new addition and claim it has ruined the series forever, except that occasional game where they all circle jerk over until they invariably get something in their eyes and then they cry and bitch about it and claim it has ruined everything forever.   Not just zelda, I think I've seen this pattern in most series fandoms."
truezelda,3a25eh,NeuroCavalry,3,Tue Jun 16 23:38:49 2015 UTC,"Really? I definitely consider myself a mid ranger and I'm open to most ideas and I can't think of a time in the past few years where I've been that complacent. For example, when Hyrule Warriors was announced, the only people I heard complaining were the hardcore fan base that breathed Zelda. Dark Souls 2 bitchers were hardcore DeS and DaS fans. Nuts 'n' Bolts flamers were hardcore BK fans. I feel like mid rangers don't really care until they play the game or hear reviews. Hardcore gamers complain before, play the game, complain that Wolf Link isn't within the spirit of Zelda, then continue to cite why OoT is the best game and nothing will ever beat it (prime example, /r/zelda). That's just what I've seen."
truezelda,3a25eh,squeezyphresh,2,Tue Jun 16 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we may have completely different conditions for 'mid-/hard-core,' Tis not a perfect science.  I've tended to notice you get storm of fighting and arguing,  and within that there are usually a group of people who adore the series in every respect and immediately set to work on putting into canon.  Maybe different strains of hardcore?   It's not like it really matters anyway, just an observation."
truezelda,3a25eh,NeuroCavalry,4,Tue Jun 16 23:55:22 2015 UTC,"True. I used to think I was hardcore, but then I went to college and learned about the existence of clubs where people took things way too seriously and then LoL became a sport. That was when I decided I wasnt hardcore."
truezelda,3a25eh,squeezyphresh,2,Wed Jun 17 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"We must have different definitions of ""hardcore"". Almost any ""hardcore"" zelda fan would easily tell you OoT is overrated (but still a good game).  I loved the shit out of Hyrule Warriors. Wolf Link was an interesting choice, but it's not like it's ""not within the spirit of Zelda"" or some shit. TP was hype as hell. Kind of fell flat while playing through it at times, but it was all good."

truezelda,3a25eh,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:36:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah!  /r/zelda was driving me nuts yesterday.  I mean, we didn't expect anything.  I wasn't expecting any new Zelda for like a year.  Now I get this to hold me over for Zelda U :)    It's not like they're not gonna make Zelda U.  It'll be here eventually.  And now we get this, too!  It looks fun, it looks different, we haven't seen a multiplayer in a long time (and the 3DS is perfect for that).  I love big, epic consul games as much as the next guy.  But man, I love just chilling out on the couch or on my bed for a bit with my dog next to me playing some handheld Zelda.  It's relaxing, it's simple (most of the time haha), it's just fun.  I hate that people are so jaded these days that the announcement of a new Zelda game is met with such hostility."
truezelda,3a25eh,Indosay,2,Wed Jun 17 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"Nah man.  If you believe the people talking about Metroid: Federation Force (who signed a petition to get it cancelled!!!), Triforce Heroes means they stopped working on Zelda U to give us a spinoff instead."

I LOVED the Link Between Worlds game and this looks like the same sort of style but with new gameplay mechanics. What more could we ask for with a 3DS zelda game? Can't wait for it :)
truezelda,3a25eh,RapedByKesha,2,Wed Jun 17 05:09:06 2015 UTC,"It's not my kind of game and most definitely not what Zelda should be. Zelda is a single player experience.  Four Swords was immensely difficult to even play due to the setup requirements and barrier of entry.  This game, even though it's online, isn't feasible, because Nintendo doesn't allow communication between players. That's asinine."

truezelda,3a25eh,NeuroCavalry,3,Tue Jun 16 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it'd be the old one (especially multiplayer needing all the people it can get).   But, I don't think it's confirmed yet so don't take my word for it"
truezelda,3a25eh,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Jun 16 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"There probably will not be very many games at all that require the New 3DS, much like the old DSi only had a handful of exclusive games.  I could see Hyrule Warriors needing the New 3DS, considering it already makes the Wii U lag, but since they didn't mention it during the announcement I'm initially skeptical of that.  For most any of the games coming out until the 3DS gets replaced with the next generation handheld, your old 3DS will be fine (by the by, the New 3DS is superb, although the outsides are glossy and hard to hold so if you already have a matte XL then maybe don't bother so much)."
truezelda,3a1c3h,cnskatefool,4,Tue Jun 16 13:32:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like the new Zelda to use items for more than one function, almost kind of in the spirit of this. In most Zelda's you are given a huge hint when to use an item (an unlit torch? I should use the lamp/fire arrow!). I'd like to use the fire arrow to light a torch but then turn sand into glass a few levels down the road, or maybe within the same dungeon. That way you have to think through puzzles more rather than pretty much knowing how to use the items for the rest of the game after using it for the first time."

truezelda,39sbqx,henryuuk,10,Fri Jun 19 08:30:32 2015 UTC,"Goth's fight isn't shortened by the eye... The only difference is that isntead of hitting ANY place, you now need to hit the eye specicially.    And while the goth fight didn't need a change, the other 3 boss fights were GREATLY enhanced in the 3D version, as Odolowa, Gyorg and Twinmold were all really boring and bad boss fights.    The 'blantant weakpoint' does nothing but change where you are attacking when they are down from 'anywhere' to one specific spot.    And yes, all 4 mask bosses have the eye popping out"
truezelda,39sbqx,gamerpenguin,3,Sun Jun 14 10:23:08 2015 UTC,"One interesting thing about Goht is you could either jump and hit his eye from above, or spike into his legs until he falls."

It doesn't really change anything about the battle itself, you're just attacking the eye, and not the whole boss when you deal the damage. I think  that the eyes were more intended to relate the bosses to Majora's Mask, which has the same eyes. With or without the eyes, the boss fights would still be the same."
truezelda,39sbqx,noopenusernames,-9,Sun Jun 14 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"Am I missing something?

truezelda,39ldc1,Dismas423,8,Fri Jun 12 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"Solid.  So, do you think he's a Hero?  Minor spoilers: there was a Zelda (possibly a Hylia) at the time, too.  Twilight Princess gave us precedent for past Heroes appearing as ghosts, so that would be neat."
truezelda,39ldc1,Serbaayuu,6,Fri Jun 12 15:48:29 2015 UTC,"He pretty much has to be a Hero. He gets a heroic title the same way Link did in OoT and WW. MC's backstory fits Demise's Curse pretty well, with there being a hero and a princess fighting some evil force. The only evidence against him being a Hero is that he doesn't wear a hat, but I don't think it's written anywhere that the Hero is required to wear a specific costume. ST Link can ditch the hero's clothes for his engineer uniform, and Link spends the entirety of WW's hero mode in his pajamas. As the name implies, the Hero of Men is a Hero."
truezelda,39ldc1,Serbaayuu,3,Fri Jun 12 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement with you.  I've theorized relatively recently that there must have been some sort of leader of the evil forces during the War of the Bound Chest, who was probably sealed along with the rest.  That would end up giving the Hero of Man a Demise Incarnation, as well as making it so that Vaati absorbed a revived Incarnation rather than being one himself."
truezelda,39ldc1,Phoxxent,3,Fri Jun 12 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that the spirit in the bound chest collectively were the incarnation of Demise. Like, the chaos which drives them is that same chaos which Demise sought to sow. Nothing to really support this theory beyond the fact that Demise specifically sent an aspect of himself to torment the hero and goddess instead of, say, his full being/spirit. It would also be supported by the fact that demise can seemingly ""body hop"" when having multiple vessels existing simultaneously."
truezelda,39ldc1,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"That's possible too; I'm kind of hoping we do see a game about the Hero of Man, so maybe we'll get it confirmed one day."
truezelda,39ldc1,henryuuk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I doubt so. We haven't had a single 'backstory event' turn into a game yet. Closest we have come was OoT with the alttp backstory, but those still barely match up."
truezelda,39ldc1,henryuuk,4,Sat Jun 13 00:07:20 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty solid. though the 'only one using the sacred sword' line should probably be checked in the original japense version to make sure it isn't something like 'only a sacred sword wielder can use this'    Aside from that it seems pretty fitting, and would actually be similar to TP's hero shade situation."
truezelda,39ldc1,jesuswig,3,Sat Jun 13 00:09:42 2015 UTC,I like it. We have a big gap from SS to MC and an explicit mention of a hero there. It all fits.

truezelda,39ldc1,LLLLLink,2,Fri Jun 12 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"I imagine they're his descendants. All their names are some sort of variation of ""blade"", and one of them explicitly carries on the name ""Swiftblade"". They're probably part of the same family line that originated with Swiftblade I."

truezelda,39j51z,BlueJoshi,26,Fri Jun 12 05:03:51 2015 UTC,"The ""Spirit of the Hero"" is not a reincarnation like you usually think of it -- like Avatar.  Specifically, it is not a ghost or soul that gets moved between bodies.  There is some evidence for this:   In Twilight Princess, we meet the shade of the Hero of Time.  It shouldn't be reasonably possible for a previous Hero to still have a ghost hanging around when a new Hero is born if they are one and the same soul. In A Link Between Worlds, Gramps is heavily implied to be a still-living Hero, probably the one who sealed Ganon before the events of that game (between LA and ALBW).  There can be more than one Hero alive at once, which means they do not share a soul.   The ""Spirit of the Hero"" is more of a set of personality traits, with which a person is fated to be born when that type of person is needed.  The intense courage, will to do good, sacrifice for loved ones, and so on.  It does not need to be a ghost.  The Hero of Winds is not literally the Hero of Time, etc.   then why did the Gods flood Hyrule?   Because the Hero of that era failed.  During the time of the Great Flood, Hyrule worshiped the Hero of Time.  We also know for a fact that they had no idea how his ""time travel"" worked (it's less time travel and more of a coma).  They thought the Hero of Time, specifically, would come rescue them.  They had no idea about the Hero's incarnation cycle.  So, imagine you are in Hyrule during this era, and a boy appears who seems heroic.  The Sages or the King or Zelda or whomever else try to find out if he's the Hero of Time, of course!  But he's not related to the Hero of Time in any way.  So they ignore him.  And, left without the aid he usually gets, he fails to defeat Ganon before the Flood is enacted.  The manga in the Hyrule Historia describes the events surrounding Demise and Hylia's war.  At the end, Hylia curses herself and the Hero to be reborn eternally whenever Hyrule is in danger.  This is the reason they reincarnate (for they would have no reason to do so otherwise).  Coupled with Demise's Curse, which states that he will appear whenever those two do, we are left with an infinite loop of fate, where Demise's Hatred is incarnated because the Hero and Goddess are being born because Demise's Hatred is going to put Hyrule in danger.  Since Hyrule was in danger during the era of the Flood, it is an absolute requirement that a Hero was present at that time.   I guess they had to wait for a New Link to be born?   Also, seriously, this is one of the top reasons I am adamant on my theory.  If we actually believe that some set of gods flooded Hyrule (and not King Daphnes as the game implies later), it would be RIDICULOUS that they did that instead of just zapping a Hero into existence.  I am pretty sure genocide-by-flood breaks more rules than making one person appear out of nowhere.  The idea that the Hero's Reincarnation stopped just because one of them left the timeline, but in a few thousand years it recharged (???) is so stupid.  Also, inb4 ""getting the Courage turned him into a Hero"", because that has not been a requirement for a single Hero otherwise, including the ones who never touch the Triforce.  And also the Triforce is a neutral entity that does not care who touches it, so why would it suddenly turn a random boy into the One True Hero just for finding it?"
truezelda,39j51z,Serbaayuu,8,Fri Jun 12 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want to address most of your post.  I have no real input that I would like to voice, but your first line is kind of funny.   The ""Spirit of the Hero"" is not a reincarnation like you usually think of it -- like Avatar. Specifically, it is not a ghost or soul that gets moved between bodies.   That's not how it works in Avatar, either.  (Major Korra spoilers below) The avatar spirit is a powerful spirit of light and harmony that became sort of symbiotically linked to a human host.  When the original host died, the spirit latched itself on to a newborn soul.  The first Avatar was not born as the Avatar, and a person can cease to be the avatar by having that spirit removed.  This is, incidentally, why current Avatars can talk to past Avatars: The past Avatars actually exist, in the Spirit World or wherever, as separate people/souls.  It's actually rather similar in nature to how the Slayer is passed along in Buffy, save that the Avatar spirit is always passed onto a newborn, while the Slayer mantle isn't.  I get the feeling if you bothered to mention Avatar, you've already seen the stuff that tells you everything I just said.  Which kind of makes me wonder why you used that as your example."
truezelda,39j51z,BlueJoshi,3,Fri Jun 12 04:59:36 2015 UTC,"You know, I actually sort of forgot about Raava when I was typing that.  I always just jump to Avatar as the go-to for traditional reincarnation examples where you can actually experience your past lives, but you're correct.  But as far as we know, Raava is the entity who contains all the souls of the previous Avatars; the fact that we see none of them in the Spirit World wandering around suggests that they don't exist outside of her (and why would they, humans don't go to the Spirit World when they die).  So even though the spirits are contained inside another spirit it's still a similar sort of reincarnation where there is a single ""ghost"" that switches bodies."

And also the Triforce is a neutral entity that does not care who touches it, so why would it suddenly turn a random boy into the One True Hero just for finding it?   I agree that getting the Triforce is not a requirement to becoming the Hero, but let's consider that whole part of Wind Waker. Basically, when Link reunited the stones with the fairy statues, he was able to bring up the Tower of the Gods, but he had to go through the Tower to prove himself worthy to the Gods, at which point they opened up a path for him down to Hyrule Kingdom. I always saw this as WW Link not being the Hero, but becoming the Hero through the course of the game. Even some of the dialogue between King of Red Lions and Jabun and Valoo implies that Link is not really the Hero. Furthermore, when Link returns to the surface, he can't even get back down to Hyrule Kingdom a 2nd time until he assembles the Triforce of Courage, proving that he is the Hero. I agree that having the Triforce physically is not a requirement for being the Hero, but in WW Link's case, it was."

Problem: the King, Valoo, and Jabun do not know shit about the reincarnation cycle.  There is absolutely no way they would have ANY idea how it works!  The Hyruleans during the Flood were not waiting for the new Hero - they were waiting for the Hero of Time.  They thought he was the only one.  They were wrong, but nobody realized it because they don't have our perspective.   he can't even get back down to Hyrule Kingdom a 2nd time until he assembles the Triforce of Courage, proving that he is the Hero.   Since when does 'being the Hero' open portals?  We have an enormous precedent for portals being opened and sealed with various keys and powers, but none - aside from this alleged one - for portals specifically opening for the Hero.  Why wouldn't the portal simply be sealed until it was the proper time to be open, or when it sensed the divine power of the Triforce of Courage / Tower of the Gods' bell?   I agree that having the Triforce physically is not a requirement for being the Hero, but in WW Link's case, it was.   No, getting the Triforce doesn't magically change your personality.  You need to be the Hero to get the Triforce, not the other way around.  He proved that he was the Hero - and always had been the Hero - by his ability to gain the Triforce."

There is absolutely no way they would have ANY idea how it works!   Whose to say that? The King might have some idea, considering his daughter and his family line are responsible for passing down the stories of the Gods.   The Hyruleans during the Flood were not waiting for the new Hero - they were waiting for the Hero of Time.   A valid point. I will have to replay it again and see what they say about Link in the dialogue. Perhaps they are saying that this Link isn't the Hero of Time.   Since when does 'being the Hero' open portals? We have an enormous precedent for portals being opened and sealed with various keys and powers, but none - aside from this alleged one - for portals specifically opening for the Hero.   What about All the other times Link had to either learn some sort of secret that was only to be given to the worthy, or pass some sort of divine test to prove who he was? Like opening the door in the Temple of Time in OoT, or the dual statue trial to get the Master Sword in TP? Or getting to the Great Palace in AoL? A lot of the ""portals"" we see are mostly man-made to protect something. The builders are not omnipotent, and so they set up these trials so that some random joe can't access them.   No, getting the Triforce doesn't magically change your personality. You need to be the Hero to get the Triforce, not the other way around.   True, but what has WW Link done in all his life that was an example of bravery? Getting up early one day instead of sleeping in? I'm not saying that assembling the Triforce of Courage or making it to the top of the Tower of the Gods in themselves are instant courage-creating acts. It's not like the Gods were like, ""oh you have the Tirforce, therefore you must be brave"". It was the fact that he was willing to undergo those trials in the first place that he learned courage along the way. It's in the journey, not the destination.    Why wouldn't the portal simply be sealed until it was the proper time to be open, or when it sensed the divine power of the Triforce of Courage / Tower of the Gods' bell?   If WW Link was a truly courageous hero to begin with, why didn't the Gods just skip the Tower of the Gods in the first place and just send Link down below the surface. My thing is, true, just reassembling the Triforce of Courage doesn't make you the Hero. However, how can you call WW Link the Hero is he doesn't have the Triforce of Courage to begin with. It's almost a chicken-or-the-egg thing. If Link was the Hero from the start, then how could the Triforce of Courage remain split off somewhere? If Link was the Hero from the beginning, then there shouldn't have even been a section where you have to go reassemble it because he would already have it. The Triforce of Courage would have recognized him and selected him from birth, regardless of the fact that someone in the past had split it up"

Right, trials, which is why ringing the bell at the top of a massive gauntlet is the key for the gate to Hyrule.   what has WW Link done in all his life that was an example of bravery?   Chasing the Helmaroc King.  Going to the Fortress.  Confronting Ganondorf directly, even with a weakened sword.  Entering every single dungeon.  How could you even suggest that he didn't display bravery?   why didn't the Gods just skip the Tower of the Gods in the first place and just send Link down below the surface   Probably because there are no gods directly involved, and the bell at the top of the tower is just a key for a portal.

The Triforce of Courage would have recognized him and selected him from birth, regardless of the fact that someone in the past had split it up   No, that's not how the Triforce works.  It only does that when it gets split, not if it is split.  It's split in ALBW, Zelda 1&2, and Skyward Sword, and Link still has to earn each piece he gets.  The only times he naturally has it are in Ocarina of Time where he gets it for being the most courageous person in the world when Ganondorf split it, and in Twilight Princess (where it was probably passed down through his family much like Tetra had her piece)."

Entering every single dungeon. How could you even suggest that he didn't display bravery?   I don't claim to know what things show true bravery. As far as Helmaroc, are you referring to in the opening of the game? Because that event, as well as facing off against Ganondorf for the first time, isn't necessarily braver. Tetra even says to him that what he was doing wasn't bravery, it was stupidity. Yes, the dungeons require bravery, but who judges who has more bravery? The man on Windfall was willing to pay someone to get his daughter back; if the pirates opted to go breaking in for the ransom, would that have been bravery?   Probably because there are no gods directly involved, and the bell at the top of the tower is just a key for a portal.   If the gods are involved, why didn't they just send Link to the bottom of every temple, get the Master Sword auto-charged, or smite Ganon?  I mean that in the game (if I remember correctly) King of Red Lions tells Link he has to go through the Tower of the Gods to prove himself to them, and then they will open the portal. Now, I know your theory is that the King brought the flood, in which case, perhaps the Tower is just a means to the end for the King; he wants to hear Link ring the bell at the top for his own piece of mind that Link might have what it takes to beat Ganondorf. But If that's the case, then who built it and for what purpose? I doubt the King made it.   No, that's not how the Triforce works. It only does that when it gets split, not if it is split.   I get that, but my concern is this: what if, while Link was roaming around on the high seas, someone else managed to find and assemble all pieces of the Triforce of Courage before Link had a chance to go get them? Perhaps Tingle lies when he translates, then sells the info to the Salvage Team. What would happen if Link is destined to be the Hero, but someone else has managed to find and assemble and claim that piece of the Triforce?"

If mortals caused the Flood, mortals knew Hyrule would be preserved, and they had to prepare for it.   I'm not so sure. I mean, it's pretty complex, in the way that you have to collect the 3 spiritual stones, place them on the right statues, and then the Tower rises up. Thinking about that in a pre-flood world, its like, they would have had to climb up all these mountains to place the statues and invoke some kind of magical properties to them. And then the Tower itself has some sort of magical properties to raise like that. I always got the impressions that the flood was a hasty, last-chance decision, which wouldn't have allowed for the time to even have the foresight for a Tower like that.  Also, do you assume that the King intended for Hyrule Kingdom to be preserved during the flood? I don't kow if it was you or someone else who said that they think the reason Hyrule Kingdom was preserved because the King wasn't powerful enough to flood the kingdom as well. Otherwise, building a Tower like that that allows access to the Kingdom would seem counterproductive if the King intended for the Kingdom to flood as well.   That'd suck for Link! But I don't see why that wouldn't be possible. The Triforce is basically finders keepers, so Link would have to go defeat that hypothetical person.   That's why the whole situation makes me hesitant to think of WW Link as a Hero from the opening; because the Triforce of Courage belongs to no one at the game's start, it's open season for anyone to claim it. I don't see how Link could be the Hero from the beginning while someone else possessed the Tirforce. Granted, the whole 'triforce of courage collection' segment in WW is kind of a filler, but it seems like the consequences of the designers putting that segment in is questions like this. I don't think it's that outrageous to suggest that Link isn't initially a hero. He enters dungeons, yes, but technically the Ruto enter the volcano as a rite of passage to get their wings, which is pretty much the same bravery Link has to display going through there. Only, the Ruto don't have to fight the boss at the end, and probably a few less moblins than usual. I'd suggest that it's the culmination of all the things that WW Link does throughout the game that shows he is the true Hero, and all those things bring him to the point where he is able to collect the Triforce pieces and truly become the Hero. That's just my take on it, anyway."

That's another thing I'm really not sure about.  We have minimal evidence in either direction, what evidence we do have could go either way.  It could even be a mix of both - he wanted to flood it, but wasn't powerful enough, so he made a plan to allow someone to save Hyrule in the future (it was probably his intent, in that case, to reopen Hyrule, but seeing Ganondorf again changed his mind at the end).   I don't see how Link could be the Hero from the beginning while someone else possessed the Tirforce.   Some weird dwarf possesses the Triforce of Courage in AoL.  Ganon possesses the entire Triforce in ALttP.  Several incarnations of the Hero never touch the Triforce.   all those things bring him to the point where he is able to collect the Triforce pieces and truly become the Hero.

I think by the end of the game, the King realizes that this dream is unrealistic and unfair, and thats part of why he decides to finally flood the kingdom and stay behind. I think he realizes that he was no different from Ganondorf in that he was living in the past, and that it was better if Hyrule kingdom washed away and the land started over.

So while they share the same 'role' in the grand game of fate, they are different people.

truezelda,39j51z,Gunnman369,2,Sun Jun 14 12:29:49 2015 UTC,"My theory is that when Link is sent back in time to be a child, the Triforce breaks into the eight pieces in this universe, and the Spirit of the Hero is sent into the child timeline which becomes an alternate universe. From there, there is no hero that is born when Hyrule is flooded (If you look at the Hyrule Historia, it calls the era where Hyrule is flooded the Era Without a Hero ) because the Spirit of the Hero no longer exists in this universe. That gave Ganondorf free reign to take over, and the Goddesses froze time and flooded Hyrule until someone brave enough to save it was born. They wouldn't have the Spirit of the Hero, but would choose to be the hero anyway. After defeating Ganondorf, I believe that the Goddesses turned WW Link's spirit into the Spirit of the Hero, thus restarting the cycle."

It is something that can be thought of as bestowed upon the given hero, rather than a simple reincarnation. So, since Hyrule needs to have the spirit of the hero, it departed from the hero of time as he left, to stay in Hyrule. It is thus that WW Link becomes the Hero. Or, one could also look at it as the title of the rite by which the hero is chosen by the gods. Gods who may have seen that it was better not to have a hero arise when ganon broke the seal. Gods that would seek to wage a war of attrition against ganon, not in his resources, but in his tactics.

Looking at many reviews when it came out, ST was considered PH done right, and I've only really seen a few people argue that PH is better. Heck, those that argue PH is better I can't remember their reasoning. It was either that they liked having a million and one paths to take to find stuff instead of having everything be definitely in X area (easier time scouring. Yes, that is a good thing, not everything has to take forever and be impossible to do. Some of us have lives outside of the game, or want to actually play through the story, or maybe even enjoy it. Stop trying to make everything tedious as fuck), or that they preferred having to re-do the same floors over and over again as they sit in the safe zones for 5 minutes planning things out because there's a constant timer counting down if you're not in a safe zone."

However, it would also allow you to salvage where the X isn't, and sometimes you would get nice little rewards for it. So yeah. And don't get me started on the fishing. Not the act itself, no, that was easy, but the whole business of getting within range of the fish. That was impossible."

truezelda,39eixg,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jun 11 06:36:01 2015 UTC,I sold it years ago becaus I needed money not because I dident like the game by the way
truezelda,39eixg,jevmorgan,-6,Thu Jun 11 06:37:04 2015 UTC,"Speaking from an objective standpoint, the gameplay, story, and everything that makes Zelda games unique are all highly lacking in both games. Most of that is due to the style of game they tried to make, as none of these problems exist in either the previous game on GBA (Minish Cap) or the next on 3DS (Link Between Worlds). Besides some of the boss battles, everything else was really terrible, even if you are patient and enjoy the music."
truezelda,397jp0,TheThoughtAssassin,8,Tue Jun 9 20:42:05 2015 UTC,"Cool critique! I really appreciate this.  I think most of the similarities between TLoZ and Tolkien's world are prevalent simply because of the nature of mythologies. A pantheon of gods and the idea of ordering chaos are all something most mythologies have in common. Ancient Near Eastern mythologies (or religions, rather), Norse mythology, even Far East mythologies are all similar in this respect."
truezelda,397jp0,bddiddy,4,Tue Jun 9 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"I don't see Demise as being on par with the Golden Goddesses. To me it seems like he was the equal and opposite of Hylia, who was a step down from the Goddesses. If there is any hierarchy of the deities in Zelda, I think Hylia and Demise occupy a middle section below the Goddesses but above Guardian Spirits like the Deku Tree and Jabu-Jabu. I'm not familiar enough with The Silmarillion to know how that view would fit in with your theory, but that's how I interpret things."
truezelda,397jp0,Dismas423,2,Tue Jun 9 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had some trouble fitting him I'm perfectly. In order to fit with the parallel with Melkor, though, I saw it best to fit him in there. I also can't explain his existence perfectly; who, or what, created him?"
truezelda,397jp0,Dismas423,3,Tue Jun 9 23:02:12 2015 UTC,"who, or what, created him?   That's a really interesting question with no definitive answer. I subscribe to the theory that he's the Lorule equivalent of Hylia. He has the emblem of the Lorule Triforce on his sword and he comes from a fissure in the earth, similar to the dimension cracks in ALBW. Hyrule-Lorule equivalents are usually opposite in terms of personality, and Hylia and Demise fit that pattern pretty well. This would also make Ghirahim the equivalent of Fi, and they also fit the pattern of opposite personalities. In this scenario Demise is a creation of the gods of Lorule, but we don't know who they are or what their purpose for creating Demise would have been."
truezelda,397jp0,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Jun 9 23:22:36 2015 UTC,"Hylia, who was a step down from the Goddesses   Is there any significant reason to believe this?  As far as I know, there is no definitive evidence either way as to Hylia's power level in comparison to the Old Gods.  She could even be one of them."
truezelda,397jp0,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Jun 10 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I would say based on the fact that she was given a task by the Goddesses, and that she eventually became mortal. It may just be me, but this implied a sort of hierarchy."
truezelda,397jp0,Dismas423,2,Wed Jun 10 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"She turned herself mortal.  And working under orders != inferior.  I'm not arguing it impossible or even unlikely, I just don't think it's possible for us to actually make assertions on it."
truezelda,397jp0,sarkasticassassin,3,Wed Jun 10 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply she was inferior, but was a subordinate to the Golden Goddesses. They are the ones worshiped as the creators of the world, and the ones who left the world the Triforce. I think this is enough to put them on a slightly higher plane then Hylia, who is still quite powerful."
truezelda,397jp0,Phoxxent,3,Wed Jun 10 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's the impression I got from playing the game. The three Goddesses are the ones credited with creating and the world and leaving the Triforce, but Hylia is never mentioned as having a role in these events. She doesn't have her own part of the Triforce like the Goddesses do. The fact that the Goddesses instructed her to watch over the Triforce indicates to me that she was subservient to them. She had no role in creation, but she's acting under the Goddesses' orders to watch over the world in their absence."
truezelda,397jp0,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Jun 10 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love the parallels, I never thought to compare these two awesome universes.  That would be exciting to find out there is a higher deity above the golden goddesses in a later game (Zelda WiiU maybe?)  Why even mention Christianity, though? I didn't understand that part, and it didn't seem like you expanded on it much."
truezelda,397jp0,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jun 9 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that. Tolkien based a lot of his mythology on Christianity, specifically Catholic dogma. Melkor, for example, is a pretty blatant expy of Lucifer/Satan."
truezelda,397jp0,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jun 9 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that deity isn't another frog, though."
truezelda,397jp0,henryuuk,3,Wed Jun 10 03:25:38 2015 UTC,Those are cool parallels.  I am still going to stick with the idea that the Golden Goddesses aren't real.
truezelda,397jp0,sugar_free_haribo,5,Tue Jun 9 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting interpretation, but I tried to base my theory on what's been established as canon (the goddesses exist) and just tried to fill the gaps using the parallels."
truezelda,38vawh,GiantX,11,Sun Jun 7 03:20:20 2015 UTC,"For one, there is the bullet timeline mechanic seen in the E3 2014 debut and the VGA gameplay. Considering the fact that it has been featured in both glimpses of the game we have seen so far (though it wasn't obvious that it was an actual mechanic during the E3 teaser), it will probably be important somehow. I imagine it won't be used just to look cool shooting random Bokoblins in the overworld."
truezelda,38vawh,JCiLee,7,Sun Jun 7 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"I can see the ""bullet time"" mechanic used to solve certain puzzles or to pull off different moves (think of hidden skills from TWP) in order to fight an advanced enemy (ie Dark Nuts)."
truezelda,38vawh,ZachPhrost,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will probably be utilized in more ways than just jumping off of Epona.  Aside from puzzles outright requiring it, hopefully it means a lot of the combat will be challenging enough to make you use it."
truezelda,38vawh,Serbaayuu,4,Sun Jun 7 10:13:10 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting if the bullet time came with a meter, like endurance or magic, so you wouldn't be able to just constantly slow motion-kill enemies."
truezelda,38vawh,adamzissou,2,Sun Jun 7 14:00:07 2015 UTC,"I could see it being similar to the VATS system in fallout where there is a meter, and you can use certain combat abilities with it when you need an advantage over an enemy."
truezelda,38vawh,Surf_Green_Braj,2,Mon Jun 8 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"Very well could be magic based. I don't think the magic meter really moved in that demo they showed us, but that could be a debug thing"
truezelda,38vawh,terraphantm,3,Mon Jun 8 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"I would probably agree. Heck, I'm not even sure if the arrow count moved, and if it did, 100 is still ridiculous for the starting number. It is obvious (or should be obvious) that many things in that demo were the way they were because it was a build for the devs. I don't think I could name you a dev that is going to make the game difficult to test. I'll bet that when testing dark souls they had infinite health and stamina, just so they didn't have to worry about actual skill when they were testing the game."
truezelda,38vawh,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"I just went and checked, it does look like the arrow count moved. It also sort of looked like the magic meter moved the second time he did the bullet time effect, but it's really hard to tell with the low quality video"
truezelda,38vawh,terraphantm,2,Fri Jun 12 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"It probably will either be that or activated by certain triggers, like jumping off Epona."
truezelda,38vawh,Serbaayuu,4,Sun Jun 7 14:04:48 2015 UTC,Could be that parrying also activates it.    Would be interesting if they connected the ability to a 'stopwatch/clock item' That looked like the one in the first game
truezelda,38vawh,henryuuk,5,Sun Jun 7 19:14:31 2015 UTC,We'll probably see the same sort of things we saw in OoT and MM. NPCs and quests dependent on the time of day and a mechanic to switch at will.

truezelda,38vawh,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"Only kind of important. But anyway, when that video was posted on /r/zelda, I wrote a comment on why I think he is wrong and full of shit, mostly having to do with UX and what developers do to make the process easier, such as displaying the in-game clock in order to make the sun/sky cycle look better, set NPC paths, etc. I think we might see a few quests where you have to have the correct time/place to progress, but I think it will be mostly atemporal, like most of the games have been. Also think that the day cycle will be completely irrelevant to the plot, and time in general will be mostly irrelevant, save maybe for a plot twist where someone is from a different time. We will probably be able to sleep in beds to pass time and/or have a song to do so. The beds would give greater control than the song if it is indeed a long cycle."
truezelda,38ohub,epicbriguy10,9,Fri Jun 5 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed SS take on bottled items and the upgrading aspect. I believe, along with item upgrades, it lent to a more custom gameplay experience. You go through all of the same tasks as anyone else when playing the game but it allows for potentially, vastly, different gameplay.  As for collectables, I beg Nintendo to give them their own slots that aren't in bottles. Nothing worse than sitting on a bottle with a quest item in it going into a dungeon, it feels like unnecessarily wasted space."
truezelda,38ohub,GoddessHylia,4,Fri Jun 5 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!   I like how I know exactly what that is.   Skyward Sword's approach   Skyward Sword did a really good job with potions, bottles, and the rest of Link's nonstandard equipment.  Having a variety of items (especially shields!) that you could choose from to fit your playstyle was excellent.  Most of the potions had some decent use, although a few were underused - waterbreathing was only useful in one section, and stamina was really only handy for the horde (although it was also used in a sidequest which was nice!).  Off the top of my head, a few potions that might be extremely useful in Zelda U:   Healing - it would be cool to see the upgrading potion system from Skyward Sword return instead of the usual tiered red/blue potions. Magic Restore - pretty sure we saw a magic meter in the demo. Shield Repair - (gods, I hope SS shields are back in this game) Damage Boost - assuming combat is actually remotely challenging. Defense Boost Run Speed - being able to move fast off of Epona would be excellent. Timeshift Boost - this is on the assumption that the bullet time mechanic we saw is going to be a core mechanic of the game.  It might be good to have a potion that slows down things even further to make it easier to get your hits in.   Couple all of those with fairies and you've got a good bottle arsenal."
truezelda,38ohub,Serbaayuu,4,Fri Jun 5 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"To add to your list, I think that regenerative potions would be nice. A potion that regenerates health for a minute, or does the same with magic. Both would be nice mid tiers between the infinite/invulnerable potions and the regular restoration potions. I also think that maybe some sort of consumable augment for a period of unlimited bombs/arrows/whatever would be nice. Not sure if a potion would make sense, but whatever."
truezelda,38ohub,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"Agree with this... I think the run speed one might almost be a necessity, based on the size of the map. Also I'd like to see a ""hunting"" type one, which heightens your senses and leads you towards secrets somehow. Plus, some kind of sailcloth potion could be cool. I don't know how it'd work or what it'd do but it could be sweet. A bit like WW used the magic meter; I guess there could be an upgraded magic sailcloth instead. Maybe you'd go faster or just catch more air.... Plus a swimming one would be nice. This could enable more water-based exploration before perhaps having a water tunic.  Yeah. All of those could probably lead to super mega glitches too."
truezelda,38ohub,dat_face,3,Fri Jun 5 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"you know what would be cool? making your own potions. collecting various items that can help you in different ways, like the SS potions, but going to a local witch that can brew up a potion according to your ""recipe"". maybe 10 seconds of invincibility per sip and golden gauntlets strength?   I would never want fairies to go away though. I like having that one fairy in one of my bottles I forget about until Link collapses."
truezelda,38ohub,infinitydefines,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"When you said ""Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" I was expecting this.  And you know what bothered me about Skyward Sword potions? I got some really nice upgraded health potions, like three of them, and then I went to Eldin Volcano for the third time, and they stole all my stuff! Including the potions! Which I never got back, and did not have enough ingredients to make more of. So I suppose I'd be okay with Skyward Sword's upgradable potions as long as they don't steal them from me. And if the ingredients are more common. I found bug hunting a little tedious."

truezelda,38jgkx,Cinnfhaelidh,13,Sat Jun 6 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"Four Swords Adventures for me. It's actually in my top 5 games ever made, which seems like a pretty blasphemous statement wherever I roam (even just putting it in the top 5 Zelda's gets me tons of shit).   I loved how the game brought back the style of A Link to the Past, my actual favorite game ever made. It added in the 4 Link's mechanic to shake things up, has a new way of moving through the game. It's extremely straight forward, and means missing the overworld exploration and coming back to characters and whatnot, but for this game I felt it knew what it wanted to do and it did it extremely well, but unfortunately its ambition and association with the more simple 2002 Four Swords caused people to look at it in a less serious manner. But, it still had pretty great world design, the town areas were cool, the dungeons were well designed, I like the way the world proresses, etc.  One sort of controversial thing about the game was a lack of an inventory, and rather picking up items on the go. I sympathize with this argument, but after Twilight Princess and some of the more straight forward titles I really appreciated it. The reason for this is that you constantly have to explore and see what to do, and you have a choice of multiple items that you have to choose from. You may be wrong. It encourages using all of your items throughout the game on multiple occasions and in multiple places, instead of getting an item in a dungeon, using it only there and calling it a day for the rest of the game. I watched a video of someone being annoyed that you could select the wrong item, which again I can sort of sympathize with, but it adds complexities in moving forward, making the right call, knowing what item to use, keeping every item relevant, keeping track of places in the dungeon etc. As much as it does have issues associated with it, I thought it was a pretty cool thing for a one-off.   It seems the biggest issue with Four Swords Adventures is how different it is from the other Zelda's, and I think that caused a lot of people to just think of it as some side title that shouldn't be taken seriously. The game has a ton of brilliance in it, and for a one-off, I think it worked extremely well. I can't say I want the Mario style level progression every game, but for this game I can say I'm glad it was there and it worked gloriously.   I love 4SA so much."
truezelda,38jgkx,watties12,4,Thu Jun 4 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"I liked 4SA a lot too. Really hope they make another game (or even just putting it on the Virtual Console on the ds/WiiU would be awesome, with 3DS's as the gba for WiiU, or top screen being the 'tv screen' and bottom screen being the gba, bonus points if they add in some basic online/matchmaking, but I fully accept that that might be asking a bit much)"
truezelda,38jgkx,henryuuk,17,Thu Jun 4 21:13:58 2015 UTC,"i wouldnt say its under rated just now talked about very often but i really like minish cap.   i only bought this game maybe a few months ago and i loved it, i hooked it up using the gamecube and the gameboy player on my old tv.   i cant quite put my finger on why i like this game so much i just thought the feature of turning to normal size to minish was a pretty cool idea and they managed to implement it into the game in a fun way."

truezelda,38jgkx,terminavelocity,2,Thu Jun 4 21:48:26 2015 UTC,Kinstones. You would fuse halves with people in the world.  Edit: there were also shells you could find and gamble for the figurines.
truezelda,38jgkx,CorbinLarryDallas,7,Thu Jun 4 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It's actually one of my favorite games in the series, truth be told. It doesn't really have many elements in common with the other games in the series, but it is a good action platformer/RPG hybrid, and the difficulty isn't nearly as unfair as people make it out to be. I only wish Nintendo would make another game in its style."
truezelda,38jgkx,mr_bigmouth_502,19,Thu Jun 4 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"People shit on Skyward Sword a lot, but I really enjoyed it. It has its fair share of flaws, don't get me wrong, but none of them ruined the game for me. It had probably my favorite use of motion controls by far, and I really liked the dungeons. The over world sucked and it was too slow paced at times though."
truezelda,38jgkx,MarvinGarbanzo,15,Thu Jun 4 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"over world sucked   If you're not referring to the Sky, that's not an overworld.  It's a set of zones - much like the zones outside of Hyrule Field in Ocarina of Time, or in Majora's Mask.  And as zones go, the ones in Skyward Sword are some of the best in the series.  Parts of them are linear, but they also have a lot of loops, shortcuts, wide-open areas, large-scale puzzles, and places you can backtrack to after getting powerups to go further and do new things.  They are, essentially, outdoors dungeons, which is exactly what Miyamoto described wanting the world to be in Skyward Sword.  The Sky is somewhat lackluster, especially compared to the Great Sea, but hey - it's got more to do in it than OoT's Hyrule Field."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,8,Thu Jun 4 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it more you are definitely right, it's just sort of an unorthodox setup. I really think the sky would have benefited from another big island with a city and the surface could have used some connections between regions. Like the graveyard to lake hylia in TP, gerudo to hylia in Oot and Ikana to the swamp in MM. Everything just seems really isolated which I wasn't a big fan of. It doesn't 'suck', it's just a bit underwhelming with a lot more potential imo."
truezelda,38jgkx,MarvinGarbanzo,7,Thu Jun 4 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, the three zones needed passages between them, and the Sky could have used more people.  It would have been cool if there was a second village trapped in the thunderhead or something."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Jun 4 19:41:45 2015 UTC,You should look at the zones as giant dungeons with smaller dungeons within prety much.
truezelda,38jgkx,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"I pretty much do, I just think it would have helped the atmosphere/feel of the world if there was a little passage between areas that you could discover. Gameplay wise it doesn't really matter though."
truezelda,38jgkx,MarvinGarbanzo,6,Thu Jun 4 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"It had probably my favorite use of motion controls by far   My biggest problem, and why I never finished SS was because of how horribly clunky these motion controls were.   When so many enemies and especially bosses revolved around a functional Motion control system, it was awful trying to beat them.   I'd swing Diagonally, and link would swing Vertically.  I'd Swing horizontally and Link would swing Diagonally.  I'd stab, and Link would swing horizontally."
truezelda,38jgkx,Kinomi,4,Thu Jun 4 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"You were doing something wrong, then.  I've probably put about 120 hours into Skyward Sword and I've only had the controls utterly fail on me twice ever.  For the record: I've used different remotes.  I've used different sensor bars (and bar positions).  I've used several different rooms and televisions.  I've sat as far away as 3-4 meters and as close as a couple feet.  None of those things had any effect on the accuracy of my motion controls.  What did have an effect was when I allowed myself to flop onto the couch without properly controlling how I was moving - that would decalibrate it pretty easily, so I just didn't do that when I played.  *You know, some day I'll get a camera and actually record myself playing accurate Skyward Sword in different environments with different tools."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:52:53 2015 UTC,"Like I've said before, some people had issues, and others did not.  You can't simple chalk it all up to everyone 'doing it wrong' when it's such a wide-scale critique.  Even if that many people are doing it 'wrong', such simple commands like 'vertical swing' shouldn't have that much room for error in the first place; this could be seen as a flaw in itself.  A simple command should be... simple, and this was not the case for many.  It's not to say that the game itself is at fault, it's just the basics of what you get with pretty much any computer technology, especially newer, less-tested tech.  You can have two identical rigs, with identical drivers playing identical versions of a game, but one person might have a plethora of issues while the other does not.  It's just a lame part of anything with a million variables behind it.  It's why you can find endless forum posts about ""this isn't working for me"" in any given game or program, while it works for thousands of others under the same conditions.  Miyamoto himself had the same issues that everyone complains about at the E3 gameplay reveal for Skyward Sword.  I would like to imagine that he wasn't going in blind... that he knew how to do it right, but sadly technology like that likes to go wrong even when there is no discernible cause."
truezelda,38jgkx,malaroo,2,Tue Jun 9 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"even when there is no discernible cause.   Well, being on a stage in front of a billion different light sources and flashing bulbs and whatnot would easily affect a remote based heavily on IR."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Jun 9 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but I wasn't on stage when I was playing, nor were the many others who claimed to have issues.  I assure you that I know how to set up a Wiimote and use one, but unfortunately I did not have your success at all times."
truezelda,38jgkx,malaroo,2,Tue Jun 9 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"I refuse to believe that 50% of all Wiimotes in the world just happen to be faulty.  Like I said, I probably intend to just make a video of myself playing Skyward Sword correctly with, like, eight different variables, just to prove myself."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jun 9 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"You do realize you're claiming that a huge portion of gamers simply can't use a Wiimote?  It's not a hard thing to understand, even when you have to be super specific, but as I said that incredibly finicky specificness where anything that isn't 100% right is 100% wrong is a flaw in itself.  A basic command should require a basic input.  At no times should swinging the remote one way result in Link swinging the other way, regardless of the player's aptitude to make specific movements.  So either Wiimote technology tends to be wonky, the controls are far too finicky/picky even when trying to execute basic commands, or a huge chunk of gamers simply can't use the basic functions of a Wiimote.  Now, I don't believe the last one, and if the second is true... well, you shouldn't have to 'master' aspects of control to accomplish the most basic commands. However I damn-sure tried all possible suggestions and solutions, which leads me to believe it's the first one, with maybe a dash of the second playing a part in that."
truezelda,38jgkx,malaroo,2,Tue Jun 9 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"a huge chunk of gamers simply can't use the basic functions of a Wiimote   Eh, people are stupid.  I believe it."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jun 9 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, often times yes, but do you think I'm stupid?  I've been playing games, fixing parts of them that don't work for... 20-25 years.  I can still remember forcing DOS to play games that weren't designed for it. I bought a Wii on release and played the hell out of it during that whole era, because that was the era where the two other console options were laughably bad and focused mostly on 'cinematics' and lowest-common-denominator sales.  It was my primary gaming device for 5 or 6 years before I played Skyward Sword on it, but trust me when I say that nothing I tried to make it more accurate worked.  There was only ever the occasional hour or so where controls would work flawlessly until going back to 'fuck you be more specific' mode, regardless of how specific I was being, which didn't change unless trying other suggested techniques."
truezelda,38jgkx,malaroo,2,Wed Jun 10 06:02:56 2015 UTC,"it was too slow paced at times   Yup. But not just ""at times"", it was one time, one very specific time. The Song of the Hero quest. That was terrible, especially for the Faron and Eldin provinces. If they could have added new areas or mini-dungeons, that would have been one thing, but they didn't."
truezelda,38jgkx,Phoxxent,3,Thu Jun 4 23:28:00 2015 UTC,"Eldin was awesome!  It took all your knowledge of the zone and turned it on its head, made you think differently, made you kind of scared.  Faron was okay."

truezelda,38jgkx,malaroo,13,Tue Jun 9 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"This is really difficult tbh...I don't think any of the games are really underrated. But if I had to name one of the games that tend to get more flak, that I enjoy myself, I'd had to say Phantom Hourglass. I just really love customizing stuff, regardless of what it is, and those little boats in the game were just so charming imo and fun to customize and mix and match sets (I could probably go on about just that aspect for an hour, but I think I will spare you all, on to more important things)   I also immediately fell in love with Linebeck. He's just ridiculously funny to watch in some of the cutscenes and I liked how he developed throughout the game. I think I got about as attached to him as Linebeck to Link by the end of the game and I felt pretty bad when you had to fight him. Something a lot of people seem to dislike, and I really really enjoyed, is the Temple of the Ocean King. At the time it just was something relatively new and unique to me and I liked seeing how good I've become throughout the adventure and trying to figure the best routes through the different floors out. It's honestly something I'd like to see return in Zelda Wii U as some sort of side distraction.   There's more stuff I liked about PH like the music, visiting the different Islands and seeing these different people and creatures and how they live, but the three things I mentioned above are what is, in my opinion, the most unique aspects of Phantom Hourglass and the main reasons why it left a bit of an impression on me back when it was released. (guess I should add that it was my second handheld Zelda after Minish Cap and I think the fact that Linebeck is actually similar to Ezlo helped a lot, too)"
truezelda,38jgkx,Tsurii897,2,Thu Jun 4 18:24:13 2015 UTC,I agree. I really liked the gameplay as well. They truly made the touchscreen a valuable asset.

truezelda,38jgkx,uddictiun,4,Fri Jun 5 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel like the original fits this. I never hear anyone talking about it that much, but it is one of my favorites in the series, though I more prefer various other remakes or prototypes of it, but it itself was really fun too. It ranks above OoT for me because it was so fun, but not for the reasons people generally give it. Crawling dungeons was fun. Going through the world was fun. Finding secrets was not fun, especially the bombable walls. They were 1. lackluster, and 2. darn near impossible to find if it wasn't a bush in the middle of the screen. No, I don't like bombing every inch of every wall (though, it's only the walls that you have to press up to face, since the sprite won't work on other walls) is fun, nor do I think it is good game design. There need to be hints towards it, such as being at a dead end, or having something off about the tile with the secret. But other than that, it is a well constructed game. The dungeons are challenging to navigate (not combat, the actual navigation. The combat is kind of suck), the items are all useful. The boomerang is amazing until the final two dungeons. I kind of wish that there were more games that were like it. Not having my exploration guided is fun, but I do like to have hints towards secrets, like they did some, but not enough."
truezelda,38jgkx,Phoxxent,8,Thu Jun 4 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"Phantom Hourglass is hated by many people I guess..   I really enjoyed it, it was one of the first titles after Twilight Princess I really got into the Zelda games (always liked Zelda games but I didnt do much with it before).  It was short, I got a bit bummed when I already finished it.  I found the puzzles with the map pretty fun.. and going back to the temple wasn't that big deal for me."

The music is actually really well done, and the cut scenes are hilarious. It's always a reward to uncover a new one. The main glaring issue it has is the controller and the controls itself, but I think you can attribute a lot of that to the system. I'm not calling it a good game, but I enjoyed it for what it was."
truezelda,38jgkx,Nickthegreat,5,Thu Jun 4 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"I've never heard anyone say anything good about the CD-i games, interesting! I haven't had the chance to try them out personally, but if I come across it I might give the faces of evil a go based on your assessment!"
truezelda,38jgkx,millapixel,2,Thu Jun 4 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Here is probably my favorite music track in the game. See what I mean? Sounds like it could be something out of Sonic the Hedgehog. If this game weren't on the CD-i, we'd remember some of these songs as classics!"
truezelda,38jgkx,Nickthegreat,2,Thu Jun 4 21:02:06 2015 UTC,I totally see what you mean about it sounding like a Sonic song! The song is actually really good. Shame the game costs so much now.

truezelda,38jgkx,henryuuk,11,Thu Jun 4 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"Spirit Tracks. The dungeons and bosses are all really fun, and I like the items as well. I also like that Zelda is your companion.

truezelda,38jgkx,krimboelf,6,Thu Jun 4 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Temple of the Ocean King as a central dungeon; the Tower of Spirits is more like a series of different dungeons that just happen to be on top of each other.  It did have some good puzzles though.  Other than that, Spirit Tracks is basically Phantom Hourglass+, imo.  And it's got one of the best Zeldas in the entire series."
truezelda,38jgkx,Serbaayuu,6,Thu Jun 4 18:15:43 2015 UTC,That's actually why I prefer the Tower of Spirits. It doesn't feel tedious going back to it again and again.

That said, with the benefit of playing many more Zelda games, it still stands out because it doesn't stick to the tried and true series staples.   We have Link and references to Princess Zelda, but it is a unique world apart from Hyrule. I loved the story and how it tied together the island, the inhabitants and the main quest. For a GameBoy game, the music was fantastic too, even if there were a number of reused tunes sped up or slowed down for different areas.  Ballad of the Wind Fish....  That moment on the beach with Marin...  Learning that succeeding in ridding the island of monsters will result in the island no longer existing....  I was hooked on the game, the series, EVERYTHING from that moment on. It doesn't get the love ALttP or OoT get, but it deserves recognition as an excellent entry in the series, despite being a departure. It is the Majora's Mask of its time."

I'd advice anyone from emulating the game(since NA has no way of playing it normally without importing,a dn even so it is hard to find)    Only thing I'd advise is that you use a guide for some of the haggle prices, because messing them up can set you on a grinding course for a while. it's not very common, but it could burn some people out."

It's also really hard, but in a fun way that keeps you wanting to finish it.

For one, it's made pretty clear that Kakariko was established as an exclusively Sheikah Village, and later on Impa became the leader of the Sheikah and opened the village up to others, giving some poorer Hylians a place to live.  So when would the Gerudos have been thrown out? If it was before Kakariko was founded, then it's unlikely Impa would have been involved. And it makes even less sense for this to have happened after the town was founded, because it was founded as an exclusively Sheikah village... so there wouldn't be Gerudos there to throw out.  I suppose it could be a poor translation, and it really meant that she fought off the Gerudos. Perhaps they invaded Kakariko during the war in which Link's mother was killed. Impa surely would have been around and old enough to fight in that war, and it's possible she drove them back into the desert."

truezelda,38h9b3,henryuuk,5,Thu Jun 4 10:13:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Nintendo used to put stuff out all the time that would create some confusion.

As other users have pointed out, 'thrown out' probably meant defended from an attack on the village. It's quite possible that the Gerudo used to be much more widespread in the land of Hyrule, but the Royal Family cut them down after hearing rumors of a potential great evil? That may have paved the way for Ganondorf's visits to the king through some kind of diplomatic front."

I suppose it's possible that it was sheikah, but then taken by Gerudo. Impa clears them out some time later, and boom. Kinda like hidden village in TP was sheikah but got overrun by bokoblin. However, I will say ""Official"" Zelda stuff is kinda untrustworthy. According to the site, the GG literally let you move mountains, and Ganondorf's lightning balls are laser balls."
truezelda,389njr,apefeet25,18,Tue Jun 2 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible, but I personally find it doubtful. Hyrule Historia suggests that the Hero of Time was related to the Knights of Hyrule rather than the Royal Family, but it doesn't make a definitive statement on his parentage. The fact that Link and Zelda are both Hylian doesn't support the theory, considering that pretty much the entire human population is Hylian in OoT. He could just as easily be Malon's brother as he could Zelda's."

truezelda,387d7z,palimer6,10,Tue Jun 2 11:20:24 2015 UTC,"Very interesting question. Let's see what clues we have of the passage of time between the events of Ocarina of Time and the games that take place after it.  ALttP - The intro states that the events concerning the sealing of the Sacred Realm have been obscured by the mists of time. Not very concrete, but a line of dialogue may refer to the events of OoT:  'Three or four generations ago, an order of knights protected the royalty of the Hylia. These Knights Of Hyrule were also guardians of the Pendant Of Courage. Unfortunately, most of them were destroyed in the great war against evil that took place when the seven wise men created their seal. Among the descendants of the Knights Of Hyrule a hero must appear.""  This might suggest about 100 years between the stories occurring. Though the Book of Mudora containing the 'ancient language of the Hylia' may muddy the matter.  TP - Anouma was quoted around the release of the game stating it takes place roughly 100 years after OoT. This would seem right as relatively little seems to have changed in the setting. The only odd thing would be the green tunic and bow being said to have been used by an ancient hero. At the time this would seem to have been referring to the Hero of Time, but it could as easily now refer to the Link of Skyward Sword.  WW: Anouma is similarly quoted placing Wind Waker 100 years after the events of OoT. Though this is harder to reconcile with the information given in game. The intro states that the tale of the Hero of Time was passed down through generations until it became legend, and this is before the return of Ganon, which necessitates the flooding to begin with. Seeing as the flooded state of the land doesn't seem to have happened in recent history (""What became of that kingdom... ? None remain who know.) It would seem much longer than 100 has passed.   Based on this evidence I can think of, it's unclear which 'order' they take place in, but my intuition would have be guess: TP, ALttP, WW"
truezelda,387d7z,DoubleDipDelish,10,Tue Jun 2 12:50:45 2015 UTC,"Anouma is similarly quoted placing Wind Waker 100 years after the events of OoT.   I think that was Miyamoto, but either way, it's definitely completely wrong.  If it was only a single century between the games, that means that Link's Grandma was alive during the Flood."
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,6,Tue Jun 2 13:13:05 2015 UTC,IIRC Miyamoto is not the biggest advocate of the Zelda timeline. I think he even once said that OoT was placed after aLttP.
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,10,Tue Jun 2 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"He seems like the kind of person who doesn't really think about this sort of thing.  But when some reporter asked ""Hey, how long is it between Wind Waker and Ocarina!?"", rather than just say he didn't know or care, he instead said: ""Uhh, 100 I guess.""  It wasn't a planned question afaik so we shouldn't take it as absolute fact.  Planned interviews are a different thing."
truezelda,387d7z,Phoxxent,2,Tue Jun 2 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"I know he's not a fan of story in games, but I recall even he didn't put OoT after ALttP, as evidenced by the existence of the ""Miyamoto Timeline"", which put OoT first, cementing it's position in lore for years."
truezelda,387d7z,TeekTheReddit,3,Tue Jun 2 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Miyamoto once said LttP took place after LoZ/AoL, but I'm pretty sure even he maintained that OoT was before any of them."
truezelda,387d7z,BlueJoshi,3,Tue Jun 2 15:09:20 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Aonuma said it.  I'm also pretty sure the 100 years part isn't an accurate translation of what he said.
truezelda,387d7z,Arathgo,5,Wed Jun 3 07:34:38 2015 UTC,"I find it extremely hard to believe that WW and TP are only supposed to take place 100 years after OoT. With Twilight Princess I'm almost certain we are to assume that the Sacred Grove is the ruins of what was Castle Town and the second Temple of Time. In the condition it's in I would find it hard to believe only a century has past since it was abandoned on top of however long it took after OoT for them to move from castle town. I would suggest it would have to be at least 250-300 years since it was abandoned.   With Wind Waker enough time would have to have taken place after the flood (However long after OoT that took place) for Hyrule to become legend, based on this I couldn't see it taking place anywhere within 500 years of OoT."
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 3 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, TP is probably a couple centuries after OoT (keep in mind the United States has been around for only a couple centuries... look at some old overgrown stone walls for an idea of the kinds of ruins that timespan should expect)."
truezelda,387d7z,Indosay,2,Thu Jun 4 02:57:40 2015 UTC,"Awesome thinking! Now just one point is missing: in what order do ALBW, FSA, ST and the Original two games take place. My personal theory on that matter would be that first of those would be ALBW as it seems as though not all that much different from aLttP. Next would be ST as there are again presumably 100 years between PH and itself, which might even be slightly less as Niko is definitely alive in New Hyrule. tLoZ and by extension AoL would be last in my view as the land of Hyrule seems very desolate and wild in those, which would suggest a huge gap of nothing but chaos between ALBW and tLoZ. The only one I am not sure with is FSA, but it seems as if even Nintendo is not sure what to do with it in the timeline."
truezelda,387d7z,DoubleDipDelish,6,Tue Jun 2 13:12:10 2015 UTC,"Also, this is why I'd love to see a game take place after AoL.  The land is so changed and so different.  It would be great to see this huge barren land once filled with life and history, but now destroyed.  It would almost be like a LoZ post apocalyptic game, which is weird, but could be very cool.  Exploring the ruins of Hyrule Castle and the Goron kingdom or whatever.  But with new cities and new tribes of people popping up.  Dunno if it would ever actually work as a game, but it'd be kinda fun if done well."
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jun 2 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"There are clues that the character of 'Gramps' in ALBW is actually the protagonist of ALttP. Gramps claims to be 80 years old. If these two facts are true then you have ~65 years between the games.  It is widely assumed that ALBW occurs in the Downfall Timeline. If so, then many generations have to occur before the time of LoZ and AoL, as the AoL backstory concerning the sleeping curse has to occur in this gap.   I don't have my Hyrule Historia at hand, but I seem to remember that the Zelda of Spirit Tracks is the great, great granddaughter of Tetra, so yes, about 100 years.  I can only think of one scrap of evidence to pin down the chronological relationship between Four Swords Adventures and earlier stories. Just that enough time for at least one other Gerudo man to be born since Ganondorf has to have elapsed. (100 years)"
truezelda,387d7z,DoubleDipDelish,6,Tue Jun 2 13:34:57 2015 UTC,"I can't base this on significant evidence, but here's my theory:   Majora's Mask - About 2 years. Twilight Princess - This takes place only a few generations after OoT, it seems, with much of the things from that game being directly relevant. ALttP/OoX/LA - These would be further after Twilight Princess due to the greater loss of knowledge about the events of Ocarina of Time, as well as the fact that the gorons left Hyrule entirely and the zora started to evolve (naturally, I assume, unlike their transformation into the rito).  Of course this ""natural"" evolution is still many magnitudes quicker than actual evolution. ALBW - This should only take place ~100 years or so after ALttP. Wind Waker/Phantom Hourglass & Zelda 1/Adventure of Link - I place these two at about the same point, some thousands of years after Ocarina of Time.  Yes, Wind Waker would be thousands, or close to it.  By the time of the Great Flood, the Hero of Time had become legend, worshiped as a near-mythical figure.  By Wind Waker, the Great Flood had been lost to public knowledge.  That is a VERY long time. Spirit Tracks - Confirmed ~100 years after Wind Waker. Four Swords Adventures - I place this at the end because it could be pretty much anywhere on the Child Timeline and not matter at this point.  So I fully expect them to stuff a whole lot of stuff in between Twilight Princess and this eventually."
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,11,Tue Jun 2 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"To go further in depth regarding Wind Waker's placement, I see on Zelda Wiki that a translation of the gravestone on Windfall Island gives the deceased's lifetime as 831 - 894. While this counting system might not have begun immediately after the flooding, it is logical that it did not begin before it. So yes, no less than 894 years should have passed since the flooding."
truezelda,387d7z,nickc122,5,Tue Jun 2 13:54:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's cool!  I could see about 900 years being somewhat reasonable."
truezelda,387d7z,ThatGreyKid,3,Tue Jun 2 13:59:46 2015 UTC,"There were still a few theories before the Historia was released that tried to put everything on one timeline, though even at that point most people were using at least two. Finding one of those would be your best way to get some idea of the best way to string them together, though it can't be done very well. Even the official timeline has some holes in it as the games, especially the early ones, were not necessarily released with the timeline a priority, so anything else would have far more."
truezelda,387d7z,watties12,3,Tue Jun 2 12:23:27 2015 UTC,"i think aLttP, FSA, and WW all take place around the same time.  aLttP and FSA are pretty easy to see, as the maps, locations, enemies, dungeons, etc. have many similarities.  if this holds true, i think WW also takes place around the same time. it has enemies are very similar to those in FSA. more specifically, i think the helmaroc king and the helmasaur king share a common ancestor, which branched off and became the helmaroc king to adapt to the flooded country. this is supported by the fact that the bosses have the same name in japanese.   also, the zoras of the downfall and child branch both evolve into the hostile river zoras eventually, while the zoras of the adult branch evolve into rito, eliminating the possibility of river zora  with this in mind, i'd like to think that ST and ALBW occur around the same time too. ST is 100 years after phantom hourglass, and the landscape is relatively unchanged in ALBW from aLttP, so i'd say 100 years is a safe gap.  so i'd say: SS, MC, FS, OoT, MM, TP, LttP/FSA/WW, PH/OoX, LA, ALBW/ST, LoZ, AoL"
truezelda,387d7z,TeekTheReddit,2,Tue Jun 2 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Is it theoretically possible that ALttP Link, WW Link, and maybe 4SA Link are the same person then; the same destined individual born three times in different timelines? Obviously TP Link can't be as he's descended from the Hero of Time, but for ALttP and WW he was never in that timeline. If those took place in similar areas, then maybe...   Or maybe I'm just crazy"
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Jun 4 06:44:30 2015 UTC,"I tend to operate under the philosophy that time doesn't like being messed with and will take steps to correct itself where it can.  So if history has decided that Ganon is going to return at a particular time, then it's going to happen whether he's trapped in the Sacred Realm, Underwater Hyrule, or in the Twilight Realm, which would place all the post-OoT games roughly parallel to each other."
truezelda,387d7z,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"So by your theory you've basically got:   ALttP == Twilight Princess == The Great Flood ALBW == ?? == ?? Zelda 1 == FSA == Wind Waker   I realize ALBW could match the other two instead, but I don't think Wind Waker is as close to the Great Flood as ALBW is to ALttP."
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"I've always placed the Great Flood was within the same generation as Ganon's initial sealing. That's what the legend implies.  Sages seal Ganon. Zelda sends Link back in time. Zelda foresees Ganon's escape and, because Link isn't around to stop him, she petitions the gods to flood the world."
truezelda,387d7z,TeekTheReddit,2,Tue Jun 2 23:51:48 2015 UTC,"That doesn't work since the legend specifically states that generations passed between Ganon's imprisonment and his freedom.  Also King Daphnes is a later king, the king in OoT was most likely killed."
truezelda,387d7z,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:57:24 2015 UTC,"Hmmmmmmmmm, then I guess it could take place whenever really. If it doesn't take place immediately after OoT, then along the same era as LttP and Twilight Princess (and LBW :p) would be the next logical place.  Which I suppose would line TWW up with LoZ to mark Ganon's return. This also pushes Spirit Tracks considerably further down the timeline than any other Zelda game... which would also be appropriate.  Which of course leaves the biggest question. Why in the hell would the survivors of Hyrule go to such lengths to honor a hero that utterly and completely failed them?  This is why I always figured the flood happened sooner. The people who survived the flood of Hyrule clearly held Link in high regard. Enough so that they created children's customs around him. The only generation of people with a motivation to do that would be the generation that he directly saved from Ganon.  That, or perhaps only those who kept their faith in the Hero of Time were spared the flood...  Holy Crap. Hyrule didn't just form a death cult when the flood came. They formed one centered around Link! And when the great end came upon them, only those who believed in him ascended to live on in the new world..."

That's a recipe for the kind of resentment that lasts generations.

truezelda,38an06,CyonicWolf,15,Tue Jun 2 23:50:07 2015 UTC,"No; this is why I subscribe to theories that explain why the Fallen Timeline exists based on what we know.  The most probable explanation is the Time Traveler Navi theory.  We know that Zelda sending Link back in time to his Childhood Timeline is the only proven cause of a timeline split.  So, it makes sense that the other timeline split would be caused by the same thing.  In the Fallen Timeline, Zelda sends Navi back instead of Link, and Navi helps Adult Timeline Link succeed in his quest.  You could suggest that due to this, the second Link had some advantages - perhaps getting the Biggoron Sword, reaching more of the Great Fairies, or simply Navi being able to target Ganon.   However technically if this timeline was a result of the hero failing then doesn't that mean pretty much every single Zelda game spawns a ""fallen"" timeline as well?   Yup, it also means there's a timeline where Link jumps off the lookout and drowns himself off Outset Island on his birthday.  Also one where Link stays in bed for 60 hours.  Also one where Link hits himself the face with a bomb with the Beetle, dying.  Basically: the sheer stupidity that comes from an infinite-universes interpretation is reason enough for there to be valid explanations otherwise.  Couple that with the fact that we already have a valid explanation for 1/2 of the splits and there must be a solid reason for it.  It is not a ""what if""."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jun 2 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"Personally I prefer the idea that Link normally dies when zapped by ganondorf, and that that death is the dream we have at the start. Zelda, or someone else, sends a 'premonition' of events to come to Link at the start of the game. This causes Link to brace himself when Ganondorf shoots him that time, causing him to survive.    Personally I don't like the 'time traveller Navi' theory, because Navi does not react the way someone with pre-knowledge would do at all."
truezelda,38an06,henryuuk,2,Wed Jun 3 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Your idea meshes with the ALttP backstory better than the Adult Timeline events, as well."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 3 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"jep, ganodnorf would have needed to enter the sacred realm to get the triforce and he would have needed an army to break through the seal as Link never opened it for him, the ancient sages (wise men) would have all been the standard sages, not the 'new' versions we awaken in OoT and nobody would have remembered there ever was a 'hero' in said story, only the knights fighting to overcome ganondorf's 'thief horde'"
truezelda,38an06,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:48:00 2015 UTC,"You're close and I agree on most of your idea.  Here's my refinement.   Ganondorf the thief obtained the Triforce of Power and managed to get his hands on Princess Zelda. The Hero of Time, Link, challenged him in a battle that would determine Hyrule's very existence, and lost.  -Hyrule Historia   The scene where Young Link encounters him is not a point in which Ganon had the Triforce of Power nor Zelda.  It can't be that.  For what it's worth, Link hasn't been bestowed the title of Hero of Time by that point either.  If it wasn't for that particular choice of wording from Hyrule Historia then holy shit that premonition scene would have been fitting.    Have I expected the downfall timeline to occur due to a premonition from Zelda?  Yes, and I blame Mortal Kombat 9's use of that trope for the inspiration.  It fits the series' feel enough for me.  We won't know until Aonuma decides to play with the downfall timeline's existence a bit."
truezelda,38an06,Ginger_Shepherd,2,Thu Jun 4 03:55:01 2015 UTC,"See, here is my issue with that : we are either gonna have to listen to the alttp backstory.... or the hyrule historia.    and I will ALWAYS placed game>book     IMO, they went for 'wow factor' over pure simple logical placement by placing the split at the final battle without looking at if it makes sense.    If the split happens during the final battle: > all three triforce pieces are already in hyrule = no need to enter the sacred realm (and thus no way for the sages to slam the door shut behind him) > Ganondorf was already ruling hyrule at the point without any worthwile oposition = no reason to enter with an 'army of thieves' , as well as no way the knights of hyrule could have launched a strong enough counteroffensive. > we 'awakened' the new sages = the people who sealed the sacred realm couldn't have been : ""7 wise men"" as the sages are not all male, not all human (as shown in the alttp backstory) and not all old people/wise.

truezelda,38an06,henryuuk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"I like to think the split occurs right after the castle crumbles in OoT, at  the point in which Link loses the Master Sword. I feel better thinking that the only reason Link lost and was killed was because he was not wielding the Master Sword."
truezelda,38an06,FOaficionado,2,Sat Jun 13 19:06:54 2015 UTC,Only issue with that is the fact that it is completely counterintuitive to the Alttp backstory.
truezelda,38an06,henryuuk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:11:07 2015 UTC,How so?
truezelda,38an06,FOaficionado,2,Sat Jun 13 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"In the Alttp backstory, Ganondorf enters the Sacred realm with his band of thieves to obtain the triforce. They break in and the hyrulean knights hold them off for as long as they can under leadership of the 7 wise men/sages. (which were all human and male, and look a lot like Rauru, one of the ancient sages their original forms) Then when ganondorf obtains the triforce, the wise men were able to seal/close the connection between the sacred realm and hyrule, meaning they gave up the triforce to him, but were able to make sure he wouldn't be able to use it against hyrule, as he had no way to get back.    Now look at the situation if Link loses during the final fight in OoT. Ganondorf is in his ganon form (not that important since the name has been used interchangably at times) All three triforce pieces are in hyrule, not the sacred realm, so he has no reason to go into the sacred realm to get them. Ganon(dorf) has already conquered hyrule easily and doesn't need his 'band of thieves' for anything anymore since he pretty much stopped the 2 people capable of stopping him : Link and Zelda. The 'knights of hyrule' are also mostly all MIA with only a handfull still seen. The sages (assuming it is the same group) are only with 6 since zelda needs to have also been defeated in order for ganondorf to have all 3 pieces.  and they are not all human, nor are they all male. (The sages also mention they are only able to seal ganondorf under leadership of the leader of the sages (Zelda) and with the help of the master sword being wielded by the hero)"

truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,3,Wed Jun 3 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"One of the timeline splits we have is caused by an actual event, so the other one must be as well."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,0,Wed Jun 3 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"And ganon defeating the hero, taking all 3 parts of the triforce, and a war being waged to seal him away isn't an event?"
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,4,Wed Jun 3 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"What does that have to do with time travel?  No.  Why would a random ""bad event"" cause a timeline split?  The event that caused the Adult/Child split was Zelda karate-chopping space-time with a lullaby.  The Fallen/Adult split must be something similar."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"And why must it? A case of one is not much to stand on, and one could just as easily say that since one timeline split (Fallen/Adult) is caused by the Hero's fate, that the other must also be based on the Hero's fate. See? The evidence is there, since we have one instance of it. So, beyond ""that's what the other was"", give me proof. I can point to two other instances of time travel that are not confirmed to have caused a timeline split, maybe even 3 depending on how you want Wind Waker to be interpreted. So that's 2:1 against for time travel being the catalyst of splitting the timeline."
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:39:26 2015 UTC,"Time travel doesn't cause it on its own; something has to be involved with time travel in such a way that it fragments the universe, like sending Link back to a time that doesn't exist anymore."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"And that's different from Link traveling to the past in Oracle of Ages and Skyward Sword because...? If you are implying that sending him back to the past broke things because the past is the past and does not exist as the present does, then you have some explaining to do. If you are implying that the point to which he had been sent could not lead to the time which he had been sent from, that is also wrong, as that was the natural course of things in how they would progress."
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,4,Wed Jun 3 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"I think what the original poster is saying is that the  Adult/Child timeline split was caused by an in-universe action that can be seen. in other words, ""someone in the world did X, which resulted in Y occurring at this time"". There was a concrete, observable event that occurred. The ""fallen"" timeline, however is entirely theoretical. Nothing actually happened to bring about it's existence. This is the part where the ""fallen"" timeline observers say, ""yes it did... Link failed in OoT! thats what happened to cause the Fallen Timeline"", to which, the OP is asking, ""where?"" because Link died in ALttP too, when he slashed the cuckoo too many times, and again in WW, when he choked on Grandma's delicious soup and literally died on her rug at her feet, and again in OoT when Saria actually stabbed Link in the face when he showed up to learn the Saria's Song (the truth was she was luring him out there so she could kill him in a place where no one would find him).  Boiling it down, the timeline split occurring from Zelda sending Link back in time can only happen once, in that specific place, in that specific time, and it did actually happen, in fact. It is not happening over and over again, in other iterations, seconds apart from each other in infinite alternate universes. The Fallen Timeline is and always will be theoretical. So why even bother with it? Because at that point, every new Zelda game is stand alone. Every new Zelda game is occurring in its own timeline. Every new Zelda game can be completely disconnected from every other game, because this game explores when Saria kills Link, this game explores when Link survives Saria's attack, but then trips down the stairs on his way out and breaks his neck, etc"
truezelda,38an06,noopenusernames,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:42:00 2015 UTC,Well put.
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 3 13:02:35 2015 UTC,It's not a time travel event.  Going back in time and stopping the JFK assassination would create a new timeline. JFK being assassinated would not.
truezelda,38an06,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"But if an event has two outcomes, then it is almost impossible for there not to be a universe/timeline where a different outcome happened. So, while from a future, in-time perspective, only time travel can change the event, from an out-of-time, nonlinear perspective, both outcomes of the even have happened. So, let's say for instance there was a possibility that Oswald's gun misfired and blew up in his face, given an infinite number of occurances, with an infinite set of universal set-ups, then there is at least one universe where that did happen, and therefore, from the perspective of an outside observer, both outcomes are equally true, despite time travel not being involved."
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,2,Wed Jun 3 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"You're bringing quantum mechanics into this, which is a completely pointless endeavor. Once you do that the entire discussion becomes meaningless because there are infinite realities where Ganondorf wins, infinite realities where Link triumphs, and infinite realities where both are killed and eaten by a giant cucco.  So for the sake of simplicity, people who don't intentionally try to derail conversations by being obtuse limit discussion of parallel timelines to just the ones created by an in-universe mechanic.  There is an in-universe explanation as to why the Adult and Child timelines exist. Nintendo's Downfall timeline has no in-universe explanation."
truezelda,38an06,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"And why does having infinite universes with infinite outcomes make the discussion meaningless? Hm? And why are the multiple outcomes not an in-universe explanation? Hm? I'd say multiple outcomes is a better explanation for timelines splitting than time travel. So, if we are to say that Nintendo saying time travel causes the timeline split is true, why can we not say that the same source saying multiple outcomes causes a split is true? We have a 1 instance of both, so to hold one above the other is pointless. I can just as easily say that the Adult/Child split came from whether or not Zelda sent Link back in time."
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:19:44 2015 UTC,And why does having infinite universes with infinite outcomes make the discussion meaningless?   Because of the infinite number of giant cuccos. Pay attention.
truezelda,38an06,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:46:24 2015 UTC,"The only way that happens is if a giant cuccoo (which I'm not even sure is a thing naturally) pops out of thin air, which is a chance so insignificantly tiny that even with an infinite number of unverses for that to occur, it would still be vastly outnumbered by the universes in which it didn't happen. Or maybe that even is mutually exclusive with some previous event, such as the liberation of the ranch, such that any universe in which that happens cannot also have a giant cuccoo materialize out of thin air. But this is beside the point. A reducto ad absurdam to be sure."

Only if you assume that there are infinite universes to begin with.  There is no reason to assume that beyond philosophy, so at this point we're arguing philosophy."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,11,Wed Jun 3 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"The ""downfall"" timeline is a cop-out designed to retroactively place the older games in the timeline- games that were developed before the devs' timeline really took shape.  I disagree with /u/Serbaayuu that the most probable explanation is the Time Traveler Navi theory. There is no evidence to suggest that the Navi helping Link in OoT was actually sent by Zelda in some bad future. In the game, it is the Great Deku Tree that commissions Navi, not Zelda.  Now, if you want an in-universe explanation of the Downfall Timeline, the most-often posited theory on the web, and really the most probable theory, imo, is the Triforce Wish Theory. At the end of A Link to the Past, we see Link wish upon the Triforce, supposedly wishing to undo all the horrors that Ganon has caused. All the people that have been hurt directly or indirectly by Ganon are now well; even your Uncle is alive again. So, it is possible that ALttP Link's wish retroactively caused Ganon to be bested by the Hero of Time, and retroactively causing a timeline split. In this explanation, it can be said that the entirety of Ocarina of Time is actually an expression of the wish that the Hero of Light (Link from ALttP) makes upon the Triforce."
truezelda,38an06,JCiLee,2,Wed Jun 3 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that theory before, I actually like it quite a lot.  So ALttP Link caused the Adult split, and then at the end of the Adult split, as a further machination of his wish on the Triforce, Zelda gained the ability to stop Ganondorf from ever coming to power.  That's really cool."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jun 3 13:13:44 2015 UTC,"That's new to me as well, but I like it. There are a few issues with it, but it's workable."
truezelda,38an06,TeekTheReddit,2,Wed Jun 3 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"... I like it. I really like it. I love it when the answer can be so simple, so boiled down that it can be summed up in two words: triforce magic, or five words: the result of Link's wish. It's brilliant, it's amazing."
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,9,Wed Jun 3 17:42:57 2015 UTC,"That's not a ""plot hole."" A plot hole is a series of events that cannot be explained with any reasonable logic.  The fact that potentially any Zelda game could spawn a new ""fallen hero"" timeline may seem silly, but it's certainly not a plot hole.  Not to mention that the fallen hero timeline is only possible because of time travel (which can create parallel universes). Therefore, only OoT, OoA, and SS could reasonably have ""fallen hero"" splits."
truezelda,38an06,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Jun 3 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"Skyward Sword is a stable time loop, so it wouldn't be possible there."
truezelda,38an06,GallantBlade475,3,Wed Jun 3 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"My favorite theory is that the Downfall Timeline was the ""original"" timeline and that the past in Oracle of Ages happens before OoT. The other timeline(s) are a result of the temporal BS caused by Veran and the Harp of Ages, having only minor differences until the fight with Ganon in OoT. Then those small things become the difference between victory and defeat."
truezelda,38an06,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"That's the one I personally subscribe to as well.  Veran, while back in the past, knowing that Link, is a descendant of the Knights of Hyrule, sets up the Dark Interlopers. They commit atrocities so terrible that they have to be sealed in the Twilight Realm, atrocities like trying to wipe out the bloodline of all the Knights of Hyrule. This explains why Link's mom hid her son in the Lost Woods and the loss of the knights explains why the King of Hyrule made an alliance with Ganondorf."
truezelda,38an06,henryuuk,2,Wed Jun 3 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"Timeline has existed in some form since the start. the split and origin simply wasn't pre-determined.    Zelda I and II were direct sequels. A Link to the past was made to take place before that. OoT was made to be an insight into the imprisooning war, but with ganondorf being defeated instead.  (and at that point they created the idea of having 3 timelines) Awakening was already determined to be alttp Link (As many of the nightmare are shadow versions of pre existing bosses, with even ganon's shape appearing amongst them) Oracle games were made to fit inbetween alttp and Awakening (opening has Link knowing the location of the full triforce, 'true' ending has Link leaving on the raft from awakening) MM was a direct sequel to OoT TP and WW clearly shows they were running with the idea of the adult and child timelines at that   point. (OoT sealing ending >)WW > PH > ST is a confirmed order of events even shown in that way in-game. SS was made to be the origin point (so far)     The only games that have a reason to believe that they are 'placed into it afterwards' are the four swords trilogy. As they are sorta 'on their own' and only ever connect to the rest by having a 'new' ganon(dorf)    .  The Adult and Child split is a direct result of a specif TYPE of time traveling. Note how all other forms of time travelling do not cause 'issues' they 'stabilize' the timeline. stuff like song of storms never being invented by anyone, changing stuff in the past merely causes them to 'shift' into the future (Tree of Life in SS is the perfect example of this, you plant it in the past, and as a result a tree APPEARS in the future, but groose still clearly says he thinks you made a good choice to plant the tree there, AKA : He remembers a time where there was no tree there !)     This type of time travel works with 'anchors' there are 2 spefic times in space time that are anchored together, and all events in the middle, are unaffected by it, causing any changes to merely 'appear' in the latter of the two anchors.    The pedestal of time 'links' (hehe) between 2 moments that are 7 years divided by each other. The harp of time (and other time anomalies caused by veran missuing Nayru(oracle)'s powers) links between the 'present' and the time where Nayru is located/shit is happening. The Gate of time links between the present and some time a little after Demise was sealed. The temple of time in TP seems to also be capable of creating some sort of 'bubble' of time, as the outside of the past temple seems unaffected and 'frozen' in some sort of state (most likely being more some kind of 'memory replica' within the sacred realm instead of an actual time travelling moment)    They are not gonna add more branches for no reason. The 3 branches allow for pretty much any situation. Fallen timeline : Hyrule is in an eternal cycle of destruction and rebuilding because Ganon keeps coming back (no doubt cause of him having had the triforce at some point, allowing his spirit to remain until his body is revived or something) Child Timeline : (specifically after TP): hyrule has grown tremendously after OoT never had anything bad happen in it, and after TP it most likely grew even bigger (which is why I am sorta thinking Zelda U might take place after TP) Adult Timeline : Hyrule is gone, and we are exploring new lands, with unknown new ancient evils and no doubt many other shit that can happen.     If they ever need to place a new game at some very strange world situation, they can merely place it many years after the current 'ends' of the timelines."
truezelda,38an06,Phoxxent,4,Wed Jun 3 15:38:28 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't ""just released to appease fans"", it was piece mealed as they went along. Sure, they released it to appease fans, but based on various comments throughout the ages, it had been there the whole time. Yes, it does potentially mean that. And before anyone gets pissy for me daring to suggest infinite timelines when we only have 3, might I remind we only have games in 3. There could very easily be timelines we don't see, just as there are portions of the timeline we don't see. For example, we see nothing after FSA, but that doesn't mean Hyrule ceases to exist, or that no Zelda game can take place after FSA. Potentially, yes."

It would be outrageous if there were games for every single possible time split in Zelda, not to mention that it would get old and only make the lore even more confusing.

My view is that after Link entered the Sacred Realm, Ganondorf followed him. The Sages imprisoned him, leading to the events of ALttP. But Link was already destined to awaken in seven years, so his awakening as an adult caused a split."

I understand that Reddit is enthrawaled with Mario Sunshine, but it is the worst-rated 3D Mario and sold half as many units (6.3M) as Mario Galaxy (11.3M) or Mario 64 (11.9M). Hell, even Galaxy 2 (7.4M) outsold Sunshine.  It would be foolish for Nintendo to cater to Reddit fanboys by making a sequel to their worst-received 3D Mario, rather than creating either a true or spiritual sequel to the Galaxy games or perhaps 64.  This is especially true considering that, although well-received, Mario 3D World is not considered by many fans to be in the same AAAA league as 64, Sunshine, or the Galaxies, but is rather considered by many to be more like a ""filler"" game similar to the New Super Mario Bros series."

However the Mario Sunshine aspect does make a certain amount of sense.  Splatoon has released to favorable reviews, and Nintendo is reportedly planning to support the title through an involved marketing and DLC effort. Considering the similarly slimy natures of both titles there is a considerable opportunity for cross-promotion. And of course the ink splattering system used in Splatoon could easily be used in development of a Sunshine sequel. Perhaps they could even use the same engine?  Either way I do have some major doubts about these rumors. Why in the world would a Gamestop employee have any idea what Nintendo is planning for E3? I would love to see more Zelda footage at the conference, but I'll take this with a grain of salt. That said though the claims aren't quite as far-fetched or pandering as you posit they are. I suppose we will have to wait and see."

truezelda,37z9m4,Phoxxent,-5,Sun May 31 18:32:18 2015 UTC,From a developer's perspective that would be a pretty terrible idea.  You don't keep a game on your shelf just to release it at a certain time.

Aonuma has stated that it takes place some time after A Link to the Past, starring a new Link, so at least one generation later.  It's possible that Gramps is that previous Link, but it's also possible that he was the Hero involved in Ganon's resurrection before ALBW (the backstory where the Triforce got split again).   is there any significance To Majora's Mask hanging in Link's house throughout the game?    He picked it up one day.  Perhaps the Happy Mask Salesman managed to remove the evil from it without Link's help in the Fallen Timeline.  Remember that the HMS left Castle Town under very different circumstances in the Adult/Fallen timeline than the Child timeline...  He would have been in a different situation and not bumped into Skull Kid, so the events of Majora's Mask didn't happen.  Even if the evil is not purified, it could simply be watching and waiting for the right person to pick it up.

truezelda,37w5u1,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 31 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"This series hasn't done such setups across games, & it has featured Easter eggs, I have little reason to believe that that specific Mask is canonically there or not, other than they put it there - which works just as well for it being a (non-canon) easter egg which is a tad simpler than it being the specific [implied one of a kind] Major's Mask; but either having had something done to it to calm it down or it being in wait for something - with a game (&/or story) tagged onto either (or both) of those things is a leap.  The Zelda series doesn't take advantage of all its tidbits by a long shot. I have incredibly little reason to believe they will utilise it, but plenty of reason to believe that even if he does have a Mask in his house which looks like that in canon that it won't be of any importance to any game they make.  ""It's there, so it's there"" does work as a solution but:   Perhaps the Happy Mask Salesman managed to remove the evil from it without Link's help in the Fallen Timeline.

Is a leap; even thinking they'll make a game which it's relevant to exempting MM3D of course is also a leap.

truezelda,37w5u1,Phoxxent,0,Sun May 31 11:50:56 2015 UTC,That they have completely different histories but the same map and same structures is better evidence that it's an alternate timeline than part of the LttP one.

Yeah, I missed the part where ganon actually negotiated with the King of Hyrule in order to gain access to the sacred realm, and then that bit where the sacred realm was all sunshine and lollipops. But do you honestly think that just because the backstory of ALBW isn't exactly A Link to the Past, that it doesn't take place after it? Really? You might as well be saying the original two don't take place after ALttP because they don't directly reference it."
truezelda,37w5u1,Phoxxent,0,Sun May 31 22:00:25 2015 UTC,"No, I think that because LBW completely ignores the events of LttP that it doesn't take place after it.  In order for LBW to take place after LttP, you have to pretend that sometime between LttP and LBW, a scenario almost identical to OoT played out.  And then, for LBW to take place before LoZ, you have to pretend that, between LBW and LoZ, Ganon was resurrected a second time.  If you need to invent two additional Zelda games worth of story to explain how it fits... it doesn't fit."
truezelda,37w5u1,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Sun May 31 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"ANd just where does it fit? Nowhere else. In FSA, ganon was destroyed. In TP, ganondorf never became ganon. In OoT the triforce was whole in the Adult Timeline, and ganon was still sealed away util he broke loose to cause havoc and lead into Wind Waker. He doesn't even exist in the rest of the Adult timeline. He's dead again after AoL, so really, it has to fit after ALttP, especially since it uses the same monuments, the same macguffins, etc."
truezelda,37w5u1,Phoxxent,0,Sun May 31 22:53:39 2015 UTC,"The question isn't where does LBW fit. It has a perfect place after OoT. LBW's backstory matches up with the events of OoT better than any other game.  It's easier to say that LttP/OoX/LoZ/AoL are on their own timeline independent from OoT and the various games that spawn from it rather than invent a second sealing and a second resurrection story just to justify sticking LBW between LttP and LoZ.  I mean, really. You'd have to come up with more fan theory backstory to fit it there than there is story in the game itself."

truezelda,37w5u1,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"ALBW's backstory can't be OoT. OoT shows the origins of Ganon and marks the first time Ganon was sealed. According to Sahasrahla, the backstory was at least the second time Ganon had been sealed away:   But surely, you have heard this. Every child of Hyrule grows up hearing of that hero… and fearing Ganon. Just when Hyrule was on the brink of ruin, the hero of legend appeared. He gathered the descendants of the Seven Sages, who had once sealed Ganon in darkness…and together they defeated the Demon King and sealed him away once more. Hyrule was saved.   So the Sages from the backstory were descendants of the ones who sealed away Ganon the first time. These original Sages are almost certainly the Sages from OoT. We don't have to invent a second sealing; the game itself necessitates that a second sealing exists."

Implying Epona, the boat, the bird aren't all gimmicks either.  Everything except ""walking"" is a gimmick at some point.  The train actually allows for some of the best sidequesting and exploration in the series, thanks to the fact that it offers a really reasonable way for them to lock off parts of the world, by simply not putting tracks there until you complete a task.  100%ing Spirit Tracks is a delight."

truezelda,37kaj5,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Jun 1 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree; empty fields are worse than a Pacman minigame.  Spirit Tracks has just as much stuff hidden around the edges of its ""empty field"" as other Zelda games."
truezelda,37kaj5,solaris1990,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"Well I don't disagree in terms of actual content, it's just the 'feel of it' which is different to me. When you first climb over a hill in OOT or TP you don't actually know that there will be empty field on the other side. With OOT (which was my first Zelda game) I pretty much explored every inch of the world and here and there I found surprises or places that were mysteriously blocked off.   There's a sense of exploration which just can't be replicated when you are constrained to rails or to small islands. Yesterday, I played ALBW for the first time and it was the same, just a notion of not knowing where I was going or what I would find... more often than not it wasn't much of note, but sometimes it was, and I felt that I'd 'stumbled' onto it of my own accord rather than being driven there."
truezelda,37kaj5,RedArremer,3,Mon Jun 1 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"PH is pretty decent, but I couldn't get through Spirit Tracks. I got bored with nearly every section. The overland train music is super good though."

truezelda,37kaj5,Cillendor,1 point,Thu May 28 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely buy them! They have rather annoying controls, but otherwise they're excellent games. And the tedious sailing mechanic from The Wind Waker is gone. It's much more interesting on Phantom Hourglass.  I should point out that I just finished replaying Phantom Hourglass and am starting a new file on Spirit Tracks."
truezelda,37kaj5,keltond95,1 point,Thu May 28 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"They are well worth it. Don't compare them to other Zelda games, just play them. They are a bit easier and child friendly, but I had a lot of fun in the dungeons. The boomerang is amazing to use"
truezelda,37kaj5,Red-Blue-,1 point,Thu May 28 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"Phantom hourglass had some cool concepts in it that no other game has. It's been a very long time since I’ve played it, but I would give it a try if you can find it at a good price."
truezelda,37kaj5,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Thu May 28 22:58:30 2015 UTC,"I liked phantom hourglass, but the drawing mechanic was kinda meh at points.  As for spirit tracks well...the panflute bit I didn't like"
truezelda,37kaj5,solaris1990,1 point,Fri May 29 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only real answer is it depends on how much money you have. If you've money to buy then get them definitely. If not then you're not missing out on the best of Zelda.  I really really liked the dungeons and some of the bosses in those games though. They were very clever and creative (thanks to the controls that so many complain about - I personally found them super-intuitive on a DS lite).  Overworld-wise both are meh and PH has a very annoying repeat dungeon. Nonetheless there's a lot of fun to be had with those games, if you can afford not to skip them, then don't."
truezelda,37kaj5,LordCharco_iii,2,Mon Jun 1 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"I emulated PH for an hour or two and gave it a whirl, the controls felt really weird, but I wrote that off as using an emulation.

truezelda,37kaj5,georgie_exia,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"In phantom hourglass they have you go back to the same dungeon every time, only a new section opens up. if you like repetitive dungeons with shortcuts each time you advance then yeah. it's a good follow up to WW.

truezelda,37esrr,Serbaayuu,24,Wed May 27 02:35:46 2015 UTC,"It seems that Link and Zelda possess the pieces of Courage and Wisdom respectively during TP. The symbol of the Triforce of Courage glows on Link's hand when he transforms into a wolf for the first time. The Triforce of Wisdom is visible in Zelda's hand during her second meeting with Link and Midna. Link and Zelda had parts of the Triforce at the end of OoT, so it makes sense that their descendants in TP would still have those pieces.  The Triforce of Power should theoretically be in the possession of Link or Zelda after TP. As we've seen in LoZ and ALttP, a person who dies while bearing part of the Triforce will leave it behind. When Link removed the Master Sword from Ganon's body, he could have discovered the Triforce of Power. He may have claimed it for himself, but I find it more likely that he gave it to Zelda to help her rebuild the kingdom. I hope Nintendo will continue the story from TP in a future game and explain what really happened to the Triforce, and maybe provide a decent segue into FSA."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,16,Wed May 27 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"I would not mind a direct sequel to TP at all.  It's already considered the OoT copycat, so they might as well make one with Link searching for Midna.  :3"
truezelda,37esrr,princekamoro,5,Wed May 27 10:58:09 2015 UTC,"I really don't see the ""too similar to OoT"" thing as a bad thing. As long as it has good dungeons, puzzles and combat, I'm happy. I never really did pay much attention to the story, except for Skyward Sword. Just do the thing, solve the puzzle, get the item, kill the boss."
truezelda,37esrr,RuafaolGaiscioch,4,Wed May 27 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"Neither do I, as long as it has enough agency to do its own thing and not try too hard to copy the old stuff."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,5,Wed May 27 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"If death = departure of the triforce, then why would the triforce stay within Link and Zelda's bloodlines?  Unless there is a distinction between natural death and violent death, or (more likely?) death via master sword vs. any other death."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,2,Wed May 27 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't say death = departure. On the contrary, I said death means the Triforce remains behind after its owner dies. After Link and Zelda died, their pieces of the Triforce would have remained behind and come into the possession of their children. Or maybe Link and Zelda passed on their pieces before their deaths. The fact remains that we see Ganon die onscreen in both LoZ and ALttP, and in both those instances the parts of the Triforce he has stick around for Link to claim. I see no reason why this same rule should not apply to TP."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,3,Wed May 27 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"Actually I just remembered that Tetra's piece of the Triforce was passed down as well, so I suppose there's no real reason why someone who isn't murdered could pass it down to their children."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,2,Wed May 27 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Triforce of Wisdom gets passed down through the bloodline of the Royal Family in both WW and ALBW. This pattern should still apply in TP. Since the Triforce can be passed down in this manner, it makes sense for Link to have the Triforce of Courage in TP, since he is a direct descendant of the Hero of Time."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,1 point,Wed May 27 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"There must be some sort of guideline on how this ""passing of the triforce"" occurs. Because in some games it gets passed physically (WW, for example), but in other games it seems to be more of a metaphysical passing, like how Link gets the triforce of courage in OoT. Any thoughts on this?"
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,3,Wed May 27 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"OoT is a special case. At the start of the game, the Triforce sits in the Sacred Realm with no master. Ganondorf touches the Triforce, inadvertently causing it to split. Wisdom and Courage go to ""those chosen by destiny"", Zelda and Link in this case. This is the only confirmed time in the series that the Triforce was divided in such a manner. The Triforce isn't being passed on from a previous owner to a new one at this point; it's seeking out its owners for the first time. After the Triforce has been divided, Link and Zelda start to hand their pieces down through their respective bloodlines."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,1 point,Wed May 27 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"How does Link get the Triforce in TP? Isn't that a 'choosing' as well? It's been a while since I've played TP, so I'm not sure"
truezelda,37esrr,Cillendor,2,Sun May 31 10:49:53 2015 UTC,"It's never outright stated why Link has the Triforce of Courage in TP, but the most likely answer is that it was passed down through his family line. The Hero of Time still has the Triforce of Courage in the Child ending of OoT; it's clearly visible on the back of his hand during the final cutscene. Hyrule Historia confirms that TP Link is a direct descendant of the Hero of Time. The Triforce of Courage most likely became an heirloom of the Hero's family, just like how the Triforce of Wisdom became an heirloom of the Royal Family. Link and Zelda from OoT passed their Triforces on to their descendants, eventually reaching Link and Zelda from TP."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,1 point,Sun May 31 13:01:40 2015 UTC,"that seems like an awfully large thing to leave out of the intro of the game. i think if Link knew he had this thing, this Triforce, the course of events would've been a little different. I'll have the play the game again, but I'm pretty sure there's no indication that Link has or even knows that he has some sort of physical form of the Triforce"
truezelda,37esrr,Cillendor,1 point,Sun May 31 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed on this.  We don't really know what happens to the Triforce when its holder dies and the piece remains unclaimed.  If the Hero of Twilight does hold the Courage to begin with, I would say the individual pieces would have to float around the world without a purpose or owner until they discover somebody who embodies that trait.  It might be possible for somebody to track down & obtain the relics while they are unowned, as well."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,1 point,Wed May 27 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'd love a sequel, but not to segue into FSA. That was the laziest decision on Nintendo's part. FSA works best where it was originally intended to go—between FS and OoT. Moving it to after TP makes no sense and hurts the timeline overall."
truezelda,37esrr,Cillendor,2,Thu May 28 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"There's really nothing in FSA suggesting it takes place before OoT. It was originally intended  to be a prequel to ALttP before Miyamoto came in and had the story changed. Since FSA is now officially a distant sequel to TP, they might as well try to tie it to the rest of the Child Timeline in some way."
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,1 point,Thu May 28 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly give exactly 0 shits if they tie in a TP sequel to FSA.  FSA could have twenty other games before it in the timeline.  I do want something else to expand on the Child Timeline after the events of Twilight Princess, though.  That is something that needs to happen."
truezelda,37esrr,Cillendor,1 point,Thu May 28 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"But it still works as a prequel to ALTTP. OoT is currently the only game before ALTTP, but the entire Imprisoning War must be assumed because it obviously can't be the events of OoT. This is pretty shabby writing. The Zelda series tends to show all its wars off-screen, and that's unfortunate to say the least. But FSA actually can, at least in part, play the role of the Imprisoning War by going before OoT.  In FSA, we see a young Ganondorf before he became King of the Gerudos. During a visit to Hyrule, he fell in love with its lush beauty (stated in TWW). He coveted the lands and wanted to rule them. Ganondorf knew of the Trident which gave the powers of Demise to its wielder [this was old fan speculation from around the launch of SS; I'm giving you the truncated version of this story]. He released Vaati to cause a disruption in Hyrule while he stole it and became the Demon King Ganon. The game of FSA picks up at the tail end of the Imprisoning War, after the soldiers had been ""hijacked"" to fight against Link. It ended with Ganon imprisoned—temporarily.  Ganon was too powerful for the Four Sword, so he managed to escape. He resumed his human form and returned to his people, who'd devolved into thieves in his absence. The Imprisoning War also served to prompt the races in Hyrule to rebel, leading to the Civil War. The King of Hyrule finally quelled the Civil War, leading to about a decade of peace (except for skirmishes with the Gerudos).  During this time, Ganondorf was learning how to reach the Triforce. He realized that the keys were the Spiritual Stones, so he set about to obtain them. No-one knew of his activities, but Zelda suspected him. Finally Link let him into the Sacred Realm. The Sages (the Old Men from ALTTP, including Rauru) appeared to seal him in.  (Ganondorf brought with him the Four Sword and summoned Vaati's spirit to join him. He charged Vaati to guard the Four Sword in the Sacred Realm so it couldn't be used to stop him again. This is seen in the GBA version of ALTTP.)  In this timeline, Ganondorf never killed the original six Sages, so Link never awoke the new ones. By the time of ALTTP, the details of the two back-to-back wars had largely been muddied. FSA!Link's role had been forgotten due to his association with the knights. OoT!Link's role was totally unknown to the populace from the get-go, so obviously he wasn't known to them. Thus they only remembered the soldiers and the Sages who sealed Ganondorf away.  The first split to the timeline occurred when Link withdrew the Master Sword as a child. The Sages had already sealed Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but by withdrawing the Master Sword, Link opened up a new branch which allowed Ganondorf to escape. This is what sparked the Adult Timeline.  The Child Timeline sent Link back to before Ganondorf started pursuing the Spiritual Stones. At that point, only the Deku Tree, Navi, and Zelda knew anything about Link's role as a hero, and only Navi actually witnessed it all. There is no way the King of Hyrule would've listened to a little boy from the forest concerning Ganondorf if he wouldn't even heed his own daughter's warnings. The reason why the king listened to Link is because Link explained to him how Ganondorf was the same person as the evil Ganon who'd attacked Hyrule decades before. Convinced, the King of Hyrule had the Sages execute Ganondorf, leading to the events of TP."
truezelda,37esrr,henryuuk,2,Fri May 29 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"In the official timeline, OoT and the Imprisoning War aren't the same event. Rather, the IW is the fallout from OoT on the Downfall Timeline. Ganon defeats Link and Zelda and takes the complete Triforce. As a last resort the Sages seal both Ganon and the Triforce in the Dark World. Hyrule was at peace for an unknown amount of years. But now knowledge of the Triforce, limited to a few individuals at the start of OoT, has spread across Hyrule. The people fight amongst themselves and go to the Dark World to try to claim it. Ganon's army grows in numbers and eventually attacks Hyrule. So the King commissioned Seven Sages, never identified with the ones from OoT, to seal the gate to the Dark World. Thanks to the sacrifice of the Knights of Hyrule, they are successful and the war ends. Since the Imprisoning War is already a standalone event, we don't need to conflate the events of FSA and OoT to have it make sense.    Ganondorf brought with him the Four Sword and summoned Vaati's spirit to join him. He charged Vaati to guard the Four Sword in the Sacred Realm so it couldn't be used to stop him again. This is seen in the GBA version of ALTTP.   That's just not true. In ALttP, there are four separate blades in the Pyramid that can be united into the Four Sword, but there is no indication as to how they got there. They have no connection to Ganon or anyone else. Vaati is never referenced at all in the Palace of the Four Sword. His spirit isn't guarding the pieces of the Fours Sword, four Dark Links are. These Dark Links are never even remotely implied to be in the service of Ganon or Vaati or any other villain.    The first split to the timeline occurred when Link withdrew the Master Sword as a child. The Sages had already sealed Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but by withdrawing the Master Sword, Link opened up a new branch which allowed Ganondorf to escape. This is what sparked the Adult Timeline.   Why would that cause a timeline split? Why would Link draw the Master Sword if Ganon was already defeated and sealed in the Sacred Realm?   There is no way the King of Hyrule would've listened to a little boy from the forest concerning Ganondorf if he wouldn't even heed his own daughter's warnings. The reason why the king listened to Link is because Link explained to him how Ganondorf was the same person as the evil Ganon who'd attacked Hyrule decades before.    That's kind of a contradiction. The King won't listen to Link, but then the King takes Link at his word that Ganondorf is actually an ancient demon? Where's the proof that FSA Ganon and OoT Ganon are in fact the same person? Ganondorf in FSA was despised by his people for breaking their laws and stealing the Trident. I don't see why the Gerudo would welcome this guy back and make him their king. There's nothing in OoT suggesting that Ganondorf was once a giant pig-demon who was sealed in the Four Sword. If he was powerful enough to escape the Four Sword and had a Trident giving him the powers of Demise, why didn't he just use that power to overwhelm Hyrule instead of riding around to each individual tribe and demanding their stones? FSA and OoT Ganon both being Gerudo from the desert doesn't make them the same person any more than OoT and TP Zelda both being Hylian princesses makes them the same person.  It's just a lot simpler for the Imprisoning War and FSA to be separate events. We don't need to finagle with the storylines or reverse the order of certain events to have things make sense. Ganon is already given a perfectly reasonable backstory in OoT and I don't see a need to confuse it by making him the same person as FSA Ganon."
truezelda,37esrr,henryuuk,1 point,Fri May 29 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"In the official timeline The official timeline gets a lot wrong, though. I don't have my copy of Hyrule Historia in front of my to provide examples, but it contradicts the games on several points.   Here is someone else's list of problems with HH. As he says, some of his points are a bit nit-picky, and I don't agree with all of them. But HH has some substantial problems nonetheless. I do think the DT is the best explanation for the classic games, but not the way that it is presented in HH. The official version of the DT has too many holes.  I know what the official version of events is, but that doesn't make it the best version (not saying mine is the best either, just that there's no sense in killing theorizing simply because Nintendo published their own error-wrought timeline).   That's just not true. In ALttP, there are four separate blades in the Pyramid that can be united into the Four Sword, but there is no indication as to how they got there. They have no connection to Ganon or anyone else. Vaati is never referenced at all in the Palace of the Four Sword. His spirit isn't guarding the pieces of the Fours Sword, four Dark Links are. These Dark Links are never even remotely implied to be in the service of Ganon or Vaati or any other villain.   Ah! Thank you for jogging my memory! That actually works out better for my theory anyway, because I couldn't think of how Vaati would get there. Ganondorf bringing the Four Sword with him is no problem, but bringing Vaati was a stretch the whole time. I just haven't played ALTTP in a few years, so it's been a while since I've played that dungeon.  I'm curious, do you consider the Palace of the Four Sword to be canon? If so, how do you explain the Four Sword getting into the Dark World, considering the last game to feature it in the official timeline is FS? And why do you say ""they have no connection to Ganon or anyone else"" when they are in his palace?   Why would that cause a timeline split? Why would Link draw the Master Sword if Ganon was already defeated and sealed in the Sacred Realm?   It causes a split because it's the only thing I can think of, lol. The better question is, Why would Ganon killing Link cause a split? The ""what if"" scenario that HH proposes for the DT makes absolutely no sense. The split for the CT/AT makes sense because Link is playing with the mechanics of time, but nothing of the sort happens if Ganon kills him in their battle. If there is going to be a DT—and like I said, I think it is the best explanation for the classic games—it has to be sparked by an actual interruption in the flow of time.  I chose the moment that Link withdraws the Master Sword because it is the first time that Link screws around with time. (In theory, every time he travels back and forth in time should cause a new split, but those will hopefully never be explored!) Actually, I just pulled up a video of the scene where Ganondorf enters the Temple of Time, and it happens after Link withdraws the Master Sword. So it would make more sense that (1) Link withdraws the blade, (2) Ganondorf enters the Sacred Realm, (3) the Sages seal him in, but (4) Link's awakening as an adult and return to Hyrule causes a split. See, I'm developing my theory as I go. But I still hold fast to the position that the DT must be caused by an actual meddling in time.   That's kind of a contradiction. The King won't listen to Link, but then the King takes Link at his word that Ganondorf is actually an ancient demon? Where's the proof that FSA Ganon and OoT Ganon are in fact the same person? Ganondorf in FSA was despised by his people for breaking their laws and stealing the Trident. I don't see why the Gerudo would welcome this guy back and make him their king.   It isn't a contradiction. Zelda couldn't convince her father that Ganondorf was evil, but if Link was able to get him to at least look into the archives, the connections would be obvious. This king would be the grandson of FS/FSA!Zelda, so he was far-enough removed from those events to not immediately make the connection. He probably never knew that the evil pig Ganon was originally a Gerudo prince, but Link's story was enough to persuade him to look and discover the truth for himself.  There is no direct proof that FSA!Ganon and OoT!Ganon are the same person, but there is no direct proof against it either. Here are a few reasons why I believe it, though. First, the Gerudo in FSA are peaceful nomads. Granted, a warrior tribe could settle down and become peaceful later on, but it makes just as much sense that they began as peaceful and later became violent. Nabooru opposed Ganondorf's behavior, so that suggests that the Gerudo hadn't been thieves and warriors for long. Second, there is only one male born every century, and he rules as the king. If Ganondorf were a prince at the time of FSA, then perhaps he could've first encountered Hyrule on a diplomatic envoy with his father. He wasn't yet the king, which is why he's never referred to as such in FSA. But during his extended absence (probably 40-50 years), the Gerudo are without a king and descend into anarchy. They are led by smaller tribal leaders such as Nabooru. When Ganondorf returns sometime prior to OoT, they readily welcome him as their long-lost king. They no longer have an aversion to his unruly ways because they've changed as a society. And the raw power that he possesses allures them.   There's nothing in OoT suggesting that Ganondorf was once a giant pig-demon who was sealed in the Four Sword.   There's nothing suggesting that he wasn't, either. The ""Ganon"" form of Ganondorf appears in multiple games from multiple causes. In OoT, it was due to the Triforce of Power. In FSA, it was due to the Trident. In ALTTP, it was due to the entire Triforce. In the other games, it was due to other reasons. I'm trying to simplify things by saying that it was actually due to his possession by Demise. As a man, he obtained the Trident which contained the spirit of Demise (I have this all worked out, but it'd take too long to explain unless you want to know). Demise's power turned him into the pig-like Demon King. Then with Demise's help, he set out to obtain the Triforce in OoT. By lining up the games as FSA > OoT > ALTTP, it brings about some consistency with what ""Ganon"" actually is in relation to the Gerudo king.   If he was powerful enough to escape the Four Sword and had a Trident giving him the powers of Demise, why didn't he just use that power to overwhelm Hyrule instead of riding around to each individual tribe and demanding their stones?   Because it didn't work the last time. He decided against all-out war because it backfired the last time. Also, I think it was partly to do with the human side of him. As it says in TWW, he coveted the lands of Hyrule. If he started another war, everything would be destroyed. Better to steal the Triforce through stealth and force everyone into submission. That's just a guess, though.  I think there is more to the Spiritual Stones and the Civil War, anyway. I think the tribes in Hyrule fought against the Royal Family because of their possession of the Stones, which were the keys to the Sacred Realm. The king gave them to the tribes in a gesture of peace. Any suggestion that the Stones had been heirlooms of the tribes for longer than that is just revisionist history on their part as they try to write out the terrible war that just occurred. So that is partly why Ganondorf committed to stealth; he wasn't sure where the Stones were, exactly.   FSA and OoT Ganon both being Gerudo from the desert doesn't make them the same person any more than OoT and TP Zelda both being Hylian princesses makes them the same person.   I know, and that is a good point. But somehow the idea that all three members of the Triforce trio keep reincarnating is just boring to me. Zelda's ""reincarnation"" makes sense because every female in the royal line is named Zelda. Link makes sense because a random kid rises up every time even rears its ugly head. But the idea that Ganon/dorf can be reincarnated makes him much less interesting to me. A godlike villain who perpetually tries to defeat the powers of good sounds much better than a random guy who is reborn every so often and can turn into a piggish beast each time. I guess I picture Ganondorf as more of a Morgoth or a Sauron than a Marvel baddie (coming back to life whenever the writers want).  If Ganondorf is important enough of a fellow for Twinrova to revive him from death, not to mention all his other minions trying to do so, then to me it seems cheap to say there can be ""another Ganondorf"". If that's the direction the producers want to take with it then that's their choice, but with the 17 games out now, the only Ganon/dorf that is hard to link to the OoT one is the one from the original LoZ game. Every single other iteration of him in the games can conceivably be the same person, which to me is much more powerful and threatening than just having a bunch of random dudes named Ganondorf.  The curse of Demise in SS was a little annoying at first since it seemed like an unnecessary addition that changed the lore too much, but once I realized that Demise could've possessed Ganondorf via the Trident and essentially made him an immortal god, it all clicked. (As for how Demise became bound to the Trident, that's another story that I can explain if you're interested.)  Anyway, this is all a very long way of saying that I don't buy the HH timeline because it has too many contradictions with the actual games, and I think the Legend of Zelda can be much more legendary."
truezelda,37esrr,SaintSpaceboy,2,Fri May 29 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"I read the list of problems with Hyrule Historia, and yeah, it's pretty nit-picky. Of course there are some errors in HH, like mixing up the Fire and Spirit medallions, but on the whole it's an accurate description of series lore. In his letter at the end of the book, Aonuma even admits there might be some discrepancies in the timeline section, but he asks the fans to accept it as a necessary consequence of the way the games are made, with gameplay ahead of story. I don't see a grand contradiction between Hyrule Historia and the games, so I'm going to accept it as legitimate.   I'm curious, do you consider the Palace of the Four Sword to be canon? If so, how do you explain the Four Sword getting into the Dark World, considering the last game to feature it in the official timeline is FS? And why do you say ""they have no connection to Ganon or anyone else"" when they are in his palace?   I'm kind of agnostic as to whether it's canon. It doesn't really affect the timeline too much either way. If it is canon, then Link got the Four Sword and proceeded to do nothing with it. If it's not canon, then Vaati is still sealed away in Hyrule somewhere. In either scenario, Vaati remains a potential threat that can be revisited in a future game. But let's assume it is canon. I have no idea how the Four Sword got to the Dark World, and the game offers no evidence as to how it did. Just because it's in the Dark World it doesn't mean Ganon brought it there. The Hookshot, Hammer, Mirror Shield, Cane of Somaria, and Red Mail are all in the Dark World as well. Did Ganon bring those along with him too? Unlike the Master Sword, there's no criteria for who can use the Four Sword. Literally anyone could have picked it up and brought it to the Dark World. The Dark Links aren't in Ganon's palace. Ganon's chief residence in the Dark World is Ganon's Tower. He doesn't head to the Pyramid until Link has already conquered the Tower. The Palace of the Four Sword, located in the Pyramid, is just one of many dungeons scattered throughout the Dark World. It has no special connection to Ganon anymore than the Swamp Palace or Turtle Rock do.    But I still hold fast to the position that the DT must be caused by an actual meddling in time.   I actually agree with you on that point. HH doesn't strictly say what causes the Downfall Timeline; it just says there is an alternate timeline in which Ganon defeats Link. I subscribe to the theory that Navi is actually from the Downfall Timeline, and she was sent back in time to prevent Link's death. Her guidance helps Link overcome Ganon, causing the Adult Timeline to branch off. But there are a number of possible explanations for exactly what caused the Downfall split.    There is no direct proof that FSA!Ganon and OoT!Ganon are the same person, but there is no direct proof against it either.   If our standard of evidence is going to be ""you can't prove that it didn't happen"" then the timeline could be virtually anything. Ganon actually has a pretty consistent backstory in most games. ALttP and OoT both state that Ganondorf was leader of a group of thieves who entered the Sacred Realm, touched the Triforce, and became the Demon King Ganon. ALBW agrees that Ganon was a thief until he claimed the Triforce and transformed into the Demon King. In TP, Ganondorf was leader of a band of thieves who was trying to get to the Sacred Realm. He never actually reaches the Sacred Realm due to the timeline split, but he still obtains part of the Triforce and is called ""Ganon"" a few times after that. FSA Ganon's backstory diverges from this pattern. He's not leader of a group of thieves, he's not trying to reach the Sacred Realm, and he becomes Ganon after claiming the Trident, not the Triforce. There's no precedent for Ganon ceasing to be the Demon King and going back to being Ganondorf the Thief. OoT and TP show he can transform between human and beast forms, but he never ceases to be the Demon King; he's always ""Ganon"". Since FSA Ganon's backstory is the only one that's inconsistent with the general pattern of the series, it makes sense for him to be a different person. SS establishes a cycle of reincarnation (though possibly not literal reincarnation) for the Goddess, the Hero, and the Demon King, so it makes perfect sense for there to be multiple Ganons in the same way there are multiple Links and Zeldas."
truezelda,37esrr,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri May 29 22:44:57 2015 UTC,"In lieu of Miyamoto's quote about the timeline being imperfect, I'll extend that to FSA's placement. All evidence in-game suggests that it follows FS after a brief period of time, not after hundreds of years.  As for Ganondorf's divergent backstory in FSA, I already explained that. ALttP, OoT, TP, and ALBW all focus on the recent events of his life prior to OoT in which he was the leader of a band of thieves. He wasn't even a king (yet) during FSA. FSA covers his early years prior to his reemergence as the Gerudo King.  That theory about Navi actually does make a lot of sense. The question I'd ask, though, is how Navi went back in time to save Link if she wasn't with him the first time? It's a legitimate question because I've never heard this theory before.  Going back to the Four Sword in the pyramid, I think I had mentioned before that it's been years since I played ALttP. So that explains the lapse in my memory. That said, there is no reason that Ganondorf couldn't have hid the Four Sword in the pyramid. As for Link not using it afterward, he had the more powerful Master Sword. Why bother using an inferior blade?  As for Shadow Link, the game offers no explanation as to how they got there. What do you think? I told you before that I've shared only a small snippet of my developing mythology, so I do have an explanation for the Shadow Links.  I say they go all the way back to SS. They were the Demon army that followed Demise (I can say where, but THAT is even longer to explain). Prior to SS, Hylia and the Light Spirits banished most of the Demons into the Mirror of Twilight. Three (or four?) escaped: Demise, Ghirahim, Batreaux, and Malladus*. Batreaux subverted and joined forces with Hylia, so she commissioned him to go with the Humans to protect them in the sky, but never to be seen by them. We know what happened to Demise and Ghirahim.  During Hyrule's reconstruction, the ancestors of the Zuna (whose origin I've also traced) worshiped Demise. Hyrule was enjoying peace and prosperity, and they became sleepy on the watch. The ""pre-Zuna"" stole into the Temple of Time and used dark magic to coax Demise out of the Master Sword. He was too weak to take a physical form, so they bound his soul to a Trident made from reforged pieces of the Dark Master Sword. Releasing him caused the sudden infestation of monsters in TMC's backstory.  (I know this whole part with the Zuna is far-fetched, but otherwise there is no explanation for where Demise' spirit went.)  By the time of FSA, the Zuna had ceased their former religion worshiping Demise. They were fearful of the Trident, so they built up the pyramid to protect it. (This pyramid was Ganondorf's inspiration for building a similar one in the Dark World. It was like a temple for him.)  When Ganondorf took the Trident and became imbued with the spirit of Demise, his first step before resurrecting Vaati was to find the Mirror of Twilight and free the Demons (he is the Demon King, after all). When he did, though, he found that most of the Demons had become complacent in their exile and didn't want to return to the world of the light. Those who did took on the form of Dark Link. After all, Link was a hero for defeating Vaati, so if he were suddenly causing mischief around Hyrule, his fame would diminish and people wouldn't trust him. Here the events of FSA happen.  After freeing himself (perhaps with the help of a few remaining Interlopers), Ganondorf took the Four Sword with him. Hyrule was engaged in Civil War, so no-one noticed his escape. But when he entered the Sacred Realm, he charged the four remaining Interlopers with guarding the Four Sword fragments in the Pyramid.  In the CT, Ganondorf was banished into the Twilight Realm himself. There he encountered a Twili named Zant who worshiped him as a god. That is because he was a god, actually Demise himself bound to a new human form.  ~~~  I know that having multiple Ganons is within the realm of possibilities for Zelda, but it seems cheap to me. Zelda's reincarnation makes sense. She's the descendant of the Goddess of Time, and all females in her line are named Zelda. Link also makes sense. He's a hero who is born whenever a great evil rises up to destroy Hyrule. But Ganon/dorf shouldn't just be some convenient villain who is born to destroy the world. His story is much stronger if there is only one of him. It's like Morgoth in Middle-earth. He is this seemingly indestructible, immortal foe, and the best the heroes can do is stop his plans for an age. But he never really relents, and something about who he is is so powerful that his minions will try to resurrect him when he actually does get defeated. If he were just reincarnated in another person, there'd be no reason to go to such extreme lengths to resurrect the original, such as in OoX and AoL. The other villains of Hyrule come and go, but Ganondorf deserves to be so much more.  *I am not sold on this last one. I'm still doing a lot of thinking on the world of ST."
truezelda,37esrr,henryuuk,8,Wed Jun 3 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"Is there any evidence for where the Courage and Wisdom are at that time? Do Link and Zelda hold them?   Yes. They have the Triforce marks on the backs of their hands.  The Historia says that Link bringing The Triforce of Courage back in time allowed Ganondorf to obtain the Triforce of Power. So one popular fan theory is that when Link brought the Triforce of Courage back in time, it caused a paradox where two Triforces of Courage existed in a single timeline. To fix this paradox, the Triforce in the childhood timeline split, with each piece going to its respective owner.  The ""extra"" Triforce of Courage is sent back to its proper universe--the adult timeline--but this causes it to shatter (setting up for WW).   And what happens to the Triforce of Power when Ganondorf dies? Normally, the death of a holder leaves their piece behind.   The game doesn't really explain it at all, but the Triforce of Power (or at least the mark) disappears from Ganon before he dies.  It weirdly seems like he lost the Triforce before he died.  I'm not really sure...but maybe when Ganondorf lost to Link, he was no longer the most powerful person in Hyrule, so the Triforce of Power automatically went to a different person who embodied power?"
truezelda,37esrr,stryker101,4,Wed May 27 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"But Zant was well and truly dead by then, don't forget."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,3,Wed May 27 15:27:58 2015 UTC,And his spirit commited 'suicide' to take ganondorf down with him cause zant saw he wasn't a god at all
truezelda,37esrr,Dismas423,2,Wed May 27 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have always thought that Ganondorf and Zant had a sort of symbiotic relationship at that point, so Zant had just as much control over Ganondorf as Ganondorf had over him."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,3,Wed May 27 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"I see it as them being each other's horcrux. If Ganondorf is alive, Zant can leech off of him to heal, and when Zant is alive, Ganondorf can do so with Zant. by the time we fight Ganondorf, Zant has started healing from their connection, but he kills himself because he realizes Ganondorf isn't the immortal undefeatable 'god' zant thought he was"

Link, without the Triforce of Power, proved himself more powerful than Ganondorf, who did have the Triforce of Power. Maybe the Triforce of Power passed itself to the new most-powerful person, Link, like how the Elder Wand changes owners is Harry Potter."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,5,Wed May 27 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"Link seems to hold the ToC in this game, as it protects him from the twilight, and I say it's the ToC based on it's position, and the fact that he displays no affinity for wisdom. Iirc, Zelda has the ToW, and it's seen in one of the scenes at twilight hyrule castle, but I could be wrong. Interestingly, though, Ganon should poses two pieces of the Triforce when during the final battle, after possessing Zelda. And Link and Zelda should get the full Triforce at the end of the game, after beating Ganon. But, then again, maybe psuedodeath or death doesn't make the triforce just ""pop"" out of a person, but kind of just makes it either turn to stone, shoot up into the sky, and find a new owner, or it just silently returns to the sacred realm where it once slept under protection of the goddess Hylia."
truezelda,37esrr,IstheLieReallyaCake,3,Wed May 27 21:04:39 2015 UTC,"If Zelda was holding the Wisdom, wouldn't she lose it when she ""died"" to save Midna?  Then again that scene was really unclear as to what actually happened with her.   maybe psuedodeath or death doesn't make the triforce just ""pop"" out of a person   Well, that's what happens in Zelda 1."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,3,Wed May 27 02:59:40 2015 UTC,"It is often assumed Zelda actually gives the triforce of wisdom to Midna to save her, and that Midna gives it back when bringing Zelda back."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 10:56:26 2015 UTC,That's pretty reasonable.
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,3,Wed May 27 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"Here's a theory for you: What if it goes to Midna?  Midna is gravely wounded from facing Ganondorf by herself (that huge explosion, Ganondorf crumbling the Fused Shadow in his hand, she didn't just walk away from that naturally). When Link impales Ganondorf the Light Spirits seize the Triforce of Power (explaining why it leaves Ganondorf before he dies), and give it to her, thus saving her life and possibly even explaining how she returned to her true form. It also provides her with an additional motive for shattering the mirror: making sure Link and Zelda will never have to worry about the Triforce of Power again.  She's certainly the ideal person to wield that piece of the Triforce. She values and seeks power, but she gains enough wisdom and courage from Zelda and Link that she isn't corrupted by it. Link is warned repeatedly what the Fused Shadows and the Mirror could do to him, but in the end it's Midna that uses both, and she only uses them to do good, not evil. Of any character in the series, she seems best suited to wield the Triforce of Power, and the Light Spirits, having seen her actions (they were paying enough attention to events that they came to Zelda's aid in an instant), easily could have realized that about Midna, since someone had to take that piece of the Triforce.  The big bonus would be giving them a reason to explore the Twili again at some point in the future.  Not really any evidence, but I think it actually makes quite a bit of sense."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"I actually like this. But if this is the case, then I would really hope that this means we will see the Twili again.... simply because locking the Triforce of Power away in the Twilight Realm would seem to me like an imbalance in Hyrule. Like, all 3 pieces are meant to be in Hyrule, that Hyrule is destined to be a piece when, one day, someone can united all 3 pieces and wish for good. Permanently taking the ToP to the Twili and getting it stuck there forever would seem to me to ruin that end goal that keeps the series going. In any event, I like this theory.  As a side note to some of the earlier comments, there must be some definitive idea of what happens to each triforce piece when its holder dies. If it just constantly disappears elsewhere, then how is anyone ever expected to united all 3 pieces? If Link or Zelda took Ganon's piece at the end of TP, then I would just say, unite all 3 pieces right then and there and be done with it; give all 3 pieces to Zelda, have her wish for piece, bam, series is over. Thats kind of how I saw WW ending when the King wished upon the triforce. It should have basically been ""roll credits, the end"" for the series in that timeline since ""a good heart wished upon the triforce"", as told in the legends. Thats essentially Harry killing Voldemort right there, or Frodo dropping the ring in Mt. doo-doo. Yet, we still see 2 games spin off from WW. That just didn't make sense to me."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"A good person reuniting the Triforce has never signified the end of the series. We've seen it happen five times, and only one of those times marks the end of a timeline. A good Triforce wish usually results in an era of prosperity, but there's nothing saying that era will be eternal, and in practice it never is."
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,1 point,Wed May 27 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"You are right. I looked back on some of the cutscenes from OoT, and it says that if a good person wishes upon the triforce, it'll lead Hyrule into ""an age of prosperity"". I suppose this was done in the event that an evil person got to the Triforce first, Hyrule wouldn't be fucked for all eternity. The downside is that the same is true if a good person wishes upon it.  So it's just a constant battle to be the first one to the triforce in every new 'age'. My question is then, how come in OoT, the triforce split when Ganondorf touched it? Technically speaking, he won and found the triforce fair and square, so it should've been an age of evil. The triforce shouldn't have split, Link shouldn't have been able to stop him. You could say it did last for 7 years until Link reawakened 7 years later, but I would think that 7 years is hardly ""an age"". To be fair, the legend technically only says that it lasts for ""an age"" if a good person touches it, but that if an evil person touches it, ""the world is consumed by evil"".... it doesn't necessarily say for how long with option B. So what then? Did the triforce split in Ocarina of Time as one last defense mechanism against evil, and that we don't quite know much about this defense mechanism? If so, can anyone cite similar evidence in other games?"
truezelda,37esrr,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 20:34:52 2015 UTC,"Sheik explains the nature of the Triforce to Link in OoT:   The Triforce... the sacred triangle... it is a balance that weighs the three forces: Power, Wisdom, and Courage. If the heart of the one who holds the sacred triangle has all three forces in balance, that one gain the True Force to govern all. But, if that one's heart is not in balance, the Triforce will separate into three parts: Power, Wisdom, and Courage. Only one part will remain for the one who touched the Triforce... the part representing the force that one most believes in. If that one seeks the True Force, that one must acquire the two lost parts. Those two parts will be held within two others chosen by destiny, who will bear the Triforce mark on the back of their hands.   Ganondorf's heart was not balanced, so when he touched the Triforce, he received only Power. Wisdom and Courage went to Zelda and Link, respectively. For Ganon to obtain the complete Triforce, he would have to take the other two pieces from them. This happens in the Downfall Timeline and nearly happens in WW."
truezelda,37c7mn,henryuuk,18,Tue May 26 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"That Hilda reformed at the end of ALBW. If she was faking it, then Zelda just handed her greatest threat her own personal Triforce and there's nothing stopping Hilda from using it to conquer Hyrule."

truezelda,37c7mn,bryanvickersband,3,Tue May 26 22:44:54 2015 UTC,Zelda still comes out ahead in the theoretical arms race. She has a working triforce and a seasoned hero with the sword of evil's bane. Hilda only has a triforce (of questionable power) and a hero that maybe just found the courage to fight.

Even if the original is all powerful there is no gurantee that a remade triforce will be as powerful as it once was.  And to be honest I feel that the whole 'all powerful' bit of the triforce might be a bit stretching it. Even when people have possessed the entire thing it hasn't really done THAT much overwhelming.
truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Wed May 27 11:08:40 2015 UTC,"Do we have proof that a triforce was used to destroy the triforce? I thought they just said they destroyed it.   You're right that they never say how.  Of course, if they did it without a Triforce, that means that the Triforce isn't quite as strong as we think, so that doesn't exactly break the theory.   Even if the original is all powerful there is no gurantee that a remade triforce will be as powerful as it once was.   Why?  It's the same thing.  You could word the wish as ""Remake Lorule's old Triforce the way it was"", and it would have to come back exactly the same.  I guess if you worded it ""give Lorule a brand new Triforce"" it could be different.   Even when people have possessed the entire thing it hasn't really done THAT much overwhelming.   That's because it only does things based on wishes.  And very few people have made wishes.  Ganon's wish was to rule the world.  He was then allowed to rule the Dark World (the Triforce does perhaps seem limited by dimension).  Link's wishes include killing a demon, reversing Ganon's work (ALL of it, which is basically the Dragonballs and a half), and reforging a Triforce.  Meanwhile, the Royal Family has used it to gain prosperity, which is fairly short-sighted but not necessarily bad.  And end the Great Flood, which is pretty all-powerful if you ask me, considering it's creating matter (water) out of nothing.  Unless the whole ocean dropped a couple inches that day."
truezelda,37c7mn,Serbaayuu,2,Wed May 27 11:20:06 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that as the triforce is meant to be a balance of the three virtues that the wish would have to be wise and thus there might be an element of monkey's paw in it.   As in you have to make sure you make the right wish or it could backfire on you to some extent.   So Ganon's wish might of been to 'make the world his' and so the sacred realm corrupted to become a world that matched the darkness in his heart rather than him ruling the sacred realm as it was.  So perhaps the triforce was only remade enough to save their world in which case it might no longer have wish granting abilities.
truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,2,Wed May 27 12:19:01 2015 UTC,"I have a similar belief to this. In another active post, I said that I don't think that the Triforce grants literal wishes. I think it more-or-less projects onto Hyrule, that which is in the bearer's heart. In other words, if a person with a good heart touches the Triforce, it acknowledges them and gives Hyrule an age of prosperity, but if someone with an evil heart touches it, Hyrule is plunged in darkness. In OoT, reread Zelda's telling of the story when Link meets her in the courtyard. I know she specifically uses the word ""wish"" but the phrasing ""wishes upon"" leads me to believe that its not an actual wish. Like, you can't just wish for whatever you want. The Triforce is more like a scale that reads the heart of the person who touches it, and then it tips to one side or the other, either Good or Evil, based on that person's heart. After that ""age"" ends, the scale resets, waiting for someone else to come along and tip the scale once more.  All of the 'wishes' that have been made on the Triforce that we've seen have had specific ""wishes"" given, but they are always aligned with this idea. For example, in WW, the King wishes for hope. The king obviously has a good heart. Yes he wishes for Hyrule to be flooded, and it is flooded, but maybe that was the best way for the Triforce to tip the scale to match his heart. Maybe the Triforce complies with your actual verbal wish to an extent, but only so far that it fulfills its role in either providing a golden age, or consuming  Hyrule with darkness. Maybe that is why the wishes we have seen are being fulfilled, only because those particular wishes allow the Triforce to 'tip the scale' so-to-speak. Tying this back into OP's question, I think the idea that the Triforce ""grants any wish"" isn't so much a lie, but that its a misinterpretation.  Some people think Heaven is a place where you can do whatever you want and be happy, and others see it as a state of being where you are at peace. It's kind of like that, I guess."

If they wished to save Lorule the triforce that was seen at the end may have no more power than to simply keep Lorule from collapsing. But if they wished for the triforce to be restored it may be just as powerful as the Hyrule one. Or only as powerful as a triforce can make a triforce since it's only the leftover power of the goddesses.

I looked it up recently because on another thread we were talking about how in WW, the King wished upon the Triforce, but why didn't that mean the end of the series in that timeline. I figured that based on that part of the Creation Story, combined with Demise's curse as described in SS, the Triforce's granting of a wish only lasts and age, and then things kind of reset until the next time Demise and Hylia are reincarnated."
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,2,Mon Jun 1 09:26:17 2015 UTC,"It's a figure of speech >.>    ""An age of prosperity"" in the same way that if Demise had won, the world would have been plunged into an era of darkness, etc...    it's not an actual measurement of time."
truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"Thats the way I saw it too, until someone brought up some questions about it that got me thinking. Now, I think it refers that that time's iteration of the struggle between the triforce trio (zelda, link, ganondorf), until the next time their incarnations reappear. Otherwise, WW should've been the end of that timeline, but as well know, we have ST and PH which come after that."
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"No proof? Play WW or LoZ. They are about finding pieces of a broken triforce part to reenter the sunken kingdom of Hyrule and finding all of the pieces of a broken triforce to be strong enough to fight ganon, respectively."

truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,23,Tue May 26 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"So the one that comes up for me immediately, is Happy Mask Salesman at the end of MM. When he says : The evil has left the mask    This one sentence being true or not, pretty much changes whether the HMS can be trusted and whether the Mask is still a danger to the world or not. Especially if HMS actually wanted the mask for nefarious reasons."
truezelda,37c7mn,Serbaayuu,3,Tue May 26 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"That would be cool. I like to think that the children on the moon are fragmented incarnations of the Mask's spirit and that by feeding their desires and hearing their stories, Link puts those fragments to rest, and so by facing off against the mask, Link is able to release the evil from the mask."
truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,18,Sun May 31 13:14:36 2015 UTC,"The Golden Goddesses created the world and the Triforce.  Now, I'm not arguing that the Triforce wasn't left by some divine beings - Hylia tells us as much - but I don't trust the Deku Tree (who wasn't alive) nor 10-year-old Princess Zelda to have a fully accurate grasp of ""beginning of time"" history.    ""There is only one Twilight Mirror"", this might not be a lie as much as a misguided belief.  If someone created the Twilight Realm, I find it hard to believe that they would leave only one passageway (which can be destroyed) between it and the other realms.    ""The people believed that the Hero of Time would come to save them.  ...But the hero did not appear.""  Wind Waker is the biggest opportunity for facts to be left behind by the Flood and replaced with legends in the entire series.  We see evidence of it already: the people at the time believed the Hero of Time would rescue them.  That's impossible, because the Hero of Time doesn't time travel.  Those people had no idea how his ""time travel"" actually worked.  Now, imagine you live in a civilization that worships the Hero of Time, and evil arrives in the world.  You look for the Hero of Time.  Enter the Hero of the Flood.  Wait, no, that's not right -- he's not the Hero of Time at all.  Look, he's too young, and he's claiming he has nothing to do with the Legendary Hero.  Just another upstart trying to capitalize on the legends.  Ignore him.  ...See how simple it would be for the true Hero of that era to fail, which caused the Flood?    Speaking of the Flood... the idea that it was caused by ""the Goddesses"".  I have always thought that it was meant to be obvious that King Daphnes called down the Flood himself.  Perhaps he used the Triforce of Wisdom to do so (which could explain why Hyrule wasn't destroyed, he didn't have the full relic).  Everybody says ""the Goddesses"" did it, but King Daphnes has a very personal regret for what happened to his kingdom.  Too personal, I think, for a man who does not hold some responsibility.  He also directly invokes the gods when using the Triforce anyway, so he might actually believe that using the Triforce is simply a means of talking to the divine beings (it's probably not).    Can't think of any more right now~"
truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,2,Tue May 26 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the whole 'misguided beliefs' concept. I literally just posted something above sharing my view on that. I like your idea of the King calling down the flood. That seems likely to me. I think if the Goddesses meant to flood the land, they would've flooded the whole thing. Hyrule is still Hyrule. The lands above the flood are still Hyrule, its just that the actual towns and villages where they actually used to live are now under water. It would make more sense for the king to have called the flood if Hyrule Kingdom was still preserved (differentiating Hyrule (the overall world) from Hyrule Kingdom (the place in Hyrule where the King lived). If the Goddesses wanted to flood Hyrule (the world) as a way to erase some mistakes or balance the scales a little bit, if doesn't make sense that they would continue to leave Hyrule Kingdom intact. Like you said, maybe the king wasn't powerful enough to flood his kingdom. Or maybe he purposely left his kingdom intact because he hoped that one day, after the evil was gone, he could receed the waters and everything could go back to the way it was. It would explain why he was so attached and held on for so long, and also why he stayed behind at the end of the game, because he realized he needed to let it go, and go down with his ship. Or maybe he left his kingdom in tact simply because he knew the Master Sword was down there and the flood was his way of attempting to buy time until a hero could appear, and then he could guide the hero down there to get the Master sword and go to work."
truezelda,37c7mn,Serbaayuu,7,Sun May 31 13:12:09 2015 UTC,That Ravio lacked the courage to confront Hilda and Yuga. In hero mode he mentions not having much magic left. Is it possible then that it is that he didn't have enough magic left to fight Yuga(should it come to a fight)? Or perhaps he literally 'lacks the courage' because of the lorule triforce destruction and feels that only a hero marked by the triforce can save Lorule?
truezelda,37c7mn,Crim_drakenya,3,Wed May 27 07:21:27 2015 UTC,"I think Ravio's thing was that he felt it was hopeless to do anything at that point.  Hilda was set in her plan, and even if he had tried to sway her previously, he gave up.  Also on ""not having enough magic"", it is true that his bracelet didn't do anything until Yuga ""charged"" it by turning Link into a painting."
truezelda,37c7mn,Serbaayuu,3,Wed May 27 11:13:48 2015 UTC,That Link's awakening is all a dream.  We've already seen proof that Link goes to parallel universes and what not. Perhaps rather than being a dream the island merely vanishes back to some other dimension until the windfish sleeps again.
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,6,Wed May 27 07:14:30 2015 UTC,"I actually think the island is a a physical manifestation of the windfish's dreams, but that it is, in a way, actually there. The 'fact' Marin turns into a seagull seems to possibly hint that the windfish can 'create' stuff"
truezelda,37c7mn,Serbaayuu,2,Wed May 27 17:00:22 2015 UTC,Interesting concept. Or does it instead turn things like seagulls into people to populate its dream world and after the dream ends...they turn back to normal
truezelda,37c7mn,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu May 28 10:38:04 2015 UTC,"You only see the seagull in the true ending, I think, so that would suggest that it didn't exist beforehand and was in fact the dream-Marin being turned into a seagull."

Like, if he were actually born Kokiri but his parents for some reason or another were removed and the Deku Tree just doesn't want people to leave the forest to be in Hyrule (then who'd taie care of mr. Old tree?). But you know, since Link was the one who removed the evil from the Deku Tree, it was decided that he could be the one chosen to save everything, so he made something up.  Or if it was just superstition that Kokiri die when they leave the forest simply because they never return."
truezelda,37c7mn,Phoxxent,6,Wed May 27 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"I think kokiri's dieing outside the forest is most definitly superstition, considering they are outside during the celebrations"

truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,4,Wed May 27 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"Or if it was just superstition that Kokiri die when they leave the forest simply because they never return.   It's less superstition and more cautionary legend.  The kokiri are seen as quite vulnerable, this includes in Wind Waker.  They'd be taken advantage of if they went out into the world - especially during wartime (which is basically what the era around OoT is).  So, it's easy enough to get them all to stay home by telling them the outside world is scary-death-time."
truezelda,37c7mn,solaris1990,4,Wed May 27 11:12:01 2015 UTC,"But then he wouldn't have grown up while he was asleep. Supposedly, Kokiri never grow up."

truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,2,Sun May 31 13:23:06 2015 UTC,"Now, I have not kept it a secret that I do not believe Ganondorf at the end of Wind Waker, that it sounds more like retroactive justification and fancy words to befuddle more than the actual truth... but what if we take this not trusting ganon a step further... what if he wasn't actually going to destroy Hyrule. What if, at least at the beginning of OoT, he was trying to bring prosperity to all, and sought the triforce to do so. What if Zelda herself was lying, as little girls are sometimes wont to do. So now we have a princess trying to defame a peacemaker, and ends up causing something that rivals a civil war, turning all the people against ganondorf, whose wish turns from prosperity to ""why won't you give me your time"", which his magic then starts to mirror. So, we, as Link, helped to destroy Hyrule by helping the princess and spreading her message."
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,6,Wed May 27 02:34:03 2015 UTC,That doesn't make sense cause Ganondorf already did all his bad stuff before you meet zelda.
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,0,Wed May 27 17:03:56 2015 UTC,But Zelda didn't just start disliking Ganondorf the moment you meet her.
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,4,Wed May 27 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"But how would Zelda disliking him change the fact the gorons refuse to give their stone to him and that his reaction is : ""STARVATION IT IS !"""
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,0,Wed May 27 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"But do we know he actually did that? She had started her defamation campaign prior to us meeting her. He had likely went to the Gorons and negotiated with them, trying to get them to lend him their support. However, Zelda had already conspired against him, so they were set against him from the moment he enters the room. Any catastrophe that happens afterwards or surrounding that is likely to be attributed to him, and given how Death Mountain had been semi-active at that point, it is not unlikely for a boulder to be erupted and cover the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern."
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,2,Wed May 27 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"You do remember that the Gorons are a race that only listens to those that proof themselves (their brothers : the king) who live at the top of a mountain that LITERALLY has ""death"" in its name and that zelda is a 10 year old girl with stories of vague dreams that even her own father don't believe right?"
truezelda,37c7mn,hylian-pudding,-1,Wed May 27 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"Did not remember the first part, but the second part: and order from the princess is still an order from a member of the royal family, so you'd best do as you are told."
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 18:33:23 2015 UTC,"No 10 year old princess is ever going to be able to convince the ZORA KING and GORON PATRIACH of ALLIED TRIBES (note : not 'servant tribes', they live and work together, the gorons are not 'below' the hylians, and the gorons only listen to the king because of the King did SOMETHING to proof he was worthy of their respect)    If Zelda went up to Darunia and said : ""You gotta listen to me cause my daddy is the king"", Darunia would laugh in her face, yelll at her and send her crying home.     Zelda couldn't even convince her own father, how would she convince the zora king, the Goron leader AND an ancient wise tree ? NONE of which need to listen to her, because they all outrank her. not to mention those monsters that appear out of nowhere. Who 'just so happen' to all appear after people turn down Ganondorf, someone we KNOW has access to monster summons since he uses it later in the game.    .  There is a difference between 'staying critical' and 'ignoring any and all signs just to disproof the clear and obvious'    NOTHING ganondorf does in the ENTIRETY of OoT, is good. He shoots a child for not saying him in what direction someone fled, he attacked the royal family, he brainwashed his own tribe to serve as soldiers, he tried to murder-genocide every other tribe, when he actually is in control he STILL doesn't actually make anything better for anyone.    Name me one, JUST ONE thing, that ganondorf DOES that implies he ever had any good intentions?    Cause this entire  strain of thought rellies on : ""what if what Zelda says is a lie"" To which my answer is simple: ""What if the ONE time ganondorf implies good actions was a lie?"" (the one time he implies it, IMMEDIATLY FOLLOW BY HIM KNOCKING YOU UNCONSIOUS!!!)"
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,-1,Wed May 27 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, you raise good points that I had overlooked and thus failed to consider. It is true that his actions make it hard to say ""he was trying to do good"", and it is also true that the monarchs of these tribes would not listen and heed the words of the princess of one of their allies, but who says she goes straight to the monarch? Who is to say she hadn't been rallying those of lower ranks, such as guards or advisors. These people would say to their king, when ganondorf walks in ""Princess Zelda says that this man is evil."" the king replies ""Hmf, she is a child, what does she know?"" the guard responds ""Yes, my king."" But then ganondorf asks for the spiritual stone and their help. The request of the spiritual stone can be seen as offensive, and depending on how he requests their help, that can be offensive as well. So the king refuses. He then says ""Perhaps Princess Zelda is right about this man, wretch that he is.""  The next question is that of the events. They certainly did happen, but how? Is it possible that his magic is not fully his to control? Could he accidentally cast a curse, by thinking ill thoughts? If so, then these events do make sense. It would also make sense that if his magic is based on his thoughts, then thoughts to put others under his will would summon minions to do so, and dark and forbidden magic that it is will summon monsters.  But this is all just speculation, after all, as you say, he shoots Link for remaining silent, and Twinrova who serve him certainly do not attempt for peace. To answer your question, no, I cannot think of anything he does which is undoubtedly good. But this was a fun thought to entertain."
truezelda,37c7mn,solaris1990,2,Wed May 27 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think the change in Ganondorf's behavior from OoT and WW is mostly because of the time he spent sealed away. I think it gave him time to retrospect himself and figure out exactly why he was doing what he was doing. Remember, he was locked away for a very long time, and he had done a lot of shit in the events leading up to and through OoT. Being sealed away probably gave him time to reconsider how he gets shit done. Plus, when he finally comes out of confinement, he looks around and he goes, ""uhhh this isnt the same Hyrule I remember it being..."" Then he realizes that all but a few of his followers are gone, the world that he wanted to take over is under a few inches of water... he needs to reconsider what his goals are. He is a wiser, older ganondorf, but still just as ambitious as he ever was. We see him lose his cool a few times in WW, but for the most part, getting locked up in the Sacred Realm for a century has taught him a shit-ton of patience."
truezelda,37c7mn,noopenusernames,1 point,Sun May 31 13:31:10 2015 UTC,I always sort of saw it as the more powerful or close to power he becomes the more maniacal and caricature evil he turns. Something to do with being Demise incarnate and being susceptible to the ToP (two aspects to his personality if you will).  I don't think someone as evil as he supposedly is would really have any need to engage in 'retrospective justification' so I don't think it can be that alone if we take his evilness at face value. Patience and reassessing his approach very likely had something to do with it too.
truezelda,37c7mn,Dismas423,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:18:57 2015 UTC,"Not a bad point. I think we could say he is far less powerful in WW than he was in OoT (significantly less followers, limited magic use, and probably a couple of other things you could look into). Getting further from that power allowed his other 2 parts, like wisdom, influence him a little more."
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"I actually had a long discussion with another user about Ganondorf's possible good side. If you take his words as truth, and don't assume he's lying through his teeth, he actually is a pretty noble guy. He tries to diplomatically solve things at first, rather than flat out attack. As you mentioned, he says he's trying to bring prosperity to all (rather than just Hylians). He doesn't actually hurt anyone himself. He never hurts Zelda when he has her captured (not in OoT nor WW). And really, it sort of just sits there patiently.  It's only once Zelda/Link start to interfere that shit goes down.  Like a guy who's fighting for all the right reasons, but does all the wrong things."
truezelda,37c7mn,Dismas423,6,Wed May 27 03:03:03 2015 UTC,He kills the deku tree with a curse (And thus dooms the kokiri forest) HE tries to starve the gorons and he curses the guardian of the zoras    but we already had this talk
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,1 point,Wed May 27 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"He kills the deku tree with a curse (And thus dooms the kokiri forest)   Allegedly.   HE tries to starve the gorons and he curses the guardian of the zoras   Allegedly. From what I see, Ganondorf offered to help the gorons. They refused that offer.   but we already had this talk   Naturally. The TL;DR is that naturally Ganondorf is evil. He's written to be evil, he's the villain, and so he's going to do evil things. That isn't the point of the discussion. I don't think anyone is trying to argue that Ganondorf is actually 100% good. Just that when put into a certain light, can be seen to have a 'good' cause (even if he doesn't achieve it, and acts counterintuitively to the cause).  Again, in my other comments I mention politicians. Same thing. Good ideas/causes, but then they almost never do them, and quite often do the opposite. It's not that those people are evil (at least, I don't think people are trying to argue Obama's the devil). But they certainly aren't the best people in the world, and they certainly act out 'evil' things.  Again, fighting for all the right reasons, but do all the wrong things."
truezelda,37c7mn,hylian-pudding,5,Wed May 27 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Ganondorf can NOT be seen as good, cause NONE of his actions are good. LITERALLY NONE. So far the closest thing we see 'good' from him is 'not killing anyone he even just glances at' Which is neutral at best. And the only other thing we EVER 'perceive' of him getting good intentions, are nothing more but a story HE tells us ('alledgedly' he did it cause of 'wind of death') which he IMMEDIATLY follows up with an attack which relies on Link being off-guard.    If you are trying to reason for any other boss, I would agree you could possibly make them seem like a victim of circumstance with good intentions. Vaati : easy, corrupted by the power he obtained to 'proof' himself Zant : Thought he was doing the right thing for his people (actually suicides to take down ganondorf at the end of the game in a minor 'redeeming' moment) fucking Bellum : AFAWK, he could very well be set up by Oshus and just be a creature of great power that can't state his reasons for his actions.    but ganondorf ? no. Ganondorf has ZERO good thing on his name, and we SEE him do several of the 'alledged' things he does, and have more then enough reasoning to believe he did the rest. It would be easier to 'defend' fucking DEMISE, then ganondorf, cause atleast Demise seems to be a beloved ruler of his 'people' who was 'merely trying to get a piece of the triforce pie' Ganondorf was even hated by his own tribe at the end (no wonder considering what he did)"
truezelda,37c7mn,Phoxxent,3,Wed May 27 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Ganondorf can NOT be seen as good, cause NONE of his actions are good.   Diplomatically discussing country relations isn't good? Helping Zant reclaim the throne is not good? Working towards getting his people out of the desert isn't good? Offering to remove the boulder in front of the goron's cave isn't good?   LITERALLY NONE.   I don't want to get into moral subjectivity, but that's quite decisive statement. Quite a lot of things that Ganondorf does can be seen as good. Naturally, his net outcome is evil. And naturally he does evil acts (even if they were with good intentions).  It's like you can't even understand the concept of an anti-hero. As I mentioned, evil would be someone like Majora. Ganondorf, it appears, to simply do evil acts, but with a good intention in mind (well, at least early on).   So far the closest thing we see 'good' from him is 'not killing anyone he even just glances at'   Ganondorf, AFAIK, never actually killed anyone on screen. He never attacked anyone.  IIRC, here's what we see Ganondorf do: Hit link out of the way (not kill him, not injure him, just knock him out of the way), we see him diplomatically consult the king of hyrule, we see him kidnap Zelda (arguably evil, but if you consider his goal 'good' it's an act done for the greater good), and we see him... defend himself from Link. Fuck, he doesn't even chase you as you flee the castle. He just sort of accepts his defeat.  Literally everything else is speculation and trusting people who already have a bias against the Gerudo people.   Which is neutral at best.   Saying that anything we see Ganondorf do is evil is a stretch. The most evil thing we see him do is kidnap Zelda. Which, while evil, he's not intentionally after Zelda herself. He's after her triforce piece (his whole damn reason for getting out of bed). It's worth noting that after Ganondorf gets what he's after, he literally doesn't give a shit about the people who are trying to kill him.  At the end of OoT there's a fight. But Link was the one who initiated, not Ganondorf. Ganondorf fights back, and naturally tries to obtain the triforce. In WW we see he's realized his mistake, and simply 'extracts' the triforce from the two individuals and then just sort of tosses them aside. His goal isn't to kill them or be evil. It's to obtain the triforce. Hell, the entire game of WW he's just kicking back and relaxing while his bird goes and looks for it.   And the only other thing we EVER 'perceive' of him getting good intentions, are nothing more but a story HE tells us ('alledgedly' he did it cause of 'wind of death')   I see no reason not to take him on his word. All of his actions line up with the goal he has stated. He never strays from that goal. It does cause him to do evil things, and I'm not arguing against that. But to say he's evil because of that is a bit silly. And is, quite frankly, the entire point of the discussion.   which he IMMEDIATLY follows up with an attack which relies on Link being off-guard.   I don't remember that being how it went down. See here. He flat out says what his goal is (he wants to call down the gods, and he covets the wind, yada yada). Then he says he already has two pieces, and needs the third. It's explicitly clear what's going on. Link readies into a battle pose. Ganondorf kicks his ass, knocks him down, and then flat out says ""Worry not. I'm not gonna fucking kill you. I don't give a shit about you."" And clearly says ""I only need what dwells inside you."" AKA the triforce. He then drops link after he takes the triforce.  And what does he motherfucking wish for? To return hyrule to the sky. To Remove the flood that not only imprisoned him, but hyrule as well. Yes, he wants to rule that land (like any power-hungry person would), but he wants the land to return and not be sunken away. But he's stopped. By guess who? The king of hyrule who wishes for: Giving the children hope, and sinking the area that they are, drowning ganondorf. That's literally his 'wish'. To drown ganondorf. Here's a quote:   Ganondorf! May you drown with Hyrule!!   Compare this to Ganondorf's wish:   Expose this land to the rays of the sun once more! Let them burn forth! Give Hyrule to me!!   Which one seems more evil to you? Drowning Hyrule, and some guy along with it? Or to restore Hyrule to what it once was, while letting him rule over it. What he really wants is to control the 'wind' of hyrule. What is that? Let's see what he says earlier:   When the sun rose into the sky, a burning wind punished my lands, searing the world. And when the moon climbed into the dark of night, a frigid gale pierced our homes. No matter when it came, the wind carried the same thing... Death.   That's the wind in his land (gerudo desert). He contrasts this with Hyrule:   But the winds that blew across the green fields of Hyrule brought something other than suffering and ruin.     See?   I coveted that wind, I suppose.   He motherfucking covets that wind. He wants the life and prosperity of Hyrule, and not to be stuck with some shit desert. That's straight out of the horse's mouth. And as soon as he gets the triforce, what's he wish for? Motherfucking hyrule. He wants to not be stuck with the shit land of the desert, and he wants to rule over the peaceful/nice land of Hyrule.  It's worth noting that he also wants to break free from the ""Zelda cycle"" of being reincarnated time after time:   Do not fear. I will not kill you... * I merely have need of the power that dwells within you. Now! Let *us put an end to that which binds us together!   He cares not to hurt Link/Zelda and friends. He just wants to not be stuck with such a shitty desert.  Only once he's sealed to drowning via triforce wish, does he not give any fucks about killing people. He realized what just happened was that the King of Hyrule literally just sealed in Hyrule's fate into being flooded permanently. And Ganondorf clearly realizes that since he's gone, someone else is most likely going to try and take the triforce (he flat out says he wants to show them how much the triforce is worth).  It's pretty clear that Ganondorf is the only individual in that end scene that knows wtf is going on. And other people are calling him insane because of it. Everyone in that scene (except Ganondorf) wants hyrule to be flooded.   If you are trying to reason for any other boss, I would agree you could possibly make them seem like a victim of circumstance with good intentions.   Except a lot of the other villains don't really have any sort of 'good motive' going for them.   Zant : Thought he was doing the right thing for his people (actually suicides to take down ganondorf at the end of the game in a minor 'redeeming' moment)   Ganondorf actually helped him reclaim his throne. Though, I'll admit I don't remember much of TP.   Vaati : easy, corrupted by the power he obtained to 'proof' himself   Vaati flat out attacks people for no real reason. He doesn't need to turn Zelda into stone. Yet he does.   fucking Bellum : AFAWK, he could very well be set up by Oshus and just be a creature of great power that can't state his reasons for his actions.   That's the definition of unwarranted evil.   but ganondorf ? no.   Ganondorf is the only villain with a clear motive that can arguably be seen as good. He just... goes about it in a horrible way.   and we SEE him do several of the 'alledged' things he does,   Link? I don't think I've ever actually seen Ganondorf do something 'evil'. The only ever time he acts evilly is when he's flat out attacked, or when he's pretty much lost everything (including his mind). He tries to act rationally and fairly throughout his efforts.   It would be easier to 'defend' fucking DEMISE   Demise doesn't have much going either way. The only thing we have on him is an unreliable narrator describing a past war. Not a fair comparison.   cause atleast Demise seems to be a beloved ruler of his 'people' who was 'merely trying to get a piece of the triforce pie'   I think you are mixing up Demise/Ganondorf. Demise doesn't have 'people'. And it's unclear of the motivation for chasing the triforce.  If I had to say, Demise looks like he's in the ""Cia position"" of having  great power, and then ends up abusing it.   Ganondorf was even hated by his own tribe at the end (no wonder considering what he did)   What he did? Please, do go on. Be sure to include only things that directly show ganondorf doing the act you describe.   He was certainly hated by his tribe, but we can't be certain of the reason. Most likely it's because he's a power-hungry shit ruler with no sense of boundaries."
truezelda,37c7mn,Kafke,5,Wed May 27 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"Diplomatically discussing country relations isn't good?   Diplomacy is not good inherently, diplomacy is only as good as what you are using it for. If I 'diplomatically' go tell a country to give me money or I bomb their asses, then I'm not using diplomacy right. We haven't learned of any of the diplomatic propositions ganondorf made.     Helping Zant reclaim the throne is not good?     Reclaim implies it was ever his to begin with : SPOILER : it wasn't. Zant THOUGHT he deserved the crown, but he never did. It was always going to go to Midna.     Working towards getting his people out of the desert isn't good?      Your entire little 'theory' stands on its little feeble legs by assuming we CAN'T TRUST WHAT ANYONE TELLS US, if we didn't see it ourselves. So, please do tell of all the 'work' ganondorf did to get his people out of the desert. Cause not a single gerudo leaves the desert throughout all of OoT except ganondorf himself.     Offering to remove the boulder in front of the goron's cave isn't good?     He didn't 'offer' for it, he made a deal, and the boulder only 'appeared' their (Obviously by sheer concidence amirite) AFTER he went to talk with the gorons. (Coincidentally after they refused to give him their stone, just like how gohma and barinade apepared COINCIDENTALLY afterwards)     I don't want to get into moral subjectivity, but that's quite decisive statement. Quite a lot of things that Ganondorf does can be seen as good. Naturally, his net outcome is evil. And naturally he does evil acts (even if they were with good intentions). It's like you can't even understand the concept of an anti-hero. As I mentioned, evil would be someone like Majora. Ganondorf, it appears, to simply do evil acts, but with a good intention in mind (well, at least early on).     An antihero should still actually be DOING good, but does so for his own gain/ulterior motives. Wario saving an entire world from an invading pirate, but doing so because he wants to steal the pirates' treasure, is what an antihero does. ganondorf doesn't actually do ANY good. You name these random facts, but none of them are actually good, and the one thing you keep replying, is something he SAYS he wanted to do. but again : you yourself are saying to not trust words, only actions.    well then : Show me a moment where ganondorf does something good, or does something for a good reason SPOILER : you can't.     Ganondorf, AFAIK, never actually killed anyone on screen. He never attacked anyone. IIRC, here's what we see Ganondorf do: Hit link out of the way (not kill him, not injure him, just knock him out of the way)   K then...    Ganondorf's minions attack Link under his command, something he himself admits. he even does the whole : ""WAHAHA I'm so evil"" thing after you defeat phantom ganondorf.    .  You also have an entire section about his little emotional dribble which I'm not even gonna touch.  You keep saying : ""Can't trust anyone"" but then you trust the words of the kidnapping powerhungry sorcerrer that hasn't been SEEN doing anything good.    not a SINGLE action we see him do is good. not fucking one.    So tell me, why are ganondorf's words more important, never mind, it's called confirmation bias, and cause else the entire idea falls over because it barely had a single leg to stand on."

I have personally always taken Ganondorf at his word in everything he says in WW, because he has literally no reason to lie and he backs up everything he says after he says it, like you showed. And since this is the same ganondorf from OoT, there has to be some prevailing truth from OoT that ties them together. I just think that in OoT, Ganondorf wasn't as mature as he is now, so maybe his ideas about how to get shit done were different, but getting sealed away for a century gives you time to think..."
truezelda,37bfaw,palimer6,14,Tue May 26 11:41:44 2015 UTC,"I believe that Malladus is an incarnation of Demise. He is the only villain in the series besides Ganon and Demise to use the title ""Demon King"". Malladus's spirit has a color scheme similar to that of Ganon from LoZ, blue and red. His beast form looks like a cross of beast Ganon's appearances in LoZ and TP. Also similar to Ganon and Demise, he requires Zelda to be sacrificed in order to be properly resurrected. Anjean specifically says that Malladus needs ""a vessel from the royal line of ancient Hyrule, with sacred power coursing through its veins"" in order to be revived, making it pretty clear that, like Demise, Malladus requires the power of Hylia to regain his strength. Since he parallels the other two Demon Kings so closely, it makes sense for Malladus to be a reincarnation of Demise."
truezelda,37bfaw,Dismas423,6,Tue May 26 12:28:49 2015 UTC,"Malladus' resurrection parallels Demise's really well.  Demise is a leftover body which requires a soul, so he rips Zelda's soul out of her body.  Malladus is a leftover soul which requires a body, so he rips Zelda's body away from her soul.  That's not really to say that that ritual is unique to a Demise incarnation, of course."
truezelda,37bfaw,Serbaayuu,12,Tue May 26 12:42:08 2015 UTC,"ALL GAMES SPOILER WARNING  Demise's Hatred will be incarnated when the Hero and Goddess appear.  That is the criteria for his curse - so we have to assume that it will always occur when those two people are born.  However, we also know that resurrection and unsealing counts as ""incarnation"" for this curse.  See: ALttP, Zelda 1, ALBW, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess... most of the games, in fact.  It also seems probable that there is only one incarnation per era.  That is, even though ALttP Link went on several adventures, only one Demise Incarnation was created for him (that being his encounter with Ganon).  Obviously, other people can meddle with this whole thing - Twinrova tries to resurrect Ganon a second time in OoX, but I don't count that as an activity of Demise's Curse, it's just someone else meddling.  So, Demise:   Ganondorf.  He was born at the time of the Hero of Time and OoT Zelda. Vaati.  Or, rather, the power in the Bound Chest.  The backstory of Minish Cap tells of a Hero and a Princess Zelda in the old war - so there was likely an incarnation of Demise leading the demon armies back then.  If that incarnation got sealed in the chest, Vaati could have absorbed it.  Vaati himself isn't the incarnation, but he basically revives it at that time, similarly to Yuga.  Also, if Vaati/The power in the Bound Chest are NOT Demise, it means the MC Hero and Hylia as well as the ones spoken of in the MC backstory have no Demise Incarnation, which should not be possible, unless they are not incarnations themselves. Ganondorf II (Four Swords Adventures).  At some point the old Ganondorf died and a new one appeared.  Otherwise he's pretty much exactly the same. Malladus.  His look, and the fact that he was created while the storyline of Demise was probably being written, gives him the most solid footing out of the side-villains.   Not Demise:   Onox & Veran: Mere minions. Yuga: Comes from a parallel world, which has nothing to do with Demise. Zant: Unrelated to Demise, acts as his pawn. Majora: An entity who is likely from a parallel world as well - unrelated. Bellum: Another parallel world entity. Nightmare: Barely even real, a manifestation of the Wind Fish's mind.     EDIT: You know, I thought about this some more, and what if Cole is actually the Demise incarnation?  He was likely born well after Ganondorf died, and it's truly his body that causes Malladus to appear like Ganon.  Cole is the one who seeks the power, too - he just uses Malladus as a tool (who eventually consumes him).  Malladus could merely be an ultra-powerful demon."
truezelda,37bfaw,Serbaayuu,5,Tue May 26 12:40:17 2015 UTC,"Now here's a question. Presuming that the spirit of Demise resides in Ganondorf, did that spirit return with Ganon when Twinrova brought him back from the dead?  Is it like Buffy the Vampire Slayer where if one flatlines, the power moves on to the next ""chosen one?"" Or did Demise's curse have to wait for NES Link to truly finish the job before moving on to somebody else?"

truezelda,37bfaw,TeekTheReddit,3,Tue May 26 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"Well, not really.  I admit it's hard to explain.  You've got two definitions of spirit:  Spirit - as in an entity, a ghost, a person.  Spirit - as in a set of traits, a meaning.  Used in a sentence you might see ""That boy embodies the spirit of patriotism"", or something.  I believe the Spirit of the Hero, as well as Demise's Hatred follow the second definition.  And for the Spirit of the Hero there is at least some decent evidence for that being the case."

The King of Red Lions says WW Ganon is the same figure from these ancient legends.  TP Ganondorf is also the same figure from OoT, but in a different timeline. The execution mentioned in the timeline refers to the scene in TP where the Sages attempt to execute Ganondorf. In the Child Timeline, Ganondorf was apprehended before he could enter the Sacred Realm. He was put on trial and sentenced to death. But because Link still has the Triforce of Courage at the end of OoT, the Triforce was divided in the Child Timeline. This resulted in Ganondorf gaining the Triforce of Power and using it to survive his execution. The Sages then sealed him in the Twilight Realm."

truezelda,37bfaw,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Tue May 26 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"No; just because Demise's Incarnation was originally born/revived/unsealed due to the Curse, it doesn't mean it can't happen again in the same Hero's lifetime.  It's just that all times except for the first, it's not due to the Curse.  When Ganon was resurrected in Oracle of X, it was Twinrova's doing.  As well as in Adventure of Link, his attempted resurrection was by his minions.  Even in Four Swords Adventures, where we actually (according to this theory) see two incarnations of Demise rise at once, I would argue that only Ganon rose due to the Curse, and he simply drew out the other incarnation of Demise (who just happened to be sealed at the time) to serve him.  The most important thing about the curse, in my opinion, is that it does not alter free will.  It simply shifts the universe in a way such that some inevitable things happen."

PH and ST seem to prove this by introducing a succession of villains who explicitly have nothing to do with Ganon, though Malladus is so similar it's hard not to believe he's the next incarnation of Demise. same with Link's Awakening, with a villain who was basically just ALTTP/OOX Link's memories personified; regardless of whether this was the intention, the last games in each timeline all seem to be moving away from the idea of Ganon being resurrected/breaking free from seals/materialising out of nowhere.  there are a lot of holes -- namely FSA randomly reincarnating Ganondorf II and ALBW bringing the original back from death AGAIN to say ""hey does anyone remember seeing this guy in the super nintendo game haha, but this time he's at the mercy of the people who brought him back (just like OoX)"" -- but generally i think its safe to say the series is trying to make ganondorf a closed chapter in every chronology, to make space for new incarnations of demise who could be a little more creative. and now that SS has gone and clarified just why link, zelda and Villain keep being reborn over and over, they can actually work it into the plot"

In the adult timeline, Ganon(dorf) is dead at the bottom of the ocean, and Daphnes' triforce wish is probably keeping it that way.    In the child timeline, Ganondorf dies at the end op TP, yes.  BUT!! a NEW ganondorf is born in the gerudo tribe, who becomes a new Ganon, unseals Vaati and is later sealed after Vaati is dead. So Ganon II is alive (but sealed) at that point.  Though we don't really know how/what this ganondorf is.    In the fallen timeline, Ganon is dead (for like the 80st time) but we do know Ganon's minion are trying to resurrect him again.

When he was defeated, instead of literally reincarnating I see his soul as fracturing into millions of pieces and actually creating the idea and potential of malice and evil in the world. Every evil creature would then, in some shape or form, owe their existence to his original evil ""seed"" you could say.   I feel similarly about Link because I don't like predestination shaping the actual personality of a character, I prefer to see it how Avatar The Last Airbender did it, with individuals possessing the spirit of the Avatar but still having their own traits and personalities."

Some sources say he was sealed for the first time when the settlers arrived, but others say the chains (spirit tracks) had already been around since before that. I should replay ST, but I gave it to a friend to play through atm.    Onox and Veran are a dark dragon and a witch that work for Ganon(dorf) (or for twinrova atleast) and nothing more. Vaati would be existing at the same time as Ganondorf, which I think is not something reincarnation allows for.       Bellum seems to be merely a being of chaos, possibly being its world's version of Demise, or some primordial being. Same for Majora."
truezelda,37bfaw,henryuuk,2,Tue May 26 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"I had another thought on Malladus: what if Cole is actually the Demise incarnation?  Cole was likely born after Ganondorf died.  Cole is the one who is power-hungry (the only thing Malladus ever says is that he will destroy the world, which does not mesh with Demise's conquering desire).  Cole is the one who orchestrates everything, and he's not actually commanded by Malladus - in fact he tries to manipulate him before Malladus proves too strong.  And, it's Cole's body that Malladus possesses which ends up looking similar to Ganon.  Interesting thought."
truezelda,37bfaw,Serbaayuu,2,Wed May 27 01:34:54 2015 UTC,"That actually makes way more sense tbh. Cole also seems much more 'hate filled' while malladus seems to just be ""destruction filled"""

The curses have to follow that sort of logic, otherwise all three of those people would always be the same age - Link and Zelda would have been born at the exact same time as Ganondorf, for example.    Like in Twilight Princess and Wind Waker, Ganondorf breaks his seal because the Hero and Goddess appear.  But he doesn't do that the day they're both born.  He does it at whatever time fate decides is best for him to eventually encounter them."

truezelda,379w61,HealingDDRVision,6,Tue May 26 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"I could see a mix of these working really well, if they do something similar to Majora's Mask: Give me one big overarching story hook, you're constantly reminded of, but that takes the backseat for most of the time, and many smaller/shorter storylines for specific regions.   I feel like something like that would work the best for Zelda. You can go back to its roots with an open world with little to no restrictions in terms of where you can go (but still a certain degree of being punished and/or rewarded for being too reckless/very skilled) but still retain the quirky characters, that have become kind of a staple of the series by now, and flesh them out in their own little stories. That way you could have a game that's, as a whole, adventure driven, but lets you choose in which order you tackle the ""story bits""/narrative. I guess it'd really be a little like the Zelda version of TES if you imagine it like this. (that's something a lot people compare Zelda Wii U to and I think even Aonuma said he enjoys playing those games (or at least Skyrim) from time to time)"

Skyward sword was a really good ND game, but nothing like xenoblade or even a few of the final fantasy games. ST did a pretty good job, but again nowhere near the best. One of my biggest complaints about skyrim was that everything was bland and worthless and there was no character involvment to the point where the whole thing felt like a sloppy sandbox game. This is not the route any adventure game needs to take. Part of the adventure is the depth of the world, and right now that doesn't work at all due to multiple factors. I want you to look up dwarf fortress or at least read this article. http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/23/5926447/dwarf-fortress-will-crush-your-cpu-because-creating-history-is-hard  The future of game development is procedurally generating game worlds and backstories because humans just can't keep up with technological advancements and the expectations of players any more. The wii u can handle say, a population of thousands of deeply characterized side characters, and you literally just can't do that with any size game development team. Yet this is what we expect. This is the type of progress the industry needs to stay alive. Once we hit this point in the next couple of console generations, adventure games including zelda will probably die out as games with much smaller checklists and expected features take over the market, namely CoD."

What your saying about the future of games makes sense, but I honestly don't think open world-ish games like Zelda will die out. There is a huge fan base and they are still being made. But I don't think a game like Skyrim is the route all open world games should take, because I completely agree with all the things you said about it. I agree that just because a game world is really big, doesn't make it a masterpiece. It needs to have depth."
truezelda,379w61,_slave,5,Thu Jun 11 00:53:54 2015 UTC,"All right, I see what you're getting at, but there are 3 games at most which allow you to complete the dungeons in any order. Those being: The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, and A Link Between Worlds. Every other game either requires dungeon items for progression or story based triggers in order to move forward.  That being said, given the more in depth plot of ALBW, and it's number based story triggers, I can see the series going forward combining the tastes, though it will still be more ALttP mixed with some story game, rather than the original. Which is fine, I just want more of the original. 4 quests isn't enough, god dammit!"
truezelda,379w61,ilovecosmo,3,Wed May 27 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think OoT had it nice being able to do the adult dungeons in a few different orders, but I feel the first three dungeons in both OoT & TP worked better by being stricter  Additionally I think TP, WW, & other more Narrative Driven Zelda games could've had a bit more flexibility later ...story wise it didn't seem important for certain dungeons/Sages/Pearls to be completed/saved/found to be in a given order, although from a gameplay perspective I enjoy dungeons depending on things form previous ones, so to design a set of dungeons with both flexibility and dependability is rather irksome.  Frankly I feel like the less linear dungeon orders are actually less adventurous in some ways: I feel like few of them are actually going to be much harder than a previous one, or rather I doubt they'll be significantly more 'complex' even if their puzzles are harder - a dungeon which makes use of multiple items is more complex but not necessarily harder if it's instantly apparent what you have to do......  So whilst I prefer the more ND games, the AD games tend to give me the feeling that they will be easier, a more fun & ironically 'relaxed' experience, the actual feeling of adventure kicks in whilst I play ... but I don't have the same sense of anticipation; silly as it may be that is how I tend to feel.  But a very ND game like SS ... well I feel like the way its world was compartmentalised could of made for a better AD game, & if they'd taken it that route I suspect that Fi would've been less annoying! & generally if I feel a ND game will either be liked by me or be disliked, whereas an AD game will either be liked or I'll just not be overly excited about... [so if Nintendo wanted to play it safe, go for an AD game I guess? :$ ]  I suspect & hope that the Wii U Zelda will be a more ND game, but with such a big world I think they could pull of less-linear dungeons like OoT but being more involved with the 'characters' in that area, be they members of a town there of Humans/Hylians/Gerudo/Gorons/Kokiri/Ritos/Sheikah/Zoras/etc, a larger more free world might better allow for one to be given a number of things to find/save/etc without locking you into a different order as much, & making the lack of use of items a bit more ...natural? IDK, conversely having dungeons being dependent on each other but still (partially) accessible would help emphasises travel back & forth exploring & shortcuts..?, but that could be terrible if not executed well...  I sincerely hope the non-handheld games to being more Narrative Driven, (I think the handhold games can do both quite well, but I think) a very low ND game on a console could risk being to ...bland..? Although I shudder at the thought of another SS   0 points (0% upvoted)   ...why would you do that? [deüpvote yourself]"
truezelda,379w61,solaris1990,0,Tue May 26 02:48:59 2015 UTC,"I do agree on how a very low Narrative Driven game could be too bland, but a game that allows you to play in an overall non-linear fashion can have a good, intriguing story. Sure, it may not be as in-depth as Skyward Sword, but do Zelda games really need to have amazing, in-depth stories?  Your second-to-last paragraph, I completely agree with that. I really hope that Nintendo has a non-linear Zelda game while keeping a story that involves a lot of characters.  On the topic of dungeons that you can do in any order you want, I think that if a certain dungeon is harder than the other, it will automatically be more complex. If a dungeon uses a lot of items but the puzzles are super obvious, it won't make it more complex, it will give the illusion of complexity since you have to use more items, but that's really it. There's not a lot of complex thinking involved. I don't think it would be a bad idea if, per say, if a Zelda game had 8 dungeons, they were split into two groups of four, lets say before and after you get the master sword, so you can do the first four in any order, but you have to get the master sword before you can do the next four. This allows for a sense of progression since the last four dungeons can make a better and complex use of more items that you got previously, while still keeping an overall non-linear fashion. Another idea is to maybe have the main dungeon and puzzles not make use of many items so you can beat the main dungeon no matter what, but to have side puzzles, secret chests, or maybe even a compass or dungeon map make use of items that you may or may not have yet. These can both be ways to make your items feel more useful, and make the dungeons larger and more complex, while still retaining a non-linear overall make-up."
truezelda,379emc,locustgate,13,Mon May 25 23:11:56 2015 UTC,"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/e/ee/Igos_du_Ikana.png/revision/latest?cb=20090222075451  It's... possible that these creatures were once human.  However, I don't think they were.  Here's a thought: we don't see any of the 'blin species in Termina, do we?  I've always thought that the stalchildren in Hyrule Field must be the remains of some enormous beastly army - likely the forces of evil during the Civil War.  They aren't human, and I doubt the Hylruleans used child-soldiers anyway.  In Termina, we speak to them for the first time, where they talk like adults, have a hierarchy, and generally act fairly organized.  I suggest that Ikana was originally a relatively peaceful 'blin species kingdom.  We don't know of any other beastly, sapient species to my knowledge.  It would also make sense that the armies of evil during the Hyrulean Civil War were primarily made up of 'blins.  And it fits Termina to twist that species into something that could actually resemble ""good"", in a parallel dimension."
truezelda,379emc,Serbaayuu,9,Tue May 26 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"I think that basing it off of the stalchildren could be the wrong way to approach it. Notice how they are commanded by the presence of the hat. I have a feeling the Ikanians had necromancy at their command to bring up these soldiers for them. Instead, we should look at Captain Keeta, and the Igos de Ikana, whose bone structures remind me of some sort of beast. One of the commanders looks like a dog, while the other looks more human. Captain keeta himself looks more doglike, but his large size is interesting. Of course, looking back on human history in our world, we have had some ""colossi"", and even some people with more beastlike skulls. So, I think that we can say they are humans, with necromancers, since that's the only thing to account for the variety we see."
truezelda,379emc,Phoxxent,3,Tue May 26 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's right to disregard the stalchildren, one of Igos' men looks just like a larger one."
truezelda,379emc,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue May 26 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"Well, they are also considerably tiny. Assuming the Igos as standard adult size, the stalchildren would have been, as their name implies, child soldiers. To say that they were brought back by a necromancer makes some more sense, especially since common footsoldiers wouldn't have the same immortality spell as their commanding officers, yet we still see them out and about in MM. So, if they were necromaniacal constructs in the first place, that would explain why they exist as they do in the ""modern"" day. That is why I discounted them, as they don't necessarily represent the people of Ikana."
truezelda,379emc,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue May 26 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"My impression was that the Ikanans were just another tribe of people who died out. They had been at war with the Garo, who are still apparently spying on the Ikana kingdom long after everyone is dead. This may be because of the fact that the Ikanans still remained even in undead form, so the Garo were probably trying to figure out why their enemies were still maintaining a hold on their kingdom even after they all died. They were probably also skeptical of the great tower in the back of the kingdom that seemed to have something to do with the demise of the Ikanans.... and thats basically where Link shows up. I'm debating on whether the Garo are some species of humans or more like a magical/physical being. But I totally got the impression that the Ikanans were a human species.  Perhaps if the Garo were more of a magical being, maybe that would explain why they were at war with the Ikanans, since the Ikanans had the huge ""magical tower reaching the Gods"" in their backyard and the Garo probably wanted the tower for magical purposes. This might explain why the mini boss in the Tower is a Garo himself. He might have been a Garo general or something along those lines."
truezelda,379emc,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"Although it could also be that both Ikanans and Garo were human species, and that they both lost the war after the Tower opened back up, but the evil magic of the Tower kept both sides from resting in piece and they were locked in eternal battle until Link came and cut off the evil in the tower."
truezelda,379emc,noopenusernames,2,Wed May 27 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure it is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that the Garo are a sort of undead as well.

truezelda,379emc,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri May 29 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats basically what I'm saying. Right now, both the Garo and the Ikanans are undead, but I think they both used to be human before their current predicament. In my first post, I was thinking the Garo could've been more like a necromancer species, as opposed to human, but the more I thought about that, it didn't make sense. Afterall, the game does mention that they were ninjas. Seeing how they kind of live in the desert, appear nomadic, and fight with long blades that aren't quite like the swords we see Link and the Ikanans using, I might even be willing to say they could be related to, or at least similar to the Gerudo. Even the names aren't too far off (Gerudo/Garo). I personally subscribe to the camp that doesn't believe that Termina is an alternate dimension, but rather a stranger, harder-to-get-to, far-side-of-Hyrule type of place. I believe that because I think that the tribe that created Majora's mask is the same tribe that created the mask that Midna uses in TP. Plus a lot of people like to say that Termina is an alternate world because of the fact that everyone there looks like someone from OoT.  My answer to that is that that was just Nintendo's way of saving money by having the programmers just reuse NPC models. But this is getting off-topic, so I won't say more about this."

But didn't the manual for AoL also say some stuff that was changed a little later on? I'm not arguing, I'm legitimately asking, because I don't have the manual for AoL. I wonder how loose the term ""parallel world"" is. I mean, I don't doubt it's a strange place, but I've always felt that Termina does exist in the same physical world that Hyrule Kingdom does as well. In the opening for MM, there's 2 'transitions' so to speak. There's the point at which Link falls down the rabbit hole (and all the little images show up as he's falling and whatnot), and theres the point where he walks through the last doorway into Termina and ends up in the bottom of clock tower (the hallway is one of those twisty hallways and turns as link walks through it). which of these points was Link's true crossing into Termina? Tackling the twisty hallway part, we see those in OoT's Forest Temple. When Link changes those hallways or walks through them, is he altering the dimension that Hyrule Kingdom exists in? I personally don't think so.   So then lets address the rabbit hole part;   Also, Link falls through a hole in the middle of the Lost Woods, walks a short way, and then comes up in a spot that has no Lost Woods anywhere nearby.   True, but I take the geography in the games with a grain of salt, and here's why. the maps on which all the games take place on are surrounded by mountains (for the most part). It's hard to say that all of Hyrule Kingdom in OoT is completely surrounded by mountains, but obviously the game needs some borders. For that reason, I sometimes like to think of Link falling down the rabbit hole as Link literally falling down some sort of large cavern, that maybe or may not be literally a vertical shaft. Maybe it has twists and turns and flatter parts, but its a long fall either way into some undergrowth cavernous area deep as shit in the Lost Woods, and as Link is falling and tumbling, he gets all disoriented, hence the floating stars and symbols and things that he sees as he falls. After he changes over to a deku, or wonders a bit through the cavern and finds himself in the well area of the Clock Tower.  I do agree that theres some sort of metaphysical difference between Termina and Hyrule Kingdom, but I don't know if I would go so far as to say that they are on 2 completely different planes of existence. Not anymore than I would say the curvy hallways in Forest Temple are on different planes of existence then those same hallways when they are straightened out. Or like the Tower Temple in MM is on a different plane of existence then that same temple when you shoot the crest with the light arrows. There has to be some sort of physical connection between Hyrule Kingdom and Termina, because the skull kid could go back and forth between the 2, and the Deku Butler's son pretty much found his way there, or he wouldn't if he hadn't gotten petrified first. Even the butler himself gets that far in the game credits. Yes, there is some sort of divide, but I don't think its just like Link plugging into the matrix and going somewhere that doesn't really exist. I don't think of Termina as a place that could exist anywhere at any time with infinite possibilities. Simply because the skull kid, Link, and potentially others could go back and forth with relative ease. Maybe Termina is just really really far deep into the Lost Woods. The Lost Woods have magical properties to begin with, so maybe Termina just gets exposed to high levels of magic, which create some sort of magical barrier that is difficult, but not impossible to cross, and Link and the Skull Kid just happened to find the one spot where it was easy to cross over.  TL; DR Maybe Termina is an actual, physical place in the land of Hyrule, but maybe it's just buried so deep in the Lost Woods and it is overexposed to the magic of the Lost Woods that it has some sort of magical barrier that is difficult to cross into, and so that's why it is hard to find and also why it experiences these weird occurrences."

I can live with that, if it comes down to Termina absolutely having to exist in an alternate reality. What about Subrosia though? I know most people say that Termina must be an alternate dimension because otherwise it would have to be physically located under the Lost Woods and that just wouldn't work. However, Subrosia is located physically under Labrynna, but is still some sort of alternate location. We know that because the Temple of Seasons falls from Labrynna down into Subrosia. I always get the impression though that theres some sort of magical element to it. Like, you couldn't literally dig your way into Subrosia from Labrynna. I think Termina is kind of like that. Maybe when Link falls through the rabbit hole in the Lost Woods, he kind of falls through a portal like the ones Rosa uses to go between Labrynna and Subrosia. Except Link's portal takes him to Termina, which is metaphysically located under the Lost Woods.  Just a thought..."

He goes to make new friends, not necessarily leaving his old friends behind, but not getting caught up on their absence, as skull kid had done. He learned goodbyes don't have to last forever, and that meant two things. It meant you may one day see your friends again, and that you shouldn't get caught up in saying goodbye, such that the act itself never ends for you. When it comes time to part, you say your goodbyes and move on. There is no closure needed.  I also agree with /u/Serbaayuu that a sequel to MM would be terrible, unless, of course, it's more of a life sim. Because, as far as known canon is concerned, that's what he does with the rest of his life. He settles down, starts a family and likely becomes a rancher or guard."
truezelda,374877,Phoxxent,2,Sun May 24 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, as far as I know, when Link was sent back in time, in that time his friends weren't Sages yet. They only turned Sages in the adult timeline. Someone correct me if I'm wrong."
truezelda,374877,hylian-pudding,1 point,Fri May 29 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's right. But still, his friends had to leave him shortly after he'd met them in his initial quest. I would suppose that the only person who remembers him is Saria, but doesn't want to see her for some reason, either because he feels he shouldn't go back to the woods, or something else. Maybe he thinks that seeing Saria is ""cheating"" because he already awakened her, so he shouldn't try to circumvent that through time travel shenanigans."
truezelda,374877,Phoxxent,3,Fri May 29 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think that, in the child timeline, none of the sages had to awaken, because there was no need for them. That's why they all look different in TP. At least that's what I've always assumed.  But yeah, all of his friends besides Saria didn't remember him, since he went back in time before he had met any of them. Which is really sad, if you think about it. I think he might have gone back to say hi to Saria, but as people say, he saw things. He went through things only he knew, so he probably couldn't look at Saria (or the other kokiri) the same way."
truezelda,374877,hylian-pudding,1 point,Fri May 29 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"You are correct with the first part, and I don't see any reason you could be wrong with the second."
truezelda,374877,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri May 29 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"I feel there might be a few things that aren't right about how time travel was handled in the game. It's mostly plot related. Like what made Ganon not destroy Hyrule during the 7 years Link disappeared. Was he already from the future or did the Ganon, Link fought, originate from the child time and was killed in the Adult time?"
truezelda,374877,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"What? In the seven year Link was gone, Ganon did destroy, ravage, and conquer Hyrule. As for Ganon, he's the same guy in both timelines, just in the Adult he is sealed away and in Child (which the split happens only after Link is sent back) he is executed (albeit rather poorly)."

Thanks for the feedback."
truezelda,374877,henryuuk,3,Mon Jul 6 05:00:25 2015 UTC,"A sequel following the Hero of Time and Navi searching for each other/reuniting?  The two most cardboard characters in the entire series?  Nooo.  That would make an awful story.    Navi probably died.  When fairies fulfill their purpose, they disappear.  We see this in every single game where they are used for healing.  In Wind Waker, the fire & ice arrow fairies dive into Link and vanish, giving him the items.  Other than that, the only fairies we've seen are the ones who protect the kokiri, Navi, Tatl, and Tael.  The kokiri guardians no longer exist in Wind Waker, so they must disappear at some point (they aren't needed since the koroks won't be threatened by humans in the new world of the Great Sea).  And, if a kokiri were to die, their lifelong partner would probably simply perish alongside it.  Tatl and Tael seem to be a special case (maybe they were created with no purpose), but Navi should follow the same rules as the other kokiri fairies.  When Links adventure ended, her purpose was done, so she disappeared."
truezelda,374877,Serbaayuu,7,Sun May 24 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"TBF, we don't really know if they 'dissapear' as in : 'dead' or as in : ""Retirement too a fairy spa"" Either way, Navi has no reason to reunite with Link    Could be Termina fairies are different in general."
truezelda,374877,hylian-pudding,2,Sun May 24 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"Well Termina fairies seem like they go to retirement when you use them, too."
truezelda,374877,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 24 22:55:35 2015 UTC,"Those fairies disappear because it's a game mechanic. Do you think every fairy you ever used would stick around you for the rest of the game? Maybe they don't even disappear, maybe they just fly away to heal other people or something.  Also, cardboard characters? Please."
truezelda,374877,hylian-pudding,1 point,Fri May 29 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"Those fairies disappear because it's a game mechanic.   And Link is left-handed because that's how his sprite was drawn.  That doesn't mean it's not canon.  There is no evidence to suggest that fairies don't disappear when they're used.   Also, cardboard characters? Please.   Please provide me with more than one example of character development for Navi and the Hero of Time.  And the reason I ask for two is because I can guarantee the one you're going to jump to for Navi is ""I can't lock-on to Ganon!"" -> ""I can lock on to Ganon!""."
truezelda,374877,Serbaayuu,2,Fri May 29 18:58:57 2015 UTC,"And Link is left-handed because that's how his sprite was drawn. That doesn't mean it's not canon. There is no evidence to suggest that fairies don't disappear when they're used.   Those are two completely different examples. Link is left-handed, that's part of his character, it's how he is in the artworks and 3D model. That's not a game mechanic, that's his character, and obviously, it's canon.  Fairies just disappearing is, on the other hand, a game mechanic. Like I said, they couldn't possibly follow you around from the moment you use them till the end of the game. So they just disappear/fly away. I highly doubt they die. They're flying around happily, Link catches them in a bottle, uses them to heal himself, and then they fly away and go do something else.  As for examples of character development, I honestly don't feel like listing anything right now. Not trying to be rude or anything. OoT Link is definitely one of the most serious of all Links, but I guess that's because, with each game, they decided to make Link less of a blank slate and give him his own personality. Doesn't mean OoT Link doesn't have personality, and if they wanted to make more games with him, they could very well explore his character more."
truezelda,374877,hylian-pudding,1 point,Fri May 29 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"OoT Link is definitely one of the most serious of all Links   He's considered 'serious' because he does literally nothing to establish a character beyond <Enjoys sleeping> and <doesn't like hugs very much?>.  He doesn't emote, and the characters around him don't react to him in ways that provide a character.  Contrast this to Midna, who Link actually has chemistry with, and who speaks to him and develops around him as a person.  Or even the King of Red Lions, who alternately patronizes him or shows him the respect he deserves when he grows and proves himself.  We learn that the Hero of Winds grew as a character because the King of Red Lions acts in a way that establishes that."
truezelda,374877,Serbaayuu,2,Fri May 29 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"Did you read what I said? He was ""serious"" because at the time they wanted him to be a blank slate for the player to connect with, and with each game they gave him more and more personality."
truezelda,374877,hylian-pudding,1 point,Fri May 29 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"Players can connect better with a character than nothing.  Also, openly admitting that the character is cardboard isn't really helping your argument of ""Cardboard?  Please."" very much."

truezelda,374877,athanc,3,Sun May 24 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"I would be very down to see a sequel to OOT/MM for the sake of completing the trilogy.   I love that the two games were remade for 3DS and considering the game engine exists for that platform, I feel like Nintendo could make an awesome game using the style and aesthetics of the Hero of Time era. It's one of my personal favourites.  Do I think Link and Navi make an interesting couple romantically? No, not at all. But I do see them as friends and I'm okay with him looking for his companion and finding her. MM did start with Link looking for her so why not finish his quest. He finishes all his other quests so why not this one?  There are some awesome possibilities that can  conclude a story that initially introduced Navi, Tatl, Tael, Ganondorf and Majora. People always want to know more about Termina and it's physical link to Hyrule (no pun intended). I say why the hell not?"
truezelda,374877,Serbaayuu,9,Sun May 24 23:36:38 2015 UTC,"What trilogy? They haven't set up a trilogy. At this point in time, the only trilogy we have in the series was WW to ST, and that was all after-the-fact sequelling that wasn't set up in the games."
truezelda,374877,Phoxxent,4,Mon May 25 09:32:56 2015 UTC,"Not completely. Alttp, Oracle games (if considered a single 'story') and Awakening also creates a trilogy, and in a way, the 2 four sword games and Minish cap create a trilogy about the creation of the four sword, and the beginning and end of Vaati. (so far)"
truezelda,374877,athanc,0,Mon May 25 17:51:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there exists a trilogy in terms of story. MM follows the events of OOT and fails to answer the question of ""does Link ever find Navi"" as suggested by the video. I'm saying there's an opportunity to answer that by introducing a new title that follows the events of MM.  There could be a trilogy in terms of three games along the same timeline branch that follow one another. I'd be very excited to see Nintendo release a new game for the 3DS in the same engine as OOT/MM for the sake of developing something new that would please fans and be relatively cheaper to develop than creating brand new assets.  I enjoyed replaying OOT and MM on my 3DS and experiencing a full 3D Zelda title on the go. However, it would be cool to see a new 3D portable Zelda title that isn't a remake and this missing piece of the puzzle is an excellent opportunity (in my opinion) to do so."
truezelda,374877,henryuuk,3,Mon May 25 01:35:30 2015 UTC,It's not a missing piece.  We know Link lived a peaceful and uneventful life after Majora's Mask.  He told us himself.  And I would have a hard time concocting a reasonable plot that both follows the Zelda Formula and consists of seeking Navi and has no major historical events occur during it.
truezelda,374877,athanc,3,Mon May 25 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"But as I said in my response to the video, this question is both already answered and doesn't need an answer when you look at the meanings behind the opening and ending of MM, as well as going beyond. He probably doesn't find Navi, but then again he also might. But it doesn't matter because he moved on from her. He, from the end of MM to the time of his death, is not searching for Navi anymore."

truezelda,374877,FrancisDSOwen,1 point,Mon May 25 03:25:26 2015 UTC,"Somehow it appears that I did not explain myself properly. I mean a trilogy in terms of three games with the same aesthetic art style as OOT and MM that directly connect and further discuss the events that occurred in Hyrule and Termina. I really like the game engine that they used and thought it would be awesome to get an original title for 3DS. Yes TP is a direct sequel of those but the Wii/GCN game is vastly different from the N64/3DS.   I just like the look and feel of OOT and MM because they were the first games I played and had a blast replaying them on a portable device. An new game (rather than a remake) would have been cool in my opinion, that's all."
truezelda,374877,athanc,1 point,Mon May 25 13:12:16 2015 UTC,"Navi's abandonment of Link is meant to mirror the giants' abandonment of Skull Kid. Skull Kid and Link's reactions to this obviously differ, but neither of them are able to simply accept their friends' decision to move on and trust them to come back if they want to. Through Majora's Mask, Link learns what it means to have faith in your friends and not succumb to doubt and grief, which plagues Termina, and plagued Skull Kid and Link.  Link doesn't finish his quest for Navi because he realized he didn't need to, and he went home."

(A Link Between Worlds comes before Zelda 1, by the way.) Release order.  If you want to see how the series progressed as it was developed. Whatever-you-feel-like order, pick which games you have access to and look fun and play them.

truezelda,375pnq,starlitepony,2,Mon May 25 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"If you are enjoying the original, I would recommend going in release order, but saving Zelda II to an indefinite ""later date"", as it is completely different from the rest of the series, especially from the first one, even in it's time."
truezelda,375pnq,vergissen,3,Mon May 25 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, Zelda II is one of my favorites (granted I like retro nintendo games, especially those that are as unforgiving as this one). I see it get a lot of hate here, but it's a solid side scroller and holds elements of the original over quite well (like back tracking to get necessary items to progress) and as you get further you unlock 'shortcuts' to get back to where you were quickly. I get that it's different but taken for what it is I found it quite enjoyable."
truezelda,375pnq,Serbaayuu,3,Mon May 25 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"Well, Zelda II is one of my favorite games of all time, but I can totally understand why it's not so well-loved here. I mean, if you're going to recommend a game to someone who loves Zelda, AoL is a terrible recommendation. It has very little in common with Zelda games from a gameplay perspective, and there are hundreds of other games that the person is more likely to enjoy than it."
truezelda,375pnq,Phoxxent,2,Mon May 25 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but if all anyone hears is how terrible it is and that it should be skipped over then they will never take the time to experience it for themselves. And as you and I have both stated its one of our favorites, so there is the possibility that it could end up being that persons favorite too."
truezelda,375pnq,Grant638,1 point,Mon May 25 19:52:02 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a side scroller. Which I just find random as heck to jump to that.
truezelda,375pnq,MegaMissingno,3,Mon May 25 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"It was the second game in the series, so they were still figuring it out.  Also, it being a side-scroller doesn't make it any less Zelda, and it has a lot of really great elements to it, like a very skill-based difficulty and some good RPG mechanics (which the rest of the series could learn from)."
truezelda,371t2h,locustgate,20,Sun May 24 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"It appears that magic can be learned. There's a few games, like OoT, where Link gains the ability to perform magic from the Great Fairies. In AoL, Link can learn a vast array of spells from the old men scattered across Hyrule. There are also some magical master-apprentice relationships, such as Syrup/Maple and Ezlo/Vaati, providing further evidence that magic is a learned craft. Magical powers can apparently also be inherited. The Royal Family possesses mystical powers due to its connection with Hylia, and the Sages have powers passed through their respective bloodlines.   The question ""What is magic?"" has no definite answer. There are no clear rules of magic in the series and its ultimate source is never identified. Maybe it comes from the goddesses, or maybe divine power is something else entirely. We don't know. We can speculate about what magic is, but its nature is so ambiguous that we're never going to arrive at a definitive answer."
truezelda,371t2h,Dismas423,1 point,Sun May 24 02:44:57 2015 UTC,I would like to second your idea that magic is learned.  Just look at the Magical Book in the original game.  It's literally the combined knowledge of the old men and old women.  And the book of Mudora was obviously written way way long ago.  People had to have been passing down that knowledge for the books to play a role.
truezelda,371t2h,Letchworth,7,Fri May 29 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"Magic in The Legend of Zelda seems to follow the ""Inner Power Channeled By Training and Relics"" trope.  Can't really get much more specific than that.  One interesting thing: I think the Triforce might only work as an augmentation relic, not a source of power on its own.  It amplifies the user's abilities to such an immense state that they're able to cast magic that changes the fabric of the world.  Maybe that's why the gods can't use it.  Maybe they don't actually have the same kind of innate magical ability.    Oh, and magic can also be stored inside items, such as the Master Sword."
truezelda,371t2h,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 24 03:10:54 2015 UTC,"I have long suspected that the triforce does this. That is amplifies the user's abilities over just granting the owner random powers they did not have before. Having the triforce of power is more like having amplified spells and an infinite magic meter.  But spells do seem to be imparted in some way. Great fairies and village elders can pass on spells to Link. I'm not sure if this is just game mechanic for teaching spells or if it is something that can be traded in some way in the setting.  And items can be made magical as long as some kind of magical fuel or substance is added to them like force gems, mushrooms, sands of time, goddess flames, element stones. Or be a part of some magical creature like a Deku Leaf, dragon scale, jabu scale, roc feather. either way it still works off the user's magic meter/inner power despite where the original power comes from."
truezelda,371t2h,Bert0lz,1 point,Thu May 28 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"Having the triforce of power is more like having amplified spells and an infinite magic meter.   I always thought about this. Ganon has powerful spells as a result of the Triforce of Power. Zelda seems to have a vast knowledge of advanced spells, such as sending Link back in time at the End of OoT. and since Link has the Triforce of Courage, he's really good at...um.... being courageous? maybe? I always wished that in the games where Link obtains a Triforce piece, you gained some additional ability to reflect the change in you from the Triforce's power. Like maybe instead of getting the white heart outlines from visiting the right Great Fairie, if you got that instead from the Triforce of Courage, because that would be like saying that the Triforce gives Link to stand up more to things that scare/hurt you. It would give you the courage to jump from higher heights and fight stronger enemies because if the piece inside you. Or something along those lines. Link's the only one who doesn't do some new amazing thing with the sudden addition of a Triforce piece."
truezelda,371t2h,noopenusernames,1 point,Sun May 31 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"Another theory of mine is how having the Triforce of Courage allows someone to perform video game/shonen anime style stunts successfully. Like if they try to do something amazing it will allow it or help it to completion, but will not just give them amazing combat powers for the sake of it.  Sort of like being able to learn how to be amazing with a sword after only two or three minute lessons and apply it masterfully after that.

truezelda,371t2h,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun May 24 12:40:21 2015 UTC,Why not? Why should rule bending have rules?
truezelda,371t2h,Serbaayuu,4,Sun May 24 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Because it has to follow an internal consistent logic, otherwise it's just Random Convenient Asspulling."
truezelda,371t2h,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun May 24 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"But what does the extent of that logic have to be? Is it existing, being usable by people, and not limited to only certain people enough? Or does one use have to make other uses not possible, despite just being bending the rules of the universe? Why should ""I think fire should appear around me now"" mean that ""I think that mountain should be purple"" is impossible?"
truezelda,371t2h,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 24 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"Who can use it and how?  A select race, anybody, a certain bloodline?  Is it innate or do they train for it?  Both? How does someone cast magic?  A focus (objects, words, etc.)?  Willpower? What constitutes a ""spell""?  Is it the same every time?  Do you will whatever you want into existence?  Do you learn ""spellcasting"" all at once, or do you need to learn how to cast each ""spell"" individually? Where does the magic power come from?  Mortals, divinity, or innately in the world/universe?  Is magic separated into elemental forms or does it simply manifest as raw energy to be used in any way? Can magic be stored?  If it is stored, can anybody use the magical relic, or is it still limited to only those who know how to cast it?   I could probably think of more, given enough time, but these are five of the most important questions that should be asked when determining the rules of magic in fiction.  If you cannot come up with an answer for each of them, your magic is just handwaving bullshit because it's convenient.  To take your example:  In the vast majority of fiction, ""I think fire should appear around me now"" translates to a specific spell, a specific relic, or a specific limitation of the magic being used (you are casting a fire spell).  You can't use that same spell, relic, or type of magic to make a mountain purple.  The crystal Link uses as a focus for Din's Fire can only be used to cast Din's Fire.  You might be able to make a spell, relic, or earth-altering type of magic that would let you make a mountain purple.  When you visit the realm of ""I want this thing, therefore it exists"", you are stepping into the territory of truly divine beings who can alter the universe with every step.  And usually, you disallow your mortal characters (and sometimes even immortal ones) from being able to mold the world to their willpower with no limitations, because otherwise your story is basically moot.  If you let your characters do whatever they want with no limitations, but they still have to go through trials and tribulations, you have created magic that is the very essence of handwaving bullshit when it's convenient."

truezelda,371t2h,henryuuk,1 point,Sun May 24 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"How do you know Twinrova didn't train to cast magic?  She's 400 years old.  The only Hero who has been able to cast magic without being taught it first is the ALttP Hero, I believe.  The Hero of Time is taught to harness his magic power from a Great Fairy, and most of the rest who obtain or use magic meters have similar trainers.  Unless every Hero is a natural at casting, it also seems that magical foci are extremely easy to use as long as you have magic potential.  They're all able to use various magical relics right after they find them, without being taught.  But most Heroes can't cast anything on their own."
truezelda,371t2h,noopenusernames,3,Sun May 24 20:59:13 2015 UTC,AoL Link is the only one that doesn't use relics/items if I remember correctly. (or atleast not as far as we know)

truezelda,36y2cg,TeekTheReddit,10,Sat May 23 04:17:07 2015 UTC,you should play WWHD since its the easiest to get into.

truezelda,36y2cg,double_super,7,Sat May 23 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind SD graphics then regular Wind Waker is just fine, it's 99% the same game. The best part about having a wii is that you can literally play any 3D zelda (untill the Wii U zelda comes out)"
truezelda,36y2cg,Phoxxent,2,Sat May 23 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"I would say that while the same content, it hardly feels like the same game. Imagine if the original Legend of Zelda allowed you to go off one side of the map to appear on the other, and then imagine if you couldn't walk left. It would still technically be the same game, but it would feel a lot different. That is what the Swift Sail does for Wind Waker, it makes it an incredibly smooth exploring experience."
truezelda,36y2cg,Serbaayuu,2,Sat May 23 14:04:22 2015 UTC,an incredibly smooth exploring experience   Short*  The Swift Sail makes the world feel tiny.
truezelda,36y2cg,Phoxxent,2,Sat May 23 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"It makes the world feel less like it's made of 45o angles, which is why I like it. I don't feel like an old scripting turtle when I have the swift sail. I don't care about the speed, I care about having the wind at my back."
truezelda,36y2cg,Serbaayuu,3,Sat May 23 15:08:32 2015 UTC,I am not a fan of being able to change the wind without using the Waker.
truezelda,36y2cg,Phoxxent,5,Sat May 23 15:09:34 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of having to follow straight lines and having to plan out everything. Having wind at my back gives me the freedom to explore in the same manor as any other Zelda game.

truezelda,36y2cg,double_super,1 point,Sat May 23 19:16:27 2015 UTC,Well i was considering WW HD the same as WW SD. In the same sense that OOT and MM 3D are the same games as the N64 version. They are technically different games and they have their differences but you can still play a version of every 3D game on the wii. I think the better way of saying it is that you can play every original 3D Zelda on the wii.
truezelda,36y2cg,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sat May 23 19:27:35 2015 UTC,My Wii doesn't play gamecube games so it will depend on what version he has. TP would also be a fine starting point over WW in this case.
truezelda,36y2cg,calvinfh,2,Sat May 23 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"I find WWSD much preferable for various reasons.  You will enjoy that one just as much, if not more."
truezelda,36y2cg,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon May 25 02:47:41 2015 UTC,I don't know why anyone would prefer the original when HD has so many minor tweaks that improve the game significantly.
truezelda,36y2cg,calvinfh,0,Fri May 29 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"Better Triforce Quest Tingle Tuner No Swift Sail   HD only has better pictographs and better Wind Waking over the original.  It's not worth eviscerating the Triforce Quest and, by extension, making treasure charts totally worthless."
truezelda,36y2cg,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri May 29 02:15:05 2015 UTC,How is the swift sail a bad thing and how does it make the treasure charts useless? HD also has a lot less item management and faster animations the original Wind Waker just wasted too much of your time.
truezelda,36y2cg,calvinfh,2,Fri May 29 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"The swift sail ruins most of the exploration and the feel of the game.  Wind Waker is supposed to be calm and slow, not GOTTA GO FAST TO BEAT GANUN BECUZ I HAS NO TIME 4 GAMES.  The fact that you only need to decipher 3 Triforce Charts means you require almost 2,000 fewer rupees in the HD version to complete the game.  Treasure charts mostly give you rupees, so that gave you an extremely good reason to go out and use them.  Using rupees is something very few of the games in the series are good at."
truezelda,36y2cg,shitcock55,2,Fri May 29 02:28:11 2015 UTC,You don't have to get the swift sail anyways if you don't like to hurry and get to the fun parts. there is less rupees needed on the charts but the charts was just a contrived way of spending rupees it would be like having to spend a thousand rupees to enter each dungeon. there is also plenty of other stuff to spend your money on.

truezelda,36y2cg,IceCubesBurning,7,Thu Jun 4 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time is definitely a good start into the 3D Zelda experience. Also you should play A Link Between Worlds! Its based off ALTTP's world and is really magnificent. But on 3D zeldas I recommend getting the 3D remakes on the 3DS. They have improved graphics and the gameplay is smoother. From OOT the other 3D ones to try are Majora's Mask, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. I would go with The Wind Waker after OOT and then Twilight Princess (try to get a GameCube copy). Majora's Mask is a little stressful with its core mechanic so save it for the last couple that you play. Skyward Sword uses motion controls on the Wii so save it for last since it requires some patience with the control scheme. Hope this helps :)"
truezelda,36y2cg,nickc122,3,Sat May 23 02:33:36 2015 UTC,"I forgot all about A Link Between Worlds, and honestly I don't know too much about it. My son does have a 3ds that I can ""borrow"" so I might have to give this one a shot."
truezelda,36y2cg,DazednEnthused,5,Sat May 23 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"I really recommend you play ALBW. It's a really good mix of both the styles, And the two transition so smoothly and after a while they just become second nature to you.  It's a really cool concept and it executes it well, Try it!"
truezelda,36y2cg,kaybee41906,3,Sat May 23 11:41:06 2015 UTC,I think it's absolutely worth it and not that steep of a learning curve. Just be aware that learning to play 3D games opens you up to countless great games from the past 20 years. I hope you've got some time on your hands!
truezelda,36y2cg,Serbaayuu,2,Sat May 23 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"Hah, time is something I do not have a lot of right now, but I'm young and have a whole life of gaming ahead of me. Thanks!"
truezelda,36y2cg,Megagreencolor,3,Sat May 23 04:31:25 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, the game absolutely deserves at least a half hour of your time.  If the story doesn't pull you in,  the fun 3D gameplay will."
truezelda,36y2cg,charoum,3,Sat May 23 07:08:57 2015 UTC,"I love most of the 3D games, and I'd definitely recommend Ocarina. That said, maybe as an introduction you may want to start with Wind Waker. I find it to be the easiest 3D game in the series, and it's also a lot of fun."
truezelda,36y2cg,2bananasforbreakfast,8,Sat May 23 13:38:47 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time will be harder for you to handle than some of the newer ones.  It was the first 3D title in the series, so they were still learning how to actually make it work.  Go with Wind Waker or Twilight Princess first.  Both of those play much smoother, even if nobody is going to tell you it's the one they worship.  Seriously, if you have enough trouble with 3D games to be ""stuck in corners"", you need to start with an easy one, not a clunky one.  As long as your Wii is the backwards-compatible version, you can play both of those, either on Gamecube or TP on Wii."
truezelda,36y2cg,TimeCircuitsOn,2,Sat May 23 09:19:17 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of time, A link to the past, and Majora's mask are the three best legend of zelda games IMHO you should definetly try it."
truezelda,36y2cg,arafinwe,2,Sat May 23 08:50:48 2015 UTC,"Not trying to knock you,  but iirc, a blind man was able to play and enjoy OOT. If he can do it,  I have confidence you can as well.  Also,  unlike Halo or Golden Eye,  no one will be shooting at you right away.  Take your time and get used to the controls and the world.  You're on an adventure,  not a speed run. It's a new perspective with a bit more strategy in it,  but still a Zelda game.  Give it a shot,  don't just dismiss it as a 3d game in the same group as fps."
truezelda,36y2cg,Nickerdoodle,2,Sat May 23 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"You don't need to be good at 3d games for this. It's a solo player game, so it's easy to learn from your mistakes. Multiplayer 3d games can be brutal, but those have a completely different game experience."
truezelda,36y2cg,Silverhand7,2,Sat May 23 13:34:10 2015 UTC,The controls in ocarina are easier to pick up than a first person shooter. Most fps games have one stick to move and another to look in different directions (to aim). In ocarina you move with one stick and the camera follows you.. You can move the camera but it doesn't need the same kind of coordination.
truezelda,36y2cg,Cillendor,2,Sat May 23 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"I was a bit like you, I had played all the 2D games and then I played Wind Waker when it came out (on the Gamecube) (I basically skipped on the N64 since neither of my cousins had one). I was so unused to 3D that I was falling off the narrow dock you're supposed to walk on in the first few minutes of the game. But it is a very slow start, it lets you explore around and get used to it. I would recommend playing this one first, but with one warning: after playing WW, OOT felt really, really lackluster to me. The controls felt annoying, I found the art ugly and I think I really missed out on the awe and reverence most Zelda fans seem to have for that game. It's very sad!!! I wish I had played OOT first so I could experience what others did...."
truezelda,36y2cg,BigKidLittleKid,7,Sun May 24 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Ocarina of Time is very friendly at the beginning and will allow you to get adjusted to the 3D Zelda and its controls, which in my opinion, are very easy to pick up on."
truezelda,36y2cg,preston159,4,Sat May 23 02:16:46 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time was the first 3D Zelda game and one of Nintendo's earliest 3D games, so it was designed intentionally to get people used to it. While later games do some stuff better OoT would definitely be a good place to start with them."
truezelda,36y2cg,stormrider133,2,Sat May 23 05:31:01 2015 UTC,"I actually don't care much for Ocarina of Time. It's a decent game, but I wouldn't even put it in my top 5. That said, it would probably be the best introduction to the 3D titles, especially since it was the first 3D Zelda game made."
truezelda,36y2cg,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Sun May 24 04:31:45 2015 UTC,I'd suggest jumping into Twilight Princess. It's a solid 3D game that gives you time to master the controls as you go. Not too hard but not too easy either.
truezelda,36y2cg,stormrider133,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:15:23 2015 UTC,"I would recommend the 3ds version of the game.  The graphics are way better, and so are the controls.  It also includes master quest."
truezelda,36y2cg,Phoxxent,-7,Sat Jun 6 07:57:55 2015 UTC,"Ocarina is a good starting point. But skip everything except Twilight Princess. Majora's Mask suffers from every disadvantage of being a 3D Zelda title and Wind Waker is just so damn tedious. Link Between Worlds is tight though. It's 3D, but plays link Link to the Past."
truezelda,36pmuc,epicbriguy10,13,Thu May 21 03:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'd hope for a few new ones. Much like OoT had the blue and red tunics that helped with water and heat, it would be cool to get some that have similar functions for earth, or wind, or darkness, or light, etc.   Like what if you had one for darkness where you could travel between/through shadows? Maybe a special green one that allowed you to camouflage in any grass or trees where no enemy or boss could notice you? What about a yellow tunic that made you give off jolts of static electricity, but hurt you slightly while you wore it.   Ideally, I would love a special one that you could use in each different region, whether it be forest, desert, ocean/water, snow, volcano, so on. It would be cool if they had drawbacks too, just to make it more evened out.  I feel like a little kid speculating right now, this is awesome."
truezelda,36pmuc,blancjua,5,Thu May 21 04:52:02 2015 UTC,How about a tunic that allows you to merge with walls just like ravio's bracelet in LBW
truezelda,36pmuc,jscoutabout,5,Thu May 21 06:45:16 2015 UTC,"There better be some kind of blue outfit to wear, but I think this is already a guarantee from the gameplay we've seen.  Once I get the blue tunic in any game I wear it for the rest of the game.  It also adds a decent challenge to TP if anyone wants another game to play (fire arrows do 2.5 hearts). I'd also like to see something along the lines of hover boots or armor or gear that allows you to move differently."
truezelda,36pmuc,Serbaayuu,3,Thu May 21 03:04:05 2015 UTC,but I think this is already a guarantee from the gameplay we've seen   Very low chance of the blue clothes lasting much longer than TP's tutorial.
truezelda,36pmuc,malaroo,3,Thu May 21 11:50:31 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to whether or not you can pick to wear those original clothes, which is a a nice option that never should have been excluded."
truezelda,36pmuc,Serbaayuu,2,Thu May 21 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"Well, except for the fact that there's never going to be a mainline Zelda game where Nintendo's second icon is wearing anything but his iconic clothes.  Maybe in NG+."
truezelda,36pmuc,malaroo,1 point,Thu May 21 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe but maybe not with all this 'convention breaking'.  I mean, it's been a good while now since we've seen Zelda U, and we've seen it multiple times, but we've still never seen Link in his trademark outfit."
truezelda,36pmuc,Phoxxent,2,Thu May 21 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"But they seem to only be breaking conventions that get in the way of making a fun game, removing any established iconology, such as the green tunic, is getting to the point of taking some random game and slapping ""Zelda"" on the front when there is nothing else to denote it as such."
truezelda,36pmuc,malaroo,3,Thu May 21 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think for a second that they'll get rid of it completely. I'm still certain it will be the main outfit, I'm just playing with idea that maybe you'll be able to wear other things (like the outfit we've seen) as well."
truezelda,36pmuc,Phoxxent,2,Thu May 21 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"Possibly, that sort of thing isn't completely foreign, but the most customization has generally been to one facet of your appearance. Maybe hats will play that role this time, who knows."
truezelda,36pmuc,Serbaayuu,0,Thu May 21 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"but we've still never seen Link in his trademark outfit.   This means literally nothing when we've only officially seen the game twice (in 1) a hype trailer and 2) an alpha/beta or earlier demo crafted specifically for that show), and the three most recent 3D Zelda titles have you run around without the Hero's Clothes for progressively longer amounts of time at the start of the game.  They're going to unveil Link's iconic outfit and pose with the rest of the game when they give it an official subtitle and everything.  They want to spend time hyping up the features, and then they want the explosion of hype from one of their Directs where they capitalize on the fandom's love for their iconic hero."
truezelda,36pmuc,malaroo,2,Thu May 21 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"You're probably right.  My only point here is that it might be possible to wear the outfit they've been showing off, especially if they're working off the whole ""player's choice"" angle with freedom of exploration and gameplay."
truezelda,36pmuc,Serbaayuu,6,Thu May 21 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"Different tunics need to be functional, and for them to be functional there has to be a reason.  The Zora Tunic in Twilight Princess may be used in a single dungeon, and it may add the ""challenge"" of fire arrows hurting you a bit more, but it's nothing special.  The same goes for the OoT tunics.  In Zelda U, if there is a tunic to resist fire, fire should destroy me if I'm not wearing it.  Not enough to make the fire dungeon impossible, but enough to make it very difficult.  It would be even more fun if the fire resistant tunic was not required to beat the game, and I'd only know about it because some NPC hinted at its existence in a cave somewhere across the map before I went into the fire dungeon.  Then I could go hunt it down because I want an easier time in the dungeon, then come back and do it.  It'd still have to be used more than in one dungeon to make it worthwhile, too.  Maybe a bunch of mini-dungeons would use it as well."
truezelda,36pmuc,MarvelousMagikarp,10,Thu May 21 11:12:33 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be cool if we could go to some shop in-game and change the color/design of our tunic, sorta like in Assassin's Creed."
truezelda,36pmuc,watties12,3,Thu May 21 06:21:24 2015 UTC,I like this idea. Even expanding on it if we got to modify Link's hair style to which one we like best.   For the tunic specific functions (like breathing underwater) they could either make a tunic add on or just build it into each tunic (so we don't always have to switch).
truezelda,36pmuc,jscoutabout,4,Thu May 21 09:52:47 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for some decent variety and maybe even customization (although that's not very Zelda-esque). It seems like there is a decent push on exploration and one way to reward players for that (other than just a chest of rupees) would be collectibles that can be used to craft armour or simply trinkets. For instance you could wear 50+ joy pendants and get a bonus to speed, or maybe it just makes Link smile. Cute"
truezelda,36pmuc,Kljmok,3,Thu May 21 06:44:11 2015 UTC,"I hope there's at least some variety of outfits. That's one of the things I didn't like about SS is that you only have the knight outfit/hero clothes after you get it. I hope they do something along the lines of TP like how the zora tunic  and magic armor looked totally different from the regular outfit.   And I hope there's at least one outfit you can choose that doesn't have the hat, like if the outfit you see in the trailer is the starter outfit I hope they give you the option to go back to it if they give you the standard hero clothes later in the game."
truezelda,36pmuc,BeautifulKiller,3,Thu May 21 03:45:12 2015 UTC,"What was bugging me with SS was, that you see SO MANY other coloured tunics, but nope. Just green for you.   It would have been nice if you could have chosen another colour for your second playthrough. At least. Or if you progressed enough in game, that you can try on different outfits"
truezelda,36pmuc,Phoxxent,2,Thu May 21 07:54:15 2015 UTC,"I wanna see LA DX's tunic system come back, along with ""magic armor"" type upgrades. So, you can get a red or blue tunic to increase attack or defense respectively, but you can also get red and blue magic armors to drastically increase attack and defense respectively, at the cost of magic/money. There would also be the ultimate magic armor to drastically increase both, again at cost of magic/money, but in the NewGame+ you would be able to get the Ultimate mail, which increases both attack and defense normally for free."
truezelda,36pmuc,fishandchips20,1 point,Thu May 21 15:24:02 2015 UTC,I'm not terribly concerned about getting different tunics. I would like to have the ability to freely switch back and forth between the traditional green tunic and the starter blue outfit. I definitely love different tunics but I want something a little different/new too.
truezelda,36pmuc,MonkeyLink,1 point,Thu May 21 08:38:54 2015 UTC,"I would love if they added a tunic similar to a wingsuit which would allow you to glide faster, further and would be easier to maneuver than the sailcloth (even though I have no clue how hard it will be to control the sailcloth). Maybe it could allow you to perform little tricks, like loops and barrel rolls."
truezelda,36pmuc,androsphere,1 point,Thu May 21 14:44:28 2015 UTC,"I would like to see either more tunic options, or custom options. Mixing various hats, tunics, and mail with various stats and perks could be fun.  edit: Also, a Fierce Deity outfit would be awesome."

truezelda,36i13u,0xFFF1,7,Tue May 19 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"Speed runners for N64 MM commonly used what was called a SpeedRunner's Save, which started you at just after getting the Ocarina back, and 101 rupees in the bank, with nothing other than what was required to get that save file to that state. Then you could copy that save to another slot and start your runs from there.  Perhaps you can do something similar with this.  Speedrunner Dungeon Rush mode: Start a minimalist run and get the arrows and each upgrade without defeating the boss, go to south clock town and save at the owl statue. Copy your save to another slot. This will be your runner's save. Each time you retry your run, you start with that save file. Immediately use the Song of Time on game load. The timer starts when you click to confirm the use of the Song of Time. The timer ends when you deliver the final attack against Majora. Further use of the Song of Time during the run is disallowed. (If not using the Reverse Song of Time is possible, the RSoT is disallowed) Song of Double Time is allowed. Acquiring items disallowed by a minimalist run is disallowed."
truezelda,36i13u,0xFFF1,4,Tue May 19 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"It's actually possible to beat the entire game (or at least what's required to see the ending credits) in only two cycles. The Deku cycle, and then the first cycle as a human. It requires a lot of planning and near perfect movements, but it's possible.  So I'm going to assume that your run is possible too, since it seems like a less extreme version."

I assume the reasoning for having to warp out immediately is to prevent people from getting the Fairy Sword?"
truezelda,36i13u,henryuuk,2,Tue May 19 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, in Easy Mode, I don't think that should matter. I just realized that all of the dungeon items save the Map and Compass reset when time does.  I think the biggest reason for immediate warp is so you don't get practice with the rest of the dungeon. The point is to do as little of the dungeon as possible before the final cycle.  Maybe the ""immediate warp"" can be limited to the harder modes, where Easy Mode just says that you can't beat the boss."
truezelda,36i13u,Falconpunch3,2,Tue May 19 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"In the story and timeline, this would be the optimal way to be. You save as many people and lands as possible before you defeat majora.

truezelda,36d6q5,porchguitar,27,Mon May 18 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"The Hero of Time most likely ended up with Malon. His descendant, Link from TP, is a commoner, lives on a ranch, and knows Epona's Song, a tune that originated with Malon's family. The Hero of Time had to marry someone, and TP Link's affiliation with ranch life makes Malon the most likely candidate. He definitely didn't have kids with Ruto. I don't think that's even physically possible.  Speaking of TP Link, I think the game suggests there was an attraction between him and Midna, but the destruction of the Mirror of Twilight makes a relationship between them impossible. Unless Link found another way to the Twilight Realm, he most likely ends up with Ilia.   The Hero of Winds probably ends up with Tetra. They have a close relationship throughout WW and PH, and we know from ST that Link remained active in Tetra's life as an adult, forming her royal guard. Neither of them have any other viable romantic candidates, so they probably ended up with each other.  SS Link almost certainly marries Zelda. It's clear that they're attracted to each other and the game's ending indicates they chose to remain on the surface and build a life together. Unless Link suffers a fatal heart attack or something and forces Groose to step in, this one is pretty much a done deal.  The 2D games are a lot more ambiguous. Link doesn't have as much personality in those games as he does in some of the more recent 3D outings, so it's hard to say what he feels. He expresses interest in Marin in LA, but she suffers from the problem of not being a real person. Link and Zelda are childhood friends in a few of these games, but overall there's few hints of a romantic attraction between the two. The Maku Tree is in love with him in OoA, but I don't even want to know how that relationship would work out."

truezelda,36d6q5,Dismas423,67,Sun May 24 01:43:49 2015 UTC,"Assuming each Link needs to have someone we see in-game as a love interest.    Hero of Hyrule (Link from the NES games) : Either one of the 2 zelda's (or both I guess, I mean we don't really know hyrule's stand on polygamy) Hints : Only a Mario-peach styled thank you kiss. 'Chance' : low    Hero of the Triforce (Alttp, Oracle games and Awakening) : Zelda, Din (oracle), Nayru (oracle) and Marin, none of which acted upon as he left the first three behind, and the last one was part of a whale's fanfic dream. Hints : almost nothing beyond being the only females he interacted with, and a dance with Din. Marin had a date-like moment on the beach, but she is a burd now. 'Chance' : low  Hero of Time (OoT and MM) : Zelda, Saria and Malon Hints : Zelda : care for each other on some level, even when sent back in time she gives the ocarina to keep him safe. Saria : Childhood friends and all, but nothing besides that. Malon : Seems very interested in him (but since Link shows about as much emotion in OoT as a wet blanket it's hard to tell what he feels) Link also gets Epona and his descendant did end up in a farm colony with a new Epona. (Ruto is clearly in love with Link, but Link seems to not share these feelings at all, even less so then with the others. Though I guess technically both her and Nabooru are 'romantically interested' in him (Nabooru more so physically to adult link it seems...) 'Chance' : imo,  low for all, with Malon being the highest.  We DO know he has to get together with SOMEONE though.     Hero of Winds (WW and PH) : Obviously Tetra. Hints : have you PLAYED the game at all ? 'Chance' : Pretty much guaranteed if you ask me.    Hero of Spirits (ST) : Princess Zelda Hints : Most of the game together, implied continued relationship (friendship or more) after evil is banished. 'Chance' : High    First hero of the four sword (FS) : Princess Zelda Hints : nothing really, he could just as easily be a dedicated knight/hero But there isn't really any other person in the entire game possible. 'Chance' : low  Second hero of the four sword (FSA) : Zelda again Hint : Same as above, nothing else to go on really. 'Chance' : Low  Hero of art (ALBW) : Zelda, the witch-girl and thieving girl. Hints : Zelda : Enthralled by legends of the previous links Witch girl : Wants to help him (if only because of a fortune reading)  seems somewhat interested ...? Thieving girl : they do the whole escape together, even IF there was more though, they are separated by the  closing of the 2D fissures. 'Chance' : low to medium     Hero of the Minish/Picori (Minish Cap) : Zelda Hints : Childhood friends, go on a 'date' to the market. 'Chance' : strong  Hero of Twilight (TP) : Midna and Illia.  (only one where Zelda is not even a possibility at all, pretty much) Hints : Again, have you PLAYED this game ? Midna : entire game is about her and Link getting to know each other, but at the end they are separated Illia : Entire game started to save her pretty much, she clearly cares for you, and so does Link for her, as he shows great relief when she is regains her memory. 'Chance' : no chance for Midna considering tear-scene, pretty high chance for Illia I'd say.     And now the most obvious one. Hero of the sky/Hylia's chosen hero (SS) : GROOSE Hints : This entire game is just about Link and Groose, and their relationship the world would never understand !!! <3 'chance' : So cannon it's the groosenator. (no but really it's Link X item check girl obviously)    (With Chance I mean how much it is implied that he gets together with anyone we see or even anyone at all)    So, final score, out of 11 Links.    No one/not enough to build upon (imo) : 6 (Hero of Hyrule, Hero of Time, Both heroes of the four sword, Hero of Art and Hero of the Triforce) Zelda/Tetra : 3 (Hero of Winds, Hero of Spirits and Hero of the Picori) Illia : 1 (Twilight Princess) Groose/Item Check Girl/Old Lady/Fi/pumpkin lady/Toilet hand/potion shop woman/etc... : 1 (Hylia's Chosen Hero)      .  Alternative vote score, if assuming Malon for Hero of Time and the boring option of Zelda for Hylia's chosen hero.     Nobody/non-implied : 5 Zelda/Tetra : 4 Malon : 1 Illia : 1"

truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,4,Mon May 18 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"It' possible, but I sorta doubt it. We have never had a game about a story we heard about in the lore before. Closest thing we got is Alttp backstory and OoT, but even that is a 'what if' scenario that is never shown in OoT itself.      An interesting thing about that Zelda is that it could very well be that she is named zelda, but isn't ""a zelda"" (as in : reincarnation of Hylia). Her time seemingly had no Hero, and the 'evil' was little more but a wizard. And she exists together with a different incarnation, which is something we never see happen at any other time in the timeline."
truezelda,36d6q5,souffle-etc,6,Mon May 18 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"I see Link as someone who doesn't fight for glory or for the accolades, but because it's the right thing to do. I don't see him as the kind of guy to get starstruck or fall in love with someone he's only just recently met. The only two romantic interests I can justify in my own head are SS Zelda and Ilia from TP. Both of them were raised in the same towns as their respective Link, they've known each other their whole lives, and there's obvious chemistry between the two in both games. Aside from that, I just don't see other Links with any of the characters we've met in those other games."
truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,4,Mon May 18 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"Link and Tetra lived together after/in between the games. Lots of time for them to get to know each other, and seeing how they act to each other in those games, I'd say there is a good chance they also go together."
truezelda,36d6q5,souffle-etc,4,Mon May 18 15:49:24 2015 UTC,They're also like super minors. We don't see direct descendants of them in Spirit Tracks so I don't see evidence to prove they ever got involved romantically.
truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,4,Mon May 18 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"Actually that is also not something we know for sure... There is actually a lot on WW that seems to point too Link and Tetra being ~16 to 17 years old, and only looking 'young' because of the artstyle. (like how Niko, Mako and so forth are adults in their twenties/thirties yet are the same size as you. )  Big hints at this is that Link gets the ""heroes' clothes"" for 'Becoming the age of the hero of old'. Chronologically, that timeline would have seen TEEN LINK as the hero, not Young Link. Secondly it is in fact called : ""Coming of age""     Lots of people call you ""Young man"" and treat you with respect. You even get the deeds to a house/island. People that call you ""boy"" would probably also do so if you were bigger, considering they are mostly jerks/people that consider themselves superior.    For Tetra this is also implied by the fact the Pirates acknowledge her as being at the very least a potential wife/romantic interest as seen by the bomb heist cutscene, where Gonzo starts blushing at the thought of making a kid with Tetra.     Either way, we see a descendant of Tetra in ST in the form of that games' Zelda. So Tetra is confirmed to have had children at the very least, and Link lived with the pirates for many years as they were searching for New Hyrule."
truezelda,36d6q5,souffle-etc,2,Mon May 18 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"Iwata has said WW Link is 9 in an Iwata Asks, but the Official Nintendo Strategy Guide for WW and the Trophy for Toon Link in SSBB say he's 12. Tetra is one year older than Link.     ""Toon Link Trophy (SSBB)"" Link as he appeared in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, with big eyes and an expressive face. He lived peacefully on Outset Island until a bird captured his little sister, and he came to her rescue. In The Wind Waker, he had to crawl, press up to walls, and the like. His green clothes were worn on his 12th birthday and are the lucky outfit of the hero of legend.    I'm not saying that I think people are crazy to think Link and Tetra could potentially have a relationship, but when I play the games I'm not concerned with/interested about if he gets the girl. That's just how my gaming experience is."
truezelda,36d6q5,Serbaayuu,7,Mon May 18 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Strategy guides and Super Smash Bros. fall easily into the ""Dubious Canon"" category.  Iwata Asks is usually a bit more solid, but where 12 is arguable, 9 is outright ridiculous, in my opinion.  That's a fifth-grade child leading a pirate crew, as opposed to a ""young lady"" at 13.  I don't care if she's Zelda, she'd have a proxy captain at the very least.  That also sets Aryll at 5-7, which is extremely young.  Too young to write fully-articulate letters and do shipwork.  Aryll seems closer to 10-12.  I realize the Hero of Time in his childhood is canonically 9 years old, but he and the Hero of Winds have very different experiences when it comes to the people around them and their ages."
truezelda,36d6q5,souffle-etc,1 point,Mon May 18 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely give you that. SSBB certainly isn't a credible canon source. But, the game text from WW also says ""Today is a day to celebrate! It is the day that you become the same age as the young hero spoken of in all the legends.""  Since they went through the trouble to specify ""young hero"" I'd say there's no way to argue they're not referencing Young Link's age."
truezelda,36d6q5,Serbaayuu,3,Mon May 18 23:41:02 2015 UTC,"But nobody in the Adult Timeline knew who Young Link was [except the Sages, who left Hyrule].  All of his heroics were done as Adult Link.  The legend at the start of Wind Waker only talks about the boy who mysteriously appeared to stop Ganon - people were unaware that he existed 7 years earlier.  It's almost outright stated that they had no idea how his particular mode of time travel worked.  They thought he was just a hero who traveled through the ages saving people, which is why they waited for him during the Flood.  There's even a statue of Adult Link in the castle.  Adult Link is still very much a young hero.  He's sixteen.  You could also argue that the knowledge of his age got corrupted and became 12, but 9 is not feasible."

truezelda,36d6q5,Serbaayuu,3,Mon May 18 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that the Killer Bees are probably ~10 or older, and it'd be really weird for Link to be treated so much older by them when if he was 12, he'd be closer to being their peers than an authority figure.  The teacher treats Link as an authority figure too, by asking him for that sort of favor.  I mean, imagine a schoolteacher asking a 12-year-old to help her rally some rowdy students.  That's weird.  But not nearly as weird for a 16-year-old."
truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,4,Mon May 18 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"Jep. Link is treated as a young adult everywhere he goes. The ruto's call him : ""A fine young man"", he 'came of age' on his brithday, nobody questions him sailing around on his own, having a weapon or getting a deed to a freaking island with door-butler, Tingle calls you : ""Mr. Fairy"", etc...    In every game where Link is a child of between 10~13, there tend to be moments when people mock you/question you for being a bit young. But not in WW."
truezelda,36d6q5,Serbaayuu,2,Mon May 18 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, I just thought of what I think is also some decent evidence: in more-recent Zelda games where the Master Sword has become enormous (basically all of them post-OoT), the sheath hangs down to Link's knees.  It does the same thing in Wind Waker.  In Skyward Sword, the Master Sword would be taller than most of the kids on Skyloft."

And this picture shows that they are infact a reincarnation of the previous zelda's knights and vassals from way before, and were that small too.      Zuko even has full fledged sideburns. So he has to be atleast into his puberty.     This also matches up with other characters in the ""toon"" games, which have vastly varying sizes despite being adults, like the minister in Minish Cap."
truezelda,36d6q5,robotortoise,2,Mon May 18 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"Huh, I guess there's just a lot of short people in ""Toon"" games!  And I guess I just assumed Grandma and Old Niko shrunk because of age, but I guess not!"

truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,1 point,Mon May 18 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean ST (Spirit Tracks) cause SS is (Schutzstaffel) Skyward Sword    And the Link from ST is not a descendant from PH Link. Link does not reincarnate through lineage, that has only happened once by coincidence. All other Links have no connection to each other in their lineage."
truezelda,36d6q5,XC_Stallion92,-2,Tue May 19 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"It's the same reason Link doesn't speak. He is simply a vehicle to move the gameplay along. There is no point in trying to get too in-depth into Link as a character, because the games don't hinge on character development, but rather gameplay. He is a ""link"" between the individual player and the world of Hyrule."
truezelda,36d6q5,EcoleBuissonniere,9,Tue May 19 08:29:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's true for a lot of the 2D games, but I feel like with the 3D ones that's starting to apply less and less. TP Link in particular was a surprisingly well-done character for a guy who never speaks."
truezelda,36d6q5,DangTaylor,7,Mon May 18 17:26:14 2015 UTC,Yep. And that's a great thing imo. The whole thing about him only existing as the player's avatar is dated and unappealing to me.  Many games have come along to prove that protagonists are even more awesome when they have their own personality and character. I identify better with the ones who are fleshed out than with the ones who aren't.
truezelda,36d6q5,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Mon May 18 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"I find that my favourite way for games to do it is somewhere in the middle. Give a character a life and personality of their own, while still letting the player feel as though they are that character. I've thus far seen this done two ways. The first is to have the character controlled by the player, in-cutscene and out, but have the character have their own defining traits, personal history, and occasionally non-player-controlled dialogue. Hawke in Dragon Age II and Lee in The Walking Dead are good examples of this. The other way is to make the character essentially a blank slate, but still have them react to events in their own way and have obvious, if mostly unseen relationships with other characters. The latter is what Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword did, and I thought it worked really, really well.   It's actually really interesting to note how this method of writing a character seems to be usually done using that character's relationships with others, rather than anything specific to the character themself. Hawke is mostly defined by her relationship with her sibling and mother, Lee by his relationship with Clementine (plus smaller, more specific things, like how one of the few stand-out moments dealing with his past mostly concerns his relationship with his brother), and Link is pretty much exclusively defined by this (e.g. his friendship with Ilia and Midna in TP and Zelda in SS). It works really well, too."

truezelda,36d6q5,Phoxxent,0,Mon May 18 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"Well, and ALttP Link is more than likely of mostly patriarchal lineage with SS Link, since SS Link would likely have founded the knights of Hyrule, and ALttP Link is confirmed to have the blood of a knight."
truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,5,Mon May 18 20:03:32 2015 UTC,I don't think link formed the knights. I wouldn't even be surprised if it took a couple of generations before they formed an actual kingdom.
truezelda,36d6q5,solaris1990,6,Mon May 18 21:59:47 2015 UTC,Without getting creative or fan-fic-y:   OOT Link - no one. Malon and Ruto flirt with him but that's basically it. Nothing bigger is hinted at because Link pretty much moves on from each area and group of characters as the story progresses (except for Zelda I guess). MM: No one in this arc. WW: I can't remember the nature of Link and Tetra's relationship in this. I think she just liked teasing him. Been a lifetime since I played it. TP: Ilia for obvious reasons or Midna towards the end but I would hardly call that a prolonged romantic interest. SS: Zelda... it was very clearly designed to allude to romantic feelings between Link and Zelda.
truezelda,36d6q5,henryuuk,3,Mon May 18 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"Tetra and Link seem pretty close very quickly. Considering they continued to live together on a boat until they found New hyrule, there is a pretty big chance their relationship expanded."

The fact that he has Epona indicates that he also has a friendship with Malon, who likely later became his wife. I like to think Link gets to live a life of peace after MM as a reward for all the horrors he faced in the future and Termina. But that proved to be a two-edged sword, as it meant there was no need for him to pass on his skills. He ultimately died full of regret and lingered for untold years as the Hero's Shade. Poor guy couldn't even find any peace in death."
truezelda,363343,Dismas423,17,Fri May 15 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"But how does that explain the new warrior's armor, shield and sword the hero's shade wears?  It was always in my head that Link wanted to live a life of peace, even started a family with Malon, but he could never settle down. He could never truly know peace because he was a fighter who only knew how to save the world. He spent the rest of his life adventuring and fighting and never passed on his knowledge to his offspring because he died away from them. This completes the tragic theme of The Hero of Time's life."
truezelda,363343,Eleos,15,Sat May 16 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"I think Hyrule has a standing army, and Link joined that army when he got older. But by that point, Ganondorf had been defeated and there was no one left for Hyrule to fight. Link was ready to fight in case another war broke out, but the peace endured so he never got a chance to prove himself on the battlefield or pass on his skills. Or maybe the armor was purely ceremonial, a gift from the Royal Family to commemorate his role in the apprehension of Ganondorf. Whatever happened, I think that Link led a quiet life that was ultimately unsatisfying for someone who had saved two worlds. So his spirit lingered until the world had need of a Hero again."
truezelda,363343,Dismas423,5,Sat May 16 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about the gigantic prison in the desert that strongly suggests Hylian occupation of the Gerudo lands. I also dont think it would be quite so easy to just imprison Ganondorf. There was likely a long, bitter war between Hyrule and the Gerudo leading to the execution of Ganondorf and I would also suggest Link had a large part to play in the conquest after Ganon's demise and his return from Termina, especially if his livelihood (ranching) and wife (Malon) were threatened by militant bandits whose king had been executed.  EDIT: I'm with you on the unsatisfying nature of the rest of his life, though. I just imagine Link became a renowned warrior who never knew what it was like to settle down. You see this with trauma victims in war, they often redeploy because it is the only way they feel normal."
truezelda,363343,Eleos,7,Sat May 16 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"I personally see the struggle against Ganondorf as a brief affair. Since Ganondorf didn't know the King of Hyrule was aware of his plan, he was apprehended rather quickly. The Gerudo, angered that the Hylians had unilaterally overthrown and executed their king, renounced their country's fealty to the King of Hyrule and went into isolation. Maybe there was a battle in the Arbiter's Grounds, but I don't see a lot of evidence of a prolonged war. That being said, exactly what happens between MM and TP is definitely something that's up to interpretation, and your theory is perfectly valid."
truezelda,363343,Dismas423,6,Sat May 16 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I personally love the interpretive aspect of this series. It makes it feel bery personal. In my mind Link is a worn out veteran with a tragic end a la classic Greek tragedy. Your end is a beautiful fairytale with peace and romance after a hard-fought battle. In this way the story of Link, Hyrule and Zelda truly is a legend!"
truezelda,363343,Eleos,2,Sat May 16 16:30:14 2015 UTC,I always thought the Arbiters grounds was (ancient) Gerudo make and was occupied by the hyruleans. To make something as big as the grounds would take generations.
truezelda,363343,locustgate,2,Wed May 20 11:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, the idea being that it was an ancient Gerudo structure that was converted by the Hylians into a prison."

Source: piles and piles of stalfos who exist outside of the Lost Woods in various games in the series.  Also, in your theory, I suppose he just happened to live 10-20 more years before growing up, finding some neat new gear, and then turning into a stalfos?  Or are you one of the people who is going to argue that skeleton monsters are capable of ""growing up""?  Also, the Hero's Shade isn't a stalfos.  He's a ghost.  A shade.  Stalfos are always fully skeletal.  Note the fact that the Hero's Shade is a ghost, particularly around his stomach where he is almost fully transparent.  His face is also far more ""mummified"" than ""skeleton"".  In fact, nothing about the Hero's Shade resembles a stalfos except for the fact that both of them exist post-mortem.    Also, page 118 of the Historia refers to TP Link as the Hero of Time's descendant, and the Hero of Time as his ancestor, specifically.  That is not how you refer to a reincarnation.

In the game's she's been in, she's been a significant, important character. At least as important as Impa, maybe more so.  Also, I have no idea what ""god-hand"" or ""non-character"" means in this context.  Sheik = OoT, OoT3D, Hyrule Warriors.  Impa (the non-elderly version, because the other one is completely irrelevant to a fighting game) = OoT, OoT3D, Skyward Sword, Hyrule Warriors.  Impa (again, non-elderly) has only been in one more game than Sheik. Sure, it's something, but she's not that much more significant.   Impa is a standard member of the core Zelda series cast, and has very recently resurged into getting badass incarnations. She deserves it.   Oh, don't get me wrong, I love Impa. She's a badass, I just think that, realistically, taking out one character and replacing her with a character that has a very similar motif and skill set wouldn't really be worth it.   Though there are a few other characters I'd like to see first, I'd probably be okay with Impa if they added her as another character slot and not replacing Sheik.  I like Sheik..."
truezelda,364zfv,MarvelousMagikarp,3,Tue May 19 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree here. You're acting like they only choose characters based on their current relevance, which is simply not how they do things. They clearly consider 'historical' relevance as well, otherwise there'd be no Duck Hunt, Pac Man, Game & Watch, etc.  Ocarina of Time was undeniably a huge deal in Nintendo's history. With Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf being in pretty much every Zelda game (and thus representing the series as a whole), that means that only Sheik is tied directly to OoT. I'd argue that actually increases Sheik's relevance, because it's a clear nod to the importance and value of OoT.  As far as Impa goes- I'm not arguing against her. I like her quite a bit, and I'd probably be fine with her joining the Smash Bros roster.  I just think that Sheik is a good inclusion that deserves a spot."

For Zelda related characters, I would love to see Young Link return with a more Majoras Mask themed moveset. Make it so all of his specials turn him into one of the three playable races, use an attack, then turn back into Link. For example, his up special could be to turn into a Deku Scrub, use the Deku flower to launch himself into the air, then turn back into Link when he hits the ground. The down special could have Link turn into a Goron and do a ground pound, which could have an area of effect attribute or something. For the side special, he could turn into a Zora and launch his boomerang fins at the enemies. The neutral special could just be Hylian Link using one of his items, like the bow or something. And the final smash could have him put on the Fierce Diety mask. Stuff like that. Though we already have two versions of Link, so a third is not very likely.  For a non-Zelda character, I would have loved to see Paper Mario, but just like with Link, there are already two versions of Mario, and that series doesn't really need another representative right now anyway."

Since Toon Ganon is probably the most ""different"" variation of Ganon, he could definitely make for a more interesting character. Even if there isn't anything special about his moveset, Wind Waker's Ganon is by far the most interesting villain in Zelda, and he really deserves a slot in the roster for this."

I like the idea of having Toon Ganon as a completely different character with all-different specials and normals, if it weren't for the weird situation of there being 6 Zelda characters and 3 of them just being alternate versions of the other 3.

I don't really like Hero Mode as it's implemented in existing games for three reasons.   Nothing changes about the enemies other than they do 8x more damage.  So the experience doesn't feel new or fresh.  (Compare with ""Extra"" mode in Kirby's Return to Dreamland, where you have less health, but the enemies have all new move sets and more intelligent strategies.) It's, IMO, too hard.  Especially in ALbW, normal mode is like ""baby's first Zelda"" and Hero Mode is ""you can literally take a max of 1 or 2 hits.""  I want something more challenging, but I don't want a frustrating experience where a single hit early in a dungeon means I basically need to restart the game. Relating to #2, Hero Mode feels more like an ""NES Remix Challenge"" (complete this dungeon taking no more than 3 hits!) than a ""hard mode."""

truezelda,35tk6x,malaroo,36,Wed May 13 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"Personally, I never understood this debate. I've never played Zelda to be challenged, I've played it for the experience and the story.  I'm not saying Zelda should be easy or that everyone else is wrong; just that while games like Dark Souls, Geometry Wars, Super Meat Boy etc. benefit immensely from difficulty and challenge, I don't feel Zelda benefits the same way. Bosses that take 4 or 5 tries only serve to break the flow of the game and introduce frustration.  I would not like a difficulty slider, for sure. I feel it would break the immersion for me.  All just my humble opinion though."
truezelda,35tk6x,23saround,7,Wed May 13 13:37:31 2015 UTC,"and the story.   This is the one that I don't really understand.  I enjoy Zelda's story as well, but until recently it was... intentionally bare-bones and as basic as could be, because ""gameplay before story.""  Now, one of my favorite things about Zelda has always been the ""figure it out"" aspect.  Taking the time to solve and defeat more challenging things makes me invest more in the games, and focus on them to a much higher degree, and this directly affects my enjoyment.  When something is more like 'going through the motions', it becomes boring to me very fast, because it doesn't require much at all from my brain.  Now, this kind of thing has faded from Zelda for 3 reasons.   An adult brain will obviously have less trouble solving something than a child brain. As we've played these games for years and years, we've obviously become better at them, and thus the things that used to seem challenging are now a piece of cake. The games have gotten easier, to be more accessible to a wider audience of non-hardcore-gamers.   Now, that's all fair, but I for one would love to see the challenge that used to make my brain so invested in the game return, and if a difficulty slider was the best way to do that, then I'd take it in a heartbeat.  I'm not a huge fan of 'modular' things in videogames; things that change how the game plays with the press of one switch, but I think it would be a better balance, satisfying to a higher amount of people than something which is simply absurdly hard or mind-numbingly easy.  If it were implemented that way, I wouldn't want the ability to change it after you pick it.  I'd prefer it be locked to what you picked when you started the game, maybe with one ""Are you sure you want to keep these settings?"" option after you complete the introduction part of the game.  Being able to change it at-will would be cheap, to me.  You're having trouble with a boss?  Turn the slider down.  To me, that is immersion breaking, like you said.  I just miss the days when Zelda made me think, because I enjoy thinking and becoming invested something, more than blasting through it without a care in the world.  If a slider is the best way to satisfy the most amount of people, I see no reason not to implement it, or at least an option like it."
truezelda,35tk6x,Ruairi101,2,Thu May 14 09:00:33 2015 UTC,Exactly. Playing WWHD on Hero Mode was like watching an alright movie. I was uninvested for the vast majority because there was no risk of death.
truezelda,35tk6x,Ruairi101,4,Fri May 15 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"I can agree with this for the extent, which is why a normal difficulty would exist. I'd more than likely have 2 game files at once if this were to be implemented. One for the relaxing side of Zelda and the other for more of a challenge. I'm also against a difficulty slider because you can change it at any time, I support choosing a difficulty before you start the most.  However, having options have never been a bad thing IMO."
truezelda,35tk6x,Phoxxent,21,Wed May 13 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"However, having options have never been a bad thing IMO.   Careful with this. There's an interesting line in this article on choices within software UIs: Every time you provide an option, you're asking the user to make a decision.  I'll use Smash Bros. as an example of where a difficulty slider works. When a new player starts the game, they'll (probably) pick the default difficulty, or they might go easier out of caution or harder because they've played a similar game before. They'll play a match or two at that difficulty and determine whether they should go up or down. For their next few matches they'll change, re-evaluate and so on. This works really well and it's clear how their choice is affecting the game and their enjoyment. Nice.  Let's look at Zelda this time, and for arguments sake, I'll assume the difficulty is locked once the player has chosen (as you suggested). The player might choose the easy difficulty because it's his first game. Two dungeons in, he's bored because it's too easy. He can't change difficult without starting again and so feels like he's had a ""missed opportunity"". He'll feel bad about his decision and will enjoy the game less. But at least he can continue.  Even worse, if he picks Hard, gets three dungeons in and can't continue/wants to throw his controller through the TV, he has to start all over again. Asking a player to scrap everything they've done and start over is really, really bad. (why else did Mortal Combat X players get mad when a patch deleted their save files?)  A key issue is that the result of this choice is so abstract. What is 'Easy' and 'Hard'? If the choice was the colour of Link's tunic, it's a bit easier; the player can understand the choice immediately and make a decision. However, difficulty is hard to accurately describe; the player has to play the game for a while to understand the choice. Furthermore, the game gets harder as it goes on anyway. Now there's two difficulty variables; problematic for players and the developers/designers writing the game.  Maybe some of these situations are a bit contrived, but you can see where choices, while having good intentions, can just create problems.  TL;DR: choice can actually negatively impact users and sometimes the designer has to put their foot down. Also I can really go on, can't I? Sorry..."
truezelda,35tk6x,solaris1990,3,Wed May 13 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"Also I can really go on, can't I? Sorry...   By no means are you hurting any of us. I love well thought out posts that explain what they mean, and gosh darn it, I agree with what you've said.  There would be a solution, perhaps. What if you can change the difficulty anywhere but scripted/main points of the games such as dungeons or during fights? Maybe limit it to all overworld save points or something?  There are ways around it, but an optimal solution would need to be found."
truezelda,35tk6x,Ruairi101,5,Wed May 13 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"I think the only way to make this work is to take the control of the difficulty away from the player, not unlike Left 4 Dead's Director. If you tear through the first 4 Bokoblins easier, maybe the rest start blocking and positioning themselves a bit better. Similarly, if you're getting crowded out and taking a lot of hits, maybe they start bumping into each other or dropping their swords.  Unfortunately, this would be hard to plan and implement; deciding whether a player is doing well or not is a tricky problem, likewise implementing every enemy's various behaviour patterns. AI can be nucking futs, man."

I love it when I can return to the early areas and easily take care of enemies, especially becuase it allows me to focus solely on the quest at hand not worry about dying because I was trying to figure out where to go and running around in circles. In fact, that was one thing I didn't like about skyward sword, I couldn't ""feel progressed"", because all the enemies advanced with me, so I couldn't just go and beat down those 30 second bokoblins in 5 seconds, because those 30 second bokoblins were replaced with new bokoblins that will still take me 30 seconds."

For the sake of pride, your file could be marked with the lowest difficulty you used during the game.  That way, there's pride for players who want to 100% the game on hero mode.  But a player who starts the game on easy and knocks it up to normal after the first dungeon--their file will say ""easy"" on it, but the type of person who's starting the game on easy probably doesn't care about that pride factor."
truezelda,35tk6x,pattybak3s,3,Wed May 13 21:15:40 2015 UTC,"The 'pride factor' is a really interesting point. Personally, I don't think I'd be able to drop down a difficulty level if I was struggling; my ego couldn't take it. In addition, by allowing players to manipulate the difficulty manually, you limit the way difficulty can be applied e.g. the layout of every map and dungeon must be the same for every difficulty."

Not necessarily.  The game can have certain checkpoints that changing the difficult resets you to.    So, I sincerely doubt the developers would completely rearrange a dungeon based on the difficulty setting, but if they wanted to do so, changing the difficulty could just have a message that says ""Are you sure you want to change the game to Easy? You will have to restart the current dungeon.""  Of course, the boss fight tends to be separate from the dungeon, so changing difficulty during a boss could reset the boss fight, rather than forcing you to redo the whole dungeon.  If the developers just want the puzzles in certain rooms to change based on difficulty, then resetting the difficulty could just reload the room.  Or more realistically, if the enemies just become more numerous and use different attacks based on difficulty, there's no reason a ""seamless"" switch wouldn't be possible."

truezelda,35tk6x,ArtistCook,3,Wed May 13 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but even this it wasn't HARD. Zelda isn't favorite series, but its one that gives me no challenge. :("
truezelda,35tk6x,TinyEnemyShrimp,1 point,Wed May 13 12:58:50 2015 UTC,Have you tried hero mode 3 heart?
truezelda,35tk6x,TeekTheReddit,2,Wed May 13 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"That's not hard, it's just obscenely punishing.  The difficulty of not getting hit is exactly the same as normal mode."
truezelda,35tk6x,TheNonis,2,Thu May 14 11:24:16 2015 UTC,"That I haven't. I was never a fan of 3 heart mode, personally. I'm far too clumsy to get hit once and then die because 95% of the time it'd be me committing suicide haha."
truezelda,35tk6x,PetiteBalls,5,Wed May 13 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"That I can agree with. It's less ""hard"" as much as it is frustrating. It doesn't make the game harder per say, just more difficult if that makes sense (but not really).   Still, getting the Hylian shield in 6 heart hero mode in Skyward Sword was one of the most difficult things I've attempted in gaming."
truezelda,35tk6x,solaris1990,1 point,Wed May 13 14:02:37 2015 UTC,I understand completely. Difficult != Hard.
truezelda,35tk6x,Serbaayuu,6,Wed May 13 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea.  Easy Mode - Enemies inflict half damage.  If you die 4 times in a row on the same level, you get a one-use invincibility potion.  You can optionally recieve hints toward difficult puzzles  Normal Mode - Standard difficulty, except now that Easy Mode is there, the game doesn't have to be dumbed down to appeal to casual players.  Hero Mode - All Heart Containers are gone.  (3 heart challenge).  No fairies.  You can carry 1 potion max."
truezelda,35tk6x,henryuuk,5,Wed May 13 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah if normal mode could not have someone like Fi interjection with random information, that'd be great.  The cut scenes to show what buttons did also felt a little hand holdy in SS."
truezelda,35tk6x,solaris1990,6,Wed May 13 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Your suggestion has the same problem as current hero mode.  There's a huge leap in difficulty between ""normal"" and ""hero,"" and hero mode isn't really more difficult, it's just sort of cheap, unbalanced, and frustrating.  I think Splinter Cell does it right.  There's easy (infinite ammo, enemies are kind of dumb), normal (limited ammo, enemies are normal), realistic (more enemies and they are smarter), and perfect (you get seen at all, you get killed).  Personally, I think even ""normal"" on Splinter Cell is a bit difficult (and Splinter Cell's problem is that easy is too easy and normal is too hard).  But they still let you scale it up more without going into ""cheap and insane"" mode.  Zelda's normal difficulty is a tad too easy, so it would really benefit from that intermediate ""hard"" difficulty where enemies are more numerous and smarter."
truezelda,35tk6x,henryuuk,1 point,Wed May 13 21:20:49 2015 UTC,"Problem, going by that, Hero Mode would allow you only 1 hit from the final boss, and then you'd have to restart, which I think is pretty bullshit to have as something beyond a self-imposed challenge. Why can't there be hints in Normal mode? If we assume people will usually go in at normal mode, why should they not have the option to get hints to solve the puzzle? Even in the easier games, you've always had one or two puzzles that were quite stumping. For example, getting the Master Ore in ALBW. And the harder games have still always had a way to get hints, though their helpfulness was often dubious and pointed only to the next plot point (seriously Nintendo, don't do that. I know the next plot point, tell me where to take this darn Pineapple!) Finally, what defines a ""level"", and how long does the potion last? Zelda isn't as broken up as Mario, so ""level"" doesn't really work, especially since you can often die outside a dungeon. Heck, some of the games use enemy strength to guide the player through the game, so giving out an invincibility potion for dying 4 times would allow for some serious sequence breaking if the game follows that model, which is not something I think Nintendo is going to want (especially as it can sometimes break the game, as the player could get stuck by not having an item or the plot would trigger forward and cut off some previous important thing, making progression impossible)."
truezelda,35tk6x,solaris1990,2,Sat May 16 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"Be nice not to have to play through the whole game to unlock 'heroic mode'  It would be nice if it wasn't piss easy or hand holding.  Heck a slider to pretty much just say 'no hand holding, some hand holding, fi level hand holding' would be fine with me"

As long as it doesn't take away from the story and world I'm fine with whatever they do.  Luckily we can challenge ourselves if we find the game too easy. Like when I played Ocarina of Time, after beating it five times I started a new file where I would only have 3 hearts for the entire game. Since you don't have to take the heart container after your boss fight it's simple to do :)"

Just roll between his legs, then do the 360 degree slash technique by spinning the control stick around in a full circle and hitting B.

During the fight with Ganon when he knocks the Master Sword away, save the game and restart. You'll restart in Ganon's Tower without a Sword.  The major use for Swordless Link is being able to use C-items on top of Epona.

I used to spend all my childhood days exploring the Twilight Princess maps using this bug.  I can't find a video of any cool hidden areas, but this clip from this video is the bomb-jump bug."
truezelda,35qdr2,_S0UL_,1 point,Wed May 13 02:20:54 2015 UTC,"The Bombchu hover glitch for OOT and MM.  More specifically OOT since I was able to fight Dark Link and Morpha as a child using it to travel across the dungeon in places out of reach. Before doing all that I skipped the Water Temple but got the Longshot so that I can complete the rest of the temples normally as well as get all the bag upgrades and hearts. Moving through the temple as a child was really tough since I had to use Bombchu hover almost everywhere and when I would run out of supply I would have to use Farore's Wind and leave to play the Bombchu mini game to reload, then I would use Farore's again to return to the dungeon room and keep moving. The cool thing is that the game assumes that I've beaten it since I went and beat the others after it so the rainbow bridge to Ganon's castle appears as well. I still have the saved game on the cartridge and one day I plan to do it on GCN port (I've been saying that for years lol). It's saved at the entrance of the Water Temple and if I want to fight Dark Link all I do is use Farore's to teleport to the room, if I want to fight Morpha I have to Bomchu hover there since child Link can't use the Hookshot.   Also, if anyone is interested in trying this you should know that in the room before Dark Link there are moving platforms going down a slope and into a bottomless pit, as an adult you're supposed to hookshot to each one quick enough and get to the top before they go to the pit along with you. Since you're a child you're going to have to Bomchu hover all the way up but you must only do it when you're hovering above a platform as they pass below you because if you try it when you're above the slope, for some reason after you attempt to hover you will fall to your death."

truezelda,35onnb,TheKingleMingle,3,Tue May 12 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed that was what became of Skyloft, then after the humans eventually abandoned it (or the sky tribe died out), it became the City in the Sky."
truezelda,35onnb,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue May 12 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"Your unclear, but Minnish Cap is after SS. One theory I heard is that Vaati drove the Wind tribe higher into the sky and they eventually mutated into the Oocos (BURN THEM ALL!) or Skyloft is the City in the Sky and the loftwings became the Oocos (STILL BURN THEM!), the wind tribe city is different from skyloft."
truezelda,35onnb,locustgate,2,Tue May 19 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"In my theory, the Wind Tribe (also from TMC) built the City in the Sky because they wanted to return to the clouds. Skyloft was gone, either because it returned to the ground or because it was just inaccessible, so they built their own mechanical city that could fly. Then Vaati came and took it over, forcing them back to their tower. When they finally managed to return again, they decided to use magic to transform themselves into birds. But it didn't work very well, so they became the Ooccas."
truezelda,35onnb,Cillendor,7,Wed May 13 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Well, as was already mentioned, there is Lake Hylia, but also they used the term ""Hylian"" well before that. Hylian is literally ""people of Hylia,"" similar to how American is ""person of America.""  As for the city that Shad talks about, you visit in right in TP. The City in the Sky temple.   You have a good eye to catch these things. However, where most of it was explained further in TP and such, I personally think it's more likely that after TP had been released, they decided to visit the history of the city and the Sky in the following game.  Remember, TP was a GCN game that was essentially ported to wii when the wii first came out. Skyward Sword came out 5 years later, more than enough time to decide to make these points a large focus of the story.   That's just my opinion on it though."
truezelda,35onnb,enigbane,0,Tue May 12 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"To put it more specifically, Zelda and Link are traditionally Hylians due to the pointy ears. However there is a less talked about race very similar to the Hylians called the Hyrulians. The main difference? Rounded ears.Note that in all three timelines it's been declared that the hylians actually became less prominent as time went on. Compare Ocarina of Time to let's say Twilight Princess or Wind Waker, where the only Hylians were Both Links, Grandma, Aryll, and Both Zeldas are the only ones that immediately come to mind. BTW Hylian should be likened to someone of Native American Descent, and Hyrulian should be applied to Being born in America."

Hylian = a race of people descended from the goddess Hylia  Hyrulean = a citizen of the Kingdom of Hyrule"
truezelda,35onnb,Dirigibleduck,3,Tue May 12 20:23:57 2015 UTC,You are correct.

Gerudo are a race of humans with red hair and golden eyes.  Sheikah are a race or tribe of humans as well.  There are also just regular humans, who are not given any particular name.  Source: the humans call themselves humans in Skyward Sword, as do Demise and Ghirahim.  ""Hyrulean"" would refer to any citizen of Hyrule, which includes nonhuman subjects.  Also, Hylians may live outside of Hyrule, and human denizens outside of Hyrule would simply be called humans.  Or by their nationality (Labrynnean, etc.)."
truezelda,35onnb,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue May 12 21:01:40 2015 UTC,That's very interesting. I always thought the two terms were interchangeable. When do you first start seeing Hyrulians? is it Wind Waker? I don't remember any in OoT. Huh.

truezelda,35ojk8,CyonicWolf,6,Tue May 12 05:50:51 2015 UTC,"Hyrule, Holodrum, and Labrynna are all separate countries in the same world. Subrosia is a separate land directly underneath Holodrum. In the Adult Timeline, this world is flooded and replaced with a new world including the Great Sea and New Hyrule. The Sacred Realm/Dark World is a separate dimension attached to Hyrule, but not part of it. All other countries, such as Termina and Lorule, are part of one or more parallel worlds.  I think it's possible that Termina and Lorule could be part of the same world. Of all the alternate dimensions seen in the series, they are the only ones whose inhabitants directly mirror those of Hyrule. Masks are also relevant to the cultures of both countries.  I personally don't connect the Realm of the Ocean King with these two countries. The people of that world don't parallel those of the Great Sea, and the symbols of Hyrule's gods appear throughout the country, suggesting a closer relationship to Hyrule than the other two have. The ending of PH makes it seem like the RotOK might be a dream world like Koholint Island, but ST establishes that people from that world traveled to New Hyrule, so it must actually exist. I think it's a separate dimension not in the same world as any other country we've seen so far.  There have been multiple games where Ganon or his minions threaten more than one country or world, such as ALttP and the Oracles. But I still think it would be cool to have a game where the overworld is large enough to include the various countries seen throughout the series. Link's quest would begin in Hyrule, but there would be dungeons in Holodrum and Labrynna as well. Hyrule changes a lot over the course of its history and I would really like to see how the other countries have changed over the centuries."
truezelda,35ojk8,Dismas423,3,Tue May 12 14:26:01 2015 UTC,I think it's possible that Termina and Lorule could be part of the same world.   I think there's also something to the idea that the leaders of the human civilizations in both of those countries share purple hair and red eyes.
truezelda,35ojk8,Serbaayuu,2,Tue May 12 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"This is something I've considered, and at one point I took it as evidence that Hilda was a direct descendant of Kafei and Anju. But the royal family of Lorule seems to go back pretty far and had a connection with their country's Triforce. The mayor's family is never referred to as royalty, and as of MM3D, there are no references to the Triforce in Termina. So now I don't think Hilda and Kafei are directly related, but are rather scions of the same ancient family."
truezelda,35ojk8,Dismas423,2,Tue May 12 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the only reference to the Hyrule Triforce that I'm aware of in Holodrum or Labrynna are on the Essence pedestals.  So it's not unreasonable that Termina wouldn't reference the Lorulean Triforce anywhere.  And it makes even more sense that they wouldn't reference or even know about the Hyrulean Triforce.   So now I don't think Hilda and Kafei are directly related, but are rather scions of the same ancient family.   Yeah, I agree with that, the Terminian leaders are probably some long-standing offshoot family from the Lorulean Royals."

And also Aonuma said it's a different realm entirely.  It's an entire parallel dimension with its own Triforce; the Sacred Realm is the place that Hyrule stores their Triforce to keep it safe."
truezelda,35ojk8,Serbaayuu,7,Mon May 25 10:44:35 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, I'd love to see a game were Link started as part of a diplomatic escort for Princess Zelda as she mediates a war between Holdrum and Labrynna (not sure if I got the spelling right there). It would be cool to see a more political based plot within the series and I've always assumed that Holdrum, Labrynna and Hyrule were on the same continent (with some no-mans-land in between).  I've also always assumed that New Hyrule (from spirit tracks) was on a different and much higher continent."
truezelda,35ojk8,Trials_and_3rrors,11,Tue May 12 07:28:27 2015 UTC,"There are four ""worlds"" (a.k.a. dimensions) that make up the universe in Hyrule.  Hyrule, Lorule, Sacred Realm, Twilight Realm    Hyrule:   Hyrule Holodrum (outer province) Subrosia (literally underground) Labrynna (outer province) Great Sea (above Hyrule) New Hyrule (originally outer province)     Lorule:   Lorule Termina (outer province) Realm of the Ocean King (Flooded Lorule, because parallel histories)     Sacred Realm:   We visit this on occasion, the most obviously being in ALttP where it turned into the Dark World.  I also believe this is where Zelda and Link end up after slaying Ganon in OoT.  And this is where Demise brings Link at the end of Skyward Sword.  This is ""the Realm of the Gods"" in a sense.     Twilight Realm:   This has only appeared in Twilight Princess, acting as a divine prison.  However, I also believe that the Dark Mirror in Four Swords Adventures is another Twilight Mirror, and that Vaati uses its twilight powers to a similar effect on the land as Zant did.      what do you all believe are the ""connections"" between these countries are   We know for a fact that Lorule, Termina, and the Realm of the Ocean King are alternate dimensions.  Lorule is quite obvious.  Termina is detailed in the manual and other places.  When Link and Tetra return from the Realm of the Ocean King, only 5 minutes have passed in Hyrule.  There is also the Dark Realm spoken of now and then, and we see it in Spirit Tracks.  I don't fit this into my theory as of now because I am not certain it is an entire place.  It could refer to the Twilight Realm, but the Twilight Realm is meant to be totally empty.  Personally, right now I think that it is a manifestation of evil that does not exist naturally but is formed when someone like Malladus has need of it, or it is the ""space between spaces"" that exists outside of dimensions.   Like Ganon ha sfinally gathered enough power to attack all of these countries and is planning on using artifacts or powers from each of these world to further his schemes?   Kinda happened in OoX.  :)  But yes, I have been waiting to see something more politically-oriented out of the series.  Spirit Tracks gave us a good taste of it with Zelda actually having a council and actually being a regent instead of a 10-year-old queen-princess."
truezelda,35ojk8,Serbaayuu,12,Tue May 12 11:36:23 2015 UTC,"Ser, it's important too note that this section :    Lorule:    Lorule Termina (outer province) Realm of the Ocean King (Flooded Lorule, because parallel histories)     Is your fan theory, and is not confirmed.

truezelda,35ojk8,TheBattler,2,Tue May 12 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"I believe Termina and Lorule are the same world due to the possible relation between Kafei's family and Hilda's family (the shared physical traits).  There's also the fact that masks feature prominently in the culture of both worlds.  Now, if we assume distance traveled in Hyrule = distance traveled in Lorule (which appears to be the case in ALBW), we can acknowledge that Link traveled very far in the Lost Woods before finding Termina.  In fact, we know that some Lost Woods, and I would wager that they are the same as Hyrule's, appear all the way in Holodrum.  So there is already precedent for the Lost Woods being big enough to be contained by more than one country.  Link could have walked far enough to be in another country, relative to Lorule, and then fell into Lorule in said country, which is Termina.    As for the connection to the Realm of the Ocean King, it's more nebulous.  Both the RotOK and Termina have a heavy obsession with time, with it being central to their culture.  Also, as the RotOK is flooded, it must have some parallel to Hyrule.  Hyrule was flooded for a good reason, so the RotOK must have been as well, similarly to how Lorule destroying their Triforce parallels one of Hyrule's wars (although which one is arguable).  I find it kind of unreasonable to assume that an entire dimension that's 100% ocean exists ""just because"", especially when we have precedent for parallel worlds with similar major historical events.   don't the Gorons and the Anouki immigrate to New Hyrule?   Since the RotOK is a parallel world, and the passages between it and Hyrule are probably not commonly-traversed (Linebeck being the exception), I would suggest that the anouki already existed in New Hyrule and the gorons had immigrated there from the Great Sea long ago, and the ones we see in the RotOK are merely their counterparts, much like both other instances of parallel worlds in the series.  Unless there is actually something in the dialogue in Spirit Tracks to suggest that those peoples have ancestors from the RotOK."
truezelda,35ojk8,Serbaayuu,3,Tue May 12 20:48:00 2015 UTC,"One of the Anoukis in ST says this:   Way back when, us Anoukis lived on an island encased in ice. But one day, someone told us we couldn't just crash there forever. So we packed up our junk and set out in search of a new land to call home.   I've always interpreted that as meaning the Anoukis left their home on the Isle of Frost and relocated to New Hyrule. I don't recall the Gorons in ST saying anything about their origins. They might have come from Goron Island, or they could have come to New Hyrule directly from the Great Sea shortly after the Flood."

truezelda,35ojk8,Serbaayuu,3,Tue May 12 23:03:39 2015 UTC,"Termina (outer province)   Holy crap, I never even thought about it but it kinda makes sense.

truezelda,35ojk8,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue May 12 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"In my mind, the ""planet"" they're on is flat. Hyrule, Labrynna, and Holodrum, (New Hyrule?,) and the lands of Zelda II are on one side. Lorule, Termina, and possibly New Hyrule are on the other.  Labrynna is far west of Hyrule. Holodrum is between them. There are unexplored lands to the north of both.  Termina is on the far western shore of Lorule, separated by inhospitable desert. New Hyrule might be part of this world.  I include New Hyrule in the ""far side"" because I imagine some sort of scenario where Tetra and her crew sailed all the way to the edge of the Great Sea and wound up on the other side of the world. There isn't necessarily a good canonical reason for this, I just think it helps to balance out the maps better.  I put Termina and Lorule in the same world because (1) masks are important in both places, (2) the portal the Skull Kid took to Termina might be similar to the ones Yuga and Link used to reach Lorule, and (3) it fits my larger mythology of Hyrule better this way."
truezelda,35olvm,CyonicWolf,3,Tue May 12 06:18:57 2015 UTC,"It's my theory that all magical items in the Zelda universe decay over time.  Magic is not a permanent fixture in enchantments or anything - we see this in seals weakening, etc.  The same should happen to the swords, and it does, as we see in Wind Waker, where it needs to be re-powered.  Fallen Timeline:  I believe the Master Sword is depowered and becomes the White Sword by Zelda 1 in this timeline.  The Master Sword being the White Sword during its forging in Skyward Sword supports this.  Thus the Magical Sword in Zelda 1 is actually the Four Sword, depowered as well.  Since the Four Sword was forged later than the Master Sword, and has similar strength (it can defeat Ganon), it should be stronger.  The Master Sword was never powered up in the Fallen Timeline, either (ALBW would suggest that the optional sword upgrades in ALttP aren't canon, and thus I assume neither are the ALBW upgrades).  I'll also note that the White Sword and Magical Sword resemble their respective blades in this theory: the White Sword has a flat blue hilt (similar to the depowered Master Sword in Wind Waker) and straight blade, while the Magical Sword has a pronged hilt and a curved blade like the Four Sword.  Neither the Phantom Sword nor Lokomo Sword were forged, as there was no need.  Child Timeline:  Both swords should still be around in this timeline.  The Four Sword is sharp and shiny at the known endpoint of this timeline, while the Master Sword was not seen.  The last we saw of it, it was jabbed into Ganondorf's soul.  I've had a game idea for a sequel for Twilight Princess where Ganondorf actually injected his soul into the Master Sword, corrupting it, which causes it to shatter or something similar upon being drawn by the next Hero.  That might be fun.  But we can assume that the Master Sword is safe after Twilight Princess, as we have no reason not to.  It may have gradually depowered, but in Twilight Princess it was powered up by the Sols back to its maximum strength, so it should be just as strong as the Four Sword now.  Again, the Lokomo Sword and Phantom Sword were not forged.  Adult Timeline:  The Master Sword is in a rock, gone forever.  It had become depowered over time and was re-powered by the Sages (originally they did this before the Flood when they discovered it loses power over time, so they made a tradition out of it) before being lost.  The Four Sword should be buried along with the rest of Hyrule, but there is always a chance it was preserved.  If it was, however, it would have freed Vaati, who was still sealed inside it at that time, so it probably was never moved.  It's likely that Vaati is doomed to rot forever in his seal and would never break free in that timeline.  The Phantom Sword is ""missing"" after Phantom Hourglass because it was created inside a parallel dimension and, as far as I am aware, Link does not bring it back out with him.  And the Lokomo Sword is just as strong as the Master Sword, as it is able to kill Malladus, who is likely an incarnation of Demise.  However, unless Malladus becomes the primary villain of New Hyrule, I think it is likely that at least one more magical sword will be forged in that place to become a mainstay, if we ever get a new mainstay villain in that timeline."
truezelda,35olvm,Serbaayuu,2,Tue May 12 11:24:18 2015 UTC,"Solid stuff, I love it.  One thing:   It's likely that Vaati is doomed to rot forever in his seal and would never break free in that timeline.      … all magical items in the Zelda universe decay over time … we see this in seals weakening, etc.   ?"
truezelda,35olvm,HylianHal,2,Thu May 14 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"Good point, I think the fact that there's an ocean on top of him would prevent him from escaping, though.  I suppose it's possible, though.  Also, Vaati himself might degrade since he is basically just a magical entity sealed inside a blade, much like Demise's consciousness did when Fi absorbed him."
truezelda,35olvm,Serbaayuu,3,Thu May 14 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"In the Downfall Timeline, the last time we see the Master Sword is ALBW, not OoX. I think it's possible a future game on this timeline could bring the Master Sword back, but right now there's nothing suggesting the blade ever left the Lost Woods again. The situation in the Child Timeline is similar. Link returned the Master Sword to its resting place after defeating Ganon. Since we haven't seen the sword since then, the best assumption is that it remains in its pedestal in the Sacred Grove. In the Adult Timeline, the Master Sword was destroyed along with the rest of Hyrule at the end of WW. It should never be seen again after that point.  There doesn't seem to be anything special about the Phantom Sword. Zauz says there have been multiple Phantom Swords throughout history. It seems to be a type of blade used specifically for fighting phantoms rather than a sacred blade like the Master Sword or Four Sword.  The Four Sword was most likely destroyed in the Adult Timeline. The sword was still being used as Vaati's prison when the timeline split and nothing indicates that Vaati escaped. The most likely outcome is that the Four Sword was still in Hyrule at the end of WW and destroyed with the rest of the country.  The fate of the Four Sword in the Downfall Timeline is a lot more ambiguous. If you accept the Palace of the Four Sword as canon, the Four Sword was used sometime after OoT and ended up in the Dark World broken into four pieces. Link recovered the blade, but what he does with it after that is unknown. It might become one of the swords from LoZ. If the Palace of the Four Sword is non-canon, then it seems that the Four Sword should still be in its shrine sealing Vaati."

I don't think ""something that makes Ganon look weak"" would work, since he is the incarnation of the ultimate evil being.  But there could be another Bellum/Majora/Malladus-like being who appears and then absorbs Ganon's power after his death to become twice as strong.

If you didn't, something different happened. Of course, it was the repeating schedule that let you play such an intricate role in their lives. I don't know how they'd achieve this in a game without the time element. Skyward Sword had the one side quest where you could only choose one to person to help. That was a good idea, but a game full of it would mean you could only do half the side quests in the game. In short, I don't know how to bring back such complex characters, but it can surely be done."
truezelda,35bsg2,nickc122,1 point,Sat May 9 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need a repeating schedule for complex characters. Lots of other games do without. It true that it does allow for consequences for inaction however if that's what you want.  The only way I can see around that is to have quests 'expire' after you reach a certain point in the story and for there to be different scripted consequences or alternate quests if this happened. It would mean that you wouldn't be able to experience everything there is to see within a particular play-through (barring time-travel) but I personally wouldn't mind it.  They could design it so that regardless of the path you choose you end up achieving the same gameplay (but not narrative) goals, so you wouldn't miss out on items or anything. It would all have to be very well-written and coherent to not feel out of place in a Zelda game though."

Give them a few regular lines, and then make every nth interaction one of several ""special"" lines.  That way, a character can have fresh or even surprising dialogue after passing the same character many times, depending on the number of regular and special lines.  Then again, this works better with spoken dialogue heard while passing a character, rather than actual ""walk up and press A"" interactions.  Also, more dialogue trees."

Nazeem from Skyrim has four or more ambient lines he'll cycle through when you get in his ""spew dialogue incessantly"" proximity, but that doesn't make them less annoying.  I recognize static dialogue as a problem that all games have to deal with, but I also really think that when dynamic dialogue is half-assed, it just makes the problem worse.  And we don't have the technology to not half-ass dynamic dialogue yet.  If an AI could be built that would string together certain keywords and phrases and use them to talk about the current circumstances of the world, that could be really interesting.

Do more of that.   Also, I want someone from the future as an ally who helps guide me from afar while also acting as a sort of rival. So, maybe I'd get a hawk with a letter every now and then saying ""Hey Link, how've ya been? Gotten better with that sword of yours? Come over and see if you can best me yet?"" And I could go and duel him. Then, when I need help, I might be able to contact him via a magic mirror and ask for his help, and he'd be all ""Well, I've heard that switches can be found all over the place"" or something. But him being from the future also allows him to appear at just the right moments for the plot, so he'll be there to help me find a dungeon or fight off some enemies. And it would turn out he's my apprentice in the future and got accidentally sent back due to the villain's evil deeds, and him helping me both fulfills the prophecy of me being his mentor, and helps him go back to his own time."

This could work with some kind of aligment system in the game. Also Zelda U sould bring back the Resistence from TP but with more involment in the game, don't just make them appear only in cinematics to aid you (like the scene in Hyrule Castle).

However, it would be very interesting to see a situation where there were two people who both sort of matched the Spirit of the Hero criteria - courageous and willing to do good.  In a Hyrule where the Hero's history is known, it's not unreasonable that some people would tend to look for a new Hero.  If there were two people who fit the bill, and (literal) Hero-worship was a thing that happened, you could have factions of people forming behind each one.  But I think I'd rather see both of them be good guys than for the non-player-character to turn evil.  It might even be more interesting if it turns out at the end of the game that the player character isn't the Hero's true reincarnation, but the other one is, and they still manage to work together to save the day."

truezelda,3596u2,Serbaayuu,3,Fri May 8 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"Phantom Hourglass has the WW story in the opening,  Spirit Tracks has the sealing of Malladus as its opening story. but the fact Zelda prays to tetra, Niko still being alive and so forth are clear signs it is obviously a sequel (and the fact Nintendo said so before release)"
truezelda,3596u2,henryuuk,-4,Sat May 9 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"im a huge middle earth fan, ive read every single thing by tolkien, and that world actually has a history and lore built up to cover many a millenia, with in depth stories that cover all posterity.    because of this i think the zelda connections all feel really halfassed to me, and since most of the zelda lore was made up after the fact solely to appease fans, that just dilutes the whole thing.  i mean, you cant argue that. it really dilutes it. but some people take zelda as serious as tolkien's work (which is a shame) and Nintendo didnt expect that, so they had to play catch up with timelines  for that reason i go back to looking and judging each game on its own. connecting theories just to have some made up literature come out and fill unnecessary gaps seems childish. zelda's fans span a large demographic, and nintendo doesnt know how to juggle that well"
truezelda,3596u2,TheMovieMaverick,6,Fri May 8 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"and since most of the zelda lore was made up after the fact solely to appease fans   No, it was made up as they went.  Nobody intended that after Adult Link stopped Ganon, there wouldn't be a Hero who could stop Ganon who would appear in the next era, and the land would be flooded.  But when they wrote Wind Waker, they wrote that.  Nobody decided ""The ALttP Hero will go on a bunch of quests to different lands after regaining the full Triforce"", but when writing the Oracle games, Capcom decided to frame the plot in that way.  There's this weird meme that seems to think the people writing the stories of these games don't pay attention to or give a shit about the series' history when they're doing it.  Why in the world wouldn't they draw connections and hints between the games when the second game was a direct sequel?  There is utterly zero precedent for Zelda games being ""unrelated stories""."

I think Majora's Mask could be seen as a tragedy, this is true, but why did you choose Link as the protagonist? I feel Skull Kid is the truly tragic hero in all of this, the one who felt the power of a god and lost everything.   Also, whilst I know this is a hybrid and only really inspired by Greek Tragedy, you have violence on stage in the stage directions, which is considered a big no-no. It would only be sounds off stage. But that's just technical nonsense, you can easily edit that to be off stage."
truezelda,34uzgz,Serbaayuu,2,Tue May 5 11:06:48 2015 UTC,"Skull Kid isn't a hero, he's a victim."
truezelda,34uzgz,generousmoblin,4,Tue May 5 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"This story is pretty tragic though, though I guess Link is kind of the epitome of what it means to be a hero, and yeah Skullkid is a victim of the mask, I guess I meant more like the protagonist? Sorry.  Saying that, Link doesn't really go through that much carthesis himself, compared to all the people he helps with masks. I guess tragedy is supposed to make us feel pity and fear, and for me Skull Kid epitomises these feelings."
truezelda,34uzgz,Phoxxent,3,Tue May 5 14:00:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. In the game, Link enters termina feeling utterly crushed and alone in the world.

Now, this goes to a larger picture, looking at his journey as a whole starting with OoT and ending in MM."
truezelda,34uzgz,generousmoblin,2,Tue May 5 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"I tried to give Link the sense of being tragic hero due to the fact that he realizes, more than anyone, how iminent death is. while he believes he can save everyone, ultimately, he will save no one"

Couldn't play it outside since the sun's reflections where making it hard to be able what went on on the screen. Couldn't play it inside since it were to dark. Only if I played near a lamp with the gba slightly turned at a very specific angle I could play.  I probably used it a couple of months before getting a gba sp instead and that's the one I still use if I'm in the mood for regular game boy or gba games.

truezelda,34sg3f,cupstard,10,Mon May 4 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"To play on this, even the little trials per character showcase the challenges of Link's other forms.    The Deku challenge pits you against moving platforms and spinning obstacles that can knock you off your course into darkness (such a fall is reminiscent of becoming a cursed Deku in the first place). You're fighting against the very light body you have, and the difficulty of navigating aerially.  The Goron challenge follows suit by requiring super-precise movement and a steady hand. Both of these have proven challenging before and the Moon room is no exception. The room doesn't play to any of the Goron's physical strength and endurance; it only tests how careful you can be -- seemingly the opposite of Goron gameplay!  The Zora room is a much more restrictive and linear challenge, especially compared to the expansive oceans you've swam through before. Here, as an embodiment of musician Mikau's soul, you do not get any real choice of personal expression. You are funneled into a set path with only one correct answer to proceed (heart container optional).  Back as Link, you will have relinquished most to all of the masks in your possession by this point. You have been whittled down without any of the friends you made along the way, exactly how you came to Termina in search of the friend you lost. You're forced to pit yourself against several strong enemies which only further reinforces the growing frustration this Link feels, knowing that his many struggles will be forgotten here as they were in Hyrule.    Now, if you've been extra diligent in your adventure, you'll receive the Fierce Deity Mask. There's many theories about this one, but personally I think of it like I think of all the other transformation masks: the mask comes from the healed souls of someone you personally helped. I think the Fierce Deity Mask represents all the inhabitants of Termina, and they lend their power to you.   Should you have received the FDM, Majora will be a total pushover. If you did not, then Majora is definitely more challenging. I'd also mention that like Link with the Deku, Goron, and Zora masks, Majora cycles through multiple incarnations. I agree with you wholeheartedly that Majora mirrors Link over and over throughout this final stage."
truezelda,34sg3f,souffle-etc,4,Mon May 4 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"This is a great analysis!   When you get the Fierce Deity mask, the subtitles read something along the lines of ""This mask's powers are as dark as Majora's"" What do you think this might mean? I only ask because you've given extremely good points already."
truezelda,34sg3f,souffle-etc,3,Mon May 4 23:09:25 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with the old saying ""Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely."" It is a mask of unbeatable power, so full of brutal magic and raw energy.. aside from gameplay mechanics, I'd say that the reason Link does not wear the mask outside of boss battles is that he knows its power is too much for him to control for very long."
truezelda,34sg3f,henryuuk,1 point,Tue May 5 05:19:10 2015 UTC,That makes sense. And that's an interesting take on why Link doesn't wear the FD or Giant's masks outside of battle. I honestly never thought of that.

Also, it completely disappears when Majora is defeated.   I always interpreted that scene to be the Moon being sent back to space or wherever it's supposed to be."
truezelda,34sg3f,Serbaayuu,4,Tue May 5 21:36:24 2015 UTC,"That does not matter at all because Zelda is a fictional universe.   ""Fictional"" is a shitty excuse that doesn't matter worth a damn.  I did some math for you.  Would you like to see it?    Part 1: Find the Radius of the Moon's Orbit  Showing my work - Part 1.  I started this with a few rough estimations, but at the sizes we're talking about, estimation errors should be fairly negligible.  The diameter of Earth's moon is 3,476km.  From Earth with the naked eye, I estimate it to appear approximately 2cm in diameter (imagine a ruler at arms-length).  I calculate that the relative size of Earth's moon as seen by a human from Earth's surface to be .000000005% of its actual size.  Next, Termina's moon.  We look at the size of the moon at the end of the final day.  By the MOST GENEROUS of estimates, I can call the diameter of this object 1km, which accounts for all sorts of gamey hammerspace and whatnot.  But I think it is probably closer to less than half of that number (which only serves to make the final results of this exercise even more hilarious!).  I checked the size of the moon relative to Hyrule's surface in Ocarina of Time (first person mode), and at its peak it was ~2cm, while at dusk it was ~5cm, which is quite a large variance, so I went ahead with the bigger version.  I calculated that, under the assumption that the Termina moon and Hyrule moon are the same size, the moon's relative size is .00005%.  This means the Hyrule/Termina moon is approximately 10,000 times closer to Hyrule/Termina than Earth's moon is to Earth.  As a result, the Hyrule/Termina moon in its natural state should be approximately 38.44km away from Hyrule/Termina.  This will be used later as the orbital radius.    Part 2: Finding the Mass of Hyrule/Termina  Showing my work - Part 2  Here I am assuming that Hyrule and Termina have near-Earth gravity, which is a very safe assumption considering they act like it.  I am also assuming their geological structure is similar to that of Earth's, which would give the planets similar densities.  During my research I found something called ""Super Earths"", which are planets very similar to Earth in density but much larger.  Known Super Earths range from 1.9g to 3.3g (g = Earth Gravity), and have corresponding radii of 9200km to 12500km.  I calculated that this correlates to roughly 1,500km of radius per g added or subtracted to a planet.  Hyrule/Termina have near-Earth gravity, so using the lowest estimate I feel comfortable with at .8g (for reference Earth's moon is a little under 1/5th of Earth's gravity), I estimated the lowest reasonable size for Hyrule/Termina around 6000km radius.  Knowing the gravitational acceleration and the planet's radius, we can calculate that the mass of the Hyrule/Termina is around 4.2298354464527E+24 kg (for reference, Earth = 5.972E24 kg).    Part 3: Let's determine the orbital period of the angry moon!  Showing my work - Part 3  This one is extremely straightforward - we just use a proven equation to find the orbital period using the measurements we established in Parts 1 and 2.  Orbital Period = sqrt((4 * pi2 * orbital radius3) / (G * planet mass)) G = Universal Gravitational Constant  This leads to the calculation of the natural orbital period of the Hyrulean/Terminian moon around its respective planet to be APPROXIMATELY 2 SECONDS.    Conclusion:  Nope, it's not the moon.  Time passes pretty quick in Zelda games (when it does pass), but the moon only passes across the sky once, and each day is most certainly not four seconds long.  It is impossible for the Terminian moon to actually be the Terminian moon, unless you will insist that Majora shrunk the moon to a fraction of its size before crashing it into the planet.  But it really wouldn't make any sense for Majora to do that, if its goal was total destruction.  QED"
truezelda,34sg3f,TheBattler,2,Tue May 5 23:04:18 2015 UTC,"Your math is really cool and it's fun to think about this stuff.  But   ""Fictional"" is a shitty excuse that doesn't matter worth a damn.   And unfortunately real world math doesn't matter worth a damn because the physics are CLEARLY not equivalent to the real world. Link only takes a little bit of damage when falling from tall heights, the hookshot should weigh like 200 pounds and not only does it not have any fuel to propel a metal hook attached to a metal chain but Link doesn't die every time he fires it, he somehow stuffs 40 bombs as large as his head in a bomb bag that's roughly the size of his hands put together, etc.  The inhabitants of Termina say it's the Moon and there is no Moon in the sky. We have 0 reason to think the Moon in Majora's Mask is anything but their natural satellite."

So we have to attribute all the things you listed to ""gameplay"", because that's what they are.  But the Terminian moon isn't tiny just because gameplay made a tiny moon."

You can see the emblem on his hand when he goes to meet Zelda in the final cutscene in the courtyard.  Since the Triforce is whole at that time, this would cause a paradox, so instead of a paradox happening, it simply splits.  Ganondorf didn't use it until his execution because he didn't know he had it.  He didn't know how that the Triforce even could split.  Remember, Link didn't know he was holding the Courage in OoT until he used it at the final battle, either.  Unaware Triforce holders tend to use them as an unconscious self-defense mechanism."

truezelda,34onal,Kafke,9,Sun May 3 04:01:46 2015 UTC,Combined with the fact that the Triforce of Courage was left in the Adult Timeline makes it somewhat paradoxical.
truezelda,34onal,Serbaayuu,6,Sun May 3 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"It makes it paradoxical if you assume he brought the triforce with him. Rather than bringing his ownership back with him.  Either way, definitely some weird time travel shenanigans."
truezelda,34onal,Kafke,3,Sun May 3 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"This concept of bringing ownership is very much in line with Majora's Mask; travelling back with the Ocarina of Time visibly results in the Skull Kid not having it even though you didn't reach the moment where he drops it. Items work the same way, no longer being in their respective chests once you take them back with you."
truezelda,34onal,SvenHudson,0,Mon May 4 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"There's lots of stuff that does get reset in terms of items though. Like rupee chests, non-key items (beans, side-quest stuff, etc), and so on.  Either way, the time travel mechanics in both OoT and MM are clearly not fully thought out, and not a lot of thought has been put into the time travel consistency.  It's pretty clear that Link doesn't physically bring the triforce back with him, but instead brings back his 'ownership' which the triforce still recognizes. Seeing as the triforce of courage is still in the adult branch, and the child branch timeline is now split up."
truezelda,34onal,Kafke,1 point,Mon May 4 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think Triforce 'ownership' matters enough to cause it to split.  Technically, there should ALWAYS be 3 people in the world who are the most worthy (as long as there isn't one who can hold all 3), but that doesn't make it split.  Ganondorf in the Child Timeline is worthy of the Power, but it wouldn't split if he didn't touch it or Link didn't come back in time."
truezelda,34onal,Serbaayuu,4,Wed May 6 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"I guess the best answer is that Link going back in time the final time is through a route different than the Master Sword. When he went back in time, he did so with the Triforce of Courage. Because the Triforce is an object of divine power and very likely exists outside of time itself, Link was now in the Child Era with one piece of the Triforce. Naturally the other two immediately went into the possession of Zelda and Ganondorf.  Ganondorf was unaware this had happened, however. The Triforce of Power remained dormant inside of him until his hour of his greatest need (dying) and at that point it manifested itself and he was able to access that power."
truezelda,34onal,gamehiker,3,Sun May 3 02:55:17 2015 UTC,"very likely exists outside of time itself   If it existed outside of time, it would only exist once in all 3 timelines.  It exists inside time."
truezelda,34onal,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 3 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"1) Why did the Triforce become split up in the child timeline.   Because Link brought it back with him. In the adult timeline, this results in Link's piece getting split and thrown all over the place (where you collect it in WW). In the past, this results in a weird triforce split, and it splits it as if Ganondorf would have touched it. Since naturally there can't be two triforces.   Like Link and Zelda shouldn't have had their respective pieces because the events that caused it to split never technically happened.   He brought his ownership along with him. Chalk it up to the triforce working across time or w/e.   Now assuming that we are accepting that the triforce was split up among Link, Zelda, and Ganandorf why didn't Ganandorf use this power during his attempted invasion?   He did. That's why he survived his execution. Namely: Link warns about Ganondorf -> Ganondorf is to be executed -> Triforce of Power saves him -> Breaks free and stabs a sage -> Keeps sword and fights you with it in TP.   Clearly is he had it he would have used it.   He did.   Or even why didn't he use it before he was captured and almost executed at Arbiter's Grounds?   Because the Triforce doesn't work like that. And yes, he did 'use it' during his execution. That's why he didn't die."

truezelda,34m7g9,GengarWithATriforce,24,Sat May 2 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"People always say Spirit Tracks has no exploration when the fact that there are a lot of spots in the game you cannot get to without doing sidequests and unlocking new tracks is the very essence of exploration.

That was one of the worst parts of PH, there were a million and one possible routes, any of one of which could contain something, the ship was way too slow, you had to completely reset the route to change direction, and catching up with the fish was all but impossible, yet needed to complete the game.

The fact that every time when you return there, you have new tools that allow you to roflstomp the floors that previously were difficult gives a fantastic sense of progression in strength. It's not repetitive due to the fact that the early floors are laughably easy late-game and skippable for the most part.  The puzzles were great, the phantom mechanic is awesome (maybe I'm biased because I love stealth missions which is another unpopular opinion) and the timer really forces you to strategize because there isn't room for lollygagging.   The main temple of Spirit Tracks wasn't as fun due to not being forced to go through the same areas again.

Also, the timeline is interesting but relatively unimportant as it will not be adhered to in any strict sense going forward. It's unfortunate because I love world building in big stories, but it's true. ALBW already proved it. It felt exclusively like a sequel to ALTTP, not a chapter in a larger story.

When I was young, it was such a magical adventure, and the world was so amazing to explore because of the mechanics of each game. The characters were cool, and I loved the ability to link the game so that you could fight Ganon. I might go replay it now that I've read this!"
truezelda,34m7g9,LGstryker,3,Sun May 3 02:35:31 2015 UTC,I like Link's Awakening the best because I think it has a really rich (and rather sad) story for such a little cartridge! And all of those Nintendo easter eggs are pretty fun too. :)
truezelda,34m7g9,kokirikid,2,Sun May 3 02:26:59 2015 UTC,"I love Ages to death, but Seasons feels weak to me. Maybe it's because it's played Ages first, but I felt like the characters in Ages were much more developed."
truezelda,34m7g9,TotallyTheJiffyBot,1 point,Thu May 7 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"I really liked Oracle of Ages. It really had the vibe of the 3D games. However, I hated Jabu Jabu's Belly. It might be my least favorite dungeon in the series. I also got super pissed about the color-changing tile puzzle in that optional dungeon cave with the super tough puzzles. The solution was arbitrary bullshit, and I spent hours trying to do it the only way that made sense. All the other puzzles in there felt tough but fair.   Besides those two things Ages is an amazing game. But I think those flaws move it slightly behind Seasons for me."
truezelda,34m7g9,BaltarForPresident,12,Thu May 7 08:55:03 2015 UTC,"I don't like Wind Waker or Majora's Mask.  I've always hated the cell shading cartoony childish graphics that started with Wind Waker and have never seemed to go away. Also, the story is okay, but definitely not great.  Majora's Mask is alright, but like holy shit people freak the fuck out over how great it is. Extraordinarily overrated. It honestly barely even feels like a Zelda game to me. It's fun and all I guess, but it doesn't have much if any replay value for me. If it had've had a different figure in place of Link, you wouldn't have been able to even recognize it as a Zelda game really. It's a spinoff, a good one at that, but nothing more."

truezelda,34m7g9,Knoxisawesome,12,Sun May 3 07:11:05 2015 UTC,"A Link to the Past is a perfectly fair game, but is incredibly dated with an inconsistent difficulty level, rather poor dungeon design, and does not really hold up to deserving most of the praise it gets anymore."
truezelda,34m7g9,starlitepony,3,Sat May 2 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that it has dated more than people usually give it credit for.  The difficulty might be a bit inconsistent, but I can't really think of anything standoutish, care to elaborate on that?  And in my recent playing of the game, I kept marveling at some of the clever layouts in the dungeons and thought they were designed fabulously.  To each their own, of course, that's the point of this thread!"
truezelda,34m7g9,KingBubblie,1 point,Sun May 3 01:58:32 2015 UTC,"My main problem with the dungeons is that if you die to the boss, you have to repeat a good deal of the dungeon just to get back to the boss. It can get quite repetitive if it takes multiple attempts to defeat or even reach the boss.  Also, you spend a much greater portion of your time dodging distractions (aimed fireballs from the snake statues, for instance) than I would like. If I really wanted to dodge a bunch of stuff thrown at me, I would be playing Touhou. The 3D dungeons, on the other hand, have you spend a much larger portion of your time solving puzzles."
truezelda,34m7g9,princekamoro,1 point,Fri May 8 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know it's more of a personal opinion than anything objective about the game. I don't think any parts were too hard per se (Helmasaur King was a bit much for me the first few times I played it though), but just that it was inconsistent: The Light World bosses are easy, then Agahnim is easier, then the Dark World bosses jump from hard to easy and back to hard, then back to super easy with Kholdstare and Agahnim again...  The music is beautiful and the overworld design is amazing, but most of the dungeons are underwhelming (I dislike the ability to skip ~50% of most Dark World dungeons). It's definitely a revolutionary game and amazing for its time, but it's one of the few Zelda games that I just really don't enjoy playing."
truezelda,34m7g9,starlitepony,1 point,Sun May 3 02:44:44 2015 UTC,The only boss I really didn't like was Moldorm; the fact that if you fell of the boss restarted is really annoying. Otherwise I actually think the dungeon designs were really memorable and well put together.

It's just a regular sword with a strong 'enchantment' on it.    Even within LoZ itself we already see a better sword. The Four Sword can smite evil just as well AND quadruples you, turning any good swordman into a 4 man squad.    Master Sword is 'iconic' sure, but that doesn't really mean shit for how good it is.

That way, both the new fans and the old fans get to play something new!  Instead of just the new fans."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,4,Mon May 4 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and list a few!  Link's Awakening is the best/my favorite 2D game in the series (although that might have a nostalgia factor.) The story, characters, and premise are really interesting, the gameplay is pretty solid aside from the heaps of text from rocks, and the world is insanely fun to explore.  Not sure if the next one is unpopular, but Link Between Worlds is infinitely better than Link to the Past in every way. Story? Check. Characters? Check. Gameplay? Check, especially the leniency of the dungeon order. Overworld? Check (although there were times where I wished for the magic mirror to make a glorious return). Moldorm that isn't nearly as annoying as before? Check. Given, Link to the Past is the granddaddy of future Zelda games (especially Link Between Worlds), but LBW took everything good of LttP and enhanced it.   Great Bay Temple is a really fun dungeon (besides Gyorg, of course). Seen people rant about the insanity of the dungeon and how it's worse than the Water Temple (which, having recently replayed both games, I can disagree, although I dearly love the Water Temple), so I guess this counts.  Like Likes are the scariest (or at least most disgusting) enemies in the Zelda franchise, right up there with any disembodied hand enemy. They're pretty much the Zelda enemy version of the word 'moisten', and anytime I hear their revolting sound effects in OoT and WW, I cringe horribly.  People are hating on Fi, which I can respect, but I have no chill for Ezlo. He's like a permanent hand to hold throughout Minish Cap whether you want your hand held or not, and his backstory is kind of generic.  As much as I love Ocarina of Time, its dungeon design was mostly basic to me. That's probably very justifiable, considering it's pretty much the first 3D game of its kind, but other than Water, Shadow, and Spirit, there's not much to look forward to besides the bosses. Also, not really unpopular, but Jabu Jabu's Belly is arguably the worst dungeon (or at least idea) in the series, although that probably stems from my hate of Like Likes.  Might be treading the line on this one: Seeing praise for Majora's Mask, my favorite game in the series (and of all time), especially today, feels really good. I was into it before the entire Ben Drowned thing or the Game Theory post (of which, admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of), but having other people to discuss this fun and interesting game, even/especially if they're into those theories, is thrilling for me. That being said, I do get tired of mindless circlejerks when they arise. Yes, Majora's Mask is a good game; no, you're not the only one who likes it.  Also, I see a lot of people criticizing OoT's battle system, but that's probably my second favorite in the series (behind Wind Waker probably). Upon replaying it recently, I realized that mono-y-mono sword fights or things with Stalfos and all are really fun, not to mention shields in that game serve very well if you know when/which ones to use (which I didn't on my first playthrough iirc,)  Lastly, this isn't for the Zelda series, but for unpopular opinions threads overall: people keep saying that the most popular opinions are upvoted to the top and if we want the real unpopular ones, then sort by 'controversial'. That'd be like if the top result on this was 'I like Majora's Mask' or something like that. I don't really see that stuff in the comments, though; most everyone knows better than that and upvotes what they're most frustrated by (or even if they agree with it), not a mainstream opinion. That's what the thread's about, right?  Hope I contributed well enough! :D"

truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,16,Sun May 3 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"Twilight princess was the weakest of the 3d zeldas. It tried so hard to be the next OoT and failed so much. They forgot that at almost every zelda adds a unique feel and aspect to the game. Alttp had two worlds, OoT had time travel/ being first 3d, MM had 3 day cycle, WW open world, ss had the story driven linear gameplay. What did TP have, it had a wolf that didn't do much other that add to puzzles and a dark world where there wasn't really even a threat. Then they tried to have one the largest zelda maps, but it was completely empty with just massive fields of grass and very few things you can collect within the fields. Finally the story had so much potential, but they made it turn into shit. They had a badass villain who actually conquered hyrule and what do they do to him? They get rid of him, because Zelda has to have ganondorf! They turned this cool badass into someone that was merely being controlled by the incredibly bland ganondorf of this game.   Extra bit regarding the story what was the point of zelda sacrificing herself to save midna, if she just magically comes back at the end? That doesn't connect the player, it just makes us feel that what zelda did was meaningless!"

truezelda,34m7g9,Cinnfhaelidh,4,Sun May 3 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'm going to take that even further and say, for someone playing noncompetitively (which is the vast majority of Smash players), each game has been better than the last in the series. I had really no idea there even was competitive Melee when Brawl came out, and I didn't realize tripping was even there, nor did I notice the floatiness. Why? Because for most people, it doesn't matter at all. What does matter is having numerous and diverse characters, stages, items, music, and game modes. I enjoyed Brawl way more than Melee, and Melee was one of my favorite games, and all Brawl has over Sm4sh is Subspace Emissary. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is otherwise better in every significant way, and the overall best in the series."
truezelda,34m7g9,SimplisticBiscuit,5,Sun May 3 07:17:31 2015 UTC,"I must admit that I loved Melee but found Brawl to be something off a disappointment. There's just something soulless about it. The same was true of Mario Kart Wii. It's odd, because Sm4sh and MK8 are my favourites in their respective series (the latter surpassed Double-Dash fro me after the DLC)."
truezelda,34m7g9,neefvii,4,Sun May 3 13:29:14 2015 UTC,"Can agree with MK Wii, but I felt this about Sm4sh rather than Brawl. They don't really seem like their own unique game. They just seem like, the game made for that console. 64 was the original, Melee is the competitive one, Brawl is the casual/family one, but Sm4sh is just... the one on the Wii U. I don't know."

Oh, there's also the fact that I don't believe the Golden Goddesses are real, that one always rustles some literalists' jimmies.

And having new looks and/or content on some old favorites is fun but I would much much MUCH rather see NEW games coming out. Sequels, prequels, completely new stories not directly related to any current game.  I keep seeing people on here wanting a TP remake. Don't give me a remake, give me a sequel. What happens to TP Link after those events? How does he move on? What new quests does he stumble into? If I want to play TP, I can play TP. How about giving us new content about that Link?  I liked Skyward Sword a great deal and never understood the hate. It's a wonderful game. I like the style and story of TP just a little bit more, but overall Skyward Sword was improved upon the 3D titles.  I think the thing with OoT is that it setup all the other 3D titles so people put it on a pedestal. Do I like it? Of course. Is it the BEST 3D title? Not at all, in my opinion. Every game after it adds something new, improves on what OoT started. Even Majora's Mask gave us some nice, if albeit minor, changes in just a short time after OoT was released."

However, as someone who was just being born around the time they came out, I never had a chance to play OoT or MM, and couldn't get myself into them when I did try to later due to how the games have aged. So to me the 3DS remakes were brand new games."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,5,Sat May 2 15:48:02 2015 UTC,That's actually a really awesome perspective and a solid point. I was in junior high/high school when OoT and MM came out so I definitely have a bias based on age.
truezelda,34m7g9,malaroo,1 point,Sat May 2 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed with you on all of those statements, especially the remakes.  Wouldn't it suck if Capcom had spent their time remaking Zelda 1, 2, and ALttP, instead of making the new handheld titles that they did?  Grezzo's been doing remakes, and I think we're missing out on some potentially good games by them continuing to do that.  Wouldn't it be cool if we were getting a handheld 3D Zelda game in the OoT3D engine in another year, instead of getting MM3D a few months ago?  The only one I've really found forgivable so far is WWHD, because that was directly used to improve Zelda U by giving the dev team a chance to practice with the Wii U."
truezelda,34m7g9,SvenHudson,2,Sat May 2 13:30:32 2015 UTC,"To make further use of the point of this sub, what do you feel makes Skyward Sword the best in the series?  I can think of a lot of things it does better than any other Zelda, but I can also think of a lot of things that knock it back down behind the others."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun May 3 12:27:12 2015 UTC,"Well, you asked for it.  In no particular order, except for #1:   Best aesthetic in the series.  Art style, music, cutscenes, everything artistic about it is perfect. The cinematic direction is flawless. Best characterization of Zelda. Most of the Skyloftians are good, interesting characters.  Notably Groose. Most of the dungeons are thematically great and extremely memorable.  In terms of gameplay, a few of them are my favorite in the series - Sandship and Sky Keep are easily in the top 10 dungeons in the entire series.  Nonlinearity, good puzzles, great theme. It's a fantastic origin story for the series.  Demise's existence and his Curse enriches SO much of the lore. Ghirahim was superb. The Motion+ combat was nearly perfect and I wish every Zelda game had it.  It also served to make some of the most skill-based combat in the series (which isn't saying much to be fair). The ""entire world is a dungeon"" design was really cool, and much better than having an empty Hyrule Field that just connects 8 dungeons together. Fi is a wonderful partner and gives the Master Sword a permanent personal connection.  Also, her connection to Ghirahim is fascinating. It did away with Magic 3 Hits on the bosses. It pretty much wrecked the concept of the Golden Goddesses as anything other than legend (see my other comment), which I think is cool and refreshing. Item upgrades & shield/gear customization is easily one of the best things it added to the series.  Zelda very much needs some RPG mechanics. Numerous sidequests, each with a fairly significant amount of depth.  I think Skyward Sword is on par with Majora's Mask and Wind Waker in sidequest (and hub city) quality. It made POTIONS USEFUL!!!  For the first time since 2D games! Also, pretty much every item in the arsenal stays useful for most of the game after you get it."
truezelda,34m7g9,calvinfh,3,Sun May 3 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"Best aesthetic in the series. Art style, music, cutscenes, everything artistic about it is perfect.   I agree, except for the cutscenes.  I feel like they're a little too full-on or 'overblown'.  I would have enjoyed it when I was deeper into anime-style things, but as it stands today I prefer cinema to be more toned back.  Not minimalistic, but not an 'extravaganza' either.  I'd also agree that Skyward Sword has some of the best songs in the series, but only some.  While Skyloft, Bamboo Island and Tubert's Thrill Digger are some of my favorite songs from the series, a lot of others felt really dull or lacking in character to me.  A little too typical RPG, and not-so-much Nintendo sounding.   Most of the Skyloftians are good, interesting characters.   Better than most others in the series, at least.   Most of the dungeons are thematically great and extremely memorable.   This is one of the game's strongest features I think.  It's the primary part of what I enjoyed about it over-all.   It's a fantastic origin story for the series. Demise's existence and his Curse enriches SO much of the lore.   I disagree with this one pretty heavily, though.  I like the idea of explaining why Ganon, Zelda and Link always 'recycle', but I think it could have been a lot more interesting than Zelda 0.5 and Ganon 0.5 throwing curses at eachother.   Ghirahim was superb.   Hated him.  Never liked the whole 'super creepy bishounen villain' thing back when it started getting popular, and by the time it came around in SS I was already extra burnt out on it.   The Motion+ combat was nearly perfect and I wish every Zelda game had it. It also served to make some of the most skill-based combat in the series (which isn't saying much to be fair).   I did like the more emphasized combat behind it; that's something I enjoy seeing improved in Zelda, but I had trouble with the 'technical' aspect of it.  I enjoyed it when it worked well, but often times it did not, and I did feel like it was a bit forced into lots of situations that didn't need/benefit from it.   The ""entire world is a dungeon"" design was really cool, and much better than having an empty Hyrule Field that just connects 8 dungeons together.   I agree and disagree with this.  The entire world being a dungeon is fantastic, yes.  It's more reminiscent of the 2D games where you're 'solving' the world as you go which is something I've wanted to see in 3D Zelda for ages, but at the same time it completely forgoes the freedom and exploration that the other games brought about.  The areas were typically designed in a visually (and somewhat mechanically) fantastic way, but they mostly boiled down to tunnels with little cohesion beyond the 'doorways' to other areas.  An empty hub is pretty bad as well, but on the sides of an empty hub you can put those same kind of areas.  Skyward Sword did do this, just like every other 3D Zelda after all.  The empty 'Hyrule Field' would be the sky in this case, which is easily much more barren than any other Zelda's 'overworld'.  If you're going to use a hub (which I'd prefer they didn't, Zelda U's world style is ideal to me), I feel like Majora's Mask wins in that case.   Fi is a wonderful partner and gives the Master Sword a permanent personal connection. Also, her connection to Ghirahim is fascinating.   Wasn't a fan of Fi, though.  Robotic personalities have always turned me off.  To me, that's the opposite of a personality, with Midna being the prime example of what I'd call a good personality.  I also guess I'm more of a fan of inanimate swords.   It did away with Magic 3 Hits on the bosses.   This is another point in the areas that I think SS shines.  It did combat and basic game mechanics in general much better, in a lot of aspects.   Item upgrades & shield/gear customization is easily one of the best things it added to the series.   Totally agree.   Numerous sidequests, each with a fairly significant amount of depth. I think Skyward Sword is on par with Majora's Mask and Wind Waker in sidequest (and hub city) quality   I wouldn't agree with that, though.  I'd put SS's sidequests down there with OoT and TP's, under Wind Waker and easily under Majora's Mask which I feel will probably never be surpassed in terms of side-quests.  They felt very side-quest-specific 'bullet-pointy', rather than a cohesive part of the world, and the whole gratitude crystal thing was almost on an MMO level of uninspired fetchy, grindiness.   It made POTIONS USEFUL!!! For the first time since 2D games!   Which is nice, because I always preferred potions to fairies, and 3D Zelda games have always had shitty item balance and general usability.    Also, pretty much every item in the arsenal stays useful for most of the game after you get it.   Again, SS's strongest point: solid core mechanics.  Items were embarrassingly one-off in TP."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 3 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"The ""entire world is a dungeon"" design was really cool, and much better than having an empty Hyrule Field that just connects 8 dungeons together.   It traded an empty field for an empty sky. I thought the land sections were an improvement for scale but are they really so different from OoT or MM or TP in being more focused and linear sections connecting the hub to the destinations?   Demise's existence and his Curse enriches SO much of the lore.   Eh."
truezelda,34m7g9,Coaz,1 point,Mon May 4 16:54:33 2015 UTC,"The Sky is for Skyloft, not the tiny islands around it.  Going from Skyloft to the Surface takes about 10 seconds.  You can go to some of the other islands for treasure (good treasure, too, not a hole with 20 rupees in it) if you want, but none of them besides the Isle of Songs are really required.  Also the smaller islands have some decent small puzzles on them - again, a tad more impressive than a hole in the ground with a few deku babas in it."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon May 4 17:02:36 2015 UTC,when I hear a game being cinematic it makes me want to throw up.
truezelda,34m7g9,Arkazia,3,Mon May 4 07:30:52 2015 UTC,"Games have cutscenes.  If a game has cutscenes, I want them to have good direction.  Skyward Sword's cutscenes have excellent cinematic direction.  I don't really give a shit about your closed-mindedness."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,3,Mon May 4 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think Skyward Sword is the best, but it is damn good. I didn't think that was an unpopular opinion? I've seen it a bit on this sub.   I think the remakes suck because they change things. I think they're usually good because they make games avaliable to newer generations. However, with OoT and MM they're already available on the eShop so I didn't see the point and I agree with you there.   A lot about what people like about Majora's Mask is that it's an overflow from the nostalgia of OoT. It's also mysterious about a lot of things. We're in a land that isn't Hyrule and we keep getting glimpses and talk of demons and ancient tribes and hexing rituals. The desire to learn about that is what makes the game so good for me as well as the transformations. So in that sense it is pretty great with some innovative new things thrown in, but if the game had been made with a little more development time I think I could have been fleshed out better.   What do you mean the Golden Goddesses aren't real? Like they're just parables and legends inspired to give people hope and guidance like The Bible? Then who created the Triforce? I don't think I've ever heard anyone say they aren't real. I'm pretty curious what you mean by that."
truezelda,34m7g9,Coaz,13,Sat May 2 13:32:47 2015 UTC,"What do you mean the Golden Goddesses aren't real?   Hooray, an excuse to outline my entire theory!  All right, in Hyrule, we have several tiers of deities.  There are the Old Gods, spoken of by Hylia.  They are the people who created the Triforce and left it on Hyrule.  Then, you have Hylia and Demise, both of whom seem to be on an equivalent power level, so I believe they are related closely.  They might be Old Gods themselves (left as stewards to the world), but they might have also been created by them, thus being New Gods.  Then you have Local Deities - these include the dragons, Eldin, Lanayru, and Faron.  Entities like Cyclos and Zephos, Valoo, Jabun, the Great Deku Tree, the Maku Tree, etc., etc..  These would have been created by the Old Gods or Hylia but are weaker than both of those higher groups.  Then there are the Mortal Titans, which include the Hero, Zelda, Ganondorf, and a few others.    I firmly believe that the Old Gods do not care about Hyrule beyond seeding it with life and left, forever, to do other things after leaving Hylia, Demise, and the Triforce there.  [Side note, Demise could also be Hylia's Lorulean counterpart, so he might not be involved in these details exactly as I write them.]  The Old Gods made sure to provide an absolutely neutral force to the mortals.  They do not do ""good"" things, nor ""bad"" things.  So all of the things that people claim are divine intervention, like sealing away the Interlopers and the Great Flood, don't make sense, and can be explained by other means.  I'll get to those.  Also, while Hylia describes the Old Gods, she never names them as being golden.  Nor female.  Nor that there are three of them.  If she never does this, where in the world would the lore of that being the case come from?    The Origin of the Golden Goddesses:  The era is Skyward Sword.  The Triforce is out in the open.  Eldin, Faron, and Lanayru are also out in the open.  The Triforce has three emblems that correspond to its pieces.  Din = Power, Nayru = Wisdom, Farore = Courage.  I believe that Din, Nayru, and Farore are words that literally mean Power, Wisdom, and Courage.  While the Golden Goddesses have their respective traits, none of them have ever been directly represented in a single piece of the Triforce before.  In Skyward Sword, we see the Triforce pieces labeled with these words.  We have seen in the past that the Triforce is ALWAYS labeled by its traits, not by its ""owner"".  As well as this, I think it makes more sense for the names Faron, Eldin, and Lanayru to be corruptions of literal words meaning courage, power, and wisdom, rather than the names of gods.  So how did people come up with the Golden Goddesses?   The Triforce and the names of its traits come out into the open.  People relate Faron, Eldin, and Lanayru with the symbols - they perhaps learn of the words those symbols represent. People form a religion around the Triforce.  They revere three golden triangles labeled with Din, Nayru, and Farore. The Triforce gets sealed.  People now have a religion revering Din, Nayru, and Farore, three pieces of gold. At some point, the lore of the Old Gods and the golden triangles gets mixed up, and someone calls the Old Gods three golden women named Din, Nayru, and Farore. And then a talking tree and a 10-year-old princess tell the fanbase this legend, and they all take it literally forever.     Divine Intervention:  I also think that, due to this, every instance of divine intervention can be otherwise explained.  The Goddess of Time isn't real, the Ocarina of Time is just that powerful.  The Happy Mask Salesman might be involved in its abilities in MM, too.  The gods didn't seal the Dark Interlopers in the Twilight Realm, nor create the Realm for them.  The Twilight Realm existed as long as Hyrule has, similar to the Sacred Realm, and the Light Spirits (a.k.a. the reformed dragons from Skyward Sword including Levias as Ordona) sealed the Interlopers away.  The Great Flood was caused by Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule, as evidenced by his deep regret for what has happened to his country.  He did not have the full Triforce, as it was split, shattered, and partially owned by Ganon, so he was not powerful enough to completely destroy the land on his own.  Since he was sealed away with Hyrule, the people obviously had no way of knowing he was responsible for it, so they attributed it to gods.    Wow, that was a wall!  Have fun!"
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,6,Sat May 2 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"Very interesting read! I do find it funny how in the real world we have such a large variety of different religions and many people who believe in non at all, but in most cases religion in games is taken as 100% cannon all the time no matter what."
truezelda,34m7g9,9000_HULLS,1 point,Sat May 2 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tend to take an atheistic tilt to any fiction I play or read, if it's a viable position to argue.  I actually think it's more likely that the Old Gods didn't create Hyrule or the universe or anything like that either, they're just very powerful beings who seeded the planet with life."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,5,Sun May 3 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with what /u/Arkazia said. It's important to remember that everything is fallible in games just as much as real life. Zoras, Gorons, Hylians, etc all have their own legends and ""religions"" and who's to say what is real. Especially now that with Skyward Sword we see the legends have been around for quite a lot of time.   However, if you're right I don't think the Goddesses' names were chosen because those words mean ""power,"" ""wisdom,"" and ""courage."" I think those words would mean what they do because the Goddesses were thought to embody those traits. We see that a lot in languages today. Many words we use today we're defined in a religious sense and the passed into common language.   But that also begs other questions. Like if the Goddesses are just legend, what else is just legend? According to OoT the Goddesses are the ones who left Hyrule under the care of the Triforce. Again taking into account that it's been many a year and the legend might be corrupted, but if it wasn't them it must have been these Old Gods. We've seen Hylia and Demise, but I think the word ""Gods"" implies more than just two. So who are these unknown beings who created the Triforce? Are just they legend too? And if they are just legends than what the hell is the Triforce and who made it? Is the Triforce an Old God?"
truezelda,34m7g9,NayBen,1 point,Sat May 2 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"Hylia describes the Old Gods in a way that makes them seem very much like people, and she does note that they created the Triforce and only built it so that mortals could use it.  I think she is the most trustworthy narrator we have on the true nature of Hyrule's history at this point.  Also keep in mind that Lorule has a Triforce, so there are likely a parallel set of gods for that realm, too (which fits into the Demise =/= Hylia Counterpart Theory)."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 3 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, nice. Since playing SS I've had a feeling that the goddesses might not exist, mainly because I found it strange that there were so many statues of Hylia and none of the three main goddesses. You'd have thought that earlier on in the timeline, the belief of the three goddesses would be stronger if they had existed.  So who do you think made the triforce? Or do you think it has just always existed?"
truezelda,34m7g9,NayBen,1 point,Sat May 2 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"As noted in the first couple lines, the Old Gods created it.  :)  I think Hylia does confirm that in Skyward Sword, and we have no reason to doubt her word since it seems likely she was alive when the Old Gods were around.  Most of the lore around the Triforce itself is correct, I just don't think it was created by 3 golden ladies named Din, Nayru, and Farore."
truezelda,34m7g9,HylianHal,1 point,Sun May 3 01:55:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm reading this pretty late. You said you believe the old gods do not care about Hyrule and are no longer involved. In Wind Waker a voice asks you to past the final test right before the boss in Tower of the Gods. Who would you think that is then?   Also, if they are impartial to good and evil, I don't think they would make it so the triforce splits only if the wielder has an evil heart. What are your thoughts?"

I don't think they would make it so the triforce splits only if the wielder has an evil heart   Then it's a good thing it only splits if the wielder has an imbalanced heart.  Ganondorf believed in Power above all things, and had neither Wisdom nor Courage in balance with it."
truezelda,34m7g9,HylianHal,2,Sat May 9 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! Yeah it does make sense now that it is Gohdan. First played it when I was 8 so I think the idea it was the goddesses just stuck with me. I remembered the imbalanced heart part, but I think I combined it with what the maiden said in alttp that when an evil person touches the triforce a hero will appear. Very interesting theory, I like the idea that the gods are absent and it's up to mortals now to deal with what they left behind."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sat May 9 13:20:10 2015 UTC,"How about in Oracle of Ages/Seasons, when the Triforce flings you into a foreign country, with a sourceless voice calling, ""ACCEPT OUR QUEST, HERO!""?  Aside from the obvious ""Capcom made it""; it is canonical after all, so at best you have to believe it was retconned for your theory to fit well.  Mind, I like your theory quite a lot. In incorporating it into my headcanon, I've been running into issues like this."
truezelda,34m7g9,aerandir92,1 point,Mon May 18 07:54:45 2015 UTC,"That would be the Triforce talking, from an era when it wasn't really established that it was an inanimate object.  It's clear that the Triforce was the thing that sent Link off, and we know that none of the gods can use the Triforce in any way, so it can't be them."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon May 18 11:38:24 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, that is one likely explanation.   However, isn't it also possible (or likely) that the Old Gods left behind a sort of limited consciousness within the Triforce to make neutral decisions and represent the wishes of the gods? Sort of like a Hyrulian Metatron, the hand and voice of God, but in hyper-advanced Clarktech AI form.  Both are roughly canon-compliant in addition to handily answering all questions raised that I've been able to ponder out."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,2,Mon May 18 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's not unreasonable that there could be some kind of intelligence inside the Triforce.  However, sending Link to go save Holodrum and Labrynna is most certainly not a neutral decision.  It's specifically good.  For that reason, perhaps the Triforce does it as part of Link's wish to save Hyrule - it sends him off to fulfill that wish by preventing the resurrection of Ganon."
truezelda,34m7g9,Zubat_Breeder,1 point,Mon May 18 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on Skyward Sword being the best game in the series, absolutely!  It has it flaws, that it does, but still king. To me TP or MM would be worst 3D title. I should just say TP because I have never been able to get far into that game (loose interest), but I am reluctant to be too hard on it, keep thinking that it is just my typical ""lose interest in stuff too fast when playing it by my self - syndrome"". I would place OoT in the middle, behind SS and WW.    Temple of the Ocean King is cool yes, I am still sad that my emulator crashed so I lost tons of progress in Phantom Hourglass. Ended up just watching a let's play of it.    I understand why people say that remakes suck, and I too would rather have a new game than a remake. But I live in the dream of all great games that where non HD (really pre current-gen really), should be remade to todays standard in graphics, res, framerate, animation etc. etc. Just full on remake so that it really can stay relevant for years and years to come. Blasting up a N64 game on a 55"" TV today would just be a horrible mess of pixels, and I find my self quite annoyed by the camera and controls on several older games when re-/playing them to day"

Its always a rather similar story line (bad guy trying to rule/destroy the world) but they always add in better graphics, the same weapons except better, better gameplay, and new vehicles.

Admittedly that's only if you use save states, otherwise it's frustration incarnate.  A Link to The Past is overrated. It's art style is pretty (except for link himself and a few other uglys) but it pales in comparison to that introduced by Four Swords and continued in the Minish Cap. ALttP is a poor introduction to the series for new players, it's pacing is meh and the over-world is designed in a manor that makes it feel oddly empty despite great variety and size. Kakariko Village in particular is too spread out making it frustrating to navigate. For first time players the game is harder to get into then most of the other top down games. Minish Cap trumps it almost every regard except length. I'd say that ALttP is very much a bog standard Zelda game, does little wrong and little great (though this is mainly due to ageing and being surpassed).  Most of what makes people rave about it so much seems to be nostalgia."

truezelda,34m7g9,Phoxxent,7,Sat May 2 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"Fair opinion, but it certainly is big and epic, and has some of the best open exploration/discovery Zelda has ever seen.  There are distinct, varied environments as well, not sure what you're getting at there.  I agree it's very much so an offshoot, a black sheep amongst other entries and doesn't even really include Zelda in it, lol.  But I'd like to see you expand on some of your points."
truezelda,34m7g9,RezicG,2,Sat May 2 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"I guess that would be; SS is the best Zelda and TP is the worst Zelda I have played. (loose interest shortly after first temple/dungeon, tried a few times, stopped around the same place each time)."
truezelda,34m7g9,Phoxxent,2,Sat May 2 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not a long time fan. I've been aware of the series since the late 80s (I'm 30 right now), but only got into the series here lately. I started with Wind Waker (since I owned it back when it came out) and went from there.  As of right now, it'd be easier to list the games I haven't played: OoA/S, FSA, Majora's Mask, Link's Awakening. and the first two games.  I say this so you'll have context. I'm not that big of a fan of OoT or ALttP. I'd probably place both in my top 10 Zelda games, but there are several games I like better. I think a big part of this is nostalgia. I just don't feel like they hold up to the nostalgia and as someone new to the series (but still familiar with each game as they came out). I still respect what they did for the series, though.  I also am having a hard time getting into the Majora's Mask games. Mostly because I don't really dabble in the sidequest aspect of the Zelda games very much. I did when I needed bottles or a better sword or whatever, but most of those I had to look up rather than find them in game. I guess I just don't explore enough to get them. (I've gotten a lot of stuff myself in Zelda games, but when I really need something extra and don't feel like looking around for it, I'll consult a guide.)  But that being said, knowing Majora's Mask is mostly sidequest kinda disappoints me and as a result, I have a hard time getting into it."
truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,2,Sun May 3 02:01:02 2015 UTC,"ALBW is essentially an ALttP remake, and was a big disappointment because of that. Mechanics are different, yes. Story is different, yes. However, it is in every respect an identical copy of ALttP. I thought at first that this game starred the same Link from ALttP. That Link has been in many games, so that seemed pretty characteristic of the series. It wasn't until I looked it up and found out a little later that it starred in the same timeline, but a different Link, and that's when I got seriously upset. Zelda games up to that point have always drastically changed the areas with different games, even if the game took place in the same area (see OoT to TP). The game didn't feel like ALttP the sequel, but ALttp again starring a new Link. It felt lazy, and felt like Nintendo was taking a further step back from SS. I know a lot of people felt like the series was getting back on track since WW or TP or whenever they personally thought was the downfall of the Zelda series, but it felt like the opposite for me. I already felt like Nintendo stopped caring in SS, but ALBW only solidified it further. It was an amazing game on its own, but wtf Nintendo, saying it's a new game? Zelda WiiU looks really promising though, so I won't lose faith yet."

truezelda,34m7g9,Serbaayuu,3,Sun May 3 03:18:38 2015 UTC,"The mechanics and design of the game were some of the best in the series. It has one of the best stories, and the fleshiest and most enjoyable characters. Sort of like MM, except for that every NPC got this development, not just 4 out of 20. The locales were also beautiful, with music that perfectly fit. People complain about handholding and linearity (the latter of which not really being anything new to the series. Heck, it's not even like you can't go somewhere else and stall), but those are just minor blemishes on an otherwise amazing game. It gets too much praise for what it is, especially what with people claiming that it is the best game ever, that it can only be thought of in it's context, and that it is above criticism. It annoys me, especially because nothing it has done is the best. The timeline was fitting together fine until TP came and screwed things up. It was quite simple, there was a split after OoT, the timeline where he was no longer got flooded, and the timeline he was sent back to had all the other stuff."
truezelda,34m7g9,TheBashfulPanda,9,Sat May 2 12:22:43 2015 UTC,I don't really see how TP screws that up?  Unless you mean TP broke putting the original games into the Child timeline.

It really was a game changer. Thus, unanimously positive reviews. A lot of objectively better games hav come out since then, but they weren't as influential.

truezelda,34m7g9,calvinfh,2,Sat May 2 13:58:12 2015 UTC,You didn't give any reason as to why OoT doesn't deserve the praise it gets...
truezelda,34m7g9,jdaniel5894,4,Sat May 2 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Also, Ocarina of Time is stupid   Ocarina of Time is a great game. It has a good story that's engaging, the dungeons are fun, and it was extremely innovative and important in the development of later games in general. The z-targeting system was also critical in game development.  Having said that, it's no masterpiece. It's also not an AMAZING game or even the best Zelda. Or even the best 3d Zelda! HERE'S WHY.   UNUSED COMPLEXITY IN ITS COMBAT For a game with such a revolutionary combat system, it does such a poor job of implementing it. There's very little variety in enemy design with most enemies having a period of invulnerability followed by a period of vulnerability. There are exceptions, but they're not as present. CRIPPLING LACK OF EXPLORATION. From the start, Zelda's been about exploration. And OoT is one of the worst games in the franchise at delivering this exploration. The game is basically on-rails, iwth players moving from one roadblock to the next and not being allowed to explore. And what's there to explore? Hyrule field is just dripping with ""hub"" scent, being very obviously just a filler to move through when accessing other areas of the game. The ""secrets"" are just holes in the ground that are pretty obvious to find and enter, and unsatisfying in their execution. It also blocks HUGE areas of the game off in order for your ""experience"" of the story. It locks them the hard way, requiring the player to go find some specific key or other ""puzzle element"" in order to access another part of the game. Which reminds me... POOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A STORY THAT'S NOTHING TOO SPECIAL The story is nothing special. TP's was grittier, WW's was better in connecting players with the characters, and MM's was more interesting. Ocarina's story contains enough Zelda tropes for people to say ""Oh, look! It reminds me of A Link to the Past!"" but nothing more. Anything new is the previously mentioned ""stupid story elements"" that require tedious crap in order to advance. It's overbearing and poorly implemented into gameplay.   But it's not a ""stupid"" game. It serves its purpose as a transition from 2D to 3D just fine and is still enjoyable today, despite not having aged extremely well (though the 3ds version certainly helps in this department). While it doesn't deserve the title ""greatest game of all time"" or ""best zelda"" that many have bestowed upon it, it's still a perfectly fine game."
truezelda,34m7g9,mechakupa,1 point,Sat May 2 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you have essentially worded my opinion better than I have. It's just that I've gotten so tired of the OoT circlejerk that I've started to resent it's existence. I get tired of the whole ""This game is terrible, unlike OoT"", followed by the ""It was trying to be OoT and it failed"" comments for TP. I'm also tired of people treating a bunch of forest children that don't interact with the rest of the world and that only appeared in one game as one of the ""major races"" of Hyrule. No, they're not. At least the Gerudos have a termanian counterpart and continue on in the Child timeline. Also, I can't stand all the people (okay, maybe it's just like 10, but still) that pine and beg for another sequel to OoT, claiming ""we need to know what happens to this Link"", to which the timeline would reply ""Have fun playing Harvest Crossing: Zelda edition"". Overall, yes, it is a fun game, but terribly overrated. I'm glad that as we get further away from 1998, Nintendo seems to be putting less and less focus on OoT."

The fact it is the title theme helps a lot too, it might be ""non-present"", but it is still the first thing you hear musicwise.   I mean, the music for the Windwaker backstory with the flute instrument is one of my favorite and easiest rocgnized songs, as well as one of my best remembered. Simply because it is so fitting and is one of the first things.    Also the fact they play in low-action moments is probably helpful for most people since you put more focus into listening to the song.    I could hum most of the 'passive' songs, stuff like the travel songs or house themes. But I don't really remember stuff like the boss themes until I hear them."

truezelda,3477p7,henryuuk,8,Sat May 2 11:25:11 2015 UTC,"There's the easy answer; tradition and nostalgia.  But for me, what makes the theme work exceptionally well is how it calmly and gently welcomes the player in to the Zelda world before actually beginning play. It's a theme that can relax the player and generate a tiny bit of excitement regardless of what the player's mood was going in to it. I find it doesn't work nearly as well in the Fountains themselves. Most times I reach a FF location and think ""Damn, wish this cave led to something useful"" but that's only because I've gotten better at the games, so I'm in less need of hearts all the time. For players who do struggle, that Fountain will pull off it's intent perfectly, as the song lets the player know they're safe in there.   It's the difference between a game that makes the player feel like they should be grateful they get to play a over a game like Zelda that's grateful you're the one playing it."

I would say it's as iconic as the actual ""Zelda theme"" for the simple fact that it's the first thing you hear in 90% of the Zelda games (I think Zelda 1 and 2 are the only exceptions?)  That's, at the very least, the reason why I personally like it so much. It's relaxing and it feels like ""coming home"" when you start up a new Zelda game and hear it for a while as you type in your name (or Link's name in most cases I guess)"

The theme is present on two very non-present areas: the Title Screen and actual Fairy Fountains.       You mean you hear it every time you start the game?   The theme stands outside of the ""Zelda"" theme and simply partners with it rather than is Zelda-themed.   The Fairy Fountain theme stands on its own as a complete entity that happens to occur in the Zelda universe, musically   What?   What makes it different from the hyrule field theme or epona's song, etc?       Is it due to being such an easy piece to play?

The simplicity is definitely a big part of that. These are the kind of songs you listen to and remember your journeys, and long to relive them again. And because of that, these songs become very central to the identity of these games."

For two, like you said, the song is simple, and generally people tend to gravitate towards more simple music unless they are well-versed in music.  But with that said... it's not like there's any shortage of covers of other songs.  There's probably thousands of each, but the Fairy's Fountain music is the most consistant between games.  It's more consistent than the actual theme itself, which is only used in a handful of games."

Most gamers would completely flip if they learned that it was possible (or even probable, depending on the density of sidequests like the example I gave) for them to permanently miss a piece of content on one playthrough, even if that resulted in a meaningful world & story change."
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,5,Sun Apr 26 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that could be interesting, especially if it affected the main story, like certain sidequests opening certain dungeons for certain items.   Now I want this."
truezelda,33v4ao,Nickerdoodle,2,Sun Apr 26 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, Minish Cap totally does this"
truezelda,33v4ao,duelingdelbene,2,Sun Apr 26 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"It does?  I don't remember that at all, which NPCs have schedules in that game?  MC doesn't have a day/night cycle so how does it count time?"
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,3,Sun Apr 26 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Not time cycle, but you have to save that dude before a certain point in the game (think of milestones in the game as days i guess) or he dies and you lose light arrows permanently... it's a pretty good example of what you were saying"

truezelda,33v4ao,Epicfaillord,-1,Mon Apr 27 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, scripted events based on player progress isn't really the same thing at all.  It's kind of like a cheaper, boring version of actual NPC schedules."
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Apr 26 22:06:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd totally love more along the lines of what you said but I was just saying Zelda has done permanently missable things before
truezelda,33v4ao,duelingdelbene,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"Well, part of it is that it takes control away from the player in a circumstance where they otherwise have complete control. If it was a new IP or something where the player doesn't expect full control, that would be fine, but Zelda has set a precedent for that to be more annoying than it could ever be beneficial."
truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"At some point you need to lose a little bit of control, assuming you ever want The Legend of Zelda to evolve into a game that has interesting open worlds.  Open world games where everything is set, static, predictable, and worst of all waits for the player, are extremely boring."
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"Alright, but I never want Zelda to say to me ""You didn't talk to this sequence of NPCs at this point in the plot, so you don't get to do this sidequest, and you don't get this reward. Now go back, spend another 20 hours, and try again."" Changing the means to reach the same end? Fine. Denying both because the player advanced the plot too quickly or was having trouble on a puzzle and thus spent more time on it? No, not okay."
truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:57:45 2015 UTC,Why would you be locked completely out of content and rewards for missing something?  Any good game designer will design it such that missing one thing leads to another thing that you can do.  You don't make dead ends in games like that.
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"Ahh, alright, having different dialogue/interactions being the thing? Totally fine. Your example of an NPC dying just seemed very drastic and brought with it the idea of a quest dying with him/her. Perhaps a better example would have been failing to help an NPC reach a place by a certain time, and thus he misses the festival he was supposed to visit. Less drastic, doesn't bring about the same connotations of finality that an NPC dying does."
truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:12:37 2015 UTC,The NPC could die as long as his daughter enlisted the Hero's help to look for remedies to the same disease or entrust him with some secret treasure map in his last will.  The most important thing for me in a game that claims to have an open world is for the majority of the world to not give a shit about the player.  Stuff needs to go on and they can interact with it or they can not but it can't revolve around them.
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah the whole ""well, you saved me, so here's a quiver"" versus ""Well, you failed, but here's his quiver, thanks anyway"" angle that JRPGs pull all the time."
truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"I was reading more of a ""take event sequence one, and be rewarded with Item A; or take event sequence 2, and be rewarded with item B"".  Which, now that I write it out, might not feel very Zelda, unless it were a minor optional item (like a potion, but then you have the player wondering what they missed out on, unless it's a really nice potion) or there were some sort of replay mechanic (like Majora's Mask).  Another way is, if you tackle it before time X, you can get the item via event sequence 1, but if not, you have to do event sequence 2 to get it -- but you get the same item either way.  Both of those could work, I think."
truezelda,33v4ao,iamthelowercase,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:13:46 2015 UTC,I mean it might not feel very Zelda like but at the same time changes like this could give the series a breath of fresh air so to speak. As in I think changes need to be embraced that's how you improve and make progress.

truezelda,33v4ao,Nickerdoodle,15,Sun Apr 26 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"Gear customization, unique and swappable shields, and medals.  A.K.A. the entire inventory/gear/character progression system from Skyward Sword.  That was one of the best and most revitalizing updates SS made to the series which is in desperate need of some real, good RPG mechanics.  It gets tiring going through game after game wielding the ""Wooden Sword + Shield"" -> ""Legendary Sword #22 + Better Shield"".  I want to make choices about the gear I bring based on what I am going to encounter.  If I'm going to be picking which dungeon from a handful I am going to next, I should feel the need to prepare certain items and equip them first.  It also helps keep many items relevant by making them stronger (optionally).  The Scattershot in Skyward Sword is fantastic for handling keese and other fast/small/mobile/multiple targets, and I think that is the first Zelda game EVER where the slingshot ended up staying useful."
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,4,Sun Apr 26 03:39:33 2015 UTC,"To add to this, the resources required to upgrade gear should be more readily available by mining, woodcutting, looting enemies, and chests with random loot. Better upgrades could be found in locations that are hard to find, or have many enemies.  I also agree that choosing between multiple items for dungeons would be fun. Like heavy armor + heavy weapon or light armor + bow. Stuff like that."
truezelda,33v4ao,androsphere,4,Sun Apr 26 06:16:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this except for   mining, woodcutting,   This is a constant bore in most modern videogames and I don't see its point.  I really don't want to see Zelda go down the ""stand here and collect X amount of grind materials"" route."
truezelda,33v4ao,malaroo,3,Tue Apr 28 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of the process as more discovery, you find a mine and immediately gain its resources. This is preferable to waiting/button mashing for materials.  Or another idea is capturing strongholds that spawn resources for you, and must be defended during moblin attacks."
truezelda,33v4ao,androsphere,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, I know how I play games, and I would be caught up by how cool the upgrades were and spend ages grinding them all to completion before even paying attention to the storyline."

It's just a ton of fun, especially being able to swing your sword and do spin attacks on it. The canoe was pretty enjoyable as well. I think it adds quite a bit of flavor to the overworld when you travel through certain parts in unique ways."
truezelda,33v4ao,stryker101,13,Sun Apr 26 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"More random cool small events. TP was king of this. The jousting, house blowing up with the bugs, bridge on fire, riding the hogs that you find, the soldier dudes helping you at the end, etc"

There were a whole bunch of different abilities it granted you, from the goofy (transforming into a creature) to the just plain useful (red ring). I would love to see it again in a future Zelda."

truezelda,33v4ao,Mawnlower,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:18:38 2015 UTC,Yes! TP was the only Zelda game that actually made rupees useful to me throughout the entire game. Too bad the magic armor was such an endgame.

In Skyward Sword, I liked the ability to choose which shield I used without one being stronger than the others overall, each had strengths and weaknesses. I would like an expansion on this, possibly including armor, and including divergent upgrade paths, so you can choose exactly what kind of hero you want to play, being better armored and more of an in-your-face kind of fighter, or lightly armored with the Hover Boots and faster weapons for a ranger or skirmisher kind of game."
truezelda,33v4ao,CaptianZaco,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:24:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, but I think there should be a endgame ultimate equipment similar to the hylian sheild in SS because then you can just finish the game withot worrying about weaknesses."

truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,14,Sun Apr 26 22:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like it if they took the concept behind Spirit Zelda from ST and used it more. Or in other words : A partner/companion that has separate abilities from your own to use.    Not something like Midna, where she performs a single move on your back or warps you around. but actually being able to scout ahead as a fairy through little holes, or having some spirit be able to set fire to something to distract the enemy. etc...    If they go further and make the companions (doesn't have to be a full-game join up like Navi) a bit like gongoron or the sages from WW, it would be nice if a second player could take control of those characters/actions. A bit like the star pointer in Super Mario galaxy, but actually fun for the person controlling it.     Obviously if you play solo you could still use both functions, just you wouldn't be able to multitask as well."
truezelda,33v4ao,henryuuk,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:53:34 2015 UTC,Kind of like how the Legos games work. I've always been a big fan of that!
truezelda,33v4ao,23saround,9,Fri May 1 22:25:15 2015 UTC,Being able to hotkey items to buttons like in Oot and WW. It annoys me when I have to enter the menu and switch between items.

truezelda,33v4ao,froogle72,5,Sun Apr 26 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Skyward Sword didn't have you pausing. You just hold B and turn your wrist. If you got to know your inventory, that should take less than a second."
truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:14:51 2015 UTC,"That's true but it also slows down combat and changes gameplay.   Think of WW, where you can easily switch between items, that allows gameplay mechanics like stealing items off enemies. A quick boomerang to a fast enemy, then instantly the grapple hook. This is just one example.   In SS, that process wouldn't be instant, it adds a second or two, which doesn't seem like a lot, but a quick steal from an enemy like in WW would be a bother, so they remove a gameplay mechanic like it.   It just slows down combat and limits item combinations"
truezelda,33v4ao,froogle72,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:27:15 2015 UTC,SS was only like that because of the Wiimote.  Any Zelda game that uses a 'normal' controller set up is going to have item hotkeys.
truezelda,33v4ao,malaroo,4,Tue Apr 28 18:23:12 2015 UTC,How about a configurable difficulty setting from the get go? Skyward Sword was so underwhelmingly easy that I would be tempted to choose a hard mode from the start for the next Zelda.
truezelda,33v4ao,MystFoxcoon,2,Sun Apr 26 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"Enemies hitting you a bit harder isn't sufficient difficulty.  A difficulty setting would have to rework pretty much all the puzzles in the game to actually be challenging, likely entail some redesigning of the various dungeons, tweaking the overall enemy density and abilities (make them dodgier, faster, smarter).  You'd have better results asking the game to be more challenging in the first place, because a difficulty setting in a game like Zelda is too much work to be worth it, since you'd have to build a bunch of the game 2+ times."
truezelda,33v4ao,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Apr 26 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"Enemies hitting you a bit harder isn't sufficient difficulty.   It's more difficult than practically-infinite health.  Difficulty sliders exist for a reason, and so does Hero Mode which is already a thing.  Health barely even has a point in anything post-WW."
truezelda,33v4ao,malaroo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:29:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. The Caves of Trials in TP and WW were the only parts I was actually challenged by. They were made additionally awesome by the fact that I lost nearly an hour of progress if I died near the end.
truezelda,33v4ao,23saround,2,Fri May 1 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"Nah, just start with the hard version and pad stuff out to make the easier version, like spikes in MegaMan 10."

truezelda,33v4ao,apefeet25,2,Sun Apr 26 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"Alright, how about they implement them in a way that doesn't close you off from the rest of the world, like an ""as you are going"" type deal."
truezelda,33v4ao,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"I liked the tears from ST. They allowed them to add nonlinear paths to the tower of spirits, and the tears in the dark realm were just awesome.

truezelda,33v4ao,Epicfaillord,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"I like the way they were implemented. Tears of light are used as a cleansing item (so far) so I don't think they should be an ""as you are going"" thing unless you have something in need of cleansing right off the bat."
truezelda,33v4ao,apefeet25,3,Sun Apr 26 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe a certain spirit has been cursed, and the tears scattered. As you go throughout the game and collect the tears, the curse slowly lifts, causing some minor changes throughout the world (similar to Kinstone fusion), and then finally revealing a plot important dungeon or a plot item (like the silver arrows or something). Or maybe it would be small things scattered across the world as a test for Link, and collecting them/visiting them shows Link's growth, and collecting all of them will grant the true power of the Master Sword or something."

Also there's the original, Zelda 2, Link's Awakening, and the Oracle games on 3DS. Plus there are lots of great games out for 3DS so you wouldn't be getting one just for Zelda. I'd say it's worth it to get one for sure"
truezelda,33ryn5,UltimateD0ge,8,Sat Apr 25 01:50:57 2015 UTC,"Seconding this, 3DS is outstanding for zelda games because OoT, MM, ALBW, LA, OoA and OoS are all great games. Technically all these can be easily emulated but ALBW, but the 3DS has a lot of other great games outside the LoZ series as well.  DS games (PH and ST) are both fun, but not classics."
truezelda,33ryn5,potentialPizza,2,Sat Apr 25 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"The Oracle games are INCREDIBLE. Honestly, the 3DS is a worthy investment even if you were literally only buying Zelda games."

Lots of people don't like the controls, but I thought they worked just fine. I would say check out Spirit Tracks, at least. It's a departure in a few ways, but it's still pretty cool and a lot of fun. Looooots of collectables, which I really like. :P"

I think it's underrated and definitely worth checking out."

I thoroughly enjoyed playing Phantom Hourglass (though I'll admit that I still dislike the controls, and it was so unremarkable of a game that I can't really remember 90% of the game anymore), but just was unimpressed by Spirit Tracks and never managed to finish it."
truezelda,33ryn5,Jinketsu,3,Sat Apr 25 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Spirit Tracks, but I only went through Phantom Hourglass because it was a direct sequel to Wind Waker. They could've done better with it, but it wasn't a bad game really.  A Link Between worlds is probably the only Zelda game on the 3DS you would have trouble finding and playing for free via illegal means. It is a fantastic game, and pays perfect homage to A Link to the Past, but it's certainly not one to buy a handheld system for if you're not interested in the other games on the platform.  Of which, are you not interested in other games on the 3DS? There are some pretty remarkable ones out there these days."

ST was some train crap with a Zelda theme and didn't really hold me at all. Not to mention that ST pretty much copied all of the awful parts of PH, but stripped out all the good stuff."
truezelda,33ryn5,Jinketsu,2,Sat Apr 25 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I thought the story was better, the on-rails overworld was a neat way of making the world feel big without staying too bland like a mostly-oceanic boat adventure (given the DS limitations), and the overall gameplay on land was touched up and polished from PH.  Different strokes for different blokes I suppose!"
truezelda,33ryn5,Kafke,3,Sun Apr 26 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"The only 3DS Zelda game at the moment is Link Between Worlds. Which I'd recommend playing. The other retail games on 3DS are OoT and MM, but the 3D remakes. I'd recommend playing them, but if you are on a budget just skip.  I'd honestly recommend picking up a 3DS (or perhaps a 2DS which is pretty cheap now), and just grabbing those three games.  The DS ones (Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks) are pretty much skippable. They take place in a separate timeline (adult, after Wind Waker), and aren't really all that great."

truezelda,33ryn5,Theditor,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a bit harsh.  If it was buggy and graphically inconsistent, then such a comparison would warrant some merit. As it is, they're still games that were made under Nintendo's quality, but they're games that definitely require a different sort of patience than the console or straight 2D games. The difference between traversing the main world map vs the segmented smaller areas can be a little detrimental to the pacing, and PH definitely didn't do anyone any favors with having to return to the Ocean King Dungeon over and over, even though each time is made easier by your ever expanding arsenal.   But they still have pretty much everything you'd want from a Zelda game. The side quests, the progression of exploration as you get new items, and some of those items can be really fun to play with. The dungeons are tricky, and the bosses are some of most cinematic for a handheld Zelda game.   I definitely feel I'm in the minority, but I think they're still very fun games, ST definitely beats PH though, so if you only play one, it should be that one.  I don't think the cd-I games should be any valid point of comparison for any Zelda canon game xD"
truezelda,33ryn5,niewolec,5,Sat Apr 25 12:46:58 2015 UTC,"You can play the two 3DS remakes cheaply on the virtual console or emulating, if it is a matter of ""not wanting to buy"" a 3DS. Majora's Mask 3D is noticeably better than the original, while Ocarina 3D is basically the same. You'll miss out on the updated mechanics and better boss fights in MM3D.   As for the DS, play Spirit Tracks and skip Phantom Hourglass. PH was a prototype at BEST for a DS Zelda, and in my opinion is not a good game at all. Spirit Tracks is better in every single way, and probably in my top 5 zeldas."

AND it had better music. Tower of Spirits was a complete improvement in format over the Temple of the Ocean King.   I suppose it is all a matter of opinion, and I accept that. But I just can't find an objective reason as to why Phantom Hourglass was better. Anything it introduced, Spirit Tracks perfected."
truezelda,33ryn5,Kafke,2,Sat Apr 25 11:28:24 2015 UTC,"PH had horrible music, boring items and bosses, and a story that borders on useless.   I can't comment with clarity, since I hardly remember the game (it's been a long ass time since I've played it), but what I remember enjoying was how it took advantage of the DS features, like drawing the maps, navigation with the stylus and then focus on cannon shooting (much better than in WW) and that sort of thing.   Spirit Tracks gave us a playable Zelda in a unique setting with an interesting way of traversing the over world.   The train mechanic singlehandedly almost killed the game for me. It redeemed itself a bit at the end with that last area. But other than that it's a simplified PH boat mechanic, really. And the 'zelda' parts (dungeons and the like) were all pretty bland.   Tower of Spirits was a complete improvement in format over the Temple of the Ocean King.   I think I have to agree and disagree. The Tower of Spirits was more convenient. And perhaps better in terms of the dungeon. But I actually liked traversing it several times. As opposed to the tower of spirits where you literally just sat there running around in a circle to get to the top.   I suppose it is all a matter of opinion, and I accept that. But I just can't find an objective reason as to why Phantom Hourglass was better. Anything it introduced, Spirit Tracks perfected.   Perhaps. I just felt like PH was a solid game, not the best, but okay. And then ST took all the bleh parts of PH and added a bunch of other crap, completely stripping out all the parts that PH did well.  PH I beat pretty much when I got it. Took me over a year or two to finally pull myself to beat ST.  All in all, ST as a game is fine. Nothing wrong with it. But as a Zelda game it's awful. PH on the other hand might be a bit worse overall (for whatever reason), but feels like a better Zelda entry. If that makes sense."
truezelda,33ryn5,iamthelowercase,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:38:22 2015 UTC,"Spirit Track's musical instrument was almost literally unplayable on my system.  Looking back, I guess I could have grabbed a straw or something and hacked around it, but that... just... feels yucky.  I shouldn't have to do that, y'know?  The train mechanic I found meh.  I also remember specifically being annoyed at the underwater bit where you have to somehow shoot down those enemies.  That was hard, and not the good kind.  The boat mechanic and the Temple of the Ocean King I both enjoyed.  The play-as-Zelda/phantom mechanic in Spirit Tracks was neat, but felt underused at the point where I dropped ST -- I would have liked to see more of it.  There were other things that bugged me about the train as well, but I can't seem to remember/articulate them.  Sorry.  There was a bell bit I remember that was probably ST, though.  That bit was cool.  In fairness, PH was either my first or second Zelda game.  If I went back now I might well find the music crappy and other elements subpar.  I certainly wasn't paying any attention to the music when I played."

If you love Zelda for gameplay, and are into playing the games with a new twist on the mechanics, then you should absolutely play the DS games.  The reason most people hate the DS games is that they weren't exactly made for sitting down for a long time to play. My problem with the 3DS remakes is that OOT/MM were made to be played on a TV screen for a nice chunk of time. I don't like to stare at my mobile platforms for really long times. Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and ALBW, all played nicely because I didn't need to focus on it for more than 25-30 minutes at a time before I put it away."

truezelda,33ip9v,jesuswig,5,Thu Apr 23 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"Good connection with Cia - though it isn't canon, Hyrule Warriors is written well enough that some of its details will always be worth talking about.   The HMS is also a guardian entity   I wouldn't say that.  I think he is neutral.  If he was not neutral, he would probably have helped save the day in Ocarina of Time, no?  And we can't quite say he has ""rules against helping"", since he does so pretty directly in Majora's Mask.  But then you could argue that he only does it because it was partially his fault.  I think he does it more because he has a personal interest in Link.  The Salesman never seems particularly worried about the moon (outside of the early cutscene) - either he knows Link will succeed or he is extremely confident.  If he knows, that implies that he's prescient, so there's little reason for him to have gotten ambushed by Skull Kid.  If he's confident in Link, that implies the sort of vested interest in seeing the Hero succeed as his primary motivation.   one could assume the masks he carries have a greater purpose.   Possibly, but he could also just be a merchant.  Not as opposed to the deity, of course.   the same guy appears in the parallel universe with Hyrule   Do note that this shows the HMS is not free from the timeline splits.  He appears in all three timelines, and since he appears in the Adult and Childhood timeline in the same era, this means that he was fractured into 3 just like everybody else.  Then again, so was the Triforce, so it's not like the timeline split hasn't already proven to be the most powerful magical event in Hyrule histories, but it does put a cap on the HMS's powers somewhat.    Also, I think Carlov might be a similar entity to the Happy Mask Salesman.  Maybe there are many of these people.    Also, one of the most popular theories about the HMS isn't exactly tinfoil hat.  :)"
truezelda,33ip9v,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Apr 22 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"If he was not neutral, he would probably have helped save the day in Ocarina of Time, no?   My comment here is that maybe he simply wasn't concerned with the events of OoT, since it was Hyrule that was endangered, not the entire world. We've seen that other countries exist outside of Hyrule (Holodrum and Lybrinnia, and one or two others I think) so maybe the HMS simply didn't intervene because the rise and fall of mortal kingdoms is beneath his concern? In MM it's the entire world that dies every time the moon crashes, making it a tiny bit more important than one Kingdom falling to what is essentially an invasion.    He appears in all three timeines    Where does he appear in the Fallen timeline? I probably haven't played that particular game but it would be interesting to know to look for him.   I think he is neutral   I agree with this, he could be a neutral deity and still be a guardian concerned with protecting the world from destruction, the difference between ""good"" and ""evil"" is quite different from ""Existance"" and ""void"".    there's little reason for him to have gotten ambushed by Skull Kid   I disagree. It's not so much that Skull Kid ambushed him and stole the mask of his own accord, I see it as more that Majora led Skull Kid to steal the mask. It's clear that Majora has some power, even when he does not have a wearer/host, so Majora could have clouded the vision of the HMS, or even impaired HMS him(its?)self."

truezelda,33ip9v,MardocAgain,2,Thu Apr 23 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"Or at least HMS was around during one of the many timeline splits that occurs when Mario is defeated for whatever reason. The Happy Mask Salesman convinces Mario to let the HMS to carry Mario's hopes, dreams and burdens, in exchange for the HMS being able to take on Mario's form and use his abilities.   The deal is struck and HMS then uses his magic to transform Mario's desires burdens form and abilities into a mask. By doing this Mario's spirit is eased and can return to the well of souls free of any of Mario's existing earthly bonds. HMS still hadn't sold the Mario mask to someone by the events of Majora's Mask, which is why it can be found on his backpack.   In any other timeline (most) that HMS didn't appear in to a dying Mario, his spirit has to deal with it's desires and burdens itself like normal, instead of being able to pass them off to HMS.    I think HMS is a neutrally aligned demigod. Like /u/Serbaayuu said, he only wants to help Link because he feels partially responsible for the events that ensue across Termina, and that he is confident in Link's ability to complete this objective. Otherwise, He doesn't do actions that are evil in nature, but he also doesn't feel the need go out of his way to do good things that he wouldn't be involved in otherwise. Like /u/milhouse92 said, He might not even be able to get involved in the affairs of a world he visits. Maybe people are only able to interact with HMS if they are spiritually or magically inclined, or have encountered HMS as a spirit or when they are near certain death, imminently about to die. If HMS wants something done for whatever reason, he asks the people of that world to do it for them, in exchange for something. He enjoys collecting mask via his magic, selling those masks to those who seem interested. He has no need for the money he acquires by doing so, but the money people spend symbolize their curiosity about the masks HMS has."

So, he knew that he could not leave the clock tower because it was dangerous and he would get caught in the timeline of Termina and by extension the time loop. But by staying in the clock tower, he exists outside of time and termina, and for him the time-loop is actually just three days times however many loops you take. He is safe from the moon because you always make sure to reset time before the moon falls.

Because the HMS acknowledges that Link has already failed in retrieving the mask we can tell he's aware the cycle has been reset, which is something that no other NPC is capable of.    Edit: Like you'd said, Link's time-skipping only affects him and Tatl so the HMS would have to have some kind of influence to retain the knowledge of a failed 3-day cycle."

Surely you should be able to recover Majora's Mask. I believe in you."" He is asking whether or not you found a way to get the mask back this cycle.

Check your inventory. That's the easiest way in any Zelda game to figure out where you're at, and what you're up to next.   In Link's Awakening- you get an instrument in each dungeon, so if you come back to the game and you have three instruments, then you know you've beaten the first three dungeons. In OoT it was the Spiritual Stones and the Medallions. In TP it was the Fused Shadows and Mirror of Twilight.   If that fails to jog your memory, then you still have your actual items. Most of the games display them in the order you got them, so it's not that hard to figure which one is the newest addition to your inventory. Then you go around the overworld and see where that new item can get you. Odds are it's going to help you get to the next place you need to go (most likely the next dungeon)."
truezelda,33f80d,stryker101,7,Wed Apr 22 06:00:44 2015 UTC,all of the games can be beat without a guide
truezelda,33f80d,henryuuk,5,Wed Apr 22 13:36:30 2015 UTC,In fact I'd easily wager that far less than 0.01% of all games ever absolutely require a guide for you to beat.
truezelda,33f80d,Serbaayuu,6,Wed Apr 22 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"I beat it when I was about 8 without a guide, first zelda game I played too. Just be patient and explore."

Just explore every nook and cranny of the environment (cut down all the grass, try every path, read every single sign, etc) and talk to every npc. You'll get the clues you need and are limited to certain areas until you get a new item or ability, clueing you to go back and search.  Guides didn't really exist when this game came out, LOL"
truezelda,33f80d,ShroomyGuy,17,Thu Apr 30 11:40:55 2015 UTC,bull shit guides didn't exist. You would swap info on the playground and get tips from Nintendo Power and EGM.

truezelda,33f80d,ewweaver,2,Wed Apr 22 14:22:48 2015 UTC,Somehow I did it all as a kid (under 10) without any help at all. I think the key is having time to just explore and talk to everyone. You will eventually stumble onto what you need to do. I replayed it a few years ago and I still remember how to do everything better than I do with more recent games like TP.
truezelda,33f80d,generousmoblin,2,Wed Apr 22 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"I have not used a guide for any zelda game I have played. I don't really see Link's Awakening as a very challenging game, but it does require some methodical exploration.   I think if you played LA at the time it was released, it would have seemed possible, but I think now the style of playing games has changed, with far more in-game hints and tips to guide you through increasingly longer games. Therefore going back to this kind of game can be frustrating as it seems so 'closed'.  I would also speculate that of its time, one would generally have less games compared to now, I play several games concurrently across different machines and platforms, whereas back in the 90s it was less likely to be splitting attention and memory across as many games? Maybe that is just how I have personally changed how I access video games."

It's definitely possible to play it without a guide, you just need to talk to as many NPCs as possible, and realize there's a few side quests too.

To answer OP's question with my own experience.  I played Z1 and Z2 years ago (back when they were new).  I skipped LttP (did not own an SNES).  I borrowed Link's Awakening from a friend - and absolutly LOVED the game.  I did not play it with a guide, although I did try asking Dr. SBATISO for help (that should date me).  I got stuck - badly.  I was in the Northern Face Shrine and couldn't progress.  Eventually, I gave the game back to my friend.  One day, months (possibly over a year) later, I was over at his house and fired up his Game Boy - and my save was still there!  So, I started messing around in it again and figured out what I was missing (a particular bombable wall that I hadn't caught before).  I finished the game the next day.  Now, I still argue that Z1 cannot reasonably be beaten without a guide of some kind (namely, the second quest) - but, yeah, Link's Awakening really does a great job of leading you without making it obvious you're being lead."

Shit I have to start over.   but anyway, you shouldn't have to use a guide, but it definitely makes it easier. If you have played Majora's Mask or OoT they are almost the exact same way. You aren't directly told what to do, you just have to explore and find out on your own.  IIRC once you get one item for the trade it starts giving you hints on where to trade it next. also I think the library thing is only for upgraded armor or damage, which technically isn't the main story so no need for hints?"
truezelda,33f80d,monsda,5,Sun Apr 26 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"Skyrims quest and map system pretty much is a walkthrough. It can be tough keeping track of all the storylines, but the ""go there, do that"" part of it is pretty straightforward."

Who wants to play a game where they ultimately lose in the end? Or where the only way you win is a deus ex machina? It's fine to have that sort of thing happen at other points in the game (and Zelda has done that), but it's not okay to end the game on that note."

truezelda,338der,buriedinthenude,9,Mon Apr 20 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"ALBW doesn't change up the formula that much beyond the fact that you can choose your order of same-step objectives and that you don't need to find the item inside the dungeon, but instead need to get it ahead of time.    ALBW has the exact same story progression as AlttP    Discover something is amiss -> gather 3 macguffins -> Master Sword -> showdown with antagonist, defeat him but fail to stop him-> 7 Temples to save the people of importance -> Final Temple.    The only difference is that you can do pendant 2 and 3 in either order, and that the only limitation on sage order is that you need to save the guy with the sand rob before going into the desert. Every dungeon still has a main item/gimmick you need to get through it and too beat the boss."
truezelda,338der,henryuuk,2,Mon Apr 20 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"I know, that's why I said I was confident that Zelda U will be what the series needs. I was just expanding on the idea and trying to create a discussion."
truezelda,338der,CitizenWolfie,8,Mon Apr 20 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"I think in terms of telling the main story, I like it when Zelda is traditional and follows the ""story - dungeon - story - dungeon"" routine as OP describes.  Just because it keeps things moving along and feels like a Zelda game.  However...  I would love it if there were more side missions and places to explore that have no bearing whatsoever on the story and are just self-contained.  I think that's why MM is often so highly rated and I think it's one of the reasons why LttP has been a favourite for so long and more western RPGs like Fallout and Elder Scrolls have started to overtake JRPGs.  They reward you for putting the effort in.  So to use your ice cavern example (I'm assuming it's the one in OoT?), IIRC you have to visit there at least once in the story to progress.  I'd prefer it if there were dungeons and caverns that had nothing to do with the main story and is just there to house say, a new weapon or power up that will make exploring places different to how you've been doing it so far.  I do agree that it'd be great for the dungeons to utilise more than one item though, though it does mean there would be an element of linearity in which dungeons you'd have to play through.  Unless you could buy items like in ALBW of course, but I really didn't care for that system.  I like to earn my items."

truezelda,338der,21stCenturyLink,9,Wed Apr 22 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, link obviously hasn't always won. Heck, normally he ends up at a temporary stalemate! SPOILERS ALL FROM HERE ON! You have been warned. Ganondorf never stays dead. Hyrule gets flooded. He at some point doesn't have descendants (wind waker, the hero of winds isn't descended from the hero).  SWS: Dont they all end up cursed in this one? And zelda ends up locked up or something? I haven't played yet...  OoT: ""Hero"" is the catalyst to allow 7 years of hell. Only locks Ganon away. And causes three separate time lines, all with Ganon in them.  MM: actually saves it... But the transoformation masks (zora, Gordon, deku) ? To get them the people each mask represented died. So much for saving everybody. TP: Saves the twilight and light realms, ""kills"" Ganon. NOTE: this happens in the timeline were link goes back in time and stops Ganon prior to the seven years of hell. Wind Waker? Note: happens in the timeline were link beats Ganon and doesn't go back seven years. Ganon is free to loose terror on the world. So much for the hero of time locking him away. This Link actually saves the world, after a couple failed attempts to save his sister and tetra. Totally beats Ganon and leaves his body a stone on the ocean floor.  PH I would qualify this as world saved. Note, this is the same hero as in WW... Seeing a pattern?  ST: assumed descendent of the Hero of Winds, for sure saves New Hyrule.  LTTP: goes through it all, victory. Oh wait, no, it is only temporary. Ganon comes back in the next game (sort of). OoS/OoA: He first draws attention to the oracles and helps the villains capture them. Then saves them, but unleashes Ganondorf in the process. I'm thinking this hero has some problems with saving the world... Kills Ganon. Temporarily. Link Awakening: It's all and dream, and link kills everybody to wake up... Depressing stuff. A win and a loss combined.  LBW: Ultimately, this hero is the most successful. Kills mindless Ganon/Yuga combo thing. Saves two worlds.      So, by my count the OoT link has 1 point (MM). TP link only temporarily stopped Ganon. SS link has an unknown. WW link is a badass with 2 points, and his descendent has netted him another 1. So 3 points with totally eliminating 3 big demon dudes. LTTP link is a wonky hero, but ultimately failed to kill Ganon, again, all his effort was temporary. Does his dream count? Cause if so, he has a negative score... LBW Link has yet to have it revealed if he was able to finish Ganon in his timeline. He gets a point for restoring peace to Lorule. 1 point.     I do think a tweaking to the game play is needed, but story wise? Link is a tragedy. Even when he wins, he loses in the long run.  Edit: clarified a couple errors."
truezelda,338der,21stCenturyLink,8,Mon Apr 20 15:04:39 2015 UTC,TP and WW are separate timelines. Your explanation reads like TP Link doesn't kill Ganon and WW Link kills that Ganon further on. Not the same timeline.

truezelda,338der,tisonz,2,Tue Apr 21 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"Why can't Ganon kill a major character? Why can't Link and Zelda lose, only to have the Goddesses intervene? (I'm sure there's a way for this to fit in the timeline somehow, also I don't know the ins and out of the lore too much)   Wind Waker's intro tells the story of Ganon rising up, only for the hero not to answer the call. There are different interpretations of this. Maybe the hero wasn't around anymore.  Because of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff, adult Link/Hero of Time did not exist in that world after Ganondorf was defeated in OoT. He was sent back 7 years, so anything that happened in that timeline would continue to happen without Link's presence. If Ganon came back , there might not have been a Link to stop him.  Another possibility is that Ganon returned quite a while after OoT, which I believe would have left the possibility open for an incarnation of Link to rise up. This is the theory I subscribe to, and one I think could fit perfectly into your suggestion.  What if Link was reincarnated, but this time he failed? When he wasn't able to stop Ganon, the Goddesses and the King flooded Hyrule. In the end, we learn that it was never the goal of the Goddesses for Link to stop Ganon this time. Instead, everything we did was to set the Great Flood in motion. Maybe the player sets things up to allow the people to evacuate to the mountain tops.   I'd love for the new game to try to bridge some of the time between OoT and WW. WW's story seemed to rely heavily on the events in that period, so it could be pretty interesting to experience it somehow."
truezelda,338der,Phoxxent,3,Mon Apr 20 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"I have my own theory on the era without a hero that would play well with nintendo's talks of having a female protagonist in zelda at some point in the future. Just because link isn't there doesn't mean zelda isn't. Instead of playing link, you play an adult Zelda who runs through the world and tries to find link but instead creates an army and gathers items to go against ganon when she finds that he's not there.  Things happen and the army corners ganondorf, final showdown with zelda, you defeat ganon but find out that he had already set the events that caused the water to come in into place. Ganon uses the last of his magic to turn the kokiri into the things they were in WW and the zora into the bird people(Its 1:45 am where i am i can't remember the names).    Que scrambling and getting everyone to tops of mountains. Zelda gives her next of kin the wisdom shard of the triforce but the king keeps part for himself to keep ganondorf from getting it when he comes back. Zelda then sacrifices herself to allow the goddess to protect the castle of hyrule and the surrounding area we have access to in WW under the ocean. Que end game, we see the Ocean as it is in WW and the people starting to build showing a bright future that zelda's sacrifice brought about."
truezelda,338der,henryuuk,2,Tue Apr 21 05:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think nintendo has said anything, that was all fans. The closest thing I can think of is Aonuma teasing the fans with ""no one said that was Link."" The goddesses flooded Hyrule to stop ganon, ganon didn't do it, besides, he needs to be undefeated to be where he is in Wind Waker. Koroks and Rito evolved from the kokiri and zora respectively, they weren't cursed."

I think LBW did a pretty good job of moving away from that, but we can definitely do more.

truezelda,334ih9,kahlandra,7,Mon Apr 20 01:30:29 2015 UTC,Do you know about the song that lets you slow down time? It definitely helps with some of the stress/anxiety that the timer can create.
truezelda,334ih9,TheHynusofTime,3,Mon Apr 20 05:17:02 2015 UTC,Yeah i use it the moment i go back in time. I'm just very slow at figuring things out in general. I take my time in games.
truezelda,334ih9,kahlandra,0,Mon Apr 20 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"No, man. If you play the song of time backwards, the timer is MUCH slower. It gives you time to breath :)"
truezelda,334ih9,Peugeon,41,Fri Apr 24 23:34:47 2015 UTC,I'm upvoting anyone in this thread making a cogent point regardless of their stance. People should not be downvoted for having varying opinions and stating them intelligently instead of blindly following the fanboyism.

It's kinda hard to have a discussion when dissenting opinions are pushed to the bottom.   this isn't really a good topic for discussion, though. like many threads on this subreddit, it's ""I like/don't like Zelda Game A, and I want to gush/vent about that, and I want some other people to gush/vent about liking/not liking it, too.""  it's one of the reasons why i detest ""DAE"" style threads. they very rarely lead to any kind of meaningful dialogue and instead are just thinly-veiled soap box rants. the thread even starts out with an inflammatory ""I just can't see why there's so much love for Majora's Mask"". do you honestly feel like any interesting conversation is going to naturally stem from that opening?  OP's original post (sans the edit) was 7 sentences. i had to scroll down to the fourth-highest rated comment to find someone who wrote more than 3 sentences. even still, most of the top level comments are just passive agreements with OP. imo, everyone who is actually using their downvotes properly should be down-voting just about every comment in this thread, and the thread itself (as it clearly needs to be reworded to foster better discussion)."

When I first got here the top comments were a mix of shorter and longer answers, as well as a mix of agreement and disagreement.

It's a fun game, and it's cool that it finally has a fan base, after spending years as one of the most underrated Zelda games. That said, it's now, in my opinion, the most overrated game in the franchise. Yes, even more so than Ocarina of Time, the game that many feel is the definition of overrated.  I love Majora's Mask, but if you told someone before 2010 that it would be considered one of the most popular Zelda games in a few years, no one would believe you."
truezelda,334ih9,TheHynusofTime,6,Mon Apr 20 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"The worst part is not that everyone loves it, that I'm fine with, as it's been my favorite for maybe 5 years or so (when I started to actually form an opinion more than ""whoo! Zelda!""). The worst part is the fan theories on it and the sequel/prequel begging. All the ""how did majora doing origin?"" and ""dae majora is best villain"" and ""what if Link was Ikana ninja Fierce Diety in the next game?"" posts get really old really fast. People gush about the ""mystery of it"", but there is no mystery. Majora is an evil spirit inside of a mask that was used in hexing rituals by an ancient tribe. It was gotten by the HMS, a traveling mask salesman and collector who knows his way around magic. The end. ""But who was the ancient tribe?"" Why does it matter? What difference does it at all make? We don't know because we don't need to know and knowing or not knowing changes nothing. There are no hints at anything else, there is no mystery, it is a story that tapers off smoothly into the obscure mists of time. Everything is filled in. Fierce Diety is the Captain Planet of Termina. Done. He wasn't some ancient hero counterpart to Link, the fierce diety's mask is a mask which contains the spirits of all of termina. He his captain termina by their spirits combined. And the whole ""diety"" but already throws the ""he was an ancient hero counterpart to Link and he and majora are always locked in eternal combat"", he is or was a god, whose power is now contained in a mask that is only created by combining the joy and happiness of the spirits of the people of termina. Besides, Majora isn't locked to termina anymore than the HMS."
truezelda,334ih9,Phoxxent,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:01:29 2015 UTC,There is a difference between theories and analysis though.(subtle though yet important) MM goes into extremely human themes throughout the whole games and pretty much has no boundaries whatsoever. I don't like fan theories because they usually rely on shoestring facts or just are cool for the sake of being cool. But a lot of people really forget just how much meaning MM has.
truezelda,334ih9,Semaug,3,Fri Apr 24 20:35:23 2015 UTC,Majora's mask has been my favourite Zelda title since I first played it when it came out years ago. It's the only one to let you take on different forms and explore environments in very different ways. It's also the one with the most intriguing atmosphere.  It's not surprising that people love the game so much
truezelda,334ih9,TheSobadef,2,Mon Apr 20 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't understand the appeal. It's just that Majora's Mask didn't have the large fan base that it does until Project Moonfall first started up, though Ben Drowned likely played a role in this as well. Before these things, Majora's Mask wasn't as well liked like it is today.  Edit: I'd also argue that a few of the things you said are either your own opinion (It's also the one with the most intriguing atmosphere), or not entirely correct (It's the only one to let you take on different forms and explore environments in very different ways). With the first case, I will agree that the atmosphere has the most depth, but due to differing opinions and perceptions, what is intriguing to you may be far less so to someone else. And for the second point, plenty of Zelda games had you exploring the same environment in different ways. (Ocarina of Time, Minish Cap, A Link Between Worlds, and Twilight Princess come to mind)."
truezelda,334ih9,TheHynusofTime,2,Mon Apr 20 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the fan base wasn't as vocal, at least on Reddit, but the fans didn't suddenly appear due to this project Moonfall I've never even heard of.   As for your counterpoints, Majora's mask is the only game where the sense of impeding doom perseveres throughout the entire game, and the clock is literally ticking while you have to figure out how to save the world. Since there is a 3 day system, it's NPCs have lives and interact with each other in ways no Zelda has since been able to replicate.   As for the environment exploration, perhaps you're right that other games have allowed you to change forms, but this is the only game where you can play as the various other species in the game, and interact with them as if you're one of them."
truezelda,334ih9,TheSobadef,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:54:12 2015 UTC,"Project Moonfall was the original petition for Nintendo to remake Majora's Mask for the 3DS, and it was a very big deal, so much so that Nintendo has addressed it on more than one occasion iirc. I believe it started up around the time that the Ocarina remake was released. And while part of the sudden fan base growth may have just been because they became more vocal, I can tell you for a fact that there were plenty of people who went from disliking or even hating Majora's Mask, to praising it and spouting about how much it deserved a remake. Project Moonfall and Ben Drowned absolutely created fans from people who weren't fans before.  Your first point, while still your own opinion, I agree with, but it isn't really arguing against anything I said. For your second point, I'd argue that Twiligt Princess still does this. Maybe it isn't as deep as Majora's Mask, but being able to change into a wolf and communicate with or play games with animals is similar to what you're describing."
truezelda,334ih9,TheHynusofTime,2,Mon Apr 20 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I can certainly appreciate all the work you put into defending your points, and I'm the end, there are no losers with Majora's Mask being a great game, among all the other fantastic Zelda games.

truezelda,334ih9,kpajamas,5,Mon Apr 20 05:39:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly! That's what I meant by ""that game is a job."" You get to a point where it's just a waste of time if you don't look up what to do next. If I ever have to look at a walkthrough, I try and only do it for the tiny section that I'm stuck at, and then attempt to figure out the rest on my own until I get majorly stuck again; otherwise, I feel like I might as well just read the walkthrough instead of playing the game altogether."
truezelda,334ih9,thegrimm54321,3,Mon Apr 20 14:56:17 2015 UTC,The exploration/figure-it-out aspect is kind of a staple of Zelda games. That's why people were so annoyed with Fi and Skyward Sword. The game never let you figure anything out on your own.

truezelda,334ih9,seiyria,15,Fri Apr 24 14:46:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like it either.  There are few things I hate more than a game forcing me to repeat things I have already accomplished (I'm looking at you, Bravely Default), and while experienced players can plan ahead to minimize this, your first time you're guaranteed to be doing the same shit over and over.  I felt no motivation at all to do anything other than the bare minimum to progress the game, since I feared running out of time and having to repeat - and from an in-world perspective, what's the point, since it'll all be undone anyway?  These two things really made me hate playing the game. I will say, underneath that there's a perfectly acceptable Zelda game in there. I just can't enjoy it because I hate the core game mechanic so much. I think it's saying something that this is the only Zelda I ever gave up on."
truezelda,334ih9,lemonitis2,6,Sun Apr 19 20:30:09 2015 UTC,God yes! I was loving Bravely Default until the chapter where I was gonna have to re-fight almost every boss in the game. That completely killed the game for me and I never finished it.
truezelda,334ih9,CVButcher,2,Sun Apr 19 20:37:37 2015 UTC,It gets worse - you have to do that four times in order to finish the game.

truezelda,334ih9,CVButcher,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:47:33 2015 UTC,No you don't. You can skip right to the end as soon as all the bosses become available.

truezelda,334ih9,dieuvainc,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:58:45 2015 UTC,"You don't have to fight all the bosses. They're all 100% optional. Although you really shouldn't skip them. Because while in Chapter 5, they are boring, around half in Chapter 6 and all of them in 7 and 8 were essentially completely different. Different dialogue and events and backstories are revealed, and the strategies are so different that it just literally isn't repetitive, at all. The tactics you have to use actually make it really fun, since in comparison everything you did beforehand counts as brute force and won't save you.  But even if you still don't want to do them, they are seriously optional. You can just power through the crystal bosses again which will take like an hour. You might have to grind a bit, but with the number of tools the game offers you to make grinding easy (super fast forwarding, adjustable encounter rate, and a ridiculous number of fast aoe strategies to try as well as auto-battle), it doesn't take long either."
truezelda,334ih9,potentialPizza,2,Mon Apr 20 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"I beat all of the bosses in every cycle, and I'd recommend against it. Dialogue wasn't worth it in most cases, the items you get weren't necessary, as the final boss is easier than some of these later fights, and it ended up being a tedious tour for minimal gain.   Admittedly, some of the dialogue was great, but other than a tiny glimpse into these characters that never really go anywhere, it also feels like you're not achieving anything.   I really enjoyed Bravely Default, but that second half was nasty. Interesting, but equally nasty."
truezelda,334ih9,Casposaurus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. The dialogue was consistently fantastic. And the battles in Chapters 7 and 8 all took significant strategy that most of the game didn't require, which at least for me, was very fun to experiment with."
truezelda,334ih9,potentialPizza,2,Mon Apr 20 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"I completed it very recently, and I only remember a few additional scenes of dialogue. As I said, some were really well-done, but for me, most were just forgettable.  The battles in Chapters 7 and 8 do get significantly more challenging, which is great. The issue is chapters 5 and 6 ruin it, because ""been there, done that.""  Had they done fewer cycles, or even differentiated it in a more memorable manner, it would've totally worked. I don't think they tried enough. I think they were attempting a grand gesture, but were still bogged down by tradition.   Although, in saying that, I would've liked for repeated boss-killing to upgrade the jobs. Maybe calling on tradition could've been done more, where Final Fantasy could've been channeled for job upgrading.   I understand why people really enjoy it, and I don't think it's 'bad', as it's an interesting approach. I personally don't think much of the dialogue is worth it, and the extra scenes that are worth it really don't carry the rest.   I think this is ultimately down to preference though, and I respect your opinion."
truezelda,334ih9,Casposaurus,2,Mon Apr 20 05:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose I can respect yours too. I just rant about it a lot because I legitimately do see a lot of people who are practically circlejerking, or just unnecessarily telling new players."
truezelda,334ih9,potentialPizza,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm opposed to a hive-mind, and telling new players anything 'major' about a game. I'm definitely with you there. Simply allowing someone to experience a game for themselves, and draw their own conclusions is the biggest service you can do for a person."
truezelda,334ih9,Casposaurus,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:21:38 2015 UTC,I found that a lot of the stuff I stole from those bosses (especially with 2x steal) were totally worth it for some character builds.
truezelda,334ih9,seiyria,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"If you think Bravely Default was forcing you to do things you already did, you probably stopped after chapter 5 or just didn't pay attention. Around half of the sidequests in Chapter 6 and all of them in Chapters 7 and 8 were completely different in terms of dialogue, providing backstory, just being really good scenes, and how the actual fights go. Seriously, they were all completely different fights with bosses in different groups (and in Bravely Default's gameplay, that makes it essentially a different fight, since the strategies are completely different), and the level of difficulty and tactics necessary made that part extremely fun."
truezelda,334ih9,potentialPizza,2,Mon Apr 20 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"I paid full attention and slogged the entire way through. While there were some nuggets of new info, the fact remains they made you repeat the entire game like four times in a row before actually moving on.

truezelda,334ih9,Kinomi,7,Sun Apr 19 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't much a fan of it. I thought the themes were neat, but all in all I just didn't have fun playing it."
truezelda,334ih9,serpent-tailed-angel,5,Mon Apr 20 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"It's one of my least favorite. I never really understood the overly amounts of praise it gets over most of the other zelda games on this subreddit.  It was fun to play through it once (which I did 15 years ago), but I can't get through it the second time on the 3DS. Like you said, it feels repetitive. To me the dungeons and bosses are bland, and it's actually a really short game.  I do like the atmosphere and music though."
truezelda,334ih9,SuperBanti,6,Sun Apr 19 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Its not my least favourite Zelda game, but it was a huge disappointment. The whole thing felt disjointed and forced, repetitive, and just 'missing' something. You can tell the original was made on low time.   I enjoyed playing it at first, but I never really felt the motivation to pick it up again. I had to stop playing when classes came back, and I planned to finish in the mid-semester break, but I just had no motivation. Because of the Time mechanic, it felt like nothing I was doing actually mattered.  So for me, I really enjoyed playing it while I was, but as soon as I put it down I never felt an urge to pick it up again, in contrast to all the other games I had to put down for classes, or the other zelda games I come back to again and again.   Its certainly not the worst, though."
truezelda,334ih9,NeuroCavalry,2,Sun Apr 19 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"MM is an experimental game. It takes a lot of risks and does a lot of new things that the team probably wanted to put in OoT but never could. But made on low time? I think there's a lot of content throughout the whole game and a lot of variety as well, two years may seem like a short time, but all the character models and animations were pretty much copy-pasted, so Nintendo could focus on other things. But yeah I can understand why you didn't like the time mechanic or a lot of things."
truezelda,334ih9,Semaug,3,Fri Apr 24 20:37:35 2015 UTC,I never managed to get into it. I have some serious stress outs when timed events are pulled into games so the idea of a timed game makes me shudder. I do plan on giving it a try now that it's out for 3ds though.

truezelda,334ih9,timeandforgiveness,13,Mon Apr 20 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"I personally love the sense of impending doom the game has and I feel like its just the perfect amount of pressure (some but not too much since you can easily reset everything).   But what makes the game really great for me is the side quests and NPCs. There's just so much to do and the NPC stories get pretty emotional (Anju/Kafei and Romani/Cremia in particular).  Also the masks are just good fun.  Anyway those are the main reasons its one of my favourites. Zelda means a lot of different things to different people. Some love it for the exploration, some love it for the characters, some love it for the puzzles, etc. And most Zelda's do different aspects better than others so not everyone is gonna love every game."

truezelda,334ih9,xahhfink6,6,Sun Apr 19 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"The game made me feel things. It made me anxious because of the moon, depressed for the NPCs, etc. The dungeons were fairly challenging, and they had very cool designs (pagan temple,  ice tower, water factory, and the fan - favorite stone tower).

truezelda,334ih9,xwatchmanx,7,Sun Apr 19 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, but I find that if you point out negatives with MM or WW on this sub you face some really harsh judgement. My guess is that it's largely because reddit's demographic is mostly in that 16-25 range where they grew up playing those games (in the same way, I have way bigger love for LoZ and AoL than most because it was my childhood).  MM is amazing for flavor, for open-worldness, and is still the darkest Zelda, but it is also one of the lowest ranked in terms of gameplay."

It's incredibly different in a number of ways, and the time system adds a whole different element to gameplay that many might find too stressful to be fun.  That said, the only real complaint I have about the game are the boss fights. Almost all of them are underwhelming, too easy, or both, including the final boss."

And A Link to the Past makes Majora's look like a half-assed sideproject."
truezelda,334ih9,schrodingers_lolcat,2,Wed Apr 22 16:06:49 2015 UTC,"I love majoras mask, but I understand why people didn't like it. I think the word is small but dense and beautiful. The over world has reason and the main quest of stopping the moon makes the game seem short if that's all you did in the game. I love colleging the masks and soothing the souls of the people around me. I feel like that healing is what defines link as a hero to me in that game. It's not the standerd ""link kills big bad evil guy"" he's a kid who's just as lost in the world as myself the player, but he impacts peoples life. I don't really like the dungeons except for the water temple (only one I like in the zelda games I've played) I love that my sword can be upgraded and the Goron and zora and deku masks are great in changing the manotany of running around."
truezelda,334ih9,Serbaayuu,2,Fri May 1 07:33:51 2015 UTC,"Until the 3DS version it was my most disliked Zelda. The game was a chore to play, it was confusing and clunky and it felt like unless you already knew where you going you didn't know how to get there.   The original N64 IMO aged quite badly.  The new 3DS port fixed a lot of what aged poorly and made it a pretty damn good game now, didn't find myself very confused at all."
truezelda,334ih9,GoldenRoad,4,Fri May 15 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"I really really wanted to like it since I got it with WW on the Gamecube, unfortunately it does not feel like Zelda to me. When I play Zelda I want escapism, relax and exploaration, some dungeon and a story that makes me feel happy. MM is grimdark, and the time bar is just too stressful to make it enjoyable. I am still -slowly- managing to finish it, but I will probably never want to play it again. Anyway, I see why there are people thst love it: it's a polarizing game."
truezelda,334ih9,eissturm,-10,Sun Apr 19 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"No, The Dark Knight is grimdark.  There's never been a grimdark Zelda game.  Maybe ""Hot Topic Dark"" a couple times."
truezelda,334ih9,GoldenRoad,5,Sun Apr 19 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"First and foremost: why are people downvoting this (58% upvoted at time of writing)? Don't downvote just because you disagree with OP's opinion.  I liked Majora's Mask, but I still had some problems with it. The dungeon's were aggressively difficult. In every other Zelda game (at least as far as the ones I've played) if a dungeon is hard it's because the player can't figure out the solution to the puzzles. In MM the puzzles are difficult in ways outside of the players control.  MM's water temple is a perfect example of this: the puzzles are difficult and the dungeon is designed in a way that you have to do everything perfectly in order to solve them. The water temple is the reason it took me until last year to finish the game, despite having bought it the day it came out.  Otherwise I liked Majora's Mask quite a bit. The story and aesthetic were a nice break from the usual Zelda format."

truezelda,334ih9,TheMcDucky,2,Sun Apr 19 15:18:42 2015 UTC,Can you imagine if Zelda Wii U copy and pasted the NPCs from Skyward Sword but with different names and stories. People would be furious! People explain away the NPCs from MM that were copied from Oot because it was an alternate universe bla bla bla but we all know it's because Nintendo was riding high off of Ocarina and wanted to cash in as soon as possible with a follow up.

(probably would have been better actually) but N64 Odolwa, N64 Gyorg and N64 Twinmold were horrendously bad bosses.    Goht and Majora had to carry the boss part of the game on themselves."

From Zeldapedia:   Boss Remains are quest items from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. They are masks left behind by the bosses who inhabit the four temples of Termina. Each time Link defeats a boss, he is rewarded with the mask it previously wore. The masks have been cursed by Majora's Mask to keep the Four Giants imprisoned within the bodies of the bosses. When Link acquires one, the Giant that had been sealed by it is freed.   This is the way I always understood it too. It's through the masks that Majora's power is manifested."

MM was in my top favorite titles for many years and I had given up on a remake long ago (I'm sorry Nintendo, I'll never doubt that you again). I really enjoy most of the changes and upgrades so far, but there's one thing that really really bothers me.   Every time you meet and speak to someone and have a new mysterious side quest, it takes you to the notes/schedule place and put a notice for you (See? See? You gotta do something about this hint hint). It's reminiscent of the horrible picking up items in SS where it tells you that you picked up an amber relic for the 200th tine. I may be a bit old school grumpy old lady about this, but I don't like this extra guidance and hint for the side quests. I get that it may be a bit difficult for new players nowadays to remember all the different side quests, but I just get a mild annoyance when that screen is forced popped up.   I haven't gotten to the Zora mask portion of the game yet. I hope the swimming doesn't make me sad. Still enjoying the game though! grumble grumble :)"

truezelda,32u2rg,Phoxxent,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"But that's the soul of Zelda games. You don't have to get anything done asap. It can stay in your log of things to do and you can spend so much time just exploring the world. Everyone is yearning for a giant open world Zelda full of things to do like the older games, but to they really understand what they want and what they're asking? I don't want to be told to immediately pursue a task, that's what many Zelda fans dislike. I want to be notified that, hey, there's this thing on the side you can do if/when you want. Pushing it in the players face all the time with a long cutscene gets bothersome. I think that's what he/she was talking about.  Also, every time that cutscene comes on it takes forever.

I mean, back from for the N64, I used to hand write notes for myself to remember things. But I think that was part of the charm of classic Zelda. Don't get me wrong, having all your event notes in the digital game makes it way more convenient. What I do dislike is how immediately after speaking with someone with a sidequest, it switches to the event notes page and an animation with a vague note about the quest pops up. I'd have appreciated something more subtle like after speaking with an NPC, a little notification bubble/sparkle/whatever notifies you that you have a new event note. Kind of how the Tatl or Navi icon light up. So you have the option of checking it at the moment, not being forced to wait and watch the mandatory animation. Reeeally don't like that at all."
truezelda,32u2rg,Jammintk,4,Thu Apr 16 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"The N64 does the exact same thing with the Bomber's notebook though, even highlighting times etc. The difference is that MM3D does this for every single interaction that is tied to the cycle, and also goes to the actual notebook screen instead of just showing an extra text box."
truezelda,32u2rg,five_inch_heels,2,Thu Apr 16 19:55:42 2015 UTC,Oh yeah you're right! Id forgotten about that. But you're also right about MM3D doing it for every interaction for the event and the is what bothers me.

truezelda,32u2rg,five_inch_heels,2,Thu Apr 16 20:46:27 2015 UTC,"Not at all. It's essentially the way most games are made now usually spell out exactly what to do in fear of players not immediately knowing the task at hand and saying it's too difficult. And as the years go by, many younger and new gamers become accustomed to this and expect it from most games. They're not stupider, they just grew up with the new kind of philosophy for game design. I understand that games change and evolve along with the technology that make them work. Our 3DS is now powerful enough to cram so much more information in than before, which is fantastic. Before when there was a limited amount of memory in the system in old games, designers made things work as best as they could, but it also inspired a lot of gamers to be more creative and often times handmade their own notes, maps, etc with critical thinking.   One of the biggest complaints I remember about MM was how confusing it was when it came to side quests. It's meant to be an exploration game where you spend hours wandering around, talking to people and piecing together the world. Those who did remember it fondly. Unfortunately, many of those people including myself now don't have time to spend hours at a time on gaming. (which really bites. I have a huge backlog of games I'd like to play)   Video games have only been around since the 70's and really started gaining progress in the 80s, just over 20 years. That's a really short amount of time. There's nothing wrong with the people, games are just much more mainstream with a larger target audience and capable of doing so much more than before. To me, it's a normal evolution of gaming and gamers as they adjust with each other.  I didn't realize I wrote so much. I just love and am fascinated by video games :)"
truezelda,32u2rg,MarvinGarbanzo,2,Thu Apr 16 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"The one change that really bothered for some reason is that when you turn on the 3ds version you will basically never see the dawn of the first day text right away.

What don't you like about how Zora Link swims?   I actually enjoyed how MM3DS was put together over OOT3DS.

This signifies that the bow has become critical to this Hero's combat as an equal to the sword and shield.  You will always have access to a bow.  This could also lead into the hypothesis some people have that the Hero's usable inventory in this game will be much smaller (possibly requiring a pick-and-choose custom loadout system).   Types of Arrows   As noted: regular, bomb, and magitech.  I do not think they have anything to do with timeshift stone - the Hero is able to perform bullet time without them in the demo, and there is otherwise nothing about it that signifies timeshift except that it's blue.  I think they'll simply be special arrows cobbled together by the Hero or one of his allies made out of old robotic parts found around the land.  It could be that these arrows are one of the few guaranteed weapons against some of those robotic enemies.  I also don't think 100 arrows was there for any purpose except to avoid running out in the demo.  We will probably start with a small quiver as usual.  I expect we'll see normal, fire, ice, bomb, light, and magitech arrows in this game.

truezelda,32llyb,CaptainFalconProblem,5,Tue Apr 14 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"I thought the glowy blue arrowhead was the bomb arrow, that it was just showing us more clearly that it was high-tech."
truezelda,32llyb,SvenHudson,3,Tue Apr 14 23:00:58 2015 UTC,"Nope. If you look closely at the first trailer, you can see the bomb arrows have a much more distinct design than the mechanical light arrow and are also ignited prior to being fired."
truezelda,32llyb,reallybigzeldafan,5,Wed Apr 15 06:14:40 2015 UTC,"as for me, I expect fire and ice arrows to return, but I am unsure about the light arrow."
truezelda,32llyb,captainth,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"I think we'll definitely see some form of the fire and ice arrows. Iirc we've seen no evidence of Link using magic in this game. Magi-tech seems to be a big thing simply as a way of explaining the tech in general, but I don't think we've seen magic at all yet (correct me if I'm wrong) so perhaps we'll see fire/ice arrows that have some sort of techno-explanation."
truezelda,32llyb,Enhasiac,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"well we did see a green bar under links hearts in the game-play video, so I think magic may have a role (that or its s stamina system like SS).  Edit: grammar"
truezelda,32llyb,Phoxxent,3,Wed Apr 15 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"Not so much a type of arrow, but I would like a bow of infinite arrows that essentially fires off magic missiles."

truezelda,32llyb,Phoxxent,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:27:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, really? I can fire off arrow after arrow with no worries of running out of anything? Yes, ALBW has no limit on the technical number, but it does limit speed of use, which is fine for the rod items, but totally impractical for items like the bow, bombs, hookshot, or boomerang. I cannot just sit up on my perch and send arrow after arrow flying to down a horde of enemies before they reach a certain point. It's also not like I'm asking to never have a limit on arrows. This sort of thing would obviously be an end-game bonus item from a side-dungeon, like the magic cape or cane of byrna in ALttP."
truezelda,32llyb,LowPatrol,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"IMO, the large open world and long draw distance that Nintendo seems to be going for will open up lots of new uses for the bow.  I think there's a good chance that the bow will see upgrades throughout the game, either through a system similar to the one in Skyward Sword or in a way similar to how the sword is normally treated.  One way or another, I expect the return of the Hawkeye (from Twilight Princess) or something very like it.  I really hope that Nintendo draws some inspiration from the moblin village section of TP (I'm blanking on the village's name right now, but the part where you went in and sniped a bunch of moblins hanging out in an abandoned town).  That was one of the highlights of TP for me and definitely one of the most fun and unique parts of any Zelda.  I would much rather see three or four sections like that in the place of, say, the parts of TP and SS where you're running around an area collecting tears or musical notes or whatever.  What I'm hoping for most is that the bow's utility grows but that its use doesn't become mandatory in very many sections of the game.  The open world/large scale concept is most exciting to me because it seems like Nintendo wants it to enable a variety of play styles and methods of moving through different areas.  It would be awesome if the bow gave Link a whole lot of options for dispatching enemies and solving puzzles without being shoehorned in just because they decided to make the bow a bigger deal."
truezelda,32llyb,FrozenGamers,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:59:51 2015 UTC,The weird blue arrows look like they are forming a blade on the end. Like a lightsaber?
truezelda,32llyb,souffle-etc,0,Wed Apr 22 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the magic blue arrow we saw at E3 will come about around the midway point in the game, similar to becoming freely able to transform into a wolf at will in Twilight Princess.  Why do I think this? 1. We were told the E3 footage features actual gameplay. 2. It would be outlandish to assume that we have to sit through such a lengthy (albeit gorgeous) activation process each time we want to use the magic arrow(s). I'm guessing that the E3 footage is of the first time the magic arrows are used, so it's probably a pretty big point in the game. That wobbly little waddle monster is probably something we can expect to encounter a few times before being able to actually fight it off and defeat it."

truezelda,31waju,TeekTheReddit,22,Wed Apr 8 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"At least 2017?  They're not even revealing it until E3 2016.  Consoles don't come out that quickly.  I guarantee we won't see it until 2018 at the earliest.  They only revealed that it exists to stop people from headlining: ""NINTENDO GOES MOBILE PHONES, CONSOLES R DED""."
truezelda,31waju,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Apr 8 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. 2017 would give the WiiU a 5 year cycle, most Nintendo consoles have had that cycle and if sales with the WiiU dont pick up then I see no issue with Nintendo putting it out in 2017.  We also don't know what they mean when they say they wont talk about it until 2016. That could be an E3 reveal similar to the WiiU E3 2011 reveal for all we know"

truezelda,31waju,watties12,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:23:05 2015 UTC,"XBone and PS4 came out pretty quickly. Within that same year. It's better to announce and release quick than announce and let the hype die off, at least for established things.   After announcing the Wii U in 2011 it came out in 2012. Now, it had a bit of a different push, as it was shown at E3 in 2011, and I don't thing NX will be. Just worth nothing.   I really don't think it's that unfathomable it releases next year. Zelda was a big launch title for them for the Wii, and the Wii U really didn't have that much on launch which hurt it. Although it'll be impossible to find official sources now, if memory serves they initially said Twilight Princess wouldn't be coming out for the ""Revolution"" and we know how that eventually turned out."

truezelda,31waju,zacattack101,26,Wed Apr 8 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's even early for that. Even if Zelda U is going to be late 2016 (and I think it will be a bit earlier in the year), the Wii U will only be four years old by then. I know it's not doing too well, but it probably has a bit more life in it than that."
truezelda,31waju,hprshredder,2,Wed Apr 8 18:32:15 2015 UTC,Well lets for arguement sake speculate a holiday 2017 release of NX. Skyward Sword was late 2011 then WiiU late 2012. I also think Zelda is Nintendo's March or May game but it still could slip to the holiday.   You gotta remember this is by far the biggest game Nintendo has ever made. They know the size of the world is gonna have to at least approach Skyrim or Witcher 3 in scale.
truezelda,31waju,snapcatt,2,Thu Apr 9 02:56:02 2015 UTC,I'm telling you now that it won't even come close. I dont even want that in a zelda game anyway. Having such open spaces means they need to be filled with something or else it becomes dry. Twilight *Princess had this issue a lot.
truezelda,31waju,aerandir92,8,Thu Apr 9 12:18:46 2015 UTC,"Im surprised by these comments. I'm pretty sure it's coming to the NX and the NX is actually coming out late 2016 or early 2017 at the latest. Keep in mind this is speculation, but I don't think it's that far-fetched. All this is based off of the belief that the NX will be an actual console, and not the next portable.  NX will likely support the gamepad seeing as backwards compatibility seems to be important for Nintendo. The Wii U is a financial failure. I own one, but only 9-10 million other people do. They're getting blown out at this point. They need something new and something fast. Why would you release your most ambitios and expensive project ever on your least successful console of all time? It won't boost the sales that much. Most people including myself that were planning on picking it up already own the console.  I think they'll still release it on the Wii U, but at this point I'd go as far as to say it would be foolish to not move on. By 2016 it'll be 4 years since the Wii U launch. The GameCube only lasted 5 years, and the sales of that system (also considered to be a failure) were more than double that of the Wii U at this point in it's life span.  Think of it this way as well: What would you do? Try to bolster a dying system already on it's way out? Or get back on the right track by releasing a fucking powerhouse with a blockbuster launch title? We also know Retro is working on another game. I'm betting it's Metroid, and I'm betting it's not for the Wii U, but the NX. If anything could get Nintendo up to snuff and even ahead of Microsoft and Sony, it would be a brand new powerhouse of a system with an open world Zelda and new Metroid as launch titles. Add a 3D Mario to the mix and that shit will sell itself. A proper 3D Mario too that feels more like an adventure.  Imagine Zelda Wii U but on the NX running on a revamped gamepad at 60 fps. ALBW looks fucking gorgeous at 60.   Now let's consider the fact that Nintendo Mobile, the NX, Zelda Wii U's delay, and Zelda's E3 absence paired with a statement from Nintendo that E3 2015 will exclusively focus on 2015 games and nothing else all were announced together within a two week span. Why do you think they aren't showing anything from 2016? They focused on 2015 last year! It might be because they're shifting gears. They've given us some great games for Wii U, but at this point it's the next Dreamcast.   Nintendo has said before when they release a console their hardware department immediately begins thinking about the next system. This time the process needs to be accelerated. In Miyamoto's own words regarding the Wii U ""The numbers have never been this bad."" The ""new possibilities"" Aunuma mentioned in his announcement were likely the realization that Zelda for Wii U would look, feel, and play better if if were Zelda for NX. The hardware department likely experimented running a prototype and I'll bet when Aunuma saw how much better it looked he wanted all the hard work of his team to go towards this next console and not the Wii U. This game needs to be played by as many people as possible. If I were developing this game, I would want the best for it. I would want to make it ""the best Zelda game possible,"" as Aunuma said himself. The reality is that game is beyond the Wii U. It would be better on a more powerful system and while I am heartbroken about the delay and it seemed to stir more anger in me than most fans, I would rather them take the extra time to put the game on a system actually worthy of such an ambitious project instead of constraining themselves to work with hardware comparable to a console that's a decade old.  Also, I'm on my phone so I apologize for the (likely) many typos."
truezelda,31waju,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  For me, the real kicker is that there is no playable demo at E3.  I can understand a delay, but there's nothing to show?  It seems like a very strange decision, and the only reason I can think of for that to happen is if they're starting over from scratch to make this mostly NX based.  I also don't think it will be released in 2016, for the same reason."
truezelda,31waju,aerandir92,0,Fri Apr 17 10:03:21 2015 UTC,"Just some points:     They said we wouldn't get more information about NX until next year. If it releases next year or early 2017, that is an unusual short time between full announcement and release, but they might test out a new tactic.   With the console being out so fast I have trouble seeing the real point of it really. It will be 3 years ahead of PS4 and Xbone yes, but that seems a bit too little. 4 years though could be enough to get a real jump in power over them. There is no doubt that the NX will priorities power more than Wii and Wii U did, they got really punished for the lack of power (and bad online I guess) on the Wii U with one third party after another ditching them. They need it.   Focusing on 2015 games on E3 don't have to mean that much. It can only mean that they feel the 2015 games yet to come when E3 is here has such a big potential that they just won't to push them as they are close to release. Then we'll get a direct in the autumn that gives us good glimps of 2016, maybe even Zelda U.     If Zelda U is moving over to NX, then they should just say it, this delay without anything close to hinting at a date (which everyone seems to assume means 1 year delay), is much worse than just saying ""it will come to the NX"". That will hurt Wii U sales yes, but it will remove angry customers that bought a Wii U primarily because of Zelda U, but they saw there was some other fun games they could have fun with while they were waiting.    Personally I do hope they push it over to NX so that they can take the huge world even further (because more power), but I also feel that the right thing for them to do is release it for both, where NX just gets better graphics, resolution, fps, etc. With this big world they are making it must be hard to make it run just 1080p30, 1080p60 is probably something they gave up immediately. A NX version that runs at 1080p60, or maybe even 1440p60 would be very nice, and could really help jump start NX. 2160p30 just won't work. If it does, there should be an option between 1440p60 and 2160p30. Options are something consoles need to learn. We have seen loads if this with games for PS4 and Xbone, GTA V and The Last of Us as good examples. Both were at the end of console life cycle, and both got an upgraded release a year or so after their original release.   Also I think it will be fully backwards compatible, and also may be a handheld and a game system, sort of in the way the Wii U works only that the ""tablet controller"" will have it's own real power so it can run independently of NX. Also 3DS' would most likely work as controllers. etc. But that's another discussion    If they are going to wait for NX, I hope they can give us another HD release of an earlier game. Twilight Princess is a good choice (Skyward Sword should not get a HD update before NX, that's way to early). Too bad Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask both has had a re-release already for the 3DS, as they would have been great on Wii U in HD. Way to crazy to give them console re-release for some generations now."
truezelda,31waju,aerandir92,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:47:51 2015 UTC,another HD release of an earlier game   Please no more.
truezelda,31waju,Serbaayuu,2,Sat Apr 11 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"Heh, I can see why you say that, but I just want every good game to look as beautiful as possible, therefor I love re-releases with better graphics. Though many of them don't do it as thoroughly as they could. Nintendo has been better at this than others actually.    An example is FFX/X-2 HD. They got great bump in resolution, and graphics effects, but player models, textures and animations really didn't get much attention (atleast they weren't as good as they could have been, far from)"
truezelda,31waju,NotEthosLab,5,Sat Apr 11 21:02:11 2015 UTC,"For that to be true the game must be delayed untill 2017 at least, and that really doesn't make much sense since their original plan was late this year. Although I have wondered if it could be necessary, as in the new features they're working on might make the game to heavy for Wii U."
truezelda,31waju,Serbaayuu,4,Wed Apr 8 18:37:48 2015 UTC,Absolutely not.  The NX is not going to be seen anytime soon.  Zelda U was already planned to release this year - they didn't delay it for well over 12 months just to add cross-compatibility.  When was the last time you saw a console announced at an E3 and then come out <6 months later?
truezelda,31waju,NotEthosLab,2,Wed Apr 8 20:06:57 2015 UTC,Xbox One and PS4 both came out less than 6 months after their announcements.

Plus it was no secret when the hardware was coming out from the start of that year, we knew those consoles were coming. The fact that Nintendo is being more coy about their console, that it was annouced alongside there smartphone plan just to reassure everyone Nintendo is still making hardware, and that a 4 year console cycle has never happened while 5 year console cycles are extremely common convinces me that this is a holiday 2017 product."

truezelda,31waju,MegaMissingno,2,Wed Apr 8 19:15:49 2015 UTC,Absolutely not for the following reasons.   Zelda U 2016 NX 2017-18   I am 99% sure that Zelda U will release in 2016. I was kind of surprised when they first gave it a 2015 release date considering 2016 would be the 30th anniversary of TLoZ release in Japan. From the very beginning I suspected that they would push its release simply to coincide with the 30th anniversary.   Nintendo said they won't even talk about the NX until 2016. Which in my opinion means the NX won't release until 2017 or 2018. That is a 1 to 2 year gap which in my opinion is too long for a dual platform release.
truezelda,31waju,TheFightFan,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"It's in the realm of possibility. I remember being pretty disappointed by how many times TP was delayed.

And then suddenly it was on the Wii."

It's happened waaaayyy too many times. They even did it in Hyrule Warriors!  It wouldn't be so annoying if the initial villain wasn't usually a good character themselves. Like, Zant (up until his end-game tantrum) was a super cool villain, but whoops, nope, he's just the cover for the REAL villain and we'll just end Zant's story right here!

truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Apr 8 03:37:58 2015 UTC,And his three stage boss fight that lasted an hour+ was pretty epic as well (probably one of my favourites). E:grammar
truezelda,31scum,Enhasiac,8,Wed Apr 15 17:29:59 2015 UTC,Zant was a fantastic villain until they unmasked him and revealed him as a slapstick comedic relief boss fight. It completely removed the buildup and creepiness of his character up to that point. Nintendo really fucked him up good.
truezelda,31scum,IThoughtThisWasDigg,27,Wed Apr 8 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"The reveal was what made his character make any kind of sense. If you actually look at his actions under the impression that he's an unflappable badass evil overlord, they don't make sense.  If he's so heartless then why spare the lives of Midna and Zelda who he has nothing to gain from? If he's not intimidated by the old magics then why the sudden display of power once you got them? How, in the span of minutes, does it make sense to go from threatening Midna to hitting on her to torturing her in someone whose actions are so cold and calculated? Why show up in person to resurrect Stallord and then teleport away and let it do the work if you're strong enough to fight them yourself?  But once you find out that he's an insecure wreck, suddenly everything falls into place. He spares Midna and Zelda because he lacks conviction. He's TERRIFIED of the Fused Shadows. He wants Midna and has trouble deciding whether he wants to be a friend or an enemy. He has zero faith in his ability to fight Link and Midna so he takes an opportunity to put more opposition in front of them with Stallord and then runs away like the little bitch he is.  Zant is a punk who had the power of a god fall into his lap and so he starts acting like he thinks cool powerful guys are supposed to be; he tries to be strong and mysterious and scary but it's all in his appearance and his actions betray his demeanor.  And you think this is WORSE writing than ""he is a guy who is strong and evil, the end""?"
truezelda,31scum,SvenHudson,13,Wed Apr 8 07:37:38 2015 UTC,"I love Zant.  If you think he's slapstick, you're missing the tragedy."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,4,Wed Apr 8 02:13:07 2015 UTC,"traditional Ganondorf would be my pick as well.  no side villians, just Link and Ganon in a battle for control over temples and Hyrule throughout the game."

I'm not sure how this would work out, but I would like to see this game taking place after the Great Flood receded, leaving a mostly empty Hyrule waiting to be rediscovered.

So if this new open world is set to Hyrule, how cool would it be if Link was in a race with Gannon to take over dungeons. Just imagine having the choice to complete any dungeon you want.  Not only that, but if you wait to long, Ganon could corrupt a dungeon and change it or make it harder. Maybe some dungeons would give different abilities so your second playthrough of the game might be completely different based on the order of dungeons.  I can't think of all the mechanics right now, but that could allow for some serious replay value as well as a ceiling for so many cool ways to do the dungeons/items/progression.  or maybe im just asking for too much..."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,17,Wed Apr 8 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"If Zelda U is in Hyrule, I would like traditional Ganondorf again.  It's been a very long time since we've seen him - his last entry as the primary antagonist was in 2002 with Wind Waker (he may be in Twilight Princess but Zant is certainly the villain there).  If the game takes place in New Hyrule, I want to see a brand new Demise incarnation get set up to be that land's version of Ganondorf - that is, someone who keeps coming back over and over again.  Ganon is dead and buried under the ocean with the Master Sword and the rest of Hyrule, and should stay dead.  The Fallen Timeline has Beast Ganon, the Child Timeline has Human Ganondorf, so let's get alternate-Demise in the Adult.  Even better if New Hyrule doesn't utilize the Triforce at all.  The new Demise incarnation wouldn't be completely like Ganon, he wouldn't rely entirely on power, he might even be cool and charismatic (not flamboyant).  I want to see a witty primary villain, someone who worms his way into the Royal Family's graces and turns their council against them to take the throne.  Or someone who actually has a loyal army of zealous comrades (actual PEOPLE who LIKE HIM) behind him trying to conquer Hyrule.  None of that really fits Ganon, but it could fit a new villain, and it'd be so cool."
truezelda,31scum,bacloldrum,4,Tue Apr 7 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of a new Demise incarnation.  I thought that would be cool but your idea for it far surpassed anything I thought it could be haha.  I would love to see a villain with some character.  Other than Ghirahim who was mostly annoying, we really haven't seen that all others have mostly been just a scary bad guy."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Apr 7 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"Malladus was boring, but I think he was probably built in the early stages of the Demise backstory - they probably had Demise as the core of the series in mind while making Spirit Tracks, but not totally fleshed out.  So they gave us a Ganon-esque beast that matches up with Demise's Curse.  Hopefully they don't bring Ganon back, at least.  I'd rather see Villains of the Week in New Hyrule forever than have him back in all 3 timelines."
truezelda,31scum,Admiral_obvious13,2,Tue Apr 7 22:41:01 2015 UTC,(he may be in Twilight Princess but Zant is certainly the villain there).   I wouldn't say that.  Zant would never have been able to curse Midna and invade Hyrule without Ganondorf's direct intervention.
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:55:26 2015 UTC,"No, not direct.  Zant is still the driving force behind all of that.  Ganon is just a power boost with some vague motive letting Zant do whatever he wants."
truezelda,31scum,Admiral_obvious13,3,Wed Apr 8 11:12:36 2015 UTC,"No, Ganon is the driving force behind Zant doing everything.  Ganon chose Zant because he knew he would do what he wants him to do.  And there's really no way of knowing what degree of control Ganon had over him.  He may have been able to communicate with him the whole time, manipulating him.  Similar to the way he possesses Zelda."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"But Zant wants all the things that happen.  Zant wants control of the Twilight Realm.  Zant wants to coat Hyrule in twilight.  Zant wants the Fused Shadow.  Presumably, Ganondorf's goal by using Zant is to eventually conquer Hyrule - but we never learn this.  We can assume it, because Ganondorf is evil and does evil things, but as far as I am concerned, Ganondorf's primary motivation is to find a really nice chair, because he only gets off of it when Link finally storms the castle.   And there's really no way of knowing what degree of control Ganon had over him.   Actually, it's pretty clear that, while Zant was being emotionally manipulated to be Ganon's puppet, Ganon and Zant shared a symbiotic relationship as partners, since Zant is the one who finally kills Ganondorf in the ending scene."
truezelda,31scum,solaris1990,2,Wed Apr 8 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"Late post but I think it could fit a somewhat younger Ganondorf. He can be imposing yet charismatic. You want a certain kind of aloofness from your main antagonistic but even a small number of scenes could potentially paint him as such.  Mainly it would be a second-hand account: by presenting a vibrant Gerudo culture in it's prime over part of the game they could show him as loved and admired by characters we can empathise with; someone who's seen as ruthless to enemies but loyal and just to his own - that way we could be invested in both 'sides'. Some sort of conflict or war between his people and others would lead to the Demise side kicking in, as he loses his initial warmth and becomes consumed by evil, ruling through fear and trying to conquer through by force.  An open world game such as this one is ideal for showing for a flourishing Gerudo culture, I think. If it isn't done here then I'm worried about whether Ganondorf's story will ever be written. Being a Zelda title the issue with it is how to balance his motivation with not letting the game get too dark or adult-rated which is hard.."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri May 22 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it would fit; Ocarina of Time and Four Swords Adventures (the only two titles to have a ""new"" Ganondorf) both paint the man as being ruthless and hurtful to the people close to him from the start.  You would have to create another new Ganondorf reincarnation, which I am always personally against doing because I don't like the idea of him reincarnating rather than Demise's Hatred."
truezelda,31scum,solaris1990,1 point,Fri May 22 14:24:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't WW Ganondorf the same as the one from OOT? He isn't shown to be unnecessarily cruel in that game (he even wants to spare Link until the KoRL takes the Triforce away from him) and he implies to have initially wanted to conquer Hyrule for the sake of the Gerudo (although in OOT he was clearly prone to the fits of ultimate evil that come with being Demise incarnate).  I was thinking of this Ganondorf but set before that game. I think there's a story that could be told told there. He seems old enough that you could set a game 20 or 30 years prior to the Hero of Time.   I just feel his/the Gerudo's story has to be told in order to justify the events of OOT, although I guess he doesn't necessarily need to be the main antagonist in another game for this to be done."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri May 22 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"he implies to have initially wanted to conquer Hyrule for the sake of the Gerudo   That's the justification of an evil man who has had thousands of years to brood on his own actions.  He conquered Hyrule.  He annihilated it over 7 years.  He turned Castle Town into zombies.  And, you'll note that he did not transplant his Gerudo people into Hyrule, even though there was nobody to oppose him from rebuilding Castle Town for and with them in their own image.  He conquered Hyrule for conquest, power, and greed, and there was zero nobility about it.   He seems old enough that you could set a game 20 or 30 years prior to the Hero of Time.   I don't think that would really fit as a game.  Keep in mind that the game you're proposing would have to end with our Hero dead, Ganondorf alive and well (and before he realized his true powers, so no Ganon allowed), Ganondorf not even opposed by the Royal Family, and in the midst of the bloodiest war in Hyrule's history.   I just feel his/the Gerudo's story has to be told in order to justify the events of OOT   I don't.  Revenge could have been a part of his motive, but it's pretty well-implied that Ganondorf is a product of the Hyrulean Civil War that occurred before Ocarina of Time.  The gorons and zora were forced to pledge allegiance to the Hylians - as were the Gerudo.  Ganondorf opposed this by causing the events of Ocarina of Time.  Before that?  He was a thief, his peoples' king, but not particularly special otherwise."
truezelda,31scum,solaris1990,2,Fri May 22 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"In WW it was shown as less clear-cut than that though, and that was very clearly the directors' choice; Ganondorf could have killed either Link or Zelda in numerous instances but he didn't.   In contrast, what he did in OOT was of coure pure evil and I did indeed notice that he didn't help the Gerudo people. It's at odds with his behaviour in WW though isn't it? I feel that there are two sides of him... the base human Ganondorf and the dark-er side of him that channels Demise/gets corrupted by the TFoP (and which seems to take over the more powerful he becomes). It's the only way in which I can make sense of the variances in his behaviour...  You're right about the second bit. The Hero of Time is implied to be the first Link that Ganondorf faces so an earlier showdown between them doesn't make sense. My bad. A game set in that period when he was a baby or about to be born could do some explaining though (also about the Sheikah; show some love to the under-explored races) as well as easily involving the sort of intelligent antagonist you were talking about (we don't really know what caused or ended that war but it's the perfect situation for someone like that to thrive).  I think it could be done, and it could probably be made into a less black and white game than the typical Zelda with all the contrasting motivations, e.g. the Gerudo 'thieves' probably needed to steal in order to feed themselves. The only issue would be justifying dungeons and so on but I think it could be done."
truezelda,31scum,monty2,5,Fri May 22 17:07:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would love to see a return one of the villains from the Oracle games. I would smile for the next year and a half if Zelda Wii U included either Onix or Veran."

It probably won't happen in this game, but I'd like to see the elements of the triforce expressed in different ways. Perhaps the character associated with power doesn't use it for evil reasons, or the character associated with wisdom is the one who needs to be balanced by the other two, or a variation on that idea.  Something other than the ""courage + wisdom vs power"" formula."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,9,Tue Apr 7 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"I think that particular plot line would be very difficult for Nintendo to muster now that they have established Ganondorf as an incarnation of an ultimate evil.  Not that I don't think that could work at some point.  It would be cool to see Link forced to cooperate with Ganondorf for some reason, though.  Actually, scratch all of that, you know what I would like to see when it comes to making Link and Ganondorf personally interact (because really, that is what that plot line is getting at)?  Have Link and Ganondorf both actively pursuing the same relic.  Quite similar to how Ghirahim was looking for the Gate of Time while Link was adventuring.  Don't just have Ganondorf sit on his tubby arse in the castle the entire game, he can go outside and reach the temple just after Link does, maybe take a different route through it.  You could have a dungeon where the puzzles consist of interfering with Ganondorf's progress while you try to move ahead.  You could even have your work-together moment during the final boss, since if it was just a natural-world monster, both of them would have to slay it to get past.  That would be fucking awesome."
truezelda,31scum,Bookong,4,Wed Apr 8 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"I had to scroll too far down this page to find this comment. My thoughts exactly, in fact they could easily set up another Groose-like rival/friend who actually becomes worthy of possessing the Triforce of Power, perhaps to stop some evil princess (or not! Surprise me, Nintendo) from dominating Hyrule with cunning and manipulation.  More likely than not though, Nintendo would probably never deviate that much from their decades-old tried and true formula. They're certainly known for keeping some of their eldest IPs true to their roots (we like to overlook LoZ's CDi days)"

No one questions when he slides into a role of authority and power. No one but an outcast teenager, who suspects that this so called hero was behind the evil in the first place.   I think that would be awesome. Also, I would like more sword play in boss fights. More duels than fighting massive monsters. Have the bad guy have a following of people who you defeat along the way, instead of just giant bosses. I don't think it should be exclusively one or the other though."

Killing is one method of saving, I understand, but why should it be the only one in the history of Hyrule and its various alternate dimensions? I get you want some kinda climax at the end but need that always be a duel?"
truezelda,31scum,CitizenWolfie,3,Wed Apr 8 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"I really liked TWW's Ganondorf, how it made him into a more fully-fleshed out, sympathetic character. So I'd be down with Zelda U doing something similar.  Barring that, I'd also be down with just straight-up Beast Ganon like the old days. There's something engaging about a story that's simply about a kid overcoming the odds and felling an ancient beast of pure evil. Very classic-hero-story in a way."
truezelda,31scum,WheneverForever,3,Tue Apr 7 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of the others here in that I just want Ganondorf back (Child timeline preferably).  I honestly don't mind if it's just him or if he is the one pulling the strings behind a new villain, I just want him to be the Big Bad.  I had this rough idea in my head for a possible story based on a previous thread regarding Ghirahim being the spirit of the anti-Master Sword:  Hyrule centuries and centuries since the events of TP where the name of Ganondorf has long faded into obscurity, and even longer since anyone had last heard of the demon Demise.  A treasure hunter learns in some hidden tomb of the legend of Demise and is roaming the world in search of riches left over from the Gerudo empire, becomes obsessed and twisted by the memory of Demise, assumes the Ganondorf name and unearths the secret of the anti-Master Sword.  The game would then play out with Link racing against Ganondorf as each other attempts to reforge the respective Anti/Master Swords, eventually leading to the usual duel to save the world."

Considering this might sometime after Skyward Sword and people are starting territories, it would only make sense to me that you would have a multitude of villains not only fighting you but each other as well for power and control.  One could even partner up with you just to give him leverage, reveal his trickery and try to kill you, then end up redeeming themselves by aiding you when another villain tries to conquer you.  I'd love a character who you could never really trust until the end."
truezelda,31scum,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Apr 9 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on where the game is placed within the timeline.  If it's in the adult timeline, then a human-ish villain would work best, maybe even ganondorf himself.   If it's in the child timeline, then Ganondorf would also work, perhaps even moreso than in the adult timeline; skull kid would also make some sense, as he is seen in two games within that timeline.  As for the downfall timeline, Ganondorf of any kind makes little sense, as he has been fused with a being from another world. Perhaps something new, or another villain who has fused with Ganon/Yuuga."

truezelda,31scum,andydude44,0,Tue Apr 7 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, let me rephrase that: Ganon has been overused as a villain in the downfall timeline, especially considering that he has been killed, resurrected, and killed again more times than I care to remember.  As for skull kid, well, he HAS shown to get into mischief that results in evil/preventing good. He is also probably immortal, so he could be a minor villain like in Majora's Mask: he finds something evil, becomes possessed by it, and is eventually discarded when he is of no further use."

""A servant of the true villain"" is basically what he really is, but I don't want to see it again. It should have just been left with Zant.  An idea I have for a villain is a Gerudo man, but not Ganondorf, someone new, who becomes possessed by the spirit of Demise and usurps the throne. Link knew him very well and was a close friend before this. This man isn't evil, he's just possessed, and Link has to somehow remove the evil from him.

Volga for example I think could make for an epic boss fight.   I also wouldn't mind seeing dark link as a villain.

It would be quite interesting if perhaps they were actually past incarnations of Link that have been corrupted somehow.   Then you could have it that when he defeats a corrupted Link that the Link you play as gains some sort of ability or item heavily associated with that Link that helps them progress. For example, you defeat the evil incarnation of OOT Link and you get the ocarina of time, you defeat the four swords incarnation(s) of link and you get the ability to split into multiple Links etc."

Example : In skyward sword you use the triforce to destroy the imprisoned, and then fight Demise yourself, because SS Link's wish was used up.    It seems Ganon wished for the power to rule the world or wished to rule everything, but by sealing off the sacred realm and Hyrule, ""everything"" came to only include everything within the sacred realm."

For example, in Skyward Sword they use the Triforce to wish Demise out of existence but that takes the form of dropping an island on top of his head rather than disappearing in a puff of smoke.  So I think what it does is set events in motion that will lead to your wish coming true. In the case you cite I suspect it is the reason that there were so many portals between the Light World and Dark World, that it was gradually enabling him to invade."
truezelda,31pxdn,SvenHudson,9,Tue Apr 7 09:32:04 2015 UTC,This is also supported by the Triforce completing the Great Flood at the end of Wind Waker.  And the Lorulean Triforce being destroyed slowly but surely causing their world to disintegrate.

truezelda,31pxdn,Dismas423,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"I think it makes sense to think of the Triforce Pieces as manifestations of the Golden Goddesses' powers. In a sense, anyone who possesses the power, wisdom, and courage to even possess the Triforce has ""earned"" an audience with the Goddesses. Perhaps it isn't so much that the Triforce itself grants the wish, but that the possession of the Triforce ensures that the wish is heard.  It would also make sense in a way, since having one of the three Triforce-pieces seems as if it grants its owner a ""blessing"" from the associated Goddess."

Ganon was building up his power here so he could conquer the Light World and make his wish come completely true.   As has been pointed out, the Triforce apparently only grants one wish per user. Ganon used his wish when he gained the complete Triforce. But because he was almost immediately sealed away, and later the entire Dark World was sealed, he never had the opportunity to fully realize his wish. If his plan to escape the Dark World in ALttP had succeeded, his wish likely would have been completed, and Ganon would rule both Light and Dark Worlds."

In OoT I think there is one in Link's treehouse and one in the Temple of Time.  The gossips stones also only appear in MM/OoT, but also in the originals.

If they are in fact Termanian Sheikah, and they so openly defied the goddesses in Ikana Canyon, perhaps that's also evidence that the dark interlopers of Hyrule were composed of rebel Sheikah,as each Termanian culture seems to parallel its Hyrulian counterpart."

truezelda,31iuzv,Dismas423,2,Mon Apr 6 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. Not to mention the association with the composer brothers and the tendency to build temples that mess with/defy reality, where falling into the void is the biggest danger present.

truezelda,31iuzv,PianoMastR64,11,Mon Apr 6 00:24:26 2015 UTC,"The ""theory"" isn't based on any evidence and is directly contradicted by other games in the series. Either one of those alone would be pretty damning and it has both going against it.  I could say that Link died in Twilight Princess when the King Bulblin bonked him on the head in Ordon Village, that he didn't get caught when fell off the cliff at the beginning of Wind Waker, that he died when he fell down the secret entrance to Hyrule Castle in Link to the Past, that he died when the train derailed at the beginning of Spirit Tracks, that he died when Zelda pushed him off the island at the beginning of Skyward Sword.  It's all the same thing and it's all meaningless because none of it is actually indicated. It's the kind of bullshit that shallow people call deep.   It cheapens the story, too. ""None of this actually happened, none of this actually mattered, none of this means anything."" And with Majora's Mask in particular, it negates the actual themes of the game. Link fought tooth and nail against a threat that he had no control over because everybody else was either denying it or submitting to it. He experienced it over and over, the futility being constantly hammered into his head and seeing his actions go undone but he pushed ahead anyways because he had to. He did this purely because it was the right thing to do, garnering zero recognition for his actions and frequently being mistaken for other people. And despite the stakes he still took the time to help people in need on an individual level which granted him masks which symbolized these small victories and made him metaphorically stronger for taking the time to do them which culminates in him becoming like a god at the end of the game, making mincemeat of the final boss as a reward for the hard work and selflessness.  In a story about heroism, about triumph over impossible odds, about reversing and preventing tragedy, making it all imagined makes it all meaningless. Link did not learn to give up, to let nature take its course, he learned to fight the inevitable using every resource at his disposal, he learned to desperately cling to survival.   If this were a game where the Moon could not be stopped and the story was resolved by him giving into it, then it would make sense as a metaphor for his death. If he didn't fix the problems of the afflicted regions and remove the sources of grief, then it would make sense that they represent him going through the stages of grief.  All of this thematic dissonance could be resolved by saying it's a metaphor for him almost dying, that it was a dream he had on death's door but that he recovered against all odds. But you people don't even have the sense to do that. And far greater a sin is the complete and utter lack of supporting evidence combined with the presence evidence which outright disproves it.   If you subscribe to this theory then you obviously don't give a shit about what's right, about what makes sense, about what isn't completely fucking hackneyed. You just want the most shocking possible answer to be true. You want everybody else to be wrong but without you having to put in the effort to find something they're actually wrong about.

It puts me in a certain mental and emotional state that I love when I imagine death in the way the theory does. I like the idea of experiencing an entire world, essentially just made up in one's head, full of symbolism representative of real life experiences for the purpose of growing as a person. (This is basically what a dream is only more realistic and with more meaning.) I like the idea that Majora's Mask sort of gives me a permission slip to apply that way of imagining to the Zelda universe. That's the place I'm coming from when I talk about the theory.  You have a serious case of projecting some person you have constructed in your own imagination onto me.    You obviously don't give a shit about what's right, about what makes sense, about what isn't completely fucking hackneyed. You just want the most shocking possible answer to be true. You want everybody else to be wrong but without you having to put in the effort to find something they're actually wrong about.    Nope, nope, and nope. You're wrong. Take it from the person who is actually the most qualified to make these statements.  I really like how passionate you are about this though. Thanks for that. People like you are what keep Zelda alive. (Sure millions of mindless consumers can buy zelda games giving Nintendo the money to develop more, but that's not really what I mean.) It's more than I have. Even so, I still love Zelda endlessly.  I literally think more of you as a person for displaying your passion for Zelda, and I'm privileged for it to have been directed at me. Keep doing what you're doing."
truezelda,31iuzv,PianoMastR64,4,Mon Apr 6 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of experiencing an entire world, essentially just made up in one's head, full of symbolism representative of real life experiences for the purpose of growing as a person.    That's a story that's been written many times and the growth it inspires needs to be something that brings the dying person acceptance or else it doesn't make any sense to be occurring in the mind of a dying person. It could be teaching them to accept the inevitable, it could be resolving their emotional baggage. Something along those lines.   You can even see that happening to other characters in the game: Mikau gets to see Lulu again, Darmani gets to say goodbye to the other gorons who look up to him. They have a vision of their problem being fixed and that vision brings them peace. But Link's story is one about struggle and victory, not acceptance and peace; he doesn't find Navi at the bottom of that pit, he just gets more adversity piled on.  This isn't about the concept of the dying dream being stupid, it's about the fact that the concept doesn't apply. When you ignore what the game has to say in favor of what you would like for it to say, then you don't actually care about the game and you misrepresent what the game is in your discussion of it.    I like the idea that Majora's Mask sort of gives me a permission slip to apply that way of imagining to the Zelda universe.   Majora's Mask no more caters to your desire than any other game in the series. If you want a Zelda game to fit into this mold that you desire, you'd be better off fixating on Link's Awakening. It is literally the dream of a hero who is dying, canonically (although he wakes up at the end). It is a story about giving up that which you are attached to and embracing grim reality, giving the dream meaning within the context.  Instead of forcing your ideas on a story they don't mesh with, you should embrace a story that shares your ideas.   You have a serious case of projecting some person you have constructed in your own imagination onto me.   Those assumptions were based on how I've seen other supporters present it.    You obviously don't give a shit about what's right, about what makes sense, about what isn't completely fucking hackneyed.    I stand by that one, though."
truezelda,31iuzv,SvenHudson,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. You'd rather have a discussion that's rooted in hard evidence about what can be reasonably implied as to what the game must be given all of the content. (Something like that anyway) I'd rather have a discussion that explores interesting ideas getting creative with them in my imagination. (Something like that as well) Neither approach is more right than the other. I like that you included that conditional,   When you ignore what the game has to say in favor of what you would like for it to say...   because this is not what I am doing. This would be what I am doing if I were intending to have the kind of discussion you want to have.   Instead of forcing your ideas on a story they don't mesh with, you should embrace a story that shares your ideas   Again, this doesn't apply to me. I'm not trying to force MM to be what it's not to fit my preconceived ideas of what I think it is. I'm using it allow my imagination to have fun and run away with the content and ideas presented by the game. If my goal is what your goal seems to be, which, if my understanding is correct, is to construct theories that match all canonical evidence, then you would be correct. This is not my goal, at least not in this context. My goal is simply to use Zelda to have an experience. Changing MM in my imagination as I desire isn't wrong, it just isn't compliant with formulating a comprehensive theory or even with interpreting a work completely as it is. It's just fun for me, and I'm hoping it will also be fun for someone else who will choose to join me. If this is something the Zelda community is not ok with, then I'm sorry as I didn't know that. So basically I should mesh and mangle stories as much as I see fit.   Those assumptions were based on how I've seen other supporters present it.   Fair enough, but I'm asking you to acknowledge me as a person separate from your assumptions until proven otherwise, or you're arguing with yourself. You got those assumptions wrong, though you were entirely confident enough to state them as fact. Also, you said ""other"" supporters. Are you still assuming I'm also a supporter? If so, then you ignored or didn't understand me when I said this: ""I don't 'subscribe' to the theory, I just like it for what it is."" I don't wish to be included with supporters of any theory unless I state otherwise. I'm sure this was pretty unclear before. Sorry if that was my fault.   I stand by that one, though.   Ok, but I hope you know that you are not qualified to make such a statement. I mean, you can say it all you want, (I'm not qualified to tell you you can't) but you're actually describing a version of me in your own imagination and not me, even if you're correct. When I said ""It puts me in a certain mental and emotional state that I love when I imagine bla bla bla"", I'm not interested in whether what I'm imagining matches what's in the game. However, that's only when I'm in the mood to experience Zelda, or anything else, in that way. It's the way of using my imagination I used to do so naturally as a child, and I love getting in touch with that. Other times I might be interested in the evidence and experiencing the story as is. There's no reason I can't do both. Not giving a shit is a very negative way of looking at it, and it's not my way. I see it as simply choosing a method with which to experience Zelda, and I do this based on what most excites me at a given moment.  It occurs to me that I'm probably very much in the minority here in the way I've decided to experience Zelda, and that you other Zelda fans just might not understand it. That's ok. I'm loving this discussion, btw. It's allowing me to reflect on myself in ways I hadn't considered before. Thank you for that. Also I'm genuinely appreciative that you are taking the time to talk to me instead of clicking the down arrow and leaving it at that."

I don't wish to be included with supporters of any theory unless I state otherwise.   I get that you differentiate between it and canon, which is a step up from most who bring it up, but you do inherently support it by considering it in an unrelated conversation. You can deny intent all you want, it doesn't change your actions.   It occurs to me that I'm probably very much in the minority here in the way I've decided to experience Zelda, and that you other Zelda fans just might not understand it.   Lots of people in this subreddit have alternative interpretations that oppose canon. There are some who disagree with the timeline, saying that they see the series as a singular story being retold in different ways.

truezelda,31iuzv,SvenHudson,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:15:08 2015 UTC,"Um, can you quote me on saying ""logic does not exist""? I don't recall saying that. Were you referring to when I said ""it doesn't necessarily have to make sense logically""? When I said that, I meant dreams don't necessarily need to make sense logically, and they don't. Were you referring to when I said ""I don't know if I'm entirely ok with giving up the necessity of logic, but it makes things interesting in its own way""? You didn't properly quote me, so I don't know what you're saying. I'll try my best to respond though. I don't know what definition of imagination you're using, but the one I'm using has nothing to do with logic. A google search for ""imagination"" returns this: ""the faculty or action of forming new ideas, or images or concepts of external objects not present to the senses."" This is the definition I'm using. ""Finding a reason for the stones to exist"" is called reasoning, not imagining.   What you did was take any topic at all about Majora's Mask and shoehorn the Link is Dead theory into a conversation to which it does not contribute.   You're making assumptions again about what I'm doing, and once again, you're wrong. I didn't take any topic at all just to shoehorn a theory. That's not why I brought it up, and I don't know what caused you to think that. You still confusing me with the person in your head.   And you're allowed to do that but it's not the topic of discussion here.    I responded to a comment, not OP's post. If I intended to offer this as a canonical explanation I would have done the latter. Also, there's nothing wrong with taking a discussion slightly off-topic. If I said something completely unrelated and unnecessary, then I would understand, but I didn't. I was trying to have a discussion. It didn't happen to be a discussion you wanted to have.   flagrantly opposed to the canon   I might be nitpicking a little here, but you guys should be more patient with others. No matter how many times you see mention of the Link is Dead theory, just calmly and patiently explain how it's not an applicable theory. You know how many time's I've heard that people don't like that theory before today? Zero. I don't care how many times You have to explain it. It's not like I'm the same person constantly badgering you about it under different usernames. Please lighten up.   you do inherently support it by considering it in an unrelated conversation.   Sigh... no. I'm not considering it. I realize there's no way for you to have known that when I first brought it up, but you should know this by now. Even if I were considering it, that doesn't mean I support it. It just means I'm considering it. Why the unnecessary conflation? Consider - think carefully about (something), typically before making a decision. Support - to maintain or advocate (a theory, principle, etc.).    You can deny intent all you want, it doesn't change your actions.   I don't understand your logic here. There's action without intent, and there's action with intent. My action was with intent. My intent was clearly stated. Why the separation between my actions and my intent? Are you saying I'm being dishonest?   it doesn't apply to those discussions.   It didn't apply to the direction you wanted to take the discussion. It did apply to the direction I wanted to take it. I didn't know you don't like to diverge from the original topic.

Simply silent observers of truth that only respond when wearing the Mask of Truth.   The Sheikah originated in Termina (or in Hyrule) and then fled to the counterpart parallel dimension. In the Bottom of the Well in OoT, we see a mural/facade which reads ""Here is gathered Hyrule's bloody history of greed and hatred."" Perhaps there was some kind of persecution of the Sheikah or executed by the Sheikah, and they fled to avoid the consequences.   There was another race like the Garo, for example, which was devoted to serving the ruling power of Termina and the Gossip Stones are the leftover artifacts. There are many indications of a previous occult following that can be seen in the Stone Tower Temple; it's not impossible that there was a similar, parallel tribe but we just don't see them in MM."

Either way...   does Zelda in Ocarina of Time die?   No one knows. She doesn't need to die, as evidenced by Wind Waker.   In the last battle with Ganon?   We have no word of what happens in the downfall branch. Only that Ganon 'defeats' Link and obtains the entire triforce. How that exactly happens is unexplained.   I mean, Ganondorf/Ganon takes the Triforce of hers (Wisdom), and Link's Triforce...   We can assume that happened, yes.   and considering Link is dead and he took the Triforce afterwards...   Nowhere is it confirmed that link is 'dead'. Merely 'defeated'.   What do you guys think?   Link and Zelda most likely had similar fates in the downfall branch. That is, if we assume they each had a piece of the triforce. Ganondorf may have simply obtained the triforce without splitting it.  Either way, refer to wind waker. Neither Link nor Zelda actually need to die for the loss to take place."

She therefore must have survived Link's battle with Ganondorf. Further, the Hyrulean Royal Family still exists in ALttP. Since Zelda is the only known living member of the Royal Family at the end of OoT, she must have survived the encounter with Ganon and had descendants."

(For what it's worth, there aren't really any spoilers here, as the three timelines are a well established part of the lore.)  Edit: The point that Ganon was sealed away by the seven sages, one of whom was Zelda, is a good one. I still have a hard time seeing how she could have possibly survived, at least if the circumstances in which Link fought Ganon were at all similar to those of Ocarina of Time. Maybe the sages who sealed Ganon away in the failure timeline were not the original ones?"

The bank would be like a giant, multi-pocketed wallet capable of holding 5,000 rupees per individual.    To add to the discussion about how the bank operates, here's my take: Rupees in your wallet are lost when you use the Song of Time. Rupees in the bank are there forever (unless withdrawn). In real life, banks pretty much generate currency when they create debt, so I'd go so far as to say banks in Termina have the ability to generate that magical energy in the form of rupees. Both your wallet and the bank lose rupees when you travel back in time, but your stamp is always updated with the current amount of rupees in your account. When you go to deposit or withdraw, the rupee amount is magically generated."

It was very funny and we concluded that Rupees spontaneously appear at the surface, at the same time a rupoor of the same value appears but the rupoor stays in the ground. This would explain why rupees are found everywhere, but also why such a thing as a rupoor exists. How could grabbing a thing lower the amount of things you have? Well, since rupoors are anti-rupees, once you grab one, it combines with a rupee and they cancel each other out. So you can't just throw them away or not grab them. Anyway..."

truezelda,31g7xo,Iron-Knuckle,2,Sat Apr 4 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time's child pacing is also much much different from the adult pacing. I can't really explain it in detail without spoiling it for you, but generally speaking, over world travel is much faster due to some new songs you get, and the requirements to enter or beat dungeons are more useful and straightforward. As a small example you will see soon, the only item you need to get to enter the Forest temple is the Hookshot, which requires you talk to one NPC and beat a very easy minigame. The only other cutscene you see before entering the temple is getting a song. A song that is actually useful."
truezelda,31g7xo,solaris1990,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"That's nice. Thanks for telling. I actually beat a Link To The Past and I know it's after Ocarina of Time, so I know the main events in it, but I don't know anything else in detail (like the new songs, dungeons, puzzles, and dungeon bosses).  Seriously, most of the Zelda games have that plot, I expected it.  But thanks anyway."

truezelda,31g7xo,0oKIRKo0,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"ALBW is definitely faster paced, but OP is right, many Zelda games include these elements that are annoying you. OoT, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword all make you run around and accomplish A, B and sometimes even C before you can enter a temple.   At this stage it kind of feels like that's what you're signing up for if you play a Zelda game."
truezelda,31g7xo,solaris1990,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"I feel SS was by far the worst in this regard (maybe MM but it's that game's theme to be heavy on side-quests), I'm only two dungeons in but already getting all those key fragments feels more artificial and annoying than anything else. WW is fine (well triforce quest aside which the Wii U version doesn't have anyway, I think??) and I don't remember much of TP being as pointless as collecting bottles or whatever."
truezelda,31g7xo,keltond95,2,Sun Apr 5 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"The 3D games are much differently paced than the 2D ones. They have a richer, more immersive and interactive world, so you'll find that you're doing a lot more in between dungeons, and interacting more with NPCs, etc. Though they share the same core fundamentals, I would argue that the 2D and 3D games are very different. For example, I like the 3D games because of the world, exploration, and sidequests. I might be alone in this, but I don't really look forward to dungeons. In the 2D games, however, the dungeons are a lot of fun, moreso, in my opinion, than exploration and character interaction."
truezelda,317grd,The14thNoah,4,Thu Apr 2 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"Adding this from another thread:  Except the Roche limit is only valid for large objects which are held together by their own gravitation. The assumption is that the ""Moon"" is an object being held together by it's own gravitation, not simply a huge rock falling.   Consider the tidal force across ""the Moon"" here. The tidal acceleration in this case would be roughly:  T=2GMr/R3  Where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of 'Termina', r is the radius of the moon and R is the distance from the centre of 'Termina'. To put it another way:  T=A×r/R3, where A=2GM  Here if 'Termina' is the same as Earth in size and mass that would give:  A=7.96×1014 m3 . s-2  If we take R to be just above the surface of 'Termina' it would be 6.37*106 m, and as such we'd get:  T=r×3.08×10-6 s-2  If 'the Moon' has a radius of 30m as the video suggested, then this is:  T=9.24×10-5 m.s-2 or around 9.42×10-6 g  Which is quite frankly a tiny acceleration. Of course, across as large mass this might mean something, but 'the Moon' doesn't need to be a large mass. At 3.34 kg.m-3 it would only be 378,000 kg, which would only give a force across it of:  T_f = 34.9 N  Which is quite frankly nothing, certainly not enough to break 'the Moon'. Dealing with how much would actually break 'the Moon' is a bit more complex, but that would certainly not be enough.   The video is an interesting way of looking at it, but it does ignore that point. That said, why the moon appears to be dragging rocks from 'Termina' up at the end is another interesting question which this does deal with. Of course, I've always preferred ""it's magic"", but hey..."

Seriously, we have a world in which there are living rock-people, humans that can survive bombs with minimal damage, physics defying magic like a 3D objects becoming 2D and back, etc.. all the time. Why is the moon in MM suddenly such a big : ""I need to find how this could make sense according to our world"" target ?    The moon is a construct of magic, as we see by the fact it disappears as soon as Majora is defeated. Most likely Majora feeds on sadness, despair and other negative emotions (in the same way the Fierce deity mask is said to be : ""All the dreams and hopes of the terminians in one mask"") And used the moon not to destroy Termina itself, but as a way to maximize strive in Termina and especially clock town."

truezelda,316cv6,henryuuk,5,Thu Apr 2 10:03:53 2015 UTC,"I think it is very clearly supposed to be that Ganondorf killed the ancient sages. probably by sending the monsters to each of the temples. Rauru was save inside the chamber of the sages.    Twilight princess has all the sages show up as the same sort of spiritual entity, which is probably how they showed themselves to others in the physical world. We see how easily Ganondorf kills one of them just cause he had the triforce. And Ganondorf probably knew the sages would be an issue if he left them alive. The OoT sages were the incarnations/descendants of the ancient ones. Like how in WW Medli and Makar are.    .  The only remaining question is which of the groups (old or new) are the Alttp sages. IMO : They are the ancient sages, (because I stay true to my theory on the fallen timeline) However, according to the (current) split in the historia timeline, it should be the 'new' sages (which wouldn't make sense with Alttp backstory and the fact the new sages needed the hero+master sword , probably cause they were still inexperienced)"
truezelda,316cv6,Dismas423,2,Thu Apr 2 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think the ALttP Sages are related to the OoT Sages at all. If you read Hyrule Historia closely, there's actually a time gap between OoT and the Imprisoning War. The sealing of Ganon and the sealing of the Dark World are described as two separate events. I think the Seven Sages (Wise Men) from the back story of ALttP, the ones who sealed the Dark World, are unrelated to the OoT Sages who sealed Ganon. This would help explain why the Maidens in ALttP are human, but the Sages in ALBW come from different species. The Maidens are descended from the Wise Men, but the ALBW Sages are descended from the OoT Sages."
truezelda,316cv6,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"See, that's what I mean with that I dislike the Historia on that point though. Cause it doesn't make any sense. So you are telling me Ganon defeated Link and Zelda at his tower, then decided to piss off for a bit, give his triforce back. Gather thieves in an army to assault the sacred realm and then capture it all back.    IMO, the historia should never have retconnec the alttp story when they had several perfect ways to make it all fit together."
truezelda,316cv6,Dismas423,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"I think Ganon had the entire Triforce since OoT. Both Hyrule Historia and the ALttP manual agree that Ganondorf became Ganon after obtaining the Triforce, and that he has been in the Dark World since that time. The ALttP backstory conflates Ganondorf's original infiltration of the Sacred Realm, seen in OoT, with his seizure of the complete Triforce seven years later. Link isn't mentioned in the ALttP backstory because he failed to defeat Ganondorf, so his story was forgotten among the greater events of the war against Ganon. The stories don't match up perfectly, but I think Hyrule Historia, as the more recent document, effectively retcons the ALttP manual."
truezelda,316cv6,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"That doesn't work with the Alttp backstory though, that's what I mean    effectively retcons the ALttP manual.      Which they shouldn't have done, cause it doesn't make sense now. Ganondorf entered the sacred realm with his thieves in order to grab the full triforce. In OoT, he wouldn't have had to do this, cause all pieces were in hyrule. He also wasn't using his thief army cause he had the triforce of power he got through being sneaky. An in alttp, there are humans in the sacred realm that are pretty much his thieves that were stuck inside with him. Which also wouldn't make sense if the split happened during the final fight in OoT."
truezelda,316cv6,Dismas423,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"I think the simplest way to reconcile the ALttP backstory and Hyrule Historia is to say that the backstory is a modified version of the actual events. The way I understand it, the tale of Ganondorf entering the Sacred Realm with his thieves is the same event as Ganondorf entering the Sacred Realm in OoT. The Triforce is still in the Sacred Realm when OoT starts; it doesn't leave until Ganondorf arrives. At the end of Downfall OoT, Ganon and the Triforce are back in the Sacred Realm/Dark World. The ALttP backstory simplified these events by treating Ganon's initial entrance and into the Sacred Realm and his taking up residence there as the same event. As for the thieves in ALttP, they're never stated to be related to Ganondorf. The people of Kakariko seem to remember Blind the Thief, so I think he and the other thieves entered the Dark World long after Ganon."
truezelda,316cv6,jesuswig,3,Thu Apr 2 19:01:59 2015 UTC,I feel the Sages go through reincarnation like The Hero or The Goddess. The sages we see in OoT are the physical embodiment of the Ancient sages.
truezelda,316cv6,Petrichor02,3,Thu Apr 2 14:42:20 2015 UTC,"The two groups seem to be entirely independent of one another. The TP sages have been guarding the Mirror of Twilight since it was created (back when the Triforce was still hidden in the Sacred Realm long before the events of OoT), and they are still alive hundreds/thousands of years later for TP (and Rauru never appeared among them).  It seems like the TP sages were tasked with guarding the Twilight Realm while the OoT sages were tasked with guarding the Sacred Realm."
truezelda,313kz0,Westmang,23,Wed Apr 1 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"Wind Waker, to me, was a different kind of adventure.  It was a bit slower paced.  Especially with the overworld.  I find myself, when playing it, enjoying the ocean travel, but I have to be in the mood for it.  If I just want some fun Zelda action, I typically stay away from Wind Waker.    And really, this overworld isn't all that different from other overworlds.  This one just seems emptier I would argue.  On land, you can always wonder if maybe there's something hidden in the ground, under the tree, etc.  And every once in a while you'll find a secret hole or something.  WW has these, too, but it's just a bit more obvious where they are.  They will either be where the treasure maps send you or on the islands.  It may feel emptier because of that, but compare it to, say, OoT.  WW overworld is huuuuuge compared to that.  And really, I'd say there's a lot more to do.  It's just the illusion that there may be a secret everywhere is broken because obviously there isn't.    As others have said, the dungeons are great and the story is really fun.  And I love the artwork.  I played it on both the original GameCube as well as the Wii U remake and if you have the option, I would recommend playing the WiiU.  The controls, IMO, were much more natural and fluid on the WiiU.    I don't think it ever gets particularly difficult.  It's not a game that I had to really struggle at beating.  But it was fun, and there are some fun puzzles.    But, it's totally not for everyone.  People had these same complaints when the game came out.  I have always loved WW, but I can see how someone wouldn't.  If you're not feeling it, then don't force yourself to play it.  I would say make it to the halfway mark and see how you feel.  If you've played two dungeons already, then you're pretty close.    And if you get bored of the game, just pick a direction you've never been and go discover an island.  Explore the seas."

truezelda,313kz0,NorwegianWood28,8,Wed Apr 1 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"Wind Waker is actually one of my top contenders for ""most bonus content"" in a Zelda game.  It's just more spread out than most."
truezelda,313kz0,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Apr 1 21:48:15 2015 UTC,Most bonus content? i.e sidequests?  Majoras mask has the most by far.  In fact you miss a great deal of the game if you just go through the dungeons in Majoras Mask
truezelda,313kz0,johnnycoxxx,3,Thu Apr 2 12:57:27 2015 UTC,"Right, MM is definitely the top, but WW is in the top few. You have the NPC quests, the sea charts, the platforms, the reefs, etc."

I hate it when people say ""this sucks"" or ""that game's terrible,"" whereas you're asking for help to understand all the hype, and that's awesome. That being said, I would stick with it just a little bit longer. If you're really not feeling it after playing through Forbidden Woods, then maybe put it down and come back to it another day. I had to do that myself with this game. I didn't like it when it came out, so I quit halfway through. Picked it up about ten years later, and now it's one of my favorites.

truezelda,313kz0,Adm5163,2,Thu Apr 2 02:29:50 2015 UTC,I felt the same way on my first play thru. I don't want to spoil anything and I'm not sure how to type on mobile with the little gradient thing...

IMO the 'easy' card is a strange one to pull which keeps being pulled for all zelda games. I find it strange cause : The only 'difficult' zelda games are Zelda I and II All the rest are easy. IMO, you don't play LoZ to be challenged, or atleast I've never thought : ""I want a game to curb-stomp me/force me to become better at the game, better go play a zelda game""    I just love the style, aesthetic, the islands and worlds, the items, the fact this Link has actual emotions, the humor, pretty much everything about the game tbh...

While it wasn't much, it at least made me focus on the combat a little more, rather than siting back and yawning while hitting B."
truezelda,313kz0,henryuuk,0,Wed Apr 1 20:57:10 2015 UTC,Original Windwaker didn't have Hero mode. and Hero mode is not actual difficulty in a meaningful way.

Hero mode is not actual difficulty in a meaningful way.   It's meaningful to me in that it makes me pay attention more, and when I'm focused on something, I tend to 'get into it' more.  It still isn't hard but it requires more attention than 'almost-infinite-health'."
truezelda,313kz0,henryuuk,0,Wed Apr 1 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"Well see, but you can easily just play like that buy simply doing limited heart challenges, or play without getting hit. Only thing Hero mode does is make it so you can't chicken out, but I don't get how people that would really want ""challenge"" to be in the game can't just create their own challenge (when talking about 'fake' challenge boosters like this)"
truezelda,313kz0,malaroo,2,Thu Apr 2 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"I like collecting everything, including heartpieces, and self-imposed challenged obviously feel a lot more arbitrary than a game where you can actually die without creating an artificial limit on how much damage you allow yourself to take.  I don't understand the problem with people who want some degree of challenge.  Difficulty-selection has been a thing since the 80s for this very reason.  I'll take the ""minor difficulty"" over ""practically-infinite health"" any day, and it's definitely a better option than ignoring collectibles or imposing a legitimately fake challenge."
truezelda,313kz0,henryuuk,0,Thu Apr 2 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"Seeking challenge, nothing wrong. Expecting challenge from a series that hasn't been challenging for over a decade ? Seems like a waste of time to me."
truezelda,313kz0,malaroo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:25:34 2015 UTC,The Hero Modes work fine for me.  I see no reason to dismiss their existence if they do what they advertise for the people who want it.
truezelda,313kz0,henryuuk,0,Thu Apr 2 20:27:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, and that's great, have fun. IMO Hero mode adds less challenge then creating your own challenges, which creates infinite amount of the same fake added difficulty.

truezelda,313kz0,malaroo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"It is, at the very least, better than the ""getting hit is meaningless"" option.  It turns the combat from 'mash b until next puzzle' into some degree of actual gameplay.  I could make up challenges all day and have my ass kicked by them, because at the end they are still just made up.  At least this one comes in the form of a 'physical' part of the game."

Once you set your wind direction, you can pretty much let go of the controller. And speaking of wind direction, how is it fun only being able to move in one set direction?   You either a) haven't played this game long enough, as you should know the sea opens up only a few hours into the game, or b) you're not playing Wind Waker HD which speeds up the sailing and lets you go in any direction.

It is kind of weird that the easiness only bothers me with Wind Waker though, and that it doesn't bother me with the other games. I'd say it's more that the puzzles just didn't feel as fun and engaging, so I was just going through the motions. The other games also had more progression - compare the Great Deku Tree to the Spirit Temple - they're leagues apart, but there really wasn't much difference from Dragon Roost all the way to the Wind Temple. They were all pretty similar. Similar size (they're all small dungeons), similar amounts of enemies, similar puzzles, similar difficulty level.   Then there's the art style. I think it's beautiful in a lot of places. I really like Windfall and the Deku Tree area is quite charming, as are the Koroks. But I do think it really highlighted that simple, easy feeling I had through the dungeons. Nothing felt creepy, nothing felt threatening or dangerous, and that really hurt it's effectiveness for me. I just can't feel intimidated by a googly eyed puppet Ganon, and the redeads made me laugh.  I actually really enjoyed sailing except for the one thing you pointed out- changing the wind was annoying, and I just flat out disliked the baton from the start (adding the timing mechanic completely ruined it, especially compared to how much fun I had with the Ocarina). Playing songs in WW always felt like a chore."

truezelda,313kz0,akadros,2,Thu Apr 2 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"What I liked most was the sheer variety and surrealness of the minor islands. The game sends you on one or two really long sea voyages early on, but IIRC there's not much of that. A couple dungeons in, you get the ability to warp to about eight different places, which cuts down on travel time.  That said, it is hurt by a handful of very annoying design flaws. Slow travel time is one (it gets better, but it's still annoying). The conducting mechanic is even more annoying than the ocarina was, because you have to use it more often, especially in the third (fourth?) dungeon. Hauling up sunken treasures was a pain.  It's optional, but the absolute worst was the guy who asks you to bring photographs of characters that he can use to make figurines. The goal is to collect 150, IIRC. Fun little diversion, right? Except your camera can only hold three pictures. So you need to make 50 trips, and he can only process one at a time. My memory is a bit hazy, but IIRC you need to go in, give him a photo, go out, play a song to advance the day, go back in, and repeat.  My therapist and I are still working through my feelings about Eiji Aonuma."

truezelda,313kz0,IAMYourReason,2,Thu Apr 2 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you OP, the game is really spelled out for you. I feel like it plays more like a movie than a game. The combat is way too easy and where it should catch you off guard, you just press A and everything is done for you. Great music though, and the story is still fun and charming. It's a great game to get kids into Zelda."
truezelda,313kz0,jmazala,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:53:46 2015 UTC,"I like your movie analogy. It really does feel like a kids game, which is part of what's turning me off.   It bothers me when games hold your hand, and I find Wind Waker does that often. In general, so many modern games are guilty of babysitting the player, making sure they can't screw up / get lost / think critically."
truezelda,313kz0,VortexxyGaming,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"I was checking to see if someone mentioned music and it brought me here OP.  I always do this just to make sure: you are listening to the game's music while playing and not your own, right?  It's such a huge aspect of gaming that is often overlooked, and it is necessary to the experience for Zelda."
truezelda,313kz0,Starpryme23,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:51:14 2015 UTC,"I've got the game's music loud and clear while playing. While I understand that the music is great in its own right and complements the art direction, in general I'm not a fan of the 'light-hearted' tone. I find it difficult to take the game seriously at times, though I know it's meant to be a lighter experience (in contrast to games like Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess)."
truezelda,313kz0,neoslith,2,Tue Apr 7 02:33:33 2015 UTC,"It has been my experience that nearly every Zelda game starts off slow and becomes great and WW was no different.  I also found the sailing pretty tedious at first, but it got better once I got the ability to warp and got the fast sail.  In the end, I found that it wasn't my favorite Zelda but easily in my top 5."
truezelda,313kz0,dude_with_the_name,2,Thu Apr 2 14:11:35 2015 UTC,I thought Fast Sail is only in the Wii U version. The implementation of the fast sail and its ability to change the wind for you definitely would fix one of OP's main issues with the game.
truezelda,313kz0,duhhidkyurgetndvoted,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, you are right.  I forgot that the GC version didn't have that.  That's definitely a game changer."
truezelda,313kz0,Knoxisawesome,5,Thu Apr 2 14:29:37 2015 UTC,"Fun Fact: The GC originally had it during development but, during testing, they discovered that it made you travel so fast that the GC hardware couldn't render the next ocean grid in time and you could fall off the edge of the world, so it got cut from the game."
truezelda,313kz0,asralyn,2,Thu Apr 2 14:36:17 2015 UTC,"I love Wind Waker, but I tend to be the kind of person who desires a thought-out novelistic experience. In my opinion (and this may or may not be common, I'm not sure) gameplay is very important but distinctly secondary to both storytelling and art direction.  Wind Waker is a masterclass title excelling in both of those aspects. Is it easy? Yes. Is traveling around the sea tedious? Absolutely. Is the combat the best in any zelda game? Not really, but it's pretty decent and I never really got ""bored."" The level designs are phenomenal. The art direction is impeccable. The story has one of the most absolutely satisfying emotional payoffs at the end.  So if you're a game junkie (which is a totally legitimate thing to be and I'm not at all trying to imply that you're ""looking at it incorrectly""or anything. People have opinions) then you might not be the biggest fan of this title just because, as a game, it's only ""good."" It's 100% solid but doesn't excel in gameplay. But the story and art are just absolutely phenomenal.  Much of the same argument holds for Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess, both of which also had fantastic art direction and great stories, but faltered a bit in the gameplay department.  That said, I'm not implying that any of these games are boring or ""too easy."" I definitely had challenging moments playing all of them, and I enjoyed the combat, but in my opinion that's not what drove these games to be so successful."
truezelda,313kz0,asralyn,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:53:21 2015 UTC,Very fair analysis. Thanks for sharing.
truezelda,30uke2,NDQAIS,33,Mon Mar 30 20:53:22 2015 UTC,I think people are going to be disappointed when the games come out and they realize that mountains are still being used as world-end barriers.  We aren't going to be scaling the mountains and traipsing across them.  There'll be paths.
truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,14,Mon Mar 30 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"TBF, what do those people expect ? To not have any borders ? That's impossible. I expect there to be some mountain ranges, a certain distance of the shore you can't cross (cause of currents) some canyons or valleys, etc....  The only way they could make it borderless is if they made it so 1 side of the map makes you appear on the other side of the map. And that wouldn't work for LoZ"
truezelda,30uke2,henryuuk,4,Tue Mar 31 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody expects a ""borderless"" world in the truest sense of the word. I.e. that wherever you went, there would be nothing to stop you. A world, where one end of the map is just the beginning of the other side, would still be possible (see most early RPGs) but I agree with you that it's probably nothing we'll see in a Zelda game (especially since we have confirmation, that  to both the south and the east the world is bordered by ocean).  Instead, ""those people"" expect a world, where everything feels as alive and fitting as possible. And invisible barriers, unscalable mountains and impenetrable forests just wouldn't do this big beautiful world justice. I don't know what method they're going to end up using but arbitrary borders would just feel unreasonable in this giant game of exploration."
truezelda,30uke2,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:35:14 2015 UTC,"It ""is possible"" in the sense that coding wise it works, yes. however in those oldschool rpg's, you traveled the entire world (often with some sort of craft) The LoZ world is much vaster than just hyrule .    In what way is an unscalable mountain wrong ? you realize we have those things IRL right ? mountains that were not conquered for thousands of years, and when they were it was by an immense expedition.      Combine that with the fact that we have GODS in hyrule that don't seem to mind terraforming and a land with so many natural shifts in geology that the land is near in-recognizable every few generations and I'd say having impassable terrain is far from ""illogical"""
truezelda,30uke2,solaris1990,2,Tue Mar 31 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's not about what feels ""(il)logical"" but rather about what fits the scale and the theme of the game.  When I'm told that I'll have a giant land to explore at my leisure then I sure as heck don't want to be stopped by just another mountain range after I surpassed so many before that one (unscalable as it might be).  You can give me the biggest land ever to be traversable in any videogame. And I'll love it. But if after all that exploring I find seemingly arbitrary borders I'll wonder what's behind that obstacle. And then I'll feel that my experience wasn't as complete as it could have been. That I was missing out on something.   That's just human.  I hope that I don't sound ungrateful or needy when I say this but I really expect a ""complete"" experience. In the end I just want to feel like I conquered what there was to conquer.  To reiterate: I'm OK with borders in the game. I just don't want those borders to make me feel like I missed out. I really like that you mentioned the Goddesses of Hyrule. If they give a good reason why Link should not be able to venture on, so be it - in the game's universe I'll gladly abide to the heavenly rules. Another idea that I liked was in a comment below by /u/pattybak3s: the ""flat earth"". How cool would it be to travel for miles to come to the edge of  a vast bottomless chasm? There'd be no objection from my end - there would obviously be now way for me to journey on.  I don't want to debate with you endlessly over what approach to map design is objectively better (if there even is such a thing). I just wanted to convey to you how I (and maybe some other people) were feeling about the exploration in Zelda U.  In the end, we're all hoping for the best with this game and I guess we can agree that what we've seen so far of the world is reason for quite some hype."
truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Mar 31 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think they just need to design mountains that you realistically wouldn't be able to maneuver cos too jagged/steep whatever. You can try to climb them sure, get a decent way up but there's a point where equipment will not cut it (because it doesn't on every surface, even in a true organic world) and link will realistically fall (to his death probably, unless he uses the sailcloth). Alternatively they devise a form of climbing which requires stamina or whatever but where it's not a limiting factor for 99% of the world, only incredible heights)."
truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 31 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"How cool would it be to travel for miles to come to the edge of a vast bottomless chasm?   Why is a bottomless chasm, which is one of the weakest, most unrealistic forms of an invisible wall, better than an unscaleable mountain?"
truezelda,30uke2,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"Why must a bottomless chasm be unrealistic or weak?  First of all, the world of Zelda is full of magic and mystery. Beasts, Demons, Goddesses - surely in this universe there is space for weird geology as well. As for how ""weak"" such a chasm must be as a border, I thought along the lines of Sinbad or Pirates of the Caribbean. That's the kind of ""invisible wall"" I would not want to cross (or even try to).  More on why I personally think this would be fun (again: just me thinking out loud - nobody's forcing you to like this idea): I really like to think what implications such an ""edge of the world"" would have for the Zelda universe and its lore. Maybe Skyloft wasn't the only time that land was raised into the skies by heavenly powers. What if what we know as the original ""earthland"" is itself only part of a far bigger world, lifted up in the ether? Or maybe Hyrule is indeed set in some kind of strange Discworld.  Those ideas are absurd, of course. But they're fun, nontheless, when you think of ways Zelda U could break with old conventions of the series."
truezelda,30uke2,henryuuk,0,Tue Mar 31 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll keep my fantasy in the realm of realistic planetary physics, thank you."

That's just whiney. so you are one of those people that doesn't care about all the fun you had, if the last 5 minutes were interrupted you will feel it all wasted ?    And the mountain ranges at the edge would obviously be bigger/steeper then the ones you already crossed.  .   ""flat earth"". How cool would it be to travel for miles to come to the edge of a vast bottomless chasm? There'd be no objection from my end - there would obviously be now way for me to journey on.    To me, THAT sounds way more lazy then actually making borders in some way, shape and form. Not to mention it would require the entire world to be explorable, in which case making the map double back on itself is much better. However we are pretty much guaranteed to not have that happen, as we will still only discover Hyrule, and not the entire planet."
truezelda,30uke2,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"That’s just whiney.   I explicitly said I'd still love that experience. What I was saying was that if you compare something extraordinary with something just as extraordinary, only with the added hint of something better, you can't help but ask yourself what that ""something"" would have been. But there is no feeling of having wasted anything.  Think of it this way:  Picture two beautiful  pieces of cake. They're both the same in every way. But the left one is served on a fine white porcelain plate, while the right one is served on a highly ornate dish, with a little elevation in the middle and decorated in a manner that suggests that your cake is about one layer higher than it really is. While you're eating the two pieces, you like both of them about the same. In fact, you enjoy both of the pieces very much. You may have never had a better cake before. But once you finish the pieces, there is a difference. While you knew what you were getting with the left cake you are left wondering what that ""last"" layer of the right cake would have tasted like. You enjoyed both the same and yet the experience was different. You did waste no more time eating the right cake than you did eating the left one - and since you liked them you can't really speak of waste here. But you might still ask yourself: ""Why would the right cake end where it did?"" (I know I would - if that is whiny to you I can't help it).  That was just a quick attempt to convey my feelings about this matter. Make of the allegory what you will.  And I admit that the ""flat earth"" is quite a stretch and rather improbable. Nevertheless, I really liked the idea. It'd be something new (in this setting).  All in all, I trust Aonuma and his crew to figure out a way to make good on their promises.  P.S.:  I can see how you might object to my reasoning but I would really like it if we could keep this thread towards our wishes for and expectations of Zelda U. After all, this community works by giving like-minded Zelda-fans a platform to exchange their experiences with the series and I would like to keep that positivity going here. Be excellent!"
truezelda,30uke2,ProudasaPeacock,2,Tue Mar 31 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that is exactly what I consider whiny, different strokes different folks I guess. My food could be server in a trog or on a naked supermodel. The food itself won't change for me."
truezelda,30uke2,cronos844,3,Tue Mar 31 23:24:36 2015 UTC,Didn't they do that in windwaker? Or was it you got so far and then you looped round?  TBh going all the way to the edge and coming back on the other side I think would work. IT would make the world seem more 'real'
truezelda,30uke2,recursion8,3,Tue Mar 31 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Hyrule is a single country, it isn't an entire world. ""looping around"" only works if you traverse the entire world.    And in windwaker the boat just said : ""we are going to far, let's turn back"" when you tried to leave the map."
truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Mar 31 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"IIRC when you get to the edge of the Great Sea the King of Red Lions tells you you have to stay and finish your quest or the water is too treacherous or something like that. The problem I have with that idea though is there are other lands in Zelda's world like Labrynna, Holodrum, and new Hyrule, and they just can't realistically fit all of those in one game right now. It could also limit future games by showing how big the world is and how many lands there are, which could stop them from adding new lands in the future unless they explain it as the Goddesses making new land or something. I do still love the idea of it though."
truezelda,30uke2,malaroo,3,Wed Apr 1 01:56:33 2015 UTC,"I bet you'll be able to climb them to a certain point, like the original Zelda. You can climb to the top, but then it gets too steep."
truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,6,Tue Mar 31 07:30:08 2015 UTC,Let us dream!
truezelda,30uke2,malaroo,3,Mon Mar 30 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"Look at the Game Awards vid. In the beginning Link is on a mountain, and yes there's paths, but he's clearly able to go off the path and climb a rocky outcropping to get to the top and look out over the wide expanse of Hyrule below. He then proceeds to jump off the cliff and float down on a sailcloth. If ever there was a place for a border in previous games, the edge of a mountain was sure to be one. Now if Link can freely go off the mountain that way, who's to say he can't go up one too, given the right tools and equipment?"
truezelda,30uke2,pattybak3s,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:00:55 2015 UTC,"Because when you're at the edge of the map and it's a mountain and you get to the top, what happens on the other side?  It's either more mountain or an invisible wall or something.  This is inevitable."
truezelda,30uke2,reallybigzeldafan,2,Tue Mar 31 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think people are going to be disappointed when the games come out and they realize that mountains are still being used as world-end barriers.   I'm confused?  Who is implying the world will be infinite?  I haven't seen anyone suggest that.  They're only saying that, within the open world, there won't be artificial 'barriers' between areas, like all prior 3D Zelda games with the exception of Wind Waker's ocean (kind of).  Similar to the Elder Scrolls, or any other modern open-world game, you are free to explore whatever is within the full 'box' of a world, until you reach the end where mountains stop you, or it says ""You cannot go that way.""  You can scale mountains in most open world games, as long as that mountain is within the map and not on the edge of it."
truezelda,30uke2,reallybigzeldafan,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of people saying ""we can go anywhere we can see!"" followed by ""when I climb the mountain I wonder what will be over it!""."
truezelda,30uke2,TeekTheReddit,2,Wed Apr 1 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but I don't think they mean they can climb them endlessly.  There will obviously be an end, at some point.  But climbing mountains to get to something on the other side?  That's commonplace in modern open world games.  It's certainly part of the appeal, and I can see why people would be excited about that in Hyrule's case."
truezelda,30uke2,recursion8,4,Wed Apr 1 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, they could blow everybody's mind and use a new type of wall for video games. Maybe have the world would end like the old theories where the world was flat.   Or play the Nintendo canon and put the mushroom kingdom as an Easter egg. Seeing the castle far in the distance, or have the Samus fly with the stars under certain conditions."
truezelda,30uke2,TeekTheReddit,8,Mon Mar 30 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"Firstly I think we'll be seeing this game anywhere from late Spring 2016-Summer 2016. The reason I say this is because it feels like this delay was largely done because the development team wanted to remove the stress of finishing the game to give themselves more creative freedom. We still have the rest of 2015 left, and that's a LOT of time for them to be adding content to this game freely, without the pressure of a release date. They're going to reach a point soon where adding more and more does nothing for the game and it might as well be ready to ship. I feel like that'll be mid 2016. (Keeping in mind this game will be in development for 5+ years by then)  As for the content, I'm expecting a strong focus on the narrative while keeping the open world gameplay fun and everything like they've promised. I can't wait to explore the lost woods  in this game. But when it comes to specific gameplay features there's really nothing I can say considering the focus is to change the conventions of Zelda. Maybe they're adding multiplayer."
truezelda,30uke2,reallybigzeldafan,4,Mon Mar 30 23:59:10 2015 UTC,"Also as a side note! I really really feel this game isn't coming out in Holiday 2016. If they're skipping this holiday what will be the advantage of going with the next holiday? The Wii U will be almost done by then and gamers will be wanting to see more of the NX. Sales are struggling to pick up still and they will be struggling more next year for sure, I mean it's a console that came out in 2012 for god's sake and some people still think it's just a tablet for the Wii"
truezelda,30uke2,pattybak3s,4,Tue Mar 31 01:15:31 2015 UTC,It's not like Nintendo putting out a Zelda at the end of the console's life isn't without precedence. This is could be Twilight Princess all over again.

Having an evolution of mounts would be something that I would love! Maybe the bird will only be available in closed area (mini games?)   I think the warp system will be fine, especially because it's something core in the serie, I highly doubt they'll make a ""bad system"" that forces us to travel excessively (mind you I didn't find the travelling in WW a pain).   They talked in a video that the game experience will change depending on the direction you approach the things. That's something really interesting and I'm sure it takes a long time to program that. I had this in mind when approaching the islands in wind waker. Imagine a temple having multiple entrances!"

truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,5,Wed Apr 1 10:21:40 2015 UTC,"I would like to just see a huge open world chock full of caves and NPCs, i guess in a similar vein to Skyrim. Have some sort of note taking system like phantom hourglass so you can keep track of the caves you have visited or have to return to because you did not have the proper item. Mix it up too, have some caves be a battle ground (like shark island), some be puzzles, hell it would be cool if they added a sneaking element too. Of course usual rewards, rupees, heart pieces, maybe something new. With such a big world I'd really like to see them fill it."
truezelda,30uke2,Jinketsu,8,Mon Mar 30 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"I hope they really focus on making the world large but not stupidly narrow and empty like TP's overworld.  TP had the problem of having a huge Hyrule Field, but you forget that it was segmented into 5 or 6 sections that were connected by very thin paths/bridges/corridors. I really don't want that rearing its ugly head again.  Secondly, TP's Hyrule Field had fucking nothing in it. Seriously, it was a means of travel and padding between areas, and that was it. I really hope Zelda U also addresses this."

There should (and most definitely will) still be places that feel vast. But if everything works out right, they won't just be empty.

The problem with these is that none of those rewards are worth going through the trouble though. It's either heart pieces, rupees, or maybe one side-quest for an item.   There should be content all over Hyrule Field that actually is worth going after, such as a completely hidden sword upgrade, maybe an entire sidestory based on hidden objects/places, etc."

There are plenty of games who have different versions of fast travel - each being more convenient than the last - that open up the more you've progressed in the game. What if the flying bird is back, and used as a simpler method of fast travel?"
truezelda,30uke2,Gilder0y,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"I thought about that possibility  as well. But I don't think Nintendo would make you climb the towers every time you want to warp. That would simply be an additional element of inconvenience slapped on top of the mechanic, just for the sake of it.  But I still like the idea of air based travel. Maybe you can warp from everywhere to every platform you visited once before."
truezelda,30uke2,beduru,2,Tue Mar 31 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh yeah. I didn't clarify that. The platforms would be a place you teleport TO, not from."
truezelda,30uke2,Zumbach,3,Tue Mar 31 10:17:25 2015 UTC,"I bet that the sizes of the bosses just got exponentially bigger, like Shadow of Colossus size.  The world is huge and they have shown off attacks that are performed by Link while riding on Epona.  Maybe they realized that people want those kinds of bosses/battles.  And we have already witnessed the e3 fight across the terrain.  I also bet they have added more function with the double screen:  I bet that you control another character with the controller and control link on the main screen.  You can see what is happening to both at the same time."
truezelda,30uke2,beduru,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:16:55 2015 UTC,"I would really love that.  I just don't know how big Nintendo can go with the bosses before it get's crowded in the overworld - especially as I hope that Hyrule is A LOT more organic and denser populated than the world of Shadow of the Colossus.  And about the second screen: I could see it get used for items/mechanics like the beetle, resp. the seagull/hawk. Another possibility could be for boss fights - think Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks!"
truezelda,30uke2,Zumbach,2,Tue Mar 31 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"I hope that the delay means they got much more ambitious, dungeon size, overworld locations, etc.  Bigger enemies would be the most exciting and something new to Zelda.  I am sure the second screen will play a huge role in the game and the items you suggested make a lot of sense.  I just hope they make the controls fluid before trying to force the second controller in."
truezelda,30uke2,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 31 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"I also like the idea that loftwings or some kind of flight mechanic is being added. Perhaps they realized that if any area can be approached by nearly any way on foot, why not have the option to do so via flight as well. This would certainly warrant some retooling of the geography to make the flight mechanic more doable without being overpowered. To push the conjecture train one step further maybe they could add some sky areas to explore too.  Another thing I think they could be working on is the combat in general. All we saw in the Game Awards demo was bow combat, which apart from the bullet time mechanic seemed fairly basic. We didn't see any sword or on foot combat at all and I would love to see them use this extra development time to make sure that swordplay is engaging and fresh. I was pretty nonplussed with the enemy design and behavior in the demo, so I'd like that to be punched up in the interim."
truezelda,30uke2,beduru,2,Tue Mar 31 17:01:54 2015 UTC,The possibities they discovered could have to do with how good the prototype looked on NX and how well it could work as a launch title.

This kind of thing happens elsewhere in the Zelda series. For example, in FS the seal that held Vaati weakened as time progressed, so he was able to escape his confinement within the blade. The descendants of the Sages were tracked down and eliminated, similar to the scenarios in ALttP  and ALBW. Since there was no Hero in the Adult Timeline between OoT and WW, there would have been no one to rescue the Sages' descendants, so the plot to free Ganon would be successful."
truezelda,30rcxj,Dismas423,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"The eliminated sages one makes the most sense, because Laruto and Fado, descendants of Ruto and Saria, are dead in TWW."

truezelda,30rcxj,Sw0rDz,4,Mon Mar 30 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"Seals weaken over time, like all magic.  Also, Demise's Curse.  Demise's incarnation will appear (be born, be resurrected, or be unsealed [per other games proving this]) when the Hero and Goddess appear.  According to Hylia's Curse, the Hero and Goddess will appear when Hyrule is in danger.  They form a cyclical rule of fate.  If Link and Zelda are going to be born, Demise's incarnation will appear, and Link and Zelda will be born because Demise's incarnation is going to appear.  With the knowledge we have now about Hylia's Curse, we know that there must have actually been a Hero during the Flood, and that could be the reason Ganon broke free in the first place - he was fulfilling Demise's Curse to be incarnated, in this case with an unsealing.  The in-lore legend in Wind Waker describes there being no Hero during the time of the Flood, but based on our current knowledge, it's far more likely that there was a Hero there and he simply failed to stop Ganon in time to prevent the Flood and was not remembered as a Hero, and thus the legend states that there was no Hero.  I will explain that full theory on request, since I don't feel like typing it out yet again right now."
truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,6,Mon Mar 30 02:22:36 2015 UTC,"But the reason of there being an era without a hero is because the Spirit of the Hero got sent back in time into a different reality. So the hero becomes non-existent in the Adult timeline following the events of OoT. Which is why no one came to save Hyrule and it got flooded, and also why the Hero of Winds had to step forth and fill the void."

truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 30 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"Correct.  More accurately, the Spirit of the Hero isn't a ghost.  It's more like a universal law that says ""This person with these traits will be born at this time"".  The person with the spirit of a Hero will appear when he is needed."

truezelda,30rcxj,dahahawgy,5,Mon Mar 30 10:51:02 2015 UTC,"Why do you think it's not a spirit that gets reborn? That's the whole point of the Adult Timeline, the hero became nonexistent and Hyrule got flooded because of it. WW Link is a different spirit entirely and although he was not predestined to become a hero or legend he was badass enough to earn the title of Hero of Winds and kill Ganondorf.  If what you said is true then the conversation between the King and Jabun would make no sense."
truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 30 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"Why do you think it's not a spirit that gets reborn?   Because we've seen Heroes separate from each other twice now.  Hero's Shade and Hero of Twilight.  They are not the same person.  They are both Heroes.  ALBW Hero and Gramps (in the same game).  Gramps is heavily implied to be a previous Hero when you finally battle him, and he is still alive.  Thus, the only reasoning that could still mean the Spirit of the Hero only exists in 1 person (which is the only way leaving the timeline would remove it from the timeline) is if the Hero's Shade is secretly inside the Hero of Twilight's mind, and if Gramps isn't actually a Hero (which would make the whole point of him seeming like an elderly Link utterly pointless).   he was badass enough to earn the title of Hero of Winds and kill Ganondorf.   But that does not create a new reincarnation cycle.  Nothing in Wind Waker did that.  There's absolutely no evidence for that happening.  Yet we know the reincarnation cycle continues, because the ST Hero exists.   the conversation between the King and Jabun would make no sense.   All the King cares about is the Hero of Time.  The King comes from an era when the Hero of Time was WORSHIPED and the people thought he was an actual time traveler who went to different eras helping people.  They were wrong, obviously, but they also had no reason to expect or believe that the Hero was actually reincarnated over and over again.  So, when the King meets this boy who is explicitly not the Hero of Time, as far as the King is concerned, he is not the Hero of legend.  Because he isn't.  There is absolutely no possible way the King would have any knowledge of the reincarnation cycle.  He is human.  The knowledge was already lost by Ocarina of Time.  It is not mentioned ANYWHERE outside of Skyward Sword.  Why does everybody think the King is a reliable narrator?"

truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"Well the explanation is either the Triforce of Courage resets it, or the Hero of Winds and ST Hero are not Heroes, or it just resets on its own.

We've talked about all this stuff before, so neither of us is about to convince the other without new unheard-of arguments, but it's just not as ridiculous as you say.

truezelda,30rcxj,Dismas423,0,Mon Mar 30 21:27:35 2015 UTC,It's a way to emphasize how ridiculous it is for the Hero's reincarnation to disappear because one Hero left the timeline and then suddenly come back some thousands years later.  And getting the Triforce of Courage doesn't restart a reincarnation cycle.
truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't say either of those things, but I gotcha."
truezelda,30rcxj,Dismas423,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"I just had a thought. What if there was no Hero during the WW backstory because the Triforce of Courage was broken at the time? The King of Red Lions says that after the Hero of Time departed, the Triforce of Courage was broken into eight pieces and scattered throughout the land. Since the Hero is the destined keeper of the Triforce of Courage, maybe it has a special bond with the Spirit of the Hero, and the Triforce's state of disrepair prevented the Hero from reincarnating. WW Link was not originally a Hero; he was just some kid who got caught up in great events. After he assembles the Triforce of Courage, he is accepted as its new keeper and becomes the Hero of Winds, thus renewing the Spirit of the Hero. This would be similar to what we see with Tetra, who does not become Princess Zelda until the Triforce of Wisdom is reunited."
truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 30 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"The Hero doesn't need the Triforce of Courage to be the Hero.  Quite a few of them have gone without it.

I guess my rationale was the Triforce of Courage was definitely one of these elements, and the Spirit of the Hero was likely another. Going along with that, when the Triforce divides in ALBW's backstory, the Triforce of Courage became bound to the Spirit of the Hero, so maybe a similar thing happened in OoT. Since the Hero of Time's departure shattered the Triforce of Courage, maybe all the ""elements"" of the Hero were also damaged. WW Link reforming the Triforce of Courage would then restore the rest of the elements as well. I admit this is speculation, but it's not totally ridiculous."

truezelda,30rcxj,malaroo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that when the Hero of Time was forcibly ripped out of the timeline, since he owned the Triforce of Courage, it could have shattered.

truezelda,30rcxj,pbeverly,2,Tue Mar 31 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"It's not narrative-based, very few Nintendo franchises are. Nintendo has always been about gameplay first, story second. At the heart of their two biggest franchises is the same simple archetype, hero rescues damsel in distress, with variations added to the core theme over time. It was really the fanbase's insistence at there being an all-encompassing timeline that forced Nintendo's hand. If you want narrative based games go look to Elder Scrolls or MGS or something along those lines."
truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 31 07:22:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think a Magic Mirror would have been necessary. The reason for the Magic Mirror and Ganon's failure to escape the Sacred Realm in ALttP and its back story was because no one could find an exit from the Sacred Realm once they entered it. But in OoT, the entrance and exit weren't difficult to find. So unless the ""Void of the Realm"" is a completely unfamiliar part of the Sacred Realm that is far away from any exits, Ganondorf probably wouldn't have needed a Magic Mirror to the same extent as Link and co. (unless the Magic Mirror is able to bypass the seal)."
truezelda,30rcxj,pbeverly,2,Mon Mar 30 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"Its important to know that in Wind Waker, Ganon and Ganondorf are names used synonymously. Coupled with this information, the Hyrule Historia states he ""crawled up from the depths of the earth and enshrouded Hyrule in darkness once more"" (pg 123). Which can mean one of two things:   1 - His appearance in Pre-Wind Waker is a perfected, less dichotomized form of the Ocarina of Time Big Bad   or    2 - That the Hero of Time defeated both Ganon and Ganondorf but the sages only could maintain the seal on the beast form of Ganondorf, thus allowing the human form to escape.   Either way, we never see beast Ganon in this game and I feel that is significant."
truezelda,30rcxj,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 30 02:27:38 2015 UTC,"The Legend of the Flood shows the beast Ganon, but we know at the end of OoT [Adult Timeline], Ganon is sealed in the Sacred Realm in his human form.  I've always thought that once he unlocked his true power, he would be able to more or less freely transform between them, like he does in Twilight Princess.  He just doesn't happen to do so in Wind Waker (and is all the more intimidating for it, imo)."
truezelda,30rcxj,korrt106,6,Mon Mar 30 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that an intersting point. I've always assumed the scroll was just a loose retelling of the legend not an actual point-by-point account of the events. A caricature of Ganondorf as an ""evil pig-beast"" rather than an actually re-telling of the Pre-Wind Waker. But I understand your sentiment. Still, if he could transform, it would make more sense to hold no punches and use his full arsenal to kill Zelda and Link."
truezelda,30rcxj,henryuuk,9,Mon Mar 30 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"You could be right about the legend - it's probably very inaccurate in many other ways.  Ganon's transformation abilities are somewhat unclear.  In the Fallen timeline, he never reverts to his human form, which could be explained by his long imprisonment in the Sacred Realm (changing him to his ""true form"" permanently) and the fact that he loses his mind.  In Twilight Princess he appears to do it at-will.  He's perfectly lucid after changing back.  However in FSA, the second Ganondorf seems totally berserk and bestial, possibly caused by the Trident of Power.  In the Adult Timeline, at the end of OoT, Ganondorf turns into Ganon as a last-ditch berserk effort, but he's also lucid after turning back.  Now this is where I'm reaching: but maybe with his experience fighting the Hero of Time and still failing to completely conquer Hyrule during the Flood, Ganon decided that his beast form was too berserk and not smart enough to be worth using at vital moments.  WW Ganon is the wisest we've seen the man, so that makes some sense."
truezelda,30rcxj,SuperNeonManGuy,3,Mon Mar 30 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I like this point. Just makes me like Wind Waker's Ganondorf even more."
truezelda,30rcxj,henryuuk,2,Mon Mar 30 07:09:33 2015 UTC,"The problem he had in windwaker is that he didn't need this transformation to get the full triforce, and probably didn't have enough power to do the transformation once he lost it."
truezelda,30rcxj,IThoughtThisWasDigg,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:46:11 2015 UTC,i always figured that Ganon's human form and personality change in WW was due to him consciously balancing out his three virtues so the triforce wouldn't just split again when he tried to use it

My HOPE is that we'll get to see some vibrant, lively realistic towns full of lots of interesting characters, rather than falling into the common pitfall you see with so many RPG/adventure games where an entire town will have like 20 inhabitants total and it's supposed to be the capital city."
truezelda,30m42f,GekkoPie,5,Sat Mar 28 18:01:15 2015 UTC,I really hope this is the case. I've never been a fan of game worlds that are far too big compared to the content they're actually filled with. I'd rather have a small hub world absolutely packed with content rather than ridiculously huge with 10 minutes of walking in between content.
truezelda,30m42f,MightyDodongo,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:27:50 2015 UTC,It only took Pokemon like 15 years to get this.
truezelda,30m42f,duelingdelbene,14,Mon Apr 13 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe they wanted to add a few optional or mini/pre dungeons. That would be really cool. I'm sure they already have the story and stuff like that all down and solidified, so you're probably right that its gameplay or side content. I hope they add some great side quests like MM's or OoT Biggoron sword quest. Like big quests on that scale. I hope there are a few really amazing towns and villages too, not just one big one."

truezelda,30m42f,TekHead,6,Sat Apr 4 03:33:41 2015 UTC,"I really like it when they put in optional items, or optional upgrades to items. Rewards for doing optional dungeon quests that are way harder on combat level and/or puzzle skills. So gratifying. So, I'm hoping it's some stuff like that."
truezelda,30m42f,Synthescissor,2,Sat Mar 28 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with this is that when you say optional items, my immediate first thought is the Gerudo Training Ground in OoT, which was a decent quest, but the reward (Ice Arrows) was practically pointless.   That being said, some optional items quests are pulled off quite well, like the Magic Armour in TP."
truezelda,30m42f,Phoxxent,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they need appropriate developement time to make them worthwhile. But they can turn out lovely, especially if at the end of a dungeon or puzzle more than a challenge"

truezelda,30m42f,Quetzalboatl,4,Sun Mar 29 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"They can't be so bouncy that they look like they will detach if the character moves too fast, yet they can't be so stiff they look like they were nailed on like a board. There is a perfect happy medium they need to capture or all is lost. I'm honestly quite excited for the delay. Good on Nintendo to make sure you produce the game we and you deserve."

I can understand them not releasing an early trailer, after all that hate mail they must receive for the smallest things."
truezelda,30kif5,Lyle91,2,Sat Mar 28 12:19:56 2015 UTC,"Early trailer? The game's been in development for 4 years.  Besides, you'd think they'd get more hate mail for not showing any video at all at E3."
truezelda,30kif5,Zeldametals,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:17:17 2015 UTC,Not being at E3 doesn't mean it won't be in a direct around E3 or maybe even earlier.
truezelda,30kif5,Serbaayuu,8,Sat Mar 28 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"Obviously we all want an awesome game, and if that means another year so be it.  What pisses me off is they JUST announced the NX system, and that can't be TOO far off, so we are almost certainly dealing with a Skyward Sword situation, ie, one of the last games for that console.  Nintendo is already behind in the hardware game and this just puts new Zelda further down the list of their priorities if they're already wheeling to focus on their next console."
truezelda,30kif5,Zeldametals,4,Sat Mar 28 14:02:42 2015 UTC,They're not talking about NX until 2016 which means it will release in 2017 at the absolute earliest (which matches the standard life cycle for Nintendo consoles nowadays).  I am guessing 2018 is more likely.
truezelda,30kif5,Fonethree,2,Sat Mar 28 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"I accept your timeline for console release.  However, that timeline still indicates a shift in priorities for a company at a time when I just want them to put out the gd game.   And if it seems overly paranoid that they might push this game to the next console, I can only say that that has happened.  That has literally already happened to a Zelda game.  And it led to a weird port for a system it was never designed for with intention.   I'm pissed, and hopefully that pissiness will pass and all this will be just so much bs on a sub, but let me say: this announcement doesn't fill me with confidence."
truezelda,30kif5,Zeldametals,2,Sat Mar 28 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"If Zelda U (or whatever) were pushed to the next console, that would make the Wii U the only Nintendo console to not have a Zelda game. It also seems pretty silly, given that when the Wii U was announced, it was stated that certain elements of the controller were implemented because the Zelda team thought they could do cool things with it."
truezelda,30kif5,Admiral_obvious13,0,Sat Mar 28 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"They just announced some kind of large-scale expansive ""discovery"" that is supposedly changing the game in a big way.  I would bet the WiiU absolutely gets this as a Zelda, but if we get some kind of half-ass effort split with whatever the hell the NX turns out to be I'm going to be super pissed"
truezelda,30kif5,androsphere,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"There has been no shift in priority.  All of the big 3 (Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony) start developing their next console as soon as the last one releases.  We know nothing about NX.  It might be the 3DS successor for all we know.  You are being paranoid.  Chill out."
truezelda,30kif5,Iron-Knuckle,3,Mon Apr 6 20:55:53 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about this? Personally, I have absolutely no problems with it, as I would like Nintendo to produce the best Zelda game they possibly can without the stress of a time restriction. One thing I am hoping for is a living and breathing overworld, with many NPC's and enemies to interact with, and hopefully this extra time gives Nintendo the opportunity to create that."
truezelda,30kif5,androsphere,4,Sat Mar 28 04:08:49 2015 UTC,I'm kind of upset because I bought my Wii U almost exclusively for Zelda. I'd like for Nintendo to time the development so that maybe Zelda will be a launch title someday.  I wish they hadn't announced a 2015 release that they can't deliver.
truezelda,30kif5,Phoxxent,2,Sat Mar 28 05:49:13 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I think big games like Zelda are never launch titles because they take a long time to make. You need a finished (or almost finished) console to make a game for it, so it would be hard to make a game that requires so much development time in time for console release."
truezelda,30kif5,adamzissou,2,Sat Mar 28 06:08:29 2015 UTC,"It sort of hinges on how long it takes to get a new console's hardware finalized, and long that is before launch.  WW was only about a year after the gamecube launch, so I'm hoping they can replicate that at some point.  You're definitely right about development time, Zelda games have a bit more content than Mario games."
truezelda,30kif5,Serbaayuu,2,Sat Mar 28 06:21:12 2015 UTC,"It's not that they couldn't deliver, it's that the vision for the game expanded during experimentation in the engine. They've been on this since maybe 2011, so what they showed at the VGAs probably had a complete map, a few dungeons, a town with a few placeholder NPCs, and a rough plot. At the time they were working on filling the world. They probably would have been ready to release by Christmas if they hadn't seen something better, something huge. Some small thing that was just so fun and they had so many visions for, it snowballed into needing to recreate parts of the game.  Now, why I'm upset by this is 1) 2015 now bores me, and I'm thinking we might have a case of the Phantom Zelda game on our hands. The Legend of Zelda Forever, with a 15 year dev time. and 2) we have to wait for 2016 before people stop using a bridge for timeline theories and drawing up fanart of the same blue shirt doing the same jump and shooting the same arrow."
truezelda,30kif5,adamzissou,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:38:26 2015 UTC,"They probably also read a lot of the feedback on forums like these (and probably more within the industry) which led to adjustments & tweaking.

I wouldn't have time or funds to play this year, but next year is a different story. I'll be perfectly content remaining patient to buy a Wii U & Zelda U then playing the crap out of it (and finding time to watch Batman v. Superman)..so it just gives us something to look forward to.  I think Nintendo can string us along with MM3DS a bit more in the meantime. I'm not in a rush, but I'm anxiously awaiting the release of a new LoZ chapter."
truezelda,30kif5,Octro,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"I am really happy with the news. I mean, eventually we'll get the game, so having to wait isn't really a problem.

truezelda,30kif5,Serbaayuu,4,Sat Mar 28 08:10:10 2015 UTC,"The demo had:   Mostly functional Epona (she looked a little SotC, so they might want to smooth her out by release) A single bullet-time action At absolute most, 1/4 of a world map ready to look at, probably less A single enemy type Basic sword mechanics Basic bow mechanics   That does not make a Zelda game - that makes a demo."

But I seriously doubt the entire world map was totally complete and polished.  What we saw was likely most of what had been completed & ready for people to look at.  The rest of the map in December was likely covered in placeholder art, incomplete things, etc..."
truezelda,30kif5,TheMovieMaverick,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I believe that. This game has been in development since probably 2011. So, from 2011 to the end of 2014, I believe they could have the entire map modeled and generally textured. Sure, they might have made more detailed textures later, but everything probably had textures that could identify it that could be improved later if time permitted, in line with building from general to specific."
truezelda,30kif5,Phoxxent,3,Sat Mar 28 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the world of vertical slices. :)  In game development (especially in the AAA sphere), demos of games that are fairly early on in development are usually what are known as vertical slices. These are demos that showcase every one of the major features (Epona, basic combat, overworld exploration, etc.), but in a very particular, closed environment.  A vertical slice is designed to feel like it was cut straight out of the completed product. Heck, this is even in the term: ""vertical slice"", like a cut from a multi-layered cake. The only difference here is that the rest of the cake hasn't been made yet -- they just made this one slice of it to show off how good this cake's gonna look once it's done."

truezelda,30km4q,Westmang,7,Sat Mar 28 04:50:18 2015 UTC,"As a proponent of the Navi theory, I admit you have a valid criticism. I interpret Navi's lack of knowledge of Ganondorf and Ganon as evidence that she had never seen them defeated before, which fits in with the time travel theory. But that still doesn't address the underlying concern of your post. The only defense I can offer is that Navi's increased experience on the Adult Timeline molded Link into a stronger and wiser hero than he was on the Downfall Timeline. He benefitted from having Navi as a mentor as well as a companion, so he was better prepared to face Ganondorf in the Adult Timeline."
truezelda,30km4q,Dismas423,4,Sat Mar 28 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think your defense is plausible. It guess it comes down to whether you focus on Navi's assistance (or lack thereof) in the final battle, or her assistance throughout the rest of the game.   Based on what you've said, it's possible that Link's journey could have transpired differently the first time without Navi's help (for example, Link could have missed out on certain items or opportunities the first time, not having Navi there for guidance).  I think what you've said makes up for my issue with the theory, but we would have to revise the theory altogether if this is the case. At this point, I think it's fair to say that the original theory is flawed, but your explanation could amend it."
truezelda,30km4q,Serbaayuu,2,Sat Mar 28 19:02:17 2015 UTC,"Navi has that moment where she decides she won't let Ganon's dark aura stop her from targeting him, so if we're going on her making a difference in the final battle, that fits.  However, it might be differences throughout the rest of the adventure - maybe her HAY LISTENs didn't happen in the Fallen Timeline, so Link didn't know where to go and what to do (like when she tells you ""MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE SARIA"")."
truezelda,30km4q,nastynate66,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"My only issue with this idea is that Navi's courage doesn't make up for her lack of knowledge. The theory suggests that Navi's enhanced knowledge is the key factor, yet her jumping into the battle doesn't add any knowledge that Link didn't already have. While her courage may have made a difference, it's irrelevant to the theory itself.  However, I agree that her assistance throughout Link's journey could have molded him into a more capable person than he was the first time around."

truezelda,30km4q,MegaMissingno,2,Sat Apr 4 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"If you subscribe to this theory, then yes. According to Nintendo, the Hero's Defeat timeline is a hypothetical scenario (hypothetical in the sense that Ocarina of Time's real ending is with Link's victory). It's one of those 'multiple / infinite possibilities' explanations, and they happen to focus on just that one outcome. It's a silly explanation, but they had to say something to explain all the other games in that timeline."
truezelda,30km4q,henryuuk,5,Sun Apr 5 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the theory doesn't fit because of the way navi reacts to you at the start of the game. And how she has no knowledge of stuff that needs to be done until the moment arises.    Personally I think that instead of Navi being send back, it was a vision that was 'send back' to warn Link about his death. Specifically the dream he has at the start.    This would also make the sages being the 'wise man', ganondorf entering the sacred realm to get the full triforce, and so forth line up with the alttp backstory without having to retcon anything.    I went into more detail over this theory here    The only actual issue with this is the moment the split happens according to the historia. which makes no sense. This however could be changed since the historia itself states that nothing in it is 100% unchangeable. and it would be much smarter to retcon something in the historia, than it would be to retcon stuff from the actual games."

It probably wouldn't be too good of an idea to outright state ""I'm from future. Go here to save the world"" because of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey paradoxes and whatnot. She does often hint at what Link needs to do, though.   Personally I think that instead of Navi being send back, it was a vision that was 'send back' to warn Link about his death.   The problem with this theory is that Link doesn't seem to do anything differently when he meets Ganondorf. If Link was to be killed at that moment, he most likely wouldn't act aggressively against his killer had he been warned beforehand."

truezelda,30kvaw,callmeon,9,Sat Mar 28 06:51:06 2015 UTC,"No, the time travel in Ocarina of Time has little to do with the timeline split itself.  Pretty much the entire game, except for the very final cutscene, takes place in the Adult Timeline.  We never see the Fallen Timeline (because Link doesn't die from our perspective).  The Child Timeline is only created when Zelda sends Link back in time.  When Link replaces the Master Sword, he goes back to 7-years-ago Adult Timeline."
truezelda,30kvaw,Serbaayuu,3,Sat Mar 28 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"I recently explained this in another thread so I'll just copy and paste it.   Link learned the Song of Storms as an adult from the windmill guy. The windmill guy learned it from Link when Link was a child. Link knew it as a child because he learned it as an adult and traveled back in time. It exists because it will exist because it did exist and so on. There is no point of origin.  ""Go around, go around, go around...""  Actions that are in Link's future but the world's past exist in the world's past before Link experiences himself doing them. So how can the world he goes back to be a new timeline if it leads to the one he already saw?"

Beans and fishing records aside, there's not actually a lot you can do in the past that affects the future storywise.

You seem to have the splits confused a little. The one where Link defeats Ganon and seals him (then returned to human 'ganondorf' form) is the 'adult timeline' which later becomes the flooded timeline.      The one where he is send back in time and warns everyone before the bad stuff can happen is the child timeline, which continues further into MM and TP    And the one that leads into A Link to the Past is the ""fallen hero"" timeline, which happens when Link dies, Ganon gets the full triforce, but is sealed inside the sacred realm before he can do his wishes and stuff. According to the Hyrule Historia this happens during the final battle of Ocarina of Time(which I consider to be their biggest, and only actual, mistake when it comes to the timeline)"
truezelda,30kvaw,henryuuk,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:41:59 2015 UTC,"I like gannon personally.  Also, why does it have to be that way? I realize hyrule historia says otherwise, but im saying that the evidence could point in another direction. For one, the idea of a fallen hero never really made sense. Unless link died at the same time that the sages sent gannon To the dark world. For one, at the end of oot, link and zelda are surrounded by clouds and zelda talks about how he should be able to live life. Why wouldnt he be able to live life in that timeline unless he died. So she had to necessarily erase events so that he could be alive, so why not erase events all the way to his childhood so he could experience it all? These erased events allows the mm child timeline.  Because he died when fighting gannon, and the sages were able to seal gannon, and gannon did grab the triforce through the temple of time, this matches the prologue of a lttp, knights hold gannon while sages imprison him.   Finally, the events of the child finding the stones still happened, otherwise the adult timeline wouldnt happen. They were erased, for link to be a child, but that creates a discontinuity. Because link never continued into that sequence of events, he would be absent. And the hero would never rise. That would make the ww timeline.   I realize im making some claims that arent cannon. But looking at my argument, does it have merit?"
truezelda,30kvaw,Dismas423,2,Sat Mar 28 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"Unless link died at the same time that the sages sent gannon To the dark world.   Link was killed shortly before the Sages sealed Ganon.    For one, at the end of oot, link and zelda are surrounded by clouds and zelda talks about how he should be able to live life. Why wouldnt he be able to live life in that timeline unless he died.   Link wasn't able to live his life because he lost his childhood by spending seven years in the Sacred Realm. This came about as a result of Zelda's plan to reach the Sacred Realm before Ganondorf. Zelda feels guilty, so she sends Link back in time to regain his lost years in a world of peace.   So she had to necessarily erase events so that he could be alive, so why not erase events all the way to his childhood so he could experience it all?   Zelda doesn't actually erase any events. She sends Link to a different timeline, but Zelda and the world she lives in still exist. This is the Adult Timeline. Link no longer exists in this timeline because Zelda sent him to the Child Timeline, so when Ganon returns, there is no hero to face him. This leads to WW.   Because he died when fighting gannon, and the sages were able to seal gannon, and gannon did grab the triforce through the temple of time, this matches the prologue of a lttp, knights hold gannon while sages imprison him.   This is basically right, but OoT and the Imprisoning War are not the same event.   Finally, the events of the child finding the stones still happened, otherwise the adult timeline wouldnt happen. They were erased, for link to be a child, but that creates a discontinuity.    Link finding the Spiritual Stones takes place in the Adult Timeline, and the ending of OoT in no way affects it with respect to that timeline. In the Child Timeline, where Link is during the final scene of OoT, he had no need to find all the Spiritual Stones because the king believed his warning and had Ganondorf executed.   Because link never continued into that sequence of events, he would be absent. And the hero would never rise. That would make the ww timeline.   Link discontinuing the quest for the Stones does not make him absent. When everything from OoT is said and done, the Child Timeline, the one in which he does not collect the Stones, is the only one in which Link still exists. He is absent from WW's backstory because Zelda sent him to a different timeline."

Yes, both worlds suffer from their own doomed fate, but the depth and 'darkness' from Majora's Mask come from the inability to truly save everybody. Plus, there's a death counter in Majora's Mask: Where other Zelda games include a running total of your Game Over count (viewable from the File Select screen), Majora's Mask includes a 3-Day Reset counter. Considering the connection, the file is basically showing you how many times you let everybody in the world get annihilated.  It's impossible to beat the game with a doom count under 001."

truezelda,30icd6,Serbaayuu,8,Fri Mar 27 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really see why you assume it could be darker than Majora's Mask. Lorule felt about on par with Twilight-covered Hyrule; clearly worse off but it relatively minor ways and mostly just a darker coat of paint.  The Hilda/Yuga/Ravio dynamic could make for a very fresh story, though.   Hilda makes for a strong tragic character. She tried to fuck us over but it was in the name of saving her own world and she did it in the most compassionate way she could muster. Sympathetic antagonists are a hard line to walk but they add a lot of depth to a story.  Whereas Ganon exudes monstrousness and 'Dorf regality, Yuga is just some arrogant dimwitted fop who happens to be freaky competent. And what's more dangerous than an idiot with power?  Link as a character is almost always destiny's plaything but Ravio turns the table on it. He recognizes the way things work for adventurers and creates a position for himself that both helps to save the world and lines his own pockets in the process. He is manipulative but ultimately symbiotic, and that mindset would be a fun one to explore.  A game set entirely in Lorule could really provide a lot of creative freedom in areas where the series stagnates the hardest."

Anyway, on topic, I personally think Nintendo should port/remake TP on the new 3DS and port SS to the Wii U with improved resolution or whatever to get rid of how awful it looks on HD screens.

truezelda,308vg2,JFM2796,8,Wed Mar 25 17:05:36 2015 UTC,Yeah older games dont hold your hand like newer ones do.
truezelda,308vg2,droopyduder,3,Wed Mar 25 19:26:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that new Mario Bros RPG for the 3DS had something like a two hour tutorial... that's excessive.
truezelda,308vg2,Tomes2789,19,Wed Mar 25 19:57:54 2015 UTC,It's not as hard as you make it out to be.  Just take your time and make your shots count.  It used to drive me crazy but I can do it in no time now.  In all Zelda games you will be able to master the parts that want to drive you insane.  Just takes practice.
truezelda,308vg2,zmonge,5,Wed Mar 25 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I beat him eventually.  It just kinda shocked me when I first saw him, since the previous boss was actually too easy."

truezelda,308vg2,heyylisten,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"Morpha, although I got snared myself a lot."
truezelda,308vg2,thunderling,5,Thu Mar 26 12:08:07 2015 UTC,"Well done for doing it, but a little tip for next time is that you can use the ice arrows to freeze a hand."
truezelda,308vg2,GhostlyGrove,6,Wed Mar 25 13:18:24 2015 UTC,...I hadn't gotten the ice arrows yet.  Damn my eyes (or arrows)!
truezelda,308vg2,ThatIckyGuy,3,Wed Mar 25 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, i've always done it without them too. Then i found out that there is an animation where he breaks the ice so I just had to see it, any excuse for a replay I guess..."
truezelda,308vg2,aerandir92,2,Wed Mar 25 13:30:33 2015 UTC,I have played this game through a hundred times and never tried that!
truezelda,308vg2,ThatIckyGuy,2,Wed Mar 25 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"I've tried it that way and actually find it easier to use regular arrows. You can't fire an ice arrow while using the lens of truth, so I was constantly pressing start to switch back to regular arrows. I finally just said fuck it and never switched back to the ice arrows."
truezelda,308vg2,aerandir92,4,Wed Mar 25 18:31:28 2015 UTC,"Bongo bongo is where I got stuck back in the day when I was a wee lad, also the shadow temple used to scare the balls out of me"
truezelda,308vg2,psilocybinbeard,4,Wed Mar 25 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"If you have enough magic, just leave the lens of truth on. I kept it on  and it made the fight super easy. Overall, the boss battle took me about two to three tries. Not too bad.  Also make sure you can capture fairies beforehand. I think there are some in that dungeon prior to getting to the boss."
truezelda,308vg2,smss28,3,Wed Mar 25 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"Wait, you can just shoot the eye with a normal arrow? First time fighting the boss it just made sense to me that I had to use the fire arrow as it was acquired before entering the temple. But I see now that the fire arrow is in no way a needed pickup to do before entering the temple, I've been so stupid 0o Always used lense of truth to just align my sight, then svitsj off and shoot a fire arrow.."
truezelda,308vg2,Lecie,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"Usually in these games, any kind of arrow will harm an eye."

truezelda,308vg2,KingKolder,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"It looks more bad-ass that way, but that doesn't make the fight more difficult. If you try to z-targeting after getting rid of both hands, it automatically focus on the eye, so you don't need the lens at all."
truezelda,308vg2,metoharo,2,Thu Mar 26 23:39:49 2015 UTC,I really love this boss battle. I nearly wet my pants when I first fought him as an 8 year old!
truezelda,308vg2,KingBubblie,2,Wed Mar 25 14:08:23 2015 UTC,yeah i didn't find him difficult admittedly i didn't find a little more challenging on the 3ds because like you mentioned the targeting system can be tricky.
truezelda,308vg2,metoharo,4,Wed Mar 25 18:18:21 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people who have played the game two dozen times feel the need to gloat about how easy it is to someone who is playing it for the first time.

truezelda,2zyx8x,Stack42,30,Mon Mar 23 02:20:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's gone, and I'd hate to see him come back.  Firstly, because while he was stupendous in Skyward Sword, the Zelda series does not need a consistent flamboyant villain.  And we've had... several, lately.  Obviously it's VERY possible to take Ghirahim seriously, but his character archetype gets tiring when overused, and it can be overused very easily.  We saw Ghirahim dissolve into light - in context, that will almost always mean ""dead forever"".  I also can't really think of any feasible way for Ganondorf to get a hold of him.  He died in an alternate realm that had its portal closed and also buried under a statue, and nobody knows it exists anymore.  Ganondorf just happening to find something like that would feel kind of cheap and shoehorned, I think.  I also think one of the few things Twilight Princess did well with Ganondorf was give him a divine sword.  Ganondorf does not need an Evil Master Sword.  Ganondorf is evil enough that he can use whatever the fuck he wants, even if it's a holy blade."
truezelda,2zyx8x,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 23 02:39:15 2015 UTC,"I meant,I know Ghirahim, the personality, is gone, (he is great but I doubt he would come back) I meant Ghirahim ,the sword, specifically. Like how a Link is always finding the Master Sword, even though it isn't Fi's personality, Ganondorf could find Demise's Sword. A lot of Zelda games set further in the timeline reference events in an earlier game, so we're due for some great SS referencing in a future game. I think it'd make an interesting plot point in a future game if Ganondorf knew of Demise (if he doesn't already in some ways, at least subconsciously) and tried to gain some of his power, including the sword and finding out where it is and finding out how to get to it, maybe at the end of the Child Timeline or something.  You do have a great point about the divine sword in TP though. I never thought of it like that."
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,2,Mon Mar 23 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"The Ganondorf in the child timeline is already 'ganon' and holds a weapon called the trident of power. I don't think anything he could find from SS era would really help him, especially since weapons, seals, magic and whatnot in the zelda universe has a tendency to lose it's power throughout the ages."
truezelda,2zyx8x,CaptainPolarBear,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:51:10 2015 UTC,I think you mean the fallen time line
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,2,Mon Mar 23 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"no, I don't. I meant the remaining ganon in the child timeline."
truezelda,2zyx8x,CaptainPolarBear,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:33:41 2015 UTC,What game does he have the trident in the child time line?
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,3,Mon Mar 23 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"four sword adventures. The only game where his trident is confirmed to be specifically the ""trident of power"""
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"Ganondorf has gone back and forth from Ganon multiple times, he only doesn't do it in the Defeat Timeline. I've heard people say it's because he used the Triforce in some way in that timeline or he spent too much time in the sacred realm and he's permanently corrupted as Ganon. But in every other timeline he does regularly, I'd expect another Ganondorf in the Child Timeline since he isn't completely dead yet. I think they will find some way to combine Ganondorf and Demise in some way in the future, they wouldn't waste that opportunity for the ultimate enemy. The end of a timeline would make perfect sense for that, and unless they split the Timelines again, the Child Timeline is the only one that still has the best potential potential for a Ganondorf to come back at the end."
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,3,Mon Mar 23 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"Uhm, you say ""regularly"" but don't seem to realize there is only 2 situations were it happens or even COULD happen..."
truezelda,2zyx8x,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:23:03 2015 UTC,"It could happen in any other instance in those timelines if he were to transform in to Ganon, so it absolutely could happen post FSA also. If he's alive, (and he should be, Ganondorf/Ganon has ""died"" several times and has only truly completely died, from what we know so far, once or maybe twice out of all of those times) there is no solid reason why Ganon couldn't transform back in to Ganondorf after FSA, there is nothing that could suggest otherwise.   If it was in the Defeated Timeline I would understand, it would be very unlikely to have a Ganondorf there, but it isn't. FSA may be somewhat out of place in the timeline, I've seen plenty of debates of whether it belongs in the Child Timeline or not, but regardless it's there. And it's proven in that timeline Ganondorf can go back and forth from Ganon to Ganondorf (and the time we see him do it in that Timeline, is with extreme ease) so he should absolutely be able to continue to do so.   He's most likely dead for good in the Adult Timeline. He's also most likely dead in the Defeated Timeline, (though that's the one I've heard the most debate about). So if you don't count him being dead after TP, and count FSA as the real original Ganondorf revived, he's most likely still kicking and needs an ending.   Honestly it's just really hard to tell when Ganondorf is dead, he's a tough bastard. Honestly he could come back from any of his ""deaths"" and Nintendo would find a great, airtight way to explain it that most people, besides the most brutal nitpicking hardasses, couldn't question. I just want to see some more Demise lore, and I mean look at Ganondorf in Hyrule Warriors, imagine that a bit more Demise-y, or just Ganondorf tapping in to some inner Demise power, and wouldn't that be a truly amazing enemy?   I'm getting tired and done debating for now, but thank you for replying to my post and a great little debate. And Happy Cake Day!!"
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,3,Mon Mar 23 06:00:40 2015 UTC,"I'll keep it short. We see him return back to human after OoT, after that he is depicted as 'ganon' in the WW backstory, but we never see this Aside from that, adult timeline is done with (actual) ganon's    In child timeline, he turns into ganon and back once, during his battle. And then in FSA he transforms into Ganon because of the trident of power. But as long as he wields the (massive) trident of power, there is little reason for him to turn back into a human.    It COULD happen, in the same way it 'could' happen in that he does so in the fallen hero timeline. there is just very little reason for it.    I think that IF more demise stuff is added onto ganondorf, it would probably be done on a new ganondorf."
truezelda,2zyx8x,henryuuk,2,Mon Mar 23 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"In adult timeline, he turns into ganon and back once, during his battle.   child* I think you meant."

truezelda,2zyx8x,mc_gamer,5,Mon Mar 23 11:59:06 2015 UTC,"It all sorta depends to what actually happened to Ghirahim at the end. we see him 'dissolve' in demise's hand. but does this mean he is gone, or just without a physical form, maybe sort of like what Fi seems to be, just a spirit without a physical form. Maybe he can eventually gather enough energy to become a physical being again. It would fit with why he only really started his demise resurrection campaign after so long. He would have needed a long time to go from just a spirit to his physical body, and might even explain why he loves his body so much, as it was something he had to wait and 'work' very hard for. and if he were to gather up a physical form again, would he be able to leave the dimension we fought Demise in ? Ghirahim has a chance to come back, but sadly it is a very small one I fear.    I would like seeing him again though."
truezelda,2zyx8x,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 23 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"This would also explain the physical ""upgrades"" Girahim gained as the game progressed."
truezelda,2zyx8x,CitizenWolfie,7,Wed Mar 25 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"I talked about this recently on Hyrule Academy, and one thought that we had that was really awesome was about comparing him to King Bublin, and following ""the strongest warrior"". When Demise is defeated, he no longer feels obliged to serve him. The more free minded attitude we see from Ghirahim separates him from Fi, and probably would make him a lot more susceptible to just ""leaving"".  The other big theory we had was that maybe he may be involved in weapons such as the Trident of Power. Unfortunately, we didn't get to expand on that."
truezelda,2zyx8x,Serbaayuu,5,Mon Mar 23 08:15:11 2015 UTC,"Free-minded?  The guy learned how to absorb his sword form into a physical body so that he could work tirelessly, alone, to free his master and then started cackling when he had his sword forcibly ripped out of him to be used in combat once again.  I think ""tremendously loyal"" is something we can definitely say the swords are."
truezelda,2zyx8x,SonoShindou,3,Mon Mar 23 11:25:01 2015 UTC,"As far as Ghirahim the character goes, I think I agree with a few of the others here in that he's more than likely gone for good as ""disappearing into light"" is generally fantasy's way of saying ""this guy isn't coming back.""  But as for being the anti-Master Sword?  I hope that a future game might bring it back or make reference to it.  After all, the Master Sword often has to be recharged with sacred powers before battling the Big Bad in various games.  I'd love it if there was a Zelda game that had a new villain who didn't bother with the usual ""kidnap the Princess"" plan and instead found the anti-MS, roaming Hyrule trying to reforge it with dark energy so that they might kill Zelda once and for all."
truezelda,2zyx8x,SvenHudson,2,Mon Mar 23 11:25:11 2015 UTC,That may well make a good plot; it'd also be really easy to do it with a weapon that isn't necessarily Ghirahim.  They could do an origin story of the Trident of Power if they wanted.  Or something new.
truezelda,302ubu,questor1991,4,Tue Mar 24 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"While this is interesting to think about, I think there's a chance you might be reading into it a bit much.  I can see how you could connect them, though. Zelda is (SS spoiler) the sole heir of Hylia's spirit, and is kind of one of Hyrule's sacred artifacts   There's be more validity to this if Link's cross-shield had remained constant throughout the series, or the Gerudo desert had any spiritual/religious significance to the Hylians."
truezelda,302ubu,androsphere,2,Tue Mar 24 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"I read that they removed a lot of the themes as the game came along due to censorship. (The cross on his shield in the original, the moon and star on the mirror shield in OoT as examples)"
truezelda,302ubu,androsphere,1 point,Tue Mar 24 12:09:33 2015 UTC,"There's also the Islamic chant that originally played in OoT's Fire Temple. I think these are mostly due to the creators drawing influence from all religions/cultures.  For example, the ancient cistern in SS and the Spirit Temple in OoT both seemed heavily influenced by Buddhism."
truezelda,302ubu,TeekTheReddit,3,Tue Mar 24 16:21:00 2015 UTC,It probably wasn't a conscious decision so much as a natural extension of Zelda's medieval themes.

It made me feel more immersed in the experience, and the game is so clearly meant to have motion controls that it feels like it is missing something. I honestly think a lot of people don't like motion controls because subconciously they hate having to keep their arms moving rather than resting, but they act as if the controls are implemented well. I personally enjoyed the motion controls in both TP and SS, and I would love for their to be an option for them in the newest Zelda, however I find that to be a slim chance."

truezelda,2zx9h9,ThatIckyGuy,9,Sun Mar 22 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see a female playable character like Zelda or an original character, instead of doing Ms. Male Character just because.  And that's playable Zelda without creating a ""Prince Link"", too."
truezelda,2zx9h9,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 23 00:02:02 2015 UTC,Why? A female character is perfectly capable of filling the role of Link.
truezelda,2zx9h9,SageWaterDragon,6,Mon Mar 23 12:04:57 2015 UTC,"Because putting boobs and a vagina on Link, who is male, is pointless when the series also has a wide cast of female characters who are perfectly capable of being playable.  We could see Zelda and Link team up for once, with equal skills and powers (slightly different gameplay).  We could have Link and his sister be comrades.  Hell we could play as Zelda by herself.  But as Zelda, not as ""Link with tits"".  Saying ""Link should be a girl so we can play as a girl"" is like saying ""Mario should be a girl so we can play as a girl"", even though Peach is a perfectly serviceable player character."
truezelda,2zx9h9,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"Well, that was the original idea, but his look and gender kinda became a trademark of the series over the years and they just kept it in. I don't even think it's possible to change it without fans making it a huge deal, and frankly, I don't think Nintendo would even try."
truezelda,2zx9h9,ThatIckyGuy,3,Sun Mar 22 22:29:47 2015 UTC,I think Pokemon got it right by adding in the option early on (within like the second or third generation) rather than having the male trainer being the staple.

And I am fully with /u/serbaayuu, what you are describing doesn't make the game ""harder"" in a meaningful way. Playing OoT with a 3 heart challenge doesn't make it ""difficult"" in a meaningful way. You could play windwaker without ever allowing yourself to get hit, and that would only mean that getting hit was now an insane punishment, instead of relying on any additional skills to be needed."
truezelda,2zx9h9,ThatIckyGuy,3,Sun Mar 22 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"Link already has a voice... he has had one since OoT.   I don't think ""Hut! Hejet! Tyaaa! Whaaa! Hut!"" really counts as having a voice.  (Though...to be fair, Wind Waker does add in ""COME ON!"" to his spoken word.)  There are two meanings to giving a character a voice. One is literally adding voice actor to the mix. The other is adding characterization, thoughts, opinions, beliefs, and so on to them. The latter is something Link is lacking completely."
truezelda,2zx9h9,henryuuk,4,Sun Mar 22 22:15:19 2015 UTC,"It is exactly what having a voice in the term of voice acting means.    If it was just about giving him dialogue, that could also be done without voice acting and is completely loose from it."

If it was just about giving him dialogue, that could also be done without voice acting and is completely loose from it.   Not necessarily. In writing, giving a character a voice is completely different from giving them a literal voice. It has to do with personality, quirks, and so on.  Dialogue and having a voice are not the same, either. You can have two characters talking, but if they sound the same, they don't have their own voice.  It is a literary term in this regard, not a voice acting term."
truezelda,2zx9h9,henryuuk,3,Sun Mar 22 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in that youtube video, he placed ""giving Link a voice"" specifically in the : ""should their be voice acting"" category of his video.    Giving link a (spoken) PERSONALITY (as 'a voice' should range further then Link having stuff to say) is not what I am debating.   That said, IMO Link already has an obvious personality in the latter games, and giving him stuff to say won't add enough to that imo. Link's way of calming Groose, getting angry at ghirahim, running of the cliff after Aryl, gritting his teeth when being launched, reacting to seeing Ganondorf crush the fused shadow helmet, making a confused/disgusted face at finding ooccoo, raise his hand to show the triforce of courage to Yuganon,etc...   are all ways he is already showing personality.    Making him speak specific ways and making him talk about stuff in specific ways would only make his personality more obvious, but risk him no longer being a 'link' for the player."
truezelda,2zx9h9,ThatIckyGuy,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:44:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I suppose I wasn't paying enough attention to the video, but going back and watching, I think you may be right.   What's weird is that I have an easier time connecting to player characters with their own personalities than I do ones I'm supposed to apply my own to. I end up just seeing the blank slate than me. For instance, I had an easier time liking Wind Waker Link than I did Twilight Princess Link.  Edit: I will say this: I've been playing Skyward Sword for the first time and seeing that they've added dialogue options to the game really help me get into the mindset of being Link as opposed to playing Link and giving him a personality myself."

So I guess I mean voice and talking, but most of all, an interesting character. It doesn't make sense for him to talk if he's not an interesting character.  Does it? Doesn't it? I never explained what I mean in the video because I meant simple changes like the lack of heart drops, enemies dealing more damage and shit like that. You can say that it's easy, but really, what do you expect from it? What is ""meaningful"" challenge and who is the arbiter of if is it really is meaningful? Actually, Wind Waker HD was still pretty easy on Hero Mode, but it was still harder. If enemies dealt triple damage, you would've relied on items and skills much more. Anyway, I thought I made it extremely clear that this video is just how I would've designed it and that you can have a completely different opinion."

Make them gang up on you, make them learn from your way of fighting, make them prevent you from reaching/using healing items in a stretched out fight. Make them protect their ranged allies,etc... things that make the enemies feel smarter and better, instead of just making Link feel easily bruised.    Hell, make them use the enviroment, like running away through a door, and when you run after them they suddenly attack from the side,etc..."

If it is more punishing, you still have more of a reason to play better and that makes it harder, or am I missing something?"
truezelda,2zx9h9,Serbaayuu,5,Mon Mar 23 07:13:14 2015 UTC,"WHY though ? why suddenly add (fake) difficulty to a game series that hasn't been 'challenging' or 'difficult' since 1987 ! and back then it was mostly cause of the era, having no guideline, and the control options.    Why would fans of LoZ suddenly have this uncontrollable need for 'difficulty' in the series ? It's not a series that is meant to be challenging, it never was, it never will be. This is like suddenly wanting Mario to have guns in it because it hasn't had them since Yoshi's safari.    And especially, why want a fake difficulty, that won't actually be challenging for anyone that played LoZ, or even just games, before. Does it really matter if an attack takes away 2 hearts or half a heart ? if you really cared for being 'good' at the game and being 'challenged' you could just as easily do a 3 heart run, or simply refuse getting hit/force yourself to 'play the game better'    Making enemies soak up damage like a dried out sponge will not make you feel 'better' at the game, it will not make the enemies feel superior, it will do the opposite, you'll just feel like the enemy sucks, and you chose to use a toothpick instead of an actual sword, when you inevitable dance circles around them, block all their attacks and are wailing on them."

But after spirit tracks it became a but harder to justify them going from a stretched out new hyrule with tracks and steam technology back to a single city with no technology. Although I did play with the idea that the rampaging horde of enemies from the windwaker came and destroyed all of new hryule and then the picori came and did their schtuff    I never really considered having the Four Sword trilogy that split off from each other."

The only tricky part is the era around ALttP, and that's mostly just because ALttP's lore is more retcon than original nowadays.  Oh, I'd also delete Four Swords from the canon since it's pointless.  I don't miss the timeline theorizing at all.  Now that he have a canon timeline, we can have more valuable discussions about how new & semi-known things fit together with verifiable factual references, rather than being able to say we disagree with each other because of our personal timeline theories."

truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,5,Mon Mar 23 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"Because of how time travel works in OoT with the Song of Storms, not to mention all of the various references to the child era in the adult timeline and the adult era in the child timeline, I'd go with a nonsplit approach like:  TMC -> OoT -> MM -> TP -> TWW -> PH -> ST -> SS -> ALBW -> FS -> FSA -> ALttP -> LA -> OoS -> OoA -> LoZ -> AoL  Not a lot of big changes from what Hyrule Historia has right now outside of the split.  I'd move SS forward because ALttP, OoT, and TP all say that the Triforce was never outside of the Sacred Realm until after OoT, and SS plays up so much how people have forgotten the creation gods and Old Hylian which is also mentioned in TWW and ALttP. There are some other reasons too which I can go into more detail on if anyone is interested.  I'd move FS and FSA together since FSA says that Hyrule was at peace between the two games and that they only take place ""years"" apart from one another, as opposed to centuries or millennia.  I'd move the Oracles to after LA since Oracles Zelda says she's never met or heard of Link before in those games (and she seems to be a different Zelda than ALttP Zelda since she has Impa as a nursemaid while ALttP Zelda didn't).  And even though it's a weird placement, I'd place ALBW before ALttP rather than after because of a number of little things that makes the story flow better if ALBW comes earlier. I could easily see ALBW taking place after ALttP too, but there are just little things like ALBW Link appearing to be able to read the language that ALttP Link couldn't, the Master Sword, the Hylian Shield, and the Golden Age that make an earlier ALBW placement fit a bit nicer. (I can explain these in more detail if desired.)  As for Zelda Wii U, I'm hoping for a post-AoL placement (or a placement in-between TMC and OoT if the game doesn't feature the Triforce), but I'm expecting a post-SS placement right now. Of course it really is too early to say for sure on its placement; we just don't have enough to go on."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Fonethree,4,Sun Mar 22 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"One huge hole is the fact that the Master Sword was created in SS and therefore the game must be before any game where it is present.  There's also the fact that SS details the origin of Ganon's power, and must be before OoT (the origination of Ganondorf)."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,5,Sun Mar 22 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the Master Sword in SS doesn't match up with the origin story we're told in ALttP, TWW, and TP. SS's sword also has different abilities, a different purpose for being created, and different limitations than the OoT/TP/TWW Master Sword.  So if SS takes place after TWW, this makes sense. SS's Master Sword would be the first Master Sword created after the TWW Master Sword was destroyed/lost beneath the waves.  If SS does take place before OoT, that creates a plot hole in the Master Sword's story.  Demise doesn't have to be viewed as the origin of Ganon's power. After all, when you look at SS's story logically and its time travel linearly, Link's wish on the Triforce should have destroyed Demise's curse. Demise's curse is what allowed the present era Imprisoned to be born, but the curse should no longer be active after the events of SS. Fi even says that she can't sense Demise any more at the end of SS, indicating that the Triforce did succeed in wiping out his consciousness and hatred that fueled his curse."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:47:19 2015 UTC,"I, unfortunately don't have ALBW since I don't have a 3DS, but, I know a somewhat decent amount about the game and its plot. What is it that makes it flow better before Alttp?"
truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,2,Sun Mar 22 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"There are 5 things that make the ALBW -> ALttP order flow better than the other way around.  1) At the end of ALttP, Link's wish on the Triforce creates a Golden Age of peace and prosperity in Hyrule. If the timeline order is ALttP -> Oracles -> AoL's back story, then it logically flows that Hyrule's Golden Age must have lasted this whole time, only ending once the King of Hyrule broke apart the Triforce and hid the Triforce of Courage away to prevent the prince from getting that part of the Triforce that he was unworthy to wield. But if the order is ALttP -> Oracles -> ALBW's back story, then that means the Golden Age doesn't have a logical end. The people of Hyrule just became greedy out of nowhere and started a civil war in the kingdom, thus ending the magical Golden Age without us being able to point to a cause for its end.  Plus, if ALBW comes shortly after SS, it would make more sense for the people of a new, young Hyrule to get greedy and try to take the Triforce from its rulers than it would for the people to rise up against the Royal Family and start a civil war after ALttP when the kingdom has been strong for centuries on end.  2) At the end of ALttP, we're told that the Master Sword ""sleeps forever"". If this is metaphorical, then it's not a big issue, but if this was meant to be literal then ALBW can't follow ALttP since ALBW has Link using (presumably) the same Master Sword.  Furthermore, when the Master Sword is upgraded in ALBW, it just changes colors but it still remains the ""Master Sword"". However, in ALttP, the sword actually changes shape and form, becoming the ""Tempered Sword"" and ""Golden Sword"" (official concept art of these swords show that they look very different from the Master Sword (or at least the Golden Sword does)). It makes more sense that the Lv. 3 Master Sword (ALBW) would eventually become just the Master Sword (ALttP's back story) over time, rather than the Golden Sword (ALttP) becoming the Lv. 1 Master Sword (ALBW's back story) over time.  3) In ALBW, the game makes special note of the fact that the Hylian Shield is based on a Hylian design. ALttP makes a special note that no one has seen a Hylian artifact in centuries by the time of its events. So if ALttP takes place first, that means all knowledge of Hylian artifacts and designs were lost over hundreds or thousands of years, but then they're suddenly remembered a few years later when ALBW happens. But if ALBW happens first, it can take place earlier in the timeline, closer to when Hylians last existed, thus allowing the design to make sense and then be forgotten about for ALttP.  4) In ALttP, Link has to find the Book of Mudora in order to read words written in an ancient language. He uses this book to read several things, including the Master Sword's pedestal. But in ALBW, the Master Sword's pedestal is written in the same language as the paintings in Hyrule Castle, and Link is able to read that language without needing outside help or any translation. So unless the Master Sword's pedestal inscription was changed over the years, this shows that ALBW Link can read a language that is ancient and dead by the time of ALttP.  5) In ALBW we meet Rosso who has certain Goron-like features and wears the symbol of the Gorons on his belt. By the time of ALttP, there have been no Gorons in Hyrule for centuries. So it makes a little more sense for Rosso to have met or have some connection to the Gorons when Hyrule wasn't so far removed from the tribe earlier in the timeline than it does to assume the Gorons just came back to Hyrule after ALttP but didn't stick around for very long, disappearing again before the events of ALBW."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Dismas423,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"One more thing (Sorry to be throwing questions at you), what are the other things in Skyward Sword you think supports it being in that place?"
truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,2,Sun Mar 22 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"Since I can't explain the full thing without going over the 10,000 character limit, I'm just going to start by saying that none of the things that are supposed to mark SS as taking place before OoT necessitate SS taking place before OoT, so we can place it anywhere in the timeline that fits the rest of the series's in-game evidence.  The things that make it seem like SS has to take place later include:  1) The Master Sword - We have at least two different games that show us the Master Sword being forged (SS and OoA) so unless one Master Sword is eventually broken and then reforged into the Master Sword again (something that would only be possible if OoA took place MUCH earlier in the timeline, which isn't allowed because of the state of the Triforce in that game) or the Broken Sword is forged into the Master Sword which is later deforged(?) into the Goddess Sword and then reforged into the Master Sword, then these two blades can't be the same Master Sword.  If that means we have confirmation of at least two Master Swords, there's no guarantee that SS's Master Sword is OoT/TP/TWW's Master Sword.  We're told in ALttP that the Master Sword was created by the Hylians (as in more than just one person) at the command of the creation gods in order to take out anyone evil who got their hands on the Triforce since this Master Sword was forged to withstand the reality-warping abilities of the Triforce. We're also told in TP that the Master Sword was forged by the wisdom of the ancient sages. And in TWW we were shown that the Master Sword only had the ability to repel evil when a Wind Sage and an Earth Sage prayed to the creation goddesses (and it would lose those powers when the sages stopped praying). We're also told in OoT, TWW, and TP that evil can never touch the Master Sword.  In SS the Master Sword was not forged by multiple Hylians, it had nothing to do with the Triforce, it wasn't commanded to be forged by the creation gods, it wasn't forged by the wisdom of any sages, it wasn't given its power to vanquish evil by prayers from a Wind and Earth Sage, it didn't lose its powers when Zelda stopped praying for its powers to remain active, and it was actually able to seal evil within itself which goes beyond simply allowing evil to touch it.  2) We're told in ALttP, OoT, and TP that the Triforce was left in the Sacred Realm when it was created and that it remained there until the events of OoT when Ganondorf got to it. So the Triforce being out in the Light World/Silent Realm during SS and its back story contradict all three of the aforementioned games if SS takes place first. (And this doesn't seem to be a case of people remembering the events of the past incorrectly since the information about the Triforce being in the Sacred Realm since creation in TP comes from Lanayru, the Light Spirit, who should have been around during the time of creation). We were also told that OoT was the first time the Triforce was ever split, and yet the Triforce is originally split in SS.  3) There's also the issue of SS Hyrule's provinces being implied to have been named after the dragons while TP Hyrule's provinces were implied to have been named after the Light Spirits (and the two sets of beings can't be the same creatures because the Light World turns to twilight when the Light Spirits ""die"" but nothing like that happens when the dragons die; plus there's no Ordona dragon).  4) It's also worth noting that in SS the creation goddesses are no longer known and are merely referred to as ""the old gods"". Compare this to OoT and TP that remembered the creation deities's names and the fact that they were goddesses, TWW which remembered that the creation deities were goddesses but didn't quite remember their names, and ALttP which only remembered that there were creation gods though their names or genders were unknown.  5) Fi also tells Link in SS that she has a message written in the language of the old gods which she must then translate for Link, but we're told in OoT (and TWW) that this language of the gods is what the people of OoT Hyrule spoke. It makes more sense for Old Hylian to have been known during OoT, then died out before TWW and have been completely forgotten about by the time of SS, than it does for the language to have been completely forgotten about in SS, suddenly relearned by all the people of Hyrule in OoT, and then forgotten again before TWW.  6) Towards the end of SS, Impa advises Link and Zelda to hide the Triforce away and let the knowledge of its existence fade from the minds of all mortals. But this isn't what happens prior to OoT. During OoT and before OoT (i.e., when the interlopers attacked), the people of Hyrule all knew about the Triforce, and many knew where it was hidden. It wasn't until millennia later in ALttP's back story before people forgot all about the Triforce or where it was hidden. (Admittedly, this is an issue regardless of what game follows SS unless ALttP is the first Triforce-related Zelda game to come after SS; of course we could argue that perhaps Zelda and Link simply didn't follow Impa's advice or that Link and Zelda did hide it away but then brought it back to the Light World for whatever reason).  7) If we place SS after TWW/before ALttP, this would also explain a lot of little oddities in the Zelda continuity. For example: A) the Triforce flying away at the end of TWW. If SS takes place some time after TWW, then that tells us what happened to the Triforce after TWW: it came into Hylia's possession, and she held onto it until the events of SS's back story when she finally thought humans were ready to have the Triforce again.  B) It would also explain the technology in the Zelda series. How it's progressing from sailboat in TWW to steam engines in PH to trains in ST to mine carts that hover on tracks in SS... and then all the technology goes to crap with Demise's attack and the people of Skyloft being separated from it for so long.  C) It would also fit the geography, seeing as how SS Hyrule looks a lot like ST and/or FS Hyrule, rather than OoT or TP Hyrule. (This would also fit with the provinces being named after the dragons instead of the Light Spirits if this is the land that Link and Tetra found in ST's back story.) Plus, there's an area at the end of the third dungeon of SS that is almost an exact replica of the Tower of Spirits from ST. You can even see the turnabout and train tracks leading away from it."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Story wise, ALBW has more in common with OoT than ALttP. The backstory of ALBW tells about how Ganon entered the Sacred Realm, a Hero defeated him, and the Sages sealed Ganon away. The Triforce was then divided between Ganon, the Hero, and the Princess. The descendants of the Sages in ALBW are clearly based of the OoT Sages, having Impa, a Zora, a part Goron, etc. In ALttP, a hero is not mentioned in the backstory, the Triforce remains united in Ganon's possession, and the descendants of the Sages are all human. ALttP ends with Link killing Ganon and reclaiming the united Triforce, but Ganon is alive and the Triforce divided in ALBW. ALBW basically undoes the ending of ALttP, so the canon order requires another event between them to explain the inconsistencies."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,2,Sun Mar 22 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"Ahh... I see. I don't know why, but, I never liked the ""Single timeline theories"", but, this one makes a lot of sense actually. I like it. The only things I'm wondering:  -so in TMC the Four Sword is forged, but, in FS/FSA it reaapears in New Hryule. Is it the same Four Sword? Is Old Hyrule accesible again? What is going on with that?   -Also, is the Ganondorf from OoT and TP the same from Wind Waker? Was he resurected or reincarnated? What happened with that?  However, I like the theory, I was just wondering these things."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Mar 22 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"-so in TMC the Four Sword is forged, but, in FS/FSA it reaapears in New Hryule. Is it the same Four Sword? Is Old Hyrule accesible again? What is going on with that?   These are good questions, and we have enough information to be able to speculate on them, but not much more than that.  Four Sword - Personally, I think they're probably different swords. They have different origins (the TMC sword was created via a blessing while the FS/FSA sword was allegedly created via a curse), powers (the TMC sword only makes phantom copies of the wielder that follow the wielder's every move while the FS/FSA sword actually creates independent duplicates of the wielder), and reasons for receiving their names (the TMC sword was named the ""Four Sword"" because it was blessed with the power of the Four Elements; the FS/FSA sword was named the ""Four Sword"" because of the rumor that it was able to split the wielder into four separate people).  However, we don't even know if TMC Vaati and FS/FSA Vaati are the same guy since he appears to die at the end of TMC. Maybe he actually survived the end of TMC and went into hiding or was somehow sealed away, or maybe FS/FSA Vaati is just a reincarnation (which would explain his differences in powers and goals/motivations). So it could really go either way.  Old Hyrule - Maybe all of the post-ST games take place in New Hyrule. SS Hyrule seems to be named after the dragons, after all, while Old Hyrule seemed to be named after the Light Spirits. Furthermore, SS Hyrule is populated with a bunch of train tracks and a building that looks a lot like the Tower of Spirits, which could easily place it in New Hyrule.  Then again, the Koroks said in TWW that they were going to plant trees across all the islands in order to create a new landmass where Old Hyrule had been, essentially resurrecting Old Hyrule. So if they eventually succeeded, the people could have moved back at some later date.   -Also, is the Ganondorf from OoT and TP the same from Wind Waker? Was he resurected or reincarnated? What happened with that?   The Ganondorf from OoT and TWW are definitely the same guy. But it's debatable as to whether TP Ganondorf is the same guy as OoT/TWW Ganondorf. If they are all the same guy, we can just assume that, after being sealed in the Sacred Realm, the sages pulled Ganondorf out in order to execute him, he died in TP, and was resurrected in TWW's back story. (After all, TWW's back story says that Ganondorf ""arose from the depths of the earth"", which could easily be interpreted as a euphemism for being resurrected.)  However, TP Ganondorf really has nothing in common with OoT/TWW Ganondorf, and TP takes place over 100 years after OoT, which means a new male Gerudo would have been born in that time. TP Ganondorf has different goals, a different reputation, different powers, a different title, different motivation, a different knowledge set, and a different drive from OoT/TWW Ganondorf. For one example, OoT Ganondorf searched for 7 years to find the missing Triforce pieces. TP Ganondorf didn't seem to care about finding the Triforce at all. Because there is so very little in common between these two, they could easily be viewed as different incarnations themselves."

I bet if he actually captured Link instead of playing the Stupid Villain Game, Zelda would've been compelled to go rescue him, and it would have worked out in Ganon's favor."
truezelda,2zwjnn,TheHynusofTime,2,Sun Mar 22 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"We know he did other things than just play an organ for seven years. He resurrected Volvagia, he ousted Talon and Malon from Lon Lon Ranch, he created Phantom Ganon, he froze Zora's Domain, and, according to him at least, he searched for Zelda.  He also had no reason to capture Link since 1) he didn't know Link had the Triforce of Courage, and 2) he thought that letting Link run around and do his thing would draw out Zelda, and he was right.  The only time he really fell into ""stupid villain"" territory is when he captured Zelda but not Link in the Temple of Time. (But maybe he can only do one of those crystal shield things at a time?)"
truezelda,2zwjnn,IThoughtThisWasDigg,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know, not my timeline above, I was just responding to why ALBW might fit better before ALttP. I guess in the above timeline it doesn't matter since ALBW takes place way after OoT anyway, but the inconsistency with ALttP is a common criticism of ALBW that I've seen."
truezelda,2zwjnn,henryuuk,2,Sun Mar 22 15:43:27 2015 UTC,"I'd put it into four splits. Skyward Sword totally splits at the end. We all know it. In fact, it splits when you plant the tree in the past. No way it doesn't. Anyway, one split leads to Minish Cap, the Four Swords games, and the NES Zeldas. Basically, the games without the Master Sword (since one universe has to exist without it due to the way SS ends) and FSA serves as a way to explain why Ganon just exists in Zelda I. Other split goes not to OoT, but to an event that hasn't actually been shown, The Imprisoning War. That leads to ALttP and the timeline continues as expected there. OoT comes in as a result of changes from time travel in the Oracle games. Behind the scenes, Twinrova go back to their youth and launch a scheme to create a more powerful Ganon by becoming his surrogate mothers and directly infusing him with evil magic. I know it isn't entirely satisfactory due to the unseen events, but I think it is more consistent with itself than the current model."
truezelda,2zwjnn,newrougecolor,2,Fri Mar 27 01:24:47 2015 UTC,"My timeline was not too different from what we have now, but there were obviously only two branches rather than three.  Pre-split timeline:  Skyward Sword -> Minish Cap -> Four Swords -> Four Swords Adventures -> Ocarina of Time  Adult Timeline:  Ocarina of Time -> Wind Waker -> Phantom Hourglass -> Link's Awakening -> Legend of Zelda -> Adventure of Link -> Spirit Tracks  Child Timeline:  Ocarina of Time -> Majora's Mask -> Twilight Princess -> Oracles -> A Link to the Past.  So the first section of the timeline is relatively straight forward. Skyward Sword was confirmed to be the earliest point in the timeline at the time, and Minish Cap was believed to be the earliest before Skyward Sword was announced. The Four Sword games were sequels to Minish Cap, so their placement was obvious. Then Ocarina happens and the split starts.  Child Timeline: Again, not too different from what we have now. Majora's Mask is a direct sequel to Ocarina, and Twilight Princess shows the aftermath of Ganon's trial. I can't exactly remember why the Oracle games are where I put them, but then Link to the Past happens, and I will explain why momentarily.  Adult Timeline: This is the one with the most variation. Wind Waker follows Ocarina, just like now, and then Phantom Hourglass, but here's where my timeline is pretty different. While Link is off on the ocean searching for a new continent, he ends up helping out the Wind Fish, explaining why he is sailing at the beginning of Link's Awakening. After that game, he and Tetra find a new continent with the Spirit Tracks already there. They move away from the tracks and start to populate the monster infested land that would become New Hyrule. After a few generations, Ganon reappears and the new Link kills him with the silver arrow. Ganon's minions try to use Link's blood to revive him, but they fail. Eventually, the continent is fully populated, and the people learn how to use the Spirit Tracks to travel. Then we see what the results are in the game Spirit Tracks.  Now, my reasoning for putting Zelda 1 and A Link to the Past in separate timelines is because those are the only two games where Link actually kills Ganon with the Silver Arrows. But anyway, I believe that's what my old timeline used to look like."
truezelda,2zwjnn,SageWaterDragon,2,Mon Mar 23 00:38:59 2015 UTC,"I'd remove the ""Link fails"" third split, because it makes no goddamn sense and there's no in-game events to prove that it exists.  I'd bring it back to two splits. A few years back (before SS/ALBW were released), I made my own dual-split timeline and put together a little graphic. Here it is. It's a bit outdated now but it still mostly makes sense."
truezelda,2zwjnn,rex_lichen,2,Sun Mar 22 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"You say the ""third split"" has no logic behind it and then you fuse the timeline back together with the oracles game ?"

truezelda,2zwjnn,Dismas423,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:15:53 2015 UTC,"Probably about the same. Would probably put FS/FSA as the precursor to the original two, coming after the ALttP trilogy, which is after TP. ALBW would fall adjacent to FSA. The reason being that the magical sword is a deported Four Sword. Zelda U would probably fall before the split, after ST, between ALttP and TP, or after AoL depending on how they build the world and the tech available."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"I would keep the timeline largely the same. I think creating a third timeline for the classic games was a good way to include them in the overall chronology without shoe-horning them after TP or WW. I might place ALBW in between OoT and ALttP on the classic timeline, but this probably creates other issues I haven't thought through. The one thing I would definitely change is placing the Four Sword games in the Adult Timeline after ST. The world of the FS games is ocean based so they would fit in a post-WW world. The Master Sword was also lost on the Adult Timeline, so it makes sense for a new Sacred Blade, the Four Sword, to take its place. The canon timeline has the Master Sword and Four Sword existing at the same time, so we end up with FSA Link taking the Four Sword and freeing Vaati while in the context of the timeline there's no reason he can't go find the Master Sword instead. It makes more sense for the Master Sword and Four Sword games to be separate.  EDIT: Another thought, the Triforce isn't mentioned at all in the Four Sword games. They instead focus on other kinds of force, like the Light Force or Force Gems. This fits in with PH and ST, which emphasize force or energy as a source of power while the Triforce has been largely forgotten."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Dismas423,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"It's also established that the Master Sword loses power over time.  Presumably this applies to any magic, meaning the Four Sword would lose power at the same rate.  But since the Four Sword was forged after the Master Sword, at any given point in time it would actually be stronger than the Master Sword.  Also, FSA could easily take place in one of those eras where the Master Sword was hidden away for some reason, but the Royal Family has always taken care of the Four Sword."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Mar 22 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"The only reason we've seen for the Master Sword weakening is that the two Sages who empower it are killed. There's no evidence that this happens on the Child Timeline, so the Master Sword should still be fine. I just think it's really weird that the Four Sword was relevant centuries before OoT, suddenly disappears and the Master Sword regains prominence, and then becomes relevant again when the Master Sword disappears without explanation."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Dismas423,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"Sages don't power it in Skyward Sword or anywhere else, though.  Why would they need to power it in the Adult Timeline unless it was already getting weak on its own?  Unless we're going to posit that there is an Earth and Wind Sage hiding in the background in every single era, never seen or talked about, but I find that a bit harder to believe than a magical enchantment naturally weakening over time (much like other enchantments and magical seals etc. do)."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Petrichor03,3,Sun Mar 22 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"I think the Earth and Wind Sages are carrying on the work started by Zelda in SS. The blade SS Link obtains after empowering the Goddess Sword with the three flames looks like the sword WW Link obtains in Hyrule Castle. After SS Zelda is purified in the Earth Spring and Skyview Spring, she regains her memories as Hylia and can empower Link's blade into the True Master Sword. After WW Link awakens the Earth and Wind Sages, his blade also becomes empowered into the complete Master Sword. Both times, the Master Sword required a special two-fold blessing to reach its full power. The Earth and Wind Temples from WW correspond to the Earth and Skyview Temples from SS. The Earth and Wind Sages maintain the blessing Zelda bestowed upon the Master Sword after she gained the power of their respective springs. So I think there are Earth and Wind Sages in every era, even if we don't see them, and they are responsible for the Master Sword's continued power to repel evil."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Dismas423,2,Sun Mar 22 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"You make a good connection with the temples.  However, I must note that in Wind Waker, the Sages empowering the Master Sword seems to be a one-and-done deal - Medli and Makar appear on the pirate ship at the end of the game, meaning they had left their temples long before the final battle with Ganon.  This suggests that the Sages do not need to be actively praying for the sword to retain its power - which further suggests that they act as more of a recharge than constant power source.  The Sages being dead caused the Master Sword to be without its power some centuries later because they hadn't been able to recharge it.  But it would have been a gradual decline in power, not a switch that gets turned off when a Sage dies."
truezelda,2zwjnn,Kafke,2,Sun Mar 22 17:40:17 2015 UTC,"If you revisit the Earth or Wind Temples, you will find Medli and Makar are still there playing their instruments. This suggests that the blessing is more than a one-off event. But yeah, the fact that Medli and Makar are on the pirate ship means that they must have left before the final battle. That means the Sages' prayers don't act like an on-off switch for the sword's power, since the Master Sword didn't suddenly weaken in Ganon's Tower. So I don't know where that leaves us. I'll just say that I think the Sages are necessary in some way to maintain Zelda's blessing on the Master Sword, and the sword will remain empowered unless there is a prolonged period of time in which the Sages don't offer their prayers."

It would therefore make sense for the symbol to appear in later games on the timeline (the Four Sword games in this hypothetical). I don't really have an answer for the SS thing, but ""force"" seems like it was more relevant in the DS and Four Sword games than it was in SS, so it makes sense for them to be related."

Duck Tales is and was pretty challenging, though wildly fun. I know the Mega Man series is pretty well-known for difficulty.   Then if you include modern games, the Dark Souls and Demon Souls games are obviously tough for new players, though that scales back quite a bit after you really learn to engage combat properly."

The first game rewarded players well for exploration.  You find upgrades and the difficulty drops significantly.  Even with a fully leveled character, some dungeons were brutal, mentally, in zelda 2.  1 instance that sticks out is intentionally jumping in a pit (I really dislike when games make this a feature btw, cost of being wrong is severe). while in free fall you need to use the fairy spell to maneuver to an unreachable platform.  This was an extremely clever and frustrating tactic, the type of stuff that makes you bash your head through wall if you aren't willing to try everything."
truezelda,2zv67k,cnskatefool,25,Sun Mar 22 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"No offense, but Twilight Princess is one of the easiest games in the series combat wise, and there really wasn't much in the way of puzzles either, though there were a few frustrating puzzles (the ice block puzzle in the mansion was pretty hard, and the puzzle with the two statues before getting the Master Sword was stupidly frustrating the first time around.  My personal list would look something like this:   Zelda 2 Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past (in terms of combat to me) Oracle of Ages (the hardest puzzles the series has ever seen) A Link Between Worlds (Hero Mode only.

It would just be a trap that each player would figure out and avoid from then on. It giving you rupees over time is justification for it existing, especially because this is a single player game (There is no economy to worry about).

They are shorthand for the chance modifier you apply to the prize amount gained from all three chest within a trial.  AAA means you pulled the same prize for each chest for all three chests. For this game, AAA equals a probability of 1/455  AAB means you pulled the same prize twice, and the other prize was a smaller prize than the other two. AAB equals a probability of 3/455  ABB means you pulled a bigger prize, then two of the same smaller prize. ABB also equals a probability of 3/455  ABC means you pulled three different prizes. ABC equals a probability of 9/455"
truezelda,2zt3dz,Zubat_Breeder,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:36:19 2015 UTC,I think the 16.5 number represents that you are 16.5 times more likely to have a net gain over a net loss.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
truezelda,2zt3dz,javierbg,3,Sat Mar 21 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"It means that you are expected to profit 16.5 rupees every time you play the game.

truezelda,2zvhrx,0oKIRKo0,3,Thu Mar 26 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"A Link to the Past is actually very different than modern Zelda games in dungeon design. ALttP's dungeons are huge mazes, where the difficulty comes from surviving while searching for keys or the correct path. Newer games are much more straightforward with only one or two directions available at a time in a dungeon. This is where ALttP shines. The mazes are very difficult to learn, and monsters are strong and will defeat the unskilled quickly. One thing I do not like about ALttP is that it doesn't have many self-contained puzzles. The puzzle is the layout of the dungeon itself. Newer games present dungeons as a string of puzzles to solve one after another. The layout of the dungeon is just there to guide you along.  I'm not sure which is the better dungeon design. Both have their merits and present difficulty in different ways. I personally like the modern approach better because it makes me think more than guess about to do. In ALttP, by guessing, I mean wandering through a dozen different possible paths when you start a dungeon. Misery Mire and the Dark Palace are good examples of this dungeon design. In newer games, you are required to guess less and required to think more. For example, Majora's Mask Snowhead Temple has a room where you must rise and lower pillars in the correct order to jump across a small pit and get to a door blocked by a pillar. This example shows how newer games try to make you think more than guess your way through a dungeon. Individual goals are presented clearly--the door to the next room or the chest that contains the key you need. In ALttP, you hardly ever know where you're going or where the path will lead, especially in dungeons that use a large number of portals.   That being said, ALttP is a great game that every Zelda fan should try especially since it's available on so many platforms now. It is all about exploration, and newer games don't capture that idea as well. The entire world is open to you as long as you have the tools. This is its greatest strength. You, the player, have so much freedom in a relatively big world. Good luck. You will get lost, but you will love every minute and every discovery."

truezelda,2zpk15,Carcharhinus_Zarb,4,Mon Mar 23 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"Far more difficult than being able to eat 50-some hits from a boss who dies in as many hits many as your basic moblin, as has been the case since Wind Waker.  I could see how someone might struggle with something like Oracle of Ages, or even Majora's Mask, but if someone told me they died in anything post-Wind Waker, I would only have to assume they actively tried to.  I don't even know what the 'game over' screen looks like in Wind Waker or Twilight Princess, because most enemies only take 1/4th of a heart (some even have to hit twice to do visible damage) and this leaves you with an astonishing 40 hits before death, even if you only have ten hearts.  That isn't even taking into considering the multitude of 'extra lives' you can carry, and restock around every corner.  It's damn-near impossible to die without spending a few minutes trying to.  It's ridiculous.  They were never amazingly hard, no, but it's nice when a game doesn't essentially turn on 'infinite health' two hours in.  At least past games offered enemies that actually had a slight chance of killing you.  Heart pieces hardly even have any meaning beyond trying to get 100% nowadays."

truezelda,2zmj6g,starlitepony,2,Thu Mar 19 22:08:36 2015 UTC,"A Link to the Past  I will admit that I don't know the other Zelda games as well as I know the NES Zeldas, so take these ones with a grain of salt. Most of what I'll say here are just things I've cribbed over the past few hours by checking up speedrunning guides, watching videos on glitches, or checking dungeon maps to reason out possible skips.  First of all, I'm going to ignore the 'Exploration Glitch' for the purposes of this explanation (since it doesn't technically 'complete' any dungeons insomuch as you do not enter and leave the dungeon by using it). Much love to Zelda Chaos and Speedrun.com among other sites.  With wall-clipping, you can get on top of Death Mountain before finishing the Desert Palace (and presumably Eastern Palace, though I can't find any videos confirming that since all speedrunners want to get the Pegasus boots as fast as possible). From there, you can use the Death Mountain Descent glitch to enter the rest of the Dark World, giving you access to virtually all of the dungeons. But which ones can you complete right away?  By using Death Mountain Descent and wall-clipping, you could enter any of the Light World dungeons first. The Bow, Power Glove, and Moon Pearl are all unnecessary for completing any Light World dungeons, so each one is as fair a start as any other.  While you can enter Dark Palace first (using the Kiki Skip glitch to prevent turning into a bunny), you do need the Bow to complete it, so the only prerequisite here is complete East Palace before Dark Palace.  It looks like you do need the hammer to enter the Swamp Palace, so the East Palace has to be done before that (You can turn from bunny to human by using the Metamorphosis Fairy glitch).  As for Skull Woods, I cannot find any way to enter Skull Woods without the Power Glove and Hammer, so (unless I'm missing something) you must do either Desert Palace or Thieves' Town first, as well as Dark Palace. Additionally, I cannot find a way to properly enter the second half of this dungeon without using the Fire Rod on the overworld, which Bunny Link can't do, so you need to complete the Tower of Hera first too.  You can wall-clip into the Village of Outcasts to get to Thieves' Town early, but it looks like you need the Moon Pearl to do anything in this dungeon, as well as the Pegasus Boots (to collect a necessary key) and the Hammer (to collect the Titan's Mitt). BE WARNED! If you complete Thieves' Town before Desert Palace and collect the Power Glove after the Titan's Mitt, your Titan's Mitt will be permanently gone. This will make completing the game awkward at best.  Using warp glitches and clips, you can enter Ice Palace without the Titan's Mitt, but you'll need the Fire Rod from Skull Woods to beat it, and the Hammer to access the boss.  I can't find any way to access Misery Mire without the Ether Medallion, which requires the Master Sword, which requires all three Light World dungeons completed. Since you can use a wall-clip (in front of the Dark World version of the woods where you normally find the flute) to get into Misery Mire without the Flute, you only otherwise need the Hammer to access that dungeon.  A precise wall-clip can get you into Turtle Rock without the Quake Medallion, but you still need the Cane of Somaria and the Fire Rod to complete it.  And I can't find any way to access Ganon's Tower without completing the other seven Dark World dungeons, so that one should always be last.  In conclusion...  EDIT: Fixed minor capitalization/spelling issues and the misplaced Ice Palace in the list.  A Link to the Past   Start -> Hyrule Castle   After Hyrule Castle -> East Palace, Desert Palace, Tower of Hera   After East Palace, Desert Palace, and Tower of Hera -> Return to Hyrule Castle   After East Palace -> Dark Palace   After Dark Palace -> Swamp Palace   After Tower of Hera and Dark Palace -> Thieves' Town   After [Thieves' Town] or [Tower of Hera, Dark Palace, and Desert Palace] -> Skull Woods   After Skull Woods -> Ice Palace   After East Palace, Desert Palace, Tower of Hera, and Dark Palace -> Misery Mire   After Misery Mire and Skull Woods -> Turtle Rock   Last -> Ganon's Tower"

EDIT: To clarify, going out of bounds in between dungeons (i.e., moving from the Tail Cave map to the Turtle Rock map without entering Turtle Rock through the overworld) is not counted as completing the dungeons for the purposes of this guide.  My experiments are probably not all-encompassing, so I almost certainly missed a few things. I cannot find a way to enter Bottle Grotto without Bow-Wow (even the screenwarp glitch isn't helpful here) so I think you absolutely must complete Tail Cave before it. EDIT: You can apparently kill the Goponga Flowers guarding it with the Magic Rod, L2 Sword, or even the Hookshot. However, you absolutely need to use the Roc's Feather to collect the Power Bracelet and fight the boss regardless.  In Key Cavern, you need the Power Bracelet to exit the first room of the dungeon, and since the door south of this room is the dungeon's entrance, the screenwarp won't help you here either.  I haven't spent time testing this one out yet, but as far as I can tell, the screenwarp should allow you to complete Angler's Tunnel first (you can definitely get the Angler key without completing any dungeons, and it looks like the screenwarp will let you find the Flippers and complete the dungeon without ever using any other dungeon items). I'll actually run this test later when I have the time and patience to. EDIT: Tested and confirmed.  I could swear that I remember seeing a video of someone using a glitch to enter Catfish's Maw without the flippers, but for the life of me I can't find it anywhere. In that case, you would need to complete Angler's Tunnel first at the very least. Regardless, you need the Roc's Feather to do anything beyond enter the dungeon.  Face Shrine, shockingly, seems to be fairly simple. You only need the Roc's Feather and Flippers to access it, and with proper planning and screenwarping, you can complete it without any other dungeon items!  You need the Hookshot and Roc's Feather to collect the Bird Key, and a Power Bracelet to grab the metal ball inside. It looks like you can access and complete Eagle Tower with only those items by screenwarping.  Finally, we have Turtle Rock. If you use wallclipping, it only requires the Roc's Feather and Hookshot to complete (aside from the Bow and Bombs). And you can access it without the Mirror Shield if you use secret medicine. Though you can theoretically access Turtle Rock without the song, it requires so much luck and precision that I would argue you essentially need the Power Bracelet to get the song. EDIT: I've found information on a glitch: If you screenwarp down from the lowest screen on the overworld map, it wraps you back around to the highest screen on the overworld map, allowing you to access the Turtle Rock warp and other entrance without the Power Bracelet  EDIT: Though you can fight the final boss within minutes of starting the game because of the screenwarp glitch, you never technically enter the Wind Fish's Egg to do so, and therefore it does not count as completing the dungeon by our earlier definition.  So in conclusion,  Link's Awakening   First -> Tail Cave or Angler's Tunnel   After Tail Cave -> Bottle Grotto   After Tail Cave and Angler's Tunnel -> Catfish's Maw, Face Shrine   After Face Shrine or Bottle Grotto -> Key Cavern   After Catfish's Maw -> Turtle Rock   After Catfish's Maw and [Bottle Grotto] or [Face Shrine] -> Eagle Tower   Last -> Wind Fish's Egg   Link's Awakening DX  This seems more straightforward without the screenwarp glitch. You must complete the levels in order, except you can complete Turtle Rock, Eagle Tower, and Face Shrine in any order. (EDIT: Any order, so long as they are the sixth, seventh, and eighth dungeons you do. You can choose which order you complete them in, but they will still be after all other dungeons, bar the Wind Fish's Egg)  Link's Awakening DX   First -> Tail Cave   After Tail Cave -> Bottle Grotto   After Bottle Grotto -> Key Cavern   After Key Cavern -> Angler's Tunnel   After Angler's Tunnel -> Catfish's Maw   After Catfish's Maw -> Face Shrine, Eagle Tower, Turtle Rock   Last -> Wind Fish's Egg"
truezelda,2zmj6g,starlitepony,2,Sun Mar 22 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"Seriously mate, this is all fantastic. I tried to figure out Twilight Princess last night and just got lost haha. You're doing god's work."
truezelda,2zmj6g,starlitepony,2,Sun Mar 22 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time  I still can't be sure whether I was looking forward to this one, or dreading it. There are a hell of a lot of glitches in this game as I'm sure you're aware, so let's just categorize why you can do practically all of the dungeons in any order. Seriously, take a look at these glitches. They're really cool to see.  Obviously you can do the Deku Tree at the start of the game. There are countless ways to escape Kokiri Forest early, so let's assume the player leaves without entering the Deku Tree.  As you can see, Dodongo's Cavern can be completed without the Fairy Slingshot, and while I'm sure it can be completed without the Goron Bracelet (no word on whether or not it can be done without Bombchus too), you can get Saria's Song before completing the Deku Tree (it becomes available as soon as you have Zelda's Lullaby) so there's no need to skip the Bracelet.  It took a bit of tracking down to find, but it is possible to enter Jabu-Jabu's Belly without a Slingshot. After collecting the Boomerang, you can skip the Big Octo with a megaflip off of a Biri and a pause buffered roll, taking you almost directly to the boss.  So you can complete any of the child dungeons in any order. The Door of Time skip is so well known that I won't go into details on it, but can you complete a child dungeon as an adult first?  You can glitch into the Deku Tree as an adult without using any items except the shield, so there's no requirement against entering it first. I can't find any videos of it, but will naturally assume you can collect the Slingshot as adult Link. Since you won't have Din's Fire or the Bow by this point, you'll have to climb up to the top of the dungeon and jump down through the web like child Link. In the basement, you can superslide off of a Deku Baba to access the bottom floor (they use a Hookshot in the video to climb back up to the loading zone, but I don't believe it's needed for the glitch. Regardless, you can collect the Hookshot as an adult without entering any dungeons). Gohma is still weak to Deku Nuts, which adult Link can use, so this is a possible first dungeon.  Dodongo's Cavern can easily be entered as adult Link (for the sake of simplicity, we'll assume you've collected the Goron's Bracelet as a child, again without entering any dungeons). A precise jump as adult Link allows you to skip a fair part of the dungeon and access the Bombs, and the rest of the dungeon is trivial.  It is hard as hell and needlessly precise to enter Jabu-Jabu as an adult, but requires Bombchus which we don't have. The only real place we can get them without beating any dungeons is the Carpet Merchant in the Haunted Wasteland. Precise alignment will allow you to cross the river of sand without the Longshot or Hover Boots (I can't find videos of adult Link doing so, but I imagine it's equally simple). I've read in a lot of places that it is possible to access the Carpet Merchant without Hover Boots or Bomb hovering, but I can't find any videos of how to do so (Alternatively, perhaps it is possible to collect 40 Gold Skulltulas Tokens and earn the reward of 10 Bombchus, though I haven't verified this). Regardless, even if we assume this is possible, there are a few flaws with this setup:   Barinade apparently cannot be killed without the Boomerang, which adult Link cannot normally wield. The only way around this is to use the Bottle Adventure glitch with 14 Deku Nuts and a fish on the C-right button, and assign the Boomerang to the B-button. The Bottle Adventure glitch can only be done by changing from adult Link to child Link and back again, which requires completing the Forest Temple. Even if you do complete the Forest Temple first, picking up the Boomerang would undo the effects of Bottle Adventure (making the dungeon impossible to complete). You could collect the Boomerang afterwards, though this would necessitate a second trip into the dungeon.   So Jabu-Jabu's Belly cannot under any circumstances be completed as adult Link as your first dungeon, but the other two could be.  Now let's take a look at the three mini-dungeons in the game as child Link. There are many ways to access the Bottom of the Well as a child before entering any other dungeons. And this dungeon is... shockingly easy to complete, requiring no items but the Ocarina and Zelda's Lullaby.  The Ice Cavern is, unfortunately, less simple. Accessing it as a child requires Bombchus, likely meaning the completion of another dungeon (unless you can reach the Carpet Merchant as a child or find 40 Gold Skulltula Tokens, which I highly doubt). That being said, the mini-dungeon itself can be done with just the Deku Sticks, more Bombchus, and Bombs, so Dodongo's Cavern must be completed first (making it irrelevant whether or not other ways to get Bombchus as child Link are possible).  For the Gerudo Training Ground, you can use the infamous cucco jump to get into the Gerudo Fortress as a child and then align a jumpslash properly to clip into this mini-dungeon. Better yet, you can collect the Ice Arrows here with a clip using a Bombchu. Unfortunately, though there are Bombchus in the mini-dungeon, they ironically require a Bomb or Bombchu to collect as child Link, making it impossible for this to be your first dungeon.  Now for adult Link, well... It looks like he can enter the Bottom of the Well with Bombchus and Bombs, but you can't actually pass the first room because of the crawlspace that only child Link can fit in. Though some wrong warp antics can get you past that point, you still cannot enter the room with the Lens of Truth in any way, making this dungeon impossible to complete.  The Ice Cavern is much easier as an adult. I mean... it can be entered with no special items and completed with no special items. Can't get much easier than that.  It doesn't require any special items to enter the Gerudo Training Ground as adult Link. There are two options for completing this dungeon as adult Link, since the wall clip child Link used will no longer work: Collect seven keys and finish it normally, or collect the 'blind the statue' key and glitch to the Ice Arrows. The latter requires the Bow from the Forest Temple, whereas the former requires, if not the Bow, a combination of at least two of the following: EDIT: just one of the following, since adult Link can collect Bombchus without entering a dungeon: Bombs/Bombchus, Iron Boots, Silver gauntlets.  EDIT TO ADD: I realize in hindsight that collecting Bombchus in the Spirit Temple as child Link requires Bomb hovering (meaning Dodongo's Cavern must already be completed), making collecting Bombchus there less important. I've edited the recap to adjust to this.  So, let's take a break here and recap the child dungeons and mini-dungeons.  Deku Tree: Possible as first dungeon as a child or an adult Dodongo's Cavern: Possible as first dungeon as a child or an adult Jabu-Jabu's Belly: Possible as first dungeon as a child. Requires completion of Forest Temple (and likely completion of Shadow Temple/Dodongo's Cavern/Gerudo Training Grounds/Bottom of the Well) as an adult. Requires two trips to complete as an adult. Bottom of the Well: Possible as first dungeon as a child. Impossible to complete as an adult. Ice Cavern: Possible as first dungeon as an adult. Requires completion of Dodongo's Cavern as a child. Gerudo Training Ground: Likely requires completion of Dodongo's Cavern/Bottom of the Well as a child. Requires completion of 1) Two of Ice Cavern, Child Spirit Temple, Dodongo's Cavern/Bottom of the Well; or 2) Forest Temple."
truezelda,2zmj6g,starlitepony,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:34:46 2015 UTC,"Alright, I have a fairly small update to make to the child dungeons/mini-dungeons of Ocarina of Time. I've been extensively studying the Bottle Adventure and Reverse Bottle Adventure glitches to see how they could interact with the dungeons, among other small details. I've also prepared some small updates and findings about earlier games, which I have edited into my earlier posts, with notes. I also learned a lot about Ocarina of Time's glitches, and am eager to study it in more detail in the future. Also, I promise I am working on the adult dungeons as well.  Regardless, here's what I now have.  There are 49 Gold Skulltula Tokens that adult Link can get without entering any dungeons (or 53 if you use certain glitches). This means you can get the Bombchus from the House of Skulltula without entering dungeons, but only as an adult. Regardless, the use of Reverse Bottle Adventure allows you to get as many Bombchus as needed, or at least to set your Bombchu count to 29 whenever you take the time to do the glitch with Bottled Bugs and a Poe, which you can do as many times as needed. So let's just assume that, unless you need more than 29 Bombchus at a time, adult Link will always have as many Bombchus as needed.  I tried very hard to figure out if young Link could even do RBA because there isn't much information on that, but I finally found videos of such. However, we have a few issues with this: Though I have not found definite information on it, I am nearly positive that even if you use RBA to set his Bombchu count to 29 in the same way as adult Link, you still will not be able to use any Bombchus until you have them in your inventory. And even if using the regular Bottle Adventure glitch would work in that sense, the item that assigns a Bottle to the Bombchu slot is the Ocarina of Time, which we obviously do not have. What this means is, as far as I can find, we absolutely CANNOT collect Bombchus as child Link without completing Dodongo's Cavern (to get them from Bombchu Bowling or the Bombchu Shop), the Bottom of the Well, the child side of the Spirit Temple, the Gerudo Training Ground, Ganon's Castle, or the Forest Temple (to collect them as an adult and then travel back in time). However, once we do any of those, we can use RBA in the same way to have 29 Bombchus whenever we need them.  I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out if you could get the Giant's Wallet as a child in order to buy the Blue Fire, saving us from needing Bombs in the Ice Cavern. However, there are only 35 Gold Skulltula Tokens that young Link can get without entering dungeons, and since 11 of them require items that we don't have, we can only collect 24 of them (or 25 with a wallclip glitch). That's not enough to earn the Giant's Wallet, and though RBA can give us the Adult's Wallet which we can turn into the Giant's Wallet if we have 10 Gold Skulltula tokens, this absolutely requires the Pocket Cucco, which means we need to already be an adult to do this, making it useless. Regardless, I clearly forgot that you can easily access Blue Fire along the way in the Ice Cavern, meaning you'll still need Bombchus to enter/complete the dungeon as a child, but not Bombs.  Another important note is that you can use the RBA as adult Link with the Broken Goron's Sword and a Fish in order to glitch the game into giving you the Forest Medallion (as well as the Shadow and Spirit Medallions, but those are less important for now). Though this will take away the Light Medallion permanently, with no known way to glitch it back, the Light Medallion never is actually used for any purpose in the game. I don't know if this is sufficient for A) allowing adult Link to go back in time without entering any dungeons, and B) allows you to still fight the dungeon's boss that have the Medallion for (since this is necessary for our definitions of completing a dungeon, and there is no way to remove the Shadow Medallion from our status with glitches).  If A is true but not B, then you can collect Bombchus/Bombs as an adult and then complete the Shadow Temple, then do the Broken Goron Sword RBA glitch and go back in time with the Bombchus/Bombs for young Link.  If A and B are both true, young Link and adult Link both have immediate access to Bombs and Bombchus without entering any dungeons thanks to this glitch.  if neither A or B is true (or even if just A is not true), then we will still have to complete one of the previous dungeons to get Bombchus as a child.  EDIT: Changed a 'child' to 'adult'. SECOND EDIT: Noted that, if A and B are true, you can complete Jabu-Jabu's Belly as an adult without entering the Forest Temple.  So then this is now our updated listing:  Ocarina of Time, child dungeons/mini-dungeons as child   Not A     Start -> Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Jabu-Jabu's Belly, Bottom of the Well     After Bottom of the Well/Dodongo's Cavern/Child Spirit Temple/Ganon's Tower/Forest Temple -> Ice Cavern, Gerudo Training Ground    A but not B     Start -> Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Jabu-Jabu's Belly, Bottom of the Well     After Bottom of the Well/Dodongo's Cavern/Child Spirit Temple/Ganon's Tower/Forest Temple/Shadow Temple -> Ice Cavern, Gerudo Training Ground    A and B     Start -> Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Jabu-Jabu's Belly, Bottom of the Well, Ice Cavern, Gerudo Training Grounds   Ocarina of Time, child dungeons/mini-dungeons as adult   Not A     Start -> Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Ice Cavern     After Forest Temple -> Jabu-Jabu's Belly     After [Forest Temple] or [Ice Cavern] or [Child Spirit Temple] -> Gerudo Training Grounds     Never -> Bottom of the Well    A but not B     Start -> Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Ice Cavern     After [Forest Temple] or [Shadow Temple]  -> Jabu-Jabu's Belly     After [Forest Temple] or [Ice Cavern] or [Child Spirit Temple] -> Gerudo Training Grounds     Never -> Bottom of the Well    A and B     Start -> Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, Ice Cavern, Jabu-Jabu's Belly     After [Forest Temple] or [Ice Cavern] or [Child Spirit Temple] -> Gerudo Training Grounds     Never -> Bottom of the Well"
truezelda,2zmj6g,Jammintk,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:26:37 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time (Continued)  I will refer to (A) and (B) at specific points during this post, both referring back to an earlier comment about the use of Reverse Bottle Adventure to glitch certain Medallions and Spiritual Stones into your inventory. ""If A is true"" means ""if having Medallion/Spiritual Stone X allows you to do Y, when Y normally requires X"". For example, ""if I glitch my inventory to have the Forest Medallion, can I travel back in time, which usually requires the Forest Medallion?"" (A is true in general, because using RBA to give you the Shadow and Spirit Medallions will allow you to collect the Light Arrows, which usually requires those Medallions. I do not know for certain if A is true in regards to going back in time with the Forest Medallion, or summoning the Great Fairy with the Goron's Ruby.)  ""If B is true"" means ""if I glitch the game to give me Medallion/Spiritual Stone X, will the boss of dungeon X still be there?"" I don't know at all whether or not this is true, but if it is not, that would mean we must complete the Shadow Temple before using RBA with Medallions and Jabu-Jabu's Belly before using RBA with Spiritual Stones, since those are the only ones that can never be removed with RBA.  Alright, without further ado, let's look at the adult dungeons of Ocarina of Time.  So the Forest Temple can be entered with nothing beyond the Hookshot. It is very easy to skip the entirety of the dungeon and fight the final boss, but we need to collect the Bow to truly 'complete' the dungeon. There are glitches to skip past the Song of Time blocks and access the courtyard, and aside from that the rest of the dungeon before the Bow is trivial to complete with just the Hookshot.  The Fire Temple is accessible with just the Hookshot, and the Goron Tunic can be earned without Bombs by using the Bomb Flowers in the area. However, completion of the dungeon requires Bombs or Bombchus at a few points throughout, so you'll have to use the RBA glitch to stock up on the latter before starting this one. Using a specific Bombchu hover you can skip two locked doors in the dungeon, and by using a glitch to bypass another locked door, you can skip up to three keys later on, one of which would require you to use the Song of Time. The rest of the dungeon can be completed as normal.  As for the Water Temple, this one is a lot more complicated. You can enter it without the Iron Boots with a precise Hookshot use. I'm sure you're familiar with Din's Dive from the Uber Challenge, which will allow you to 'dive' underwater without the Iron Boots, though of course we'll need Din's Fire to do this. To earn Din's Fire, we need to have a Magic Meter, as the game will simply not allow us to collect or use the item otherwise, but it also won't let us get a Magic Meter until after Dodongo's Cavern is completed, so we're a bit out of luck there. So it's time to check back to RBA fun!  We can glitch the game into giving us the Goron Ruby (and Zora's Sapphire, which is less necessary) by using RBA with a Bottled Fairy and the Odd Potion on C-Right while Link is an adult. If A is true, we can access the Magic Meter before actually completing that dungeon (and if A and B are true, we can do so without completing any other dungeons too, since we can become child Link again). On the downside, if B is not true, then we'd need to complete Jabu-Jabu's Belly and either the Shadow Temple or the Forest Temple before doing this, since the latter would be required to reverting back in time. Of course, we could simply complete the Ice Cavern instead, negating any need to use Din's Dive.  Regardless, there is another way to dive underwater using Navi's enemy text on the Tektite, though it's an incredibly hard 1-frame trick, but it would mean you could take on the Water Temple without any other dungeons. In any case, we can use a precise sidehop to get to a small key earlier than intended (requiring only Bombs or Bombchus to access). Then you can save and quit to get back to the start of the dungeon or use this cool glitch to do so.  Alright, here's where things get complicated, since we need to access the top floor of the Water Temple while the water level is low, and there are a few ways to do this. I believe you can Z-Target the Tektite from the entrance ledge, which would allow you to get the Infinite Sword Glitch and Bombchu hover towards the platform, but I can't be positive of this. There are a few other options for us.   Collect the Hover Boots from the Shadow Temple before entering the Water Temple. Collect Bombs ahead of time so you can Bomb hover over. This can be done as Adult Link without completing Dodongo's Cavern by first using RBA with a Bottled Fish and Cojiro on C-Right to give yourself the biggest Bomb Bag and a regular Quiver. Then, by using the RBA glitch while you have Bombs on C-Right (only possible the first time you become adult Link) overwrite the empty Bomb slot in your inventory with a Bottle. Then you can collect Bomb drops as normal. However, from then on whenever you do finally grab the Bombs from the chest in Dodongo's Cavern (which you will eventually have to do to complete the dungeon), your Bombchus will be replaced forever with a Bomb Bag item which is effectively worthless. This may highly limit our dungeon order or force Dodongo's Cavern to the end if we choose to do this. In addition, I can't find any information for sure on whether or not you can then turn the Bottle in the Bomb slot of your inventory back to Bombs in any way. If not, then this glitch would prevent you from even using Bombs as a child. There is a similar use of RBA to glitch the game into letting you use the Bow before collecting it. With Cojiro and a Bottled Fish to get the Quiver like in the previous paragraph, you can put a Bottle on the empty Bow spot in your inventory if you have the Fire Arrows, Ice Arrows, or Light Arrows: Just catch something in an Empty Bottle and mid-swing, change the C-Button that the Bottle is on with one of the Magical Arrows. The game will now drop arrows, and this can be done even without a Magic Meter. Note that this requires completing the Gerudo Training Grounds or completing the Spirit and Shadow Temples, or using RBA to get those Medallions to get the Light Arrows (which would mean completing the Shadow Temple first if B is not true). I realized we could use RBA with an Empty Bottle and the aforementioned glitched Bomb Bag on C-Right to get 20 keys for the Water Temple, which is more than enough to complete it, but would limit us unnecessarily for the rest of the Water Temple. Simply collect the Iron Boots instead and complete the dungeon more or less normally up to this point.   To get to the Longshot, we'll need to use only two keys since we can just jump to raise the water back to its highest point. One of those keys can easily be collected as mentioned before, but the other one would require either Din's Fire, the Bow, or Iron Boots.   Now, we can complete the dungeon so far in any case with Iron Boots and Bombs/Bombchus. If A and B are true and we can Z-Target the Tektite from the entrance way, we can complete it so far with just Bombs/Bombchus and Din's Fire, meaning we wouldn't need to enter any other dungeons first. If B is not true, but we can Z-Target the Tektite from the entrance way, we can Bombchu hover to the middle pillar but will need the Bow (meaning completing the Forest Temple or using the awkward arrow RBA) or Din's Fire (meaning completing Dodongo's Cavern, or completing both Jabu-Jabu's Belly and either the Forest Temple or the Shadow Temple). If we cannot Z-Target the Tektite from the entrance way, we would need Hover Boots or Bombs to continue, meaning we would need to complete the Shadow Temple, Dodongo's Cavern, or do the awkward RBA that will eventually ruin our Bombchus. If we did not complete Dodongo's Cavern, we would either need the Bow to get the second key, or to complete Jabu-Jabu's Belly and the Shadow Temple before our RBA glitches to get Din's Fire.   Following me so far? I hope you can see why we all hate the Water Temple so much. Either way, we have two keys and are en route to the Longshot, which is no different from the usual. Once we get the Longshot, we can't continue on because we don't have the Song of Time, but we can save and quit to return to the start of the dungeon. I don't know if the dragon-head statue leading to the boss door stays 'up' after saving and quitting (it's really hard to find answers to obscure questions like this without actually playing the game for myself to test it), but even if it doesn't you can retrace your steps until you re-enter the room with the crystal switch to raise them, and then head back normally into the first room. From here, use the Longshot on the dragon-head target to enter the path to the boss door. Though we don't have a key, we can glitch in using either Bombchus or by using Bombs. Morpha is still a pushover, so thank god this temple is finally done."
truezelda,2zmj6g,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:33:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, the Shadow Temple is thankfully ridiculously easy in comparison. In order to even enter the Shadow Temple, you will need to have the Forest, Water, and Fire Medallions, or Bombs to glitch into it, or by using Bombchus. Getting the Hover Boots is trivial either way (keep in mind that you never actually need the Lens of Truth at any point), and by dropping through the invisible floor in the first silver rupee room in the dungeon, you arrive at a gate you can glitch through, taking you virtually to the final boss. Instead of shooting down the statue at the end with a Bow, you can just put your new Hover Boots to work and then you can glitch past the boss door with a Bomb or with a Bombchu. Bongo Bongo can be defeated with the Hookshot instead of the Bow, so this dungeon is complete.  There are two sides to the Spirit Temple, which we will separate into the Child Spirit Temple (completion being defined as defeating the Iron Knuckle and collecting the Silver Gauntlets) and the Adult Spirit Temple (completion being defined as defeating Twinrova and collecting the Mirror Shield).  It is possible to glitch past the first crawlspace into the Child Spirit Temple with just Bombs and the Hover Boots, and past the second one with a Hookshot clip, but none of this is actually necessary. There are many ways to hover up to the ledge that the Silver Gauntlets are on! (The videos all show Link hovering to the Mirror Shield ledge, but they should all be possible to do to the Silver Gauntlets as well by changing your angle.)  If you're insane, you could do a Guay hover that requires only a sword and shield, but takes about 25 minutes (the best part about this one is that, since you never walk on the wall between the Mirror Shield ledge and the Silver Gauntlets ledge, with a proper angle this trick is guaranteed to work to take you to the Silver Gauntlets). If you want to do this a different way, you will need to have Bombs and Bombchus to hover up to the wall (the Hookshot should work instead of the Bow for the short jumps in this video), from where you can either continue to Bomb hover up towards the Silver Gauntlets chest, or just Hookshot up onto it. If you want to use Bombchus instead of Bombs it seemingly requires the Hover Boots as well. Finally, you could use Bombs and the Hover Boots instead of Bombchus. Since you can immediately enter the end of the child side of the Spirit Temple from this position, you can kill the Iron Knuckle there in seconds and collect the Silver Gauntlets with no difficulties (I do not know if having the Black/Green Gauntlets before collecting the Silver Gauntlets will have any negative effects, but I believe it will just turn them into Blue Gauntlets, which is only cosmetically different and therefore not an issue).  As for the adult side of the Spirit Temple, you can jump up to the Mirror Shield's location in the same way. Since you're skipping half of the dungeon, there aren't very many things you need to do out of the ordinary. At some points you'll need to use Bombs or Bombchus to blow up a fake wall, and you can use a minor glitch to skip the need for the Bow to get the boss key. Aside from that, I think you need the Longshot to reach the grate for the boss door, or you can reach it with the Hookshot by using two bombs with this cool clip.

truezelda,2zmj6g,Biggorons_Blade,3,Sun Mar 29 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"NES Zelda, First Quest  This game is a lot more free than the others, you can enter many dungeons in any order. I don't know if you can use the screenscroll glitch to enter level 4 before level 3, but I'll assume you can't. You need to collect the Ladder in level 4 before you can finish levels 5 or 6, and the Whistle from 5 before you complete level 7. You also need the Bow from level 1 to complete level 6.  EDIT: I did experiment with the screenscroll glitch, and you cannot use it to warp north into a water tile. Instead, the game will just let you move a bit below the border of the screen. Though you can warp to the screen with level 4 from the right, you will end up stuck on a water tile behind a mountain tile and cannot move, forcing you to reset the game. Also, because collecting the Magical Key is technically part of my definition of completing the dungeon, you need the Bow to complete dungeon 8 too, to defeat a Gohma.  The only rules are: 3 before 4. 4 before 5. 1 and 5 before 6. 5 before 7. All others before 9.  NES Zelda, Second Quest  You need whistle from level 2 before you can enter level 3 or 6. Again, unless the screenscroll glitch works for it, you need the raft from level 4 before you can enter level 5. You need the bow from from level 5 before you can finish level 6, and the ladder from level 6 to finish level 7 or 8.  So for this game, you have to do 2 before 3, and 2->4->5->6->7->8->9 with 1 happening anywhere in that chain, and 3 anywhere after 2.  EDIT: The following lists correct small errors I made in the orders.  FIRST QUEST   First -> The Eagle, The Moon, The Manji   After The Eagle -> The Lion   After The Manji -> The Snake   After The Snake -> The Lizard   After The Snake and The Eagle -> The Dragon   After The Lizard -> The Demon   Last -> Death Mountain  SECOND QUEST   First -> Letter E, Letter A   After Letter A -> Letter L, Letter D   After Letter D -> Letter Z   After Letter Z -> Junk Data   After Junk Data -> The Inner Spiral, The Outer Spiral   Last -> Ganon's Skull   Zelda II  The Healer Glitch messes with the game's understanding of Link's horizontal position on the screen and leads into very unusual glitches, so with enough trial and error it would be theoretically possible to complete the dungeons in any order (with the exception that you absolutely must complete Midoro Palace before the Great Palace, and would inherently skip several dungeons by doing this). Assuming you could set up the proper positioning of Link with the glitch (and keep in mind that this particular positioning may or may not exist), you could potentially complete the dungeons in any order. Or maybe you'd need to complete Midoro Palace and find the handy glove before finishing Maze Palace and Hidden Palace. I don't know, the glitch is weird.  EDIT: Turns out I knew nothing about that glitch. I experimented with it for myself and I found that it's more limited than I thought (though still beautiful). It can warp you from one 'location tile' on the map to a specific other location tile, such as from Rauru to King's Tomb or from the Nabooru Cave to the Southeast Swamp Cave, but cannot warp you to non-location tiles (other than specific tiles in the water or on mountains that cannot be crossed and require the game to be reset). It also doesn't let you 'teleport' through dungeons, so much as it lets you exit the left side of any screen without scrolling through the screen. This means three things for us.  1. Since the Raft and boss in Island Palace are each to the right of screens walled off by blocks, you cannot warp past them by using the Healer Glitch scroll lock, and therefore cannot complete them before collecting the Handy Glove in Midoro Palace.  2. Though you can warp to Maze Island and therefore access Eastern Hyrule without the Raft, you cannot talk to people in houses while the Healer Glitch screen lock is active, meaning you cannot learn the Reflect spell needed to defeat the boss of Maze Palace, and therefore cannot complete the dungeon before collecting the Raft from the Island Palace.  3. Since there are no 'location tiles' on the island with the Ocean Palace, you cannot warp there, and since the Hidden Palace will not appear without the Flute, you cannot enter it even if you access Southeastern Hyrule with this glitch.  Without that one glitch, the dungeon order is more straightforward. Parapa Palace can be completed at any time before the Great Palace, but all other palaces must be completed in order.  I'll try to figure out all the orders the other games can be done in.  EDIT: Added data on this game as well.  Zelda II   First -> Parapa Palace, Midoro Palace   After Midoro Palace -> Island Palace, Great Palace (end)   After Island Palace -> Maze Palace   After Maze Palace -> Ocean Palace   After Ocean Palace -> Hidden Palace"
truezelda,2zk2s0,ItsZant,36,Thu Mar 19 05:35:36 2015 UTC,"Cremia.  Playing through her story in Majora's Mask, you discover that she is one of the saddest, most mature characters in the game--possibly the entire series.  You have a lot of characters, like Colin and Groose, kind of growing up and maturing and becoming a very developed character, but Cremia feels the most human.  She already has so much to bare when you first meet her, and as the three days go on, she has even more hardship even if you succeed.  You find out that Cremia is in a love triangle with Kafei and Anju.  She is Anju's best friend she is also in love with Kafei and while she is still happy for her friend, she is still hurt that she cannot be with the one she loves.  Her job as the owner of the ranch, Cremia is plagued by the Gormon brothers who vandalize and try to ruin her business when she travels to Clock Town.  Then there is her relationship with her little sister, Romani.  First, there is the encounter with ""Them."" If Link fails to help Romani defend the barn, Romani is taken away (but returned the next day) with her memory wiped out.  Cremia now must mourn and care for her little sister on top of all her other problems.  On the last day (if Link was successful in helping Cremia and Romani) The sisters are seen in the barn, talking about the Carnival. Romani asks if she can have a mask to signify that she is matured into an adult, which also allows her to have the special Chateau Romani. She gives her sister happiness the best way she can before the moon falls.  She even asks Romani to sleep with her in her bed that night so she can hold her in the final moments.  I mean, for crying out loud, my heart broke when she said ""Tonight I'm kind of lonely. I welcome company.""  Cremia will always be the most bittersweet character for me, and that's why I love her so much.  Her, and the Postman for similar reasons. ""The mail is the top priority!"" Man, the letter he sends himself..."

truezelda,2zk2s0,Serbaayuu,28,Fri Mar 20 01:16:36 2015 UTC,"I'll go with Colin from Twilight Princess.  I enjoy having characters that doubt Link and what he can do, but it was a really cool experience to have a character that truly looked up to him. It's even better because he admires Link and recognizes Link's courage from the very start- it's not about Link's cool moves (like it is for the other Ordon kids), or even Link's accomplishments throughout the game that convinces others. His big moment in Kakariko is one of my favorite moments in the entire series.  One of the reasons TP is among my favorite games is largely because of this. Saving Hyrule is always fun, but TP took it further with several of the characters. Getting to inspire various characters, such as Colin, into taking positive and courageous actions of their own was a really great experience.  Midna is ultimately my favorite, but she's been discussed a lot so I went a different direction."
truezelda,2zk2s0,stryker101,6,Thu Mar 19 06:26:56 2015 UTC,"Great choice. I love Colin's character as well, and TP is my favorite Zelda game so naturally it has many of my favorite characters."

He had an obsession, and a reason for that obsession.  He did not want to rule Hyrule just to rule it, he wanted the wind that brought life, not death."
truezelda,2zk2s0,Remioli,6,Thu Mar 19 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"He has my favorite ganon design. And when you fight him, you're like right there face to face with him. Like most ganons feel like this beast who is above you and you take him down. But that fight almost feels personal."

truezelda,2zk2s0,jey123,33,Mon Mar 23 04:15:44 2015 UTC,"The Groose is Loose!  Groose from Skyward Sword really stands out in my mind. He starts out as this total douchebag that Link dislikes. It's brilliant; we dislike him so much because Link dislikes him. Link never really had a rival before (Mido wasn't a rival, just an ass), so it was cool to see someone who could challenge our hero.  He makes some really good points about what an airhead Link is and that he needs to straighten up if he wants to deserve Zelda. As it turns out, Groose was right. Link needed to transform into a narcoleptic lazybones to a bonafide hero in order to deserve Zelda.  He follows Link to the surface (in what is likely the funniest scene in any Zelda game) because he genuinely wants to find Zelda. He may be an ass, but he really does care. And when he realizes that Link is the hero of this tale, he accepts his role and grows as a person.   He looks after ""Granny"" and builds the Groosenator, without which Link couldn't have stopped the Imprisoned. And most importantly, he saves Zelda when Demise tossed her aside.   After Link comes back from his duel with Demise, Groose greets him enthusiastically as a friend, a big change from his earlier jerkiness. All throughout, he never loses his swagger and it becomes rather charming by the end.  In short, Groose challenges Link to become better, has a heart underneath the ego, develops as a person, and is just all around awesome."
truezelda,2zk2s0,henryuuk,10,Thu Mar 19 06:32:49 2015 UTC,"I actually think a really big part of his character is also the part where he accepts that, not only is Link 'the hero' and he isn't, he also accepts that Link and Zelda belong together, despite still clearly loving Zelda."

This is where the second person, not holding the controller comes in. Their job was to yell ""Now!"" at any given time.   Whoever was holding the controller had to go from spinning around, to hookshot out, and hit one of the boards and pull Link to it. If the hookshot dinged on metal, or a full rotation of the windmill happened before you fired, you lost. If you hit wood and pulled, you won.   We used it to settle disputes a couple times.

truezelda,2znp4c,negaprez,10,Fri Mar 20 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"I'd like Link to stay male. As the video pointed out, a lot of Zelda's lore is filled with female characters. The Triforce is a nice balance of good vs. evil. Theres one courageous male, a wise female which makes up the good part of the Triforce. And the evil is male. There's no logical way to turn Princess Zelda into a Prince Zelda. And I think if you're going to change one character, you might as well gender swap all of them. Why not get a male Impa? Why can't we see a female incarnation of Demise's hate? What about male incarnations of the three Golden Goddesses. Where are the Gods in Zelda? Zelda as a series always struck me as very balanced. It's female characters aren't all the same, the ratio of males to females seems fairly good, and no one gender suffers due to the other.  I'd much rather be able to play as Sheik on a quest, or even just play as Princess Zelda. I've actually been looking forward to a Sheik playable game for years ever since OoT came out."
truezelda,2znp4c,YoungGunSilver,3,Fri Mar 20 02:49:27 2015 UTC,"I hate this topic. Link should stay male in my opinion. Not because I don't want to play as a female character, just because Link shouldn't change. Samus should be a woman, Mario should be a man, Chell should be a woman, Gordon Freeman should be a man, silent protagonists shouldn't have to be a certain gender to appeal to us, I can get immersed in Zelda or Portal or Metroid equally."

Link doesn't have any particular Male traits that are sexist. In fact I would consider Link a very neutral blank slate when it comes to gender traits. So, what really would making him a female really change?  My suggestion would be, Make an original female character instead of taking a pre-existing character and swapping the gender."
truezelda,2znp4c,Serbaayuu,2,Fri Mar 20 10:55:18 2015 UTC,"'Miss Male character' isn't fixing anything.   And we have a name for it, brilliant, thank you."
truezelda,2znp4c,Serbaayuu,2,Fri Mar 20 11:25:36 2015 UTC,"Because slapping a pair of tits and a vagina onto the Hero isn't gender equality, it's pandering.  Link is male, and giving him female parts isn't going to change his character.  You know what would be cool?  Getting to actually play as one of the many female cast members of the series.  But, according to Polygon and everybody else who advocates for the genderbent Link, nobody except the male Hero is good enough to be a female playable character."
truezelda,2znp4c,The-Loch-CuteNess,2,Fri Mar 20 10:53:48 2015 UTC,I used to think that but after seeing the Hyrule Warriors concept art of Link being female I never want it -- her design was either a cute little girl in a frilly looking dress of his tunic or an adult sexy babe with crop tops.  I would like Link as a woman if it wasn't Link but rather a family member like Ayrll from Windwaker but I feel like Link doesn't need to be a woman the same reason Mario or Samus do not need to have their genders switched.  It's a fun idea but I think it's the sort of things that should stay for fanfics rather than the actual game.

Something that looks more like a moving painting, not necessarily in a cartoonish or childlike way, could be quite dark. I think that would be nice.  The issue with photorealism is that it limits design and Zelda tends to like being very imaginative in that respect (enemies, weapons, events' etc). For those who want an 'adult' Zelda, I would say that realism is not necessarily optimal in order to create a dark or macabre mood. Things like Rule of Rose or our very own Majora's Mask prove this... while most Zelda games are 'upbeat' it is not really an issue of them being non-realistic, it's the concept which is key.  I don't think there should be any inherent limits to design though. Whatever suits the gameplay and mood that the creators seek to establish should be fine."

I feel like the cartoony, WW-like feel needs to be retired for a while, considering we have it in 3 games now (unless you want to count 2D, making it more like 5). TP truly has the most unique art style of them all, as I feel it's the only one that uses its artstyle (the next closest thing is MM, which still isn't close). We've got 2 OoT style. ALBW I consider unique because it's kind of old school but put in a modern context of 3D graphics. All the 2D ones have a generally similar artstyle, considering the ability to express an artstyle was limited until the N64. So to end my rambling, I basically would say if we are gonna stick with what we have, maybe another TP style or ALBW style game would be nice, but it would be even better to explore something new, almost anything new. A new artstyle works best though when complimented with appropriate mechanics for that style as well as an appropriate story."

Would they tack it on at the end as an ""after the fact"" new story like Dragon Age: Awakening? Would it be a side-quest kind of narrative like the Mass Effect DLCs?   And if there was DLC, there would have to be new items and dungeons.  Maybe they could do a small side-game with another playable character. For example: OoT could have DLC where you play as Sheik setting up the events of the story and helping Link from the sidelines.   Nintendo is a game company that has thoroughly earned our trust, so if they decide to make Zelda DLC, I'll trust them to do it right."
truezelda,2zjcps,YoungGunSilver,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:18:41 2015 UTC,"If it was a cool story, I'd love DLC. I always thought that if Ocarina of Time was released today instead of back in '98, Majora's Mask would've been released as DLC."

truezelda,2zjcps,thebannedknight,0,Thu Mar 19 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and no recent Zeldas have had DLC"
truezelda,2zjcps,MrBoobieBuyer,3,Thu Mar 19 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"The only Zelda game they've released during this time, excluding remakes, was A Link Between Worlds. Seeing as Nintendo is still doing DLC, it's not too late at all for the next Zelda game to feature it. That said, if I had to guess, I'd say it's not going to happen either."
truezelda,2zeo7b,Stack42,24,Tue Mar 17 23:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think so, yes.  My reasoning for why he should be: if he isn't, the Hero and Goddess of the Minish Cap era don't have a Demise incarnation, which defies Demise's Curse - which shouldn't be possible.  This could be circumvented by giving those two characters another story in which a Demise incarnation appears and then is permanently killed, but since there's no reason to think that will ever happen, we must make assumptions with what we have.  My reasoning for why I don't think Vaati and Ganon existing at the same time is a problem: Vaati exists in all timelines.  By the timeline split, Vaati is sealed in the Four Sword, which continues to exist in all three timelines.  The Child timeline is the only one so far where he has been freed.  But, regardless of that, this is not an issue, because the Spirit of the Hero is also not limited to a singular incarnation.  In Twilight Princess, the Hero's Shade [Hero of Time] and the Hero of Twilight exist simultaneously.  In A Link Between Worlds, Gramps (heavily implied to be a previous, still-living Hero) and the ALBW Hero exist simultaneously.  There is no reason to think that Demise's incarnations cannot do the same.  Vaati fits Demise's motives, too - he craves power, godhood, and is driven by hate."

truezelda,2zeo7b,frigidsoul,1 point,Tue May 12 11:03:10 2015 UTC,Then why would there be a Legend focused on the adventure of the Hero saving her?
truezelda,2zeo7b,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sat May 23 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"Because it's a sequel, like Majora's Mask or similar.  The Original Hero got his set of incarnations (himself, Zelda (not-sleeping), and Ganon).  There doesn't need to be another one for that era."
truezelda,2zeo7b,henryuuk,2,Sun May 24 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"the Hero and Goddess of the Minish Cap era don't have a Demise incarnation, which defies Demise's Curse -   Demise's curse never states all three have to be present on all times And we have not seen CONFIRMED Links being ALIVE at the same time."
truezelda,2zeo7b,Serbaayuu,4,Wed Mar 18 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"It's not much of a curse if it's meant to read: ""I'll show up sometimes.  Like as Ganondorf.  And that'll be about it.""  And correct, not confirmed, but it's a hard argument to say that Gramps isn't a Hero, considering his arsenal, his strength, his mannerisms, and the fact that he is named ""Legendary"" when you battle him."
truezelda,2zeo7b,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:05:58 2015 UTC,"His curse is : ""I will never truly die and keep trying to plunge this world into darkness,death and destruction"" sounds like a good curse to me, to say to 2 souls that love the land of Hyrule intensely.    He could be a Hero that isn't a reincarnated Link, simple as that. There is no reason why Link needs to be all the heroes in all Legend of Zelda games and backstories at once."
truezelda,2zeo7b,Tsurii897,4,Wed Mar 18 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"Okay...I just wrote several sentences about why I think that it's impossible, since Vaati is still somewhere in the world (sealed away after Minish Cap) and Ganon appears/is born despite that and I simply thought it wouldn't make sense to have ""2 Demises"" at the same time (they even appear together in FSA), but then I remembered that there's 2 Zeldas in LoZ/AoL...  It's kinda hard to tell, imo. I guess it's possible, but the thing with Vaati is, that he doesn't look anything like Demise (like Malladus and Ganon), but...we don't know if that's how the curse works, he just said there would be an evil to haunt Link's and Hylia's/Zelda's ancestors, not he'd reincarnate like the other two."
truezelda,2zeo7b,Dismas423,4,Tue Mar 17 23:30:14 2015 UTC,"We don't know that every Zelda is an incarnation of Hylia. Zelda was popular name for Hyrulean princesses (and mandatory after AoL's backstory), but that doesn't mean every single Zelda is Hylia. I think the princesses who are born around the same time as a Hero are reincarnations of Hylia, and the rest are just normal members of the royal family."
truezelda,2zeo7b,Phoxxent,2,Wed Mar 18 03:02:58 2015 UTC,"Didn't the curse say ""carries the blood of hylia""? So, wouldn't it then apply the the whole royal family?"
truezelda,2zeo7b,Dismas423,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"I think it means that everyone affected by Demise's curse will be a descendant of Hylia, but not all of Hylia's descendants will be affected by the curse. If we take the curse literally, every single member of the Royal Family should be fighting Demise in some form. But Hyrule has had extended periods of peace under the Royal Family, so it makes more sense to say that only certain princesses are incarnations of Hylia."
truezelda,2zeo7b,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same thing actually, FSA kind of challenges this theory in some ways because that's the only time they appear in the same timeline. But it's possible Vaati was really gone after the first FS but Gannon somehow used his Demise powers to reawaken him in FSA, or maybe he just learned of him and helped awaken some form or incarnation of him, maybe something like the 2 Zeldas like you said, there's old Vaati and new Vaati."
truezelda,2zeo7b,henryuuk,2,Tue Mar 17 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"Vaati was sealed, not dead, after Four Swords.  He has in fact been around & alive longer than Ganondorf."

truezelda,2zeo7b,aiden_sullivan,3,Wed Mar 18 09:52:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, no. Ganondorf is the only (known) reincarnation of Demise at this point. Something that is shown in how much they look and act alike. Vaati was a minish that became corrupted, first by his curiosity and then by the power he got.     Malladus is unknown, but I don't think he is an incarnation of Demise's hatred. I'd say there is more chance that he came from the same realm as Demise and was sealed by the spirits of good."

But that's just me."
truezelda,2zevnx,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:31:17 2015 UTC,You start with 1 more heart container and the level 1 sword so you don't need to go through the cave of heroes.
truezelda,2zevnx,Phoxxent,6,Thu Mar 19 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"The canon story order is Seasons and then Ages, but the story doesn't really turn out that differently if you play Ages first.  However, there is a single tile on the map of Ages that you can't access unless you're playing a linked version of Ages (i.e., you need to play Seasons first in order to explore all of Ages's map).  On the other hand, Ages is probably harder than Seasons overall, so maybe you would prefer to get the harder game out of the way first. Also, Seasons places a little bit more emphasis on combat while Ages places a little bit more emphasis on puzzles, so that may affect your decision too.  There is one notable disadvantage to playing Seasons first though, IMO. In both games you are introduced to three animal partners. One of them becomes your permanent animal partner that you can call at any time though. In order to get this permanent partner though, you have to get a Flute. You can find the Flute on your own, but after so long of not getting the Flute, the game will just give you the Flute automatically. The permanent animal partner that you get depends on how you acquired the Flute.  If you play Seasons first and you never find the Flute before the game just gives it to you, you are stuck with the (IMO) worst of the three animal partners as your permanent partner. But if you play Ages first and you never find the Flute before the game just gives it to you, you get the (IMO) best of the three partners as your permanent partner. So if you don't think you'll find the Flute early enough in the game, it might be better to start with Ages so that the animal partner you're stuck with is one of the better ones."

I think you get to use all the animals at separate parts of the game even if you don't have their flute. If I recall you use mosh in a graveyard to get a key.  Either way, I absolutely hate moosh.

I finished both around the same time too so it worked out really well. That was the ultimate experience for me and since then these two games fall into my #2/3 spot for favorite Zelda game(s) with no particular preference.  The games were supposed to be part of a trilogy and got cut to two during development due to limitations. They were supposed to represent the pieces of the Triforce to my understanding.  Experiencing both games at the same time made me feel like I was experiencing all parts of the Triforce (Diforce?) rather than just one piece.  Maybe something worth considering."

It ended with Hyrule itself given a poetic death: lovingly destroyed by the king who knew he needed to pave way for the future.  Hyrule was lost forever and Ganon was destroyed.  Of course this only wraps up the story on that branch of the timeline.  But I think that the fact that Nintendo had to stretch out that timeline into Link and Tetra traveling to discover a new Hyrule with new and silly villains is proof that the events of Wind Waker dispelled Demise's prophecy for good."
truezelda,2zdoaq,dannyb21892,8,Tue Mar 17 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"Good point. Wind Waker's ending with the destruction of Hyrule was arguably one of the series' most powerful moments. I've never played Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks, but I'll admit, I was always a little flustered that they decided to continue that storyline/timeline."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Serbaayuu,7,Tue Mar 17 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"new and silly villains   You mean like Malladus, who is the spitting image of Ganon, making him almost certainly a Demise incarnation (supported even further by the fact that ST came out shortly before SS, so they probably had the story for Demise already planned out and created Malladus because of it)?"
truezelda,2zdoaq,dannyb21892,7,Tue Mar 17 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible that malladus is the same entity, but every time Ganon has been part of the story after Demise, he's been...well...Ganon.  Plus I don't see a means or a reason for Demises spirit to have followed them all that way. Isn't it more likely a new evil for a new Hyrule?"
truezelda,2zdoaq,Serbaayuu,13,Tue Mar 17 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"Malladus isn't Ganon, but he looks like him, just like Ganondorf resembles Demise, because Malladus is a Demise incarnation.  Ganon is most likely dead and gone forever in the Adult Timeline.  They made a pretty cut-and-dry point of leaving Old Hyrule behind.  Also, I really don't see why destroying Old Hyrule would end Demise's Curse anyway?  He isn't tied to Hyrule.  He is tied to Link and Zelda.  And the blood of the goddess and Spirit of the Hero are perfectly intact through New Hyrule, as evidenced by the fact that they still exist."
truezelda,2zdoaq,dannyb21892,7,Tue Mar 17 21:16:20 2015 UTC,I concede this argument to you. Your points are good.

I will say I think the spirit of your argument is correct, that Ganon and all he stood for is done and gone, and any villain (recurring or otherwise) we see in New Hyrule will have nothing to do with him, aside from sharing the same lust for power that all incarnations of Demise hold.  The end of Skyward Sword was simply a way to forever unite the main series villains under that notion, I think."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Dismas423,4,Tue Mar 17 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"Even if Malladus is an incarnation of Demise (which I think he is), he's still a rather flat character. He's not mysterious like Majora or tragic like WW Ganon. He's just a generic doomsday villain. I don't think it's totally out of place to call him ""silly."""
truezelda,2zdoaq,Dismas423,3,Tue Mar 17 21:40:32 2015 UTC,"... or tragic like WW Ganon   Now there's a whole discussion in and of itself. I often argue that WW Ganondorf's ""Wind"" monologue gives him more depth than any other Ganon incarnation in the entire series.   It provided a whole new angle to his evil; namely, how his evil ways were borne out of anger over what he saw as an injustice (the gerudo starving and struggling in the desert while the people of Hyrule flourished in their green lands). He was still just as much a villain, but his motives were understandable (as opposed to ""I wanna burn the world to the ground and be king of the ashes and corpses because evil""), which added so much to the game's story."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Serbaayuu,6,Tue Mar 17 23:15:29 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, this is the backstory for Ganon in every game except FSA. Every Ganon we see originated as a man with noble intentions, but he lost sight of his goal and became the monster we are familiar with.  WW Ganon is the only one that seems to regret his decisions, but, like the rest, he chooses power over any chance for peace or redemption. Ganon's tragedy is that he is a slave to his lust and will never choose to change."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:11:55 2015 UTC,"No, that monologue isn't why he's tragic.   as opposed to ""I wanna burn the world to the ground and be king of the ashes and corpses because evil""   Don't forget - this is the same timeline of Ganondorf who DID THAT.  Ganondorf's character has a tragic tilt because he was enabled by the Hylians to do what he did.  The Gerudo were part of that war before Ocarina of Time.  Ganondorf was likely forced to swear allegiance to the throne, just like Darunia and King Zora (...does he not have a name?).  He saw this as an opportunity for revenge, and took it.  Who knows how differently things would have turned out if Ganondorf wasn't welcomed into the castle in the first place?"
truezelda,2zdoaq,Dismas423,2,Wed Mar 18 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah no Malladus is totally silly.  Never said he wasn't, but then again so is pretty much every villain in the series aside from G-dorf himself."

He's visually similar to Ganon, he requires Zelda in order to be revived, and he's the only character besides Demise and Ganon to use the title ""Demon King"". I agree that WW is a fitting conclusion for Ganon, but Demise's curse might still have effect."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Dismas423,3,Tue Mar 17 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"I actually just went through the SS text dump, and it looks like  Demise never actually uses the title ""Demon King"".

(And as far as I can tell, the only time Ganon uses ""Demon King"" as an official title is in ALBW, interestingly.)

""Great Demon King Ganondorf""); in the latter, his beast form is titled 魔獣ガノン (lit. ""Demon Beast Ganon""). The North American release of Ocarina of Time uses ""Great King of Evil Ganondorf"" for his human form and simply ""Ganon"" for his bestial form, and the North American release of Twilight Princess uses ""Dark Lord Ganondorf"" and ""Dark Beast Ganon"", respectively."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Petrichor03,9,Wed Mar 18 01:17:28 2015 UTC,"with Link and Zelda reincarnating whenever their land is in danger   There's actually several events throughout the timeline where there is no Link or Zelda but the land is in danger (like when the interlopers attacked, when the goddesses flooded Hyrule, when Malladus first attacked, when Hyrule had a civil war for the Triforce and the sages sealed it in the Sacred Realm instead, when the prince's wizard cast Zelda into an eternal sleep in AoL's back story, etc.). But maybe this can be explained away because Demise says an incarnation of his shall appear whenever both Link and Zelda are present. So it's not that an evil causes Link and Zelda to be born; it's that a hero and princess being born causes a new evil to appear.  Then again, that wouldn't be accurate either when applied to the entire series since there was a hero and princess born in the same era in TMC's back story but there's no incarnation of Demise there. And there's a hero and princess both alive during TMC and FS, but Vaati is the only evil that shows up in those games, and he can't be an incarnation of Demise if Demise can only produce a single incarnation of his hatred at a time and Ganon is an incarnation of his hatred since Vaati and Ganon appear at the same time in FSA (and if Demise can produce multiple incarnations of hatred at the same time, why not do that all the time?). There's also a hero and princess alive in ALttP, LA, MM, Oracles, TWW, PH, ST, and ALBW, but no new evil is born because of the new hero and princess being born; it's just an old evil that wasn't killed previously that resurfaces (or is resurrected in the case of the Oracles).  So there are just a lot of complications that arise if we take Demise's curse literally and without exception, including the fact that Link's wish on the Triforce probably should have been enough to destroy Demise's curse since it is fueled by Demise's hatred/consciousness, which should have been destroyed by the wish, and Fi says that she can't sense Demise at all after Link's wish is complete.  SS didn't really establish why anyone (except Demise) reincarnates. It just acknowledged that the people of Hyrule do reincarnate, and Demise's curse is locking himself to Link and Zelda's simultaneous reincarnations.  But even if Link's SS wish didn't destroy Demise's curse, another wish on the Triforce that specifically wishes for the curse to end should do it. After all, Demise has to be weaker than the Triforce in order to use it (or at least have a need for it, and he invaded Hyrule in the first place because he wanted to use the Triforce), so a wish to extinguish the curse should work."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Petrichor03,3,Tue Mar 17 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"with Link and Zelda reincarnating whenever their land is in danger   My bad. For a second, a part of Hylia's speech from the SS Manga crept its way into what I remembered  from the actual game. However, the mangas aren't canon, so disregard that. You're right, Hyrule's been in  danger (and even sealed away) without either protagonists there.  As for the evil appearing because of Link and Zelda being born anew, then why would Hylia let herself (and Link) be reincarnated if it'd cause the evil to appear? Unless, of course, Hylia lost all control of the reincarnation process when shedding her divinity and memories of her godhood to be reincarnated the first time (... which she probably did, come to think about it).  With Demise's uncanny resemblance to Ganon/Ganondorf, I think it's safe to assume that you're right; there's only one incarnation of him at a time (and indeed, if you want to take over or destroy the world and you CAN be two places at once, why not?). This would mean that other villains do not originate from Demise, proving he's not the origin of all evil in the Zelda universe. It cannot be swept under a rug that Nintendo created a lot of continuity problems with SS, so no, his curse definitely cannot be taken as an absolute rule.    SS didn't really establish why anyone (except Demise) reincarnates. It just acknowledged that the people of Hyrule do reincarnate, and Demise's curse is locking himself to Link and Zelda's simultaneous reincarnations.   While I get where you're coming from, I believe his words are somewhat open for interpretation: ""My hate... never perishes. It is born anew in a cycle with no end! [...] Those like you… Those who share the blood of the goddess and the spirit of the hero… They are eternally bound to this curse."". It seems to me this refers to descendants of Zelda and Link respectively, i.e. the Zeldas and Links of (chronologically) later installments, which would explain why they, too, are reincarnated. Whether because they are bound to Demise's curse, or (like you pointed out) the other way around.  Indeed, SS established that a Triforce wish would be enough to obliterate Demise completely, and likely by extension, the curse. The problem is, of course, that in later installments in the timeline, no one knows of Demise and the curse, the (presumably) source of Ganon's power and evil, and therefore won't wish for the curse's end. They might wish for Ganon to be destroyed or sealed away once and for all, but Demise's ""hatred"" might take on other forms.  Thanks, I'm getting a new view of this whole thing. And realizing just how problematic it is to make 15 games in a franchise, then going back before the beginning and attempting to establish an origin story."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"As for the evil appearing because of Link and Zelda being born anew, then why would Hylia let herself (and Link) be reincarnated if it'd cause the evil to appear?   Well she did give up her divinity and allow herself to become human before Demise ever cast his curse. Then again, Hylia giving up her divinity has always been one of the biggest plot holes in SS since she did it in order to wish on the Triforce, but then immediately gave that job to Link upon reincarnating as a mortal, not to mention the fact that it's heavily implied that Hylia looked into the future in order to manipulate events in the present era of SS before giving up her divinity, which means she should have seen what would happen if she did give up her divinity. Maybe she's bound to fulfill the future she sees though, like Dr. Manhattan.   It seems to me this refers to descendants of Zelda and Link respectively, i.e. the Zeldas and Links of (chronologically) later installments, which would explain why they, too, are reincarnated.   If Demise's curse is the reason that Link and Zelda reincarnate, do we need to have a reason for why the other characters reincarnate too? I mean, we have evidence of Ganon, Tingle, Malon, Talon, Ingo, Din (the oracle), Nayru (the oracle), Farore (the oracle), the Postman, Syrup, Sahasrahla, Impa, Anju, Carlov, and more all reincarnating. So since it seems like most people in the Zelda universe just reincarnate regularly anyway, do we really need a special reason as to why Link and Zelda reincarnate?   Indeed, SS established that a Triforce wish would be enough to obliterate Demise completely, and likely by extension, the curse. The problem is, of course, that in later installments in the timeline, no one knows of Demise and the curse, the (presumably) source of Ganon's power and evil, and therefore won't wish for the curse's end.   That's very true. But of course it just leads me back to the question of why SS Link's wish didn't destroy Demise's curse in the first place. Demise's curse is powered by an aspect of Demise himself, and Link's wish must have been for the complete annihilation of Demise since that's what we were told Hylia was attempting to do by getting the Triforce herself, and Fi says that Link's wish resulted in Demise being entirely eradicated. So if all of Demise and his hatred are gone after Link's wish, how is Demise's curse still being powered by Demise's hatred? Personally it seems to me that Demise might have been overstating his abilities. Just like how OoT Ganondorf swore that he would break out of the Sacred Realm and kill Link's and Zelda's descendants (but then never did), I'm not so sure we can take Demise's word as 100% truth either. I do think that his curse is what allowed the present era Imprisoned to be born (because otherwise there would be no explanation for its origin without creating a time paradox), but perhaps that's where the curse's effects ended thanks to Link's wish."

The multitude of other characters appearing in several eras had completely slipped my mind. Good point. I'd still argue that Link and Zelda reincarnates due to the curse, as they seem to reincarnate at spesific times when there is need, but then again, we don't know whether these other character reincarnate more randomly/often or in the same spesific way/time as Link/Zelda.   I mean: supposing that Tingle & Co. is reincarnated repeatedly throughout the series' timeline, even ""between games"", when nothing in necessarily happening. Would the Hero's spirit and Hylia reincarnate the same way, meaning they're both reborn countless times between each event we experience through the games? Does Link reincarnate several times and simply live his life normally as a peasant because the need for a hero doesn't arise? Regardless, you're right that Link/Zelda are not exclusive in this matter.   it seems to me that Demise might have been overstating his abilities.   Gotta agree on this one.   Just like how OoT Ganondorf swore that he would break out of the Sacred Realm and kill Link's and Zelda's descendants (but then never did)   Didn't he eventually break out and attack Hyrule again, causing the goddesses to create the Great Flood and seal him away with Hyrule?"

I found one, but I can't find the one that is specifically coming to mind:  ""You stand under the roof of the Sealed Temple, a place built by the goddess an eternity ago. Your arrival here was predestined many, many years ago.""  There's another quote somewhere in the game where Fi mentions Hylia looking through the ages at Link's progress, or something to that extent, but I can't figure out the wording in order to find it. (SS's text dump is huge.)   Didn't he eventually break out and attack Hyrule again, causing the goddesses to create the Great Flood and seal him away with Hyrule?   Yes, but he didn't kill the princess of that era (unless there was more than one princess alive at the time; we know a princess had to survive in order for the Royal Family line to survive and for Tetra to be born), and he didn't kill any descendants of the Hero of Time (TWW Ganondorf essentially tells TWW Link that OoT Link is the last hero he fought)."

I would argue that is setup for Ganondorf.   when the prince's wizard cast Zelda into an eternal sleep in AoL's back story   I'd argue that's not really ""danger"", since life in Hyrule went on fine afterward.     he can't be an incarnation of Demise if Demise can only produce a single incarnation of his hatred at a time   There can be more than one Hero around at a time (Gramps, Hero's Shade), so no reason there can't be more than one Demise.   but no new evil is born because of the new hero and princess being born   This simply means that ""unsealing"" and ""resurrection"" counts for the curse.     the fact that Link's wish on the Triforce probably should have been enough to destroy Demise's curse   Hylia died, and her curse continued.  Clearly she and Demise had the power to affect the laws of the universe in a permanent way.  I also think it'd be quite ridiculous if Nintendo made a point of bringing up the Demise incarnations if they merely wanted it to be a self-contained loop in Skyward Sword.   It just acknowledged that the people of Hyrule do reincarnate   [Citation needed], and Link and Zelda are due to Hylia's Curse.     Vaati is the only evil that shows up in those games, and he can't be an incarnation of Demise   This is the one I have no answer for.   another wish on the Triforce that specifically wishes for the curse to end should do it.   I agree with that.  But after Skyward Sword, there is nobody in the entire world who should be aware that the reincarnation curses exist, so there's no chance of ending them.  Unless someone makes a really generic wish, like ""I wish for evil to stop attacking Hyrule forever"", but I think even the Triforce might not be powerful enough for that kind of monumental task (you'd figure someone would have tried that already, right?)."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 21:08:02 2015 UTC,"There could be a game there someday, nobody ever said there wasn't a Hero there.   Neither did I. I only said that we currently don't know of any hero or princess existing during that era (even though it's very likely that the Hylian Royal Family had been established at that time, and therefore there was most likely a princess in that era, at least).   Before OoT?   No, the ""fierce war"" is the war that precedes OoT. The Hyrulean civil war is the war that proceeds ALBW when the sages have to hide the Triforce in the Sacred Realm but then Ganon finds it, which requires a hero, seven sage descendants, and Princess Zelda to work together to seal him away ""in darkness"", which seems to result in the Triforce being split.   There can be more than one Hero around at a time (Gramps, Hero's Shade), so no reason there can't be more than one Demise.   Right, so why do we never (or extremely rarely) see multiple main villains if they all come from the same source? Wouldn't it make more sense to incarnate as multiple villains at the same time to take out the hero and princess?   Hylia died, and her curse continued.   Hylia never cast a curse. She just allowed herself to become mortal which allowed her to be reincarnated like any other mortal (see my list of mortals that are shown to reincarnate that I posted elsewhere in this thread).   (you'd figure someone would have tried that already, right?)   I don't know... The people who tend to get ahold of the Triforce are typically pretty short-sighted in their wishes. The only person who ever wished for something that wasn't just immediate was the King of Red Lions (wishing for hope for Link and Tetra), but even that wish didn't last long because he let the waves of the Great Sea kill him, which should have therefore extinguished any continuing portion of his wish.  And perhaps that's the biggest problem. It's not that the Triforce can't do something like wishing for all evil to stop attacking Hyrule forever, but it only grants continuous wishes while the wisher is alive. Once the wisher dies, the continuous wishes end. I imagine that if there was a singular source of all evil in the universe, a wisher could wish that this source be destroyed, which would be forever granted (since the Triforce wouldn't be continuously destroying the source; it would just be a one-time thing), but if the wisher just wished for the source's power to be suppressed, the wish would eventually end when the wisher died."

Wouldn't it make more sense to incarnate as multiple villains   Sure, but I don't think there's anybody behind the scenes orchestrating who and what appears.  Stuff just happens as it happens because it needs to happen.  Ganondorf was born ~20 years before the Hero and Goddess in the OoT era, because he needed to be a powerful king of his people in order for him to reach his full potential.  It might make sense for the Gerudo to suddenly have an influx of 20 males who all become powerful warlords and turn out to all be Demise, but that's not the path of least resistance.

The realm of the Ocean King is only a ""parallel universe"" in the way that the Sacred Realm is a ""parallel universe""; i.e., it exists as another dimension within the same universe as the rest of the realms as opposed to being a truly parallel universe like the Lorule realms. So if PH Salvatore is a different guy from TWW Salvatore, that would be evidence of reincarnation (and simultaneous reincarnation at that, assuming TWW Salvatore is still alive).

As dannyb said earlier in this thread, Wind Waker could be considered an end to Ganon in that timeline (although he has been brought back alive in other games just fine) and it does work well with the whole New Hyrule set-up.  However, if we are speaking from a purely hypothetical standpoint and we would want to have a grand finale for the whole series, I could see something like this:  An evil force (maybe Ganondorf himself) learns of the existence of multiple potential timelines as well as the various forms and incarnations of Ganon. Similarly to Cia in HW, he summons all these forms of Ganon from different parts of the all the timelines and universes. Ganondorfs from OoT, WW and TP, Ganons from all over the history, Yuganon, maybe Demise if the lore allows, perhaps other villains that could be considered related to Ganon such as Malladus from ST. All these incarnations of Demise join forces to bring the entire world to its destruction, by the driving force which created Ganon itself. Even after fighting countless hordes of Ganon and being pushed to their limits, Link and Zelda have no way but to use the power of Triforce to travel back in time (kind of similar to how SS did this with summoning Demise) to where it all began with Demise. By destroying the source of Ganon itself, Link and Zelda can stop the vicious cycle from ever happening, at the cost of erasing all the timelines. Hyrule would be able to exist in peace but at a cost of losing the grand history of the war between goddess Hylia and the Demon King."

Ganon was killed in ALttP but instead of being reincarnated, he was resurrected in OoX. The ritual was incomplete, so he was revived as a mindless beast. He seems to remain this way in ALBW and LoZ. I think this botched resurrection interrupted the cycle of reincarnation and permanently tethered Demise's spirit to Ganon. Ganon could still be resurrected, but he won't be reincarnated like he was in FSA. If no one resurrects Ganon, Demise is done for good on this timeline. Since the Hero and Hylia have arisen in times when Ganon is not a threat, I think they could continue to reincarnate even in Demise's absence."
truezelda,2zdoaq,Xattm15,2,Tue Mar 17 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Fair points here. The nature of Demise's reincarnation as Ganon is never explored in detail, so his connection to Ganon being compromised, but not entirely broken, could in theory prevent his return if Ganon is not fully resurrected."

The Demise cycle could somehow be stopped there (but I have no idea how, since nobody knows about it), and any future games in that timeline could be about a variety of other villains attempting to gain the power that is missing from the world at those times.  The Child timeline will always have Ganondorf, and I believe we will see the Adult Timeline get a new permanent recurring incarnation of Demise, similar to Ganondorf, in New Hyrule very soon."

truezelda,2zeynf,Stack42,3,Wed Mar 18 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"and how Termina and Hyrule are different universes   Aonuma apparently recently changed his mind about that. In a recent interview with Game Informer about MM3D, he said, ""You know we described [Termina] as being a nearby land, but in feel, it’s almost like another dimension."" So apparently now Termina and Hyrule are nearby lands, and Termina's presentation is just meant to evoke a feeling of an alternate dimension. So if Hyrule and Termina take place in the same dimension, that kind of precludes the idea of Termina having its own Demise.  Besides, even in MM's instruction manual it says that the people of Termina aren't doppelgangers/alternate versions of the people of Hyrule. It says that the people of Termina only have a ""passing resemblance"" to the people Link once knew in Hyrule. So apparently within the in-game universe, the people of Termina actually look quite different from the people of Hyrule in Link's eyes. It's only when you take just a passing glance at these people that they're supposed to look like the people of Hyrule.  Obviously this is something that was included so that players would excuse the reused character models, but it still shows that the developers' original intention was for these people to not be alternate universe doppelgangers.

truezelda,2za6gs,henryuuk,8,Tue Mar 17 09:11:47 2015 UTC,That Hand stresses me out so much!
truezelda,2za6gs,souasify,9,Tue Mar 17 10:39:53 2015 UTC,"In retrospective, I think the reason it nearly gave me panic attacks was that it reminded me of an even creepier version of OoT's wallmasters. * Shudders *"
truezelda,2za6gs,dddonnanoble,7,Tue Mar 17 10:47:19 2015 UTC,It's wallmasters that can't be defeated.
truezelda,2za6gs,souasify,5,Tue Mar 17 13:16:16 2015 UTC,Those things.... Those things are the creepiest scariest things in any zelda game! Every time that shadow appeared over my head I would NOPE the hell outta Dodge
truezelda,2za6gs,dddonnanoble,2,Tue Mar 17 14:28:46 2015 UTC,And then they break into tinier wallmasters...
truezelda,2za6gs,benoxxxx,3,Tue Mar 17 16:06:35 2015 UTC,The hand is the reason I quit twilight princess when I got to the twilight palace.
truezelda,2za6gs,dddonnanoble,2,Tue Mar 17 15:54:24 2015 UTC,Keep trying!! They're by far my least favorite part of any Zelda game but I find the final battle to be worth it.
truezelda,2za6gs,souasify,5,Tue Mar 17 16:04:33 2015 UTC,I literally have no desire to beat that dungeon. In my mind I've beat the game haha. I know that is silly but I'm okay with it :)
truezelda,2za6gs,Xattm15,2,Tue Mar 17 16:09:30 2015 UTC,If it's cool it's cool. Just know that you're missing out on the best final boss fight in all of Zelda.

truezelda,2za6gs,Hylian_Spud,6,Tue Mar 17 18:05:07 2015 UTC,whaaat! I haven't played TP yet! this music gave me the chills!

truezelda,2za6gs,TheDetective13,6,Tue Mar 17 04:35:00 2015 UTC,Twilight Princess is definitely worth playing especially if your familiar with the 3d games
truezelda,2za6gs,stryker101,3,Tue Mar 17 06:40:08 2015 UTC,I got stuck on this level for a while so I have a pretty good idea of what your talking about. It kinda resonates with the empty city concept of the whole level and make the whole level feel large and lonely.
truezelda,2za6gs,Neskuaxa,15,Tue Mar 17 06:38:47 2015 UTC,"The original OoT Fire Temple music with the creepy chanting. The chants are compositionally dark and the words are alien to most people, enforcing the sense that you're in an unfamiliar place where danger lurks. The way that one chant repeats over and over while getting progressively louder and louder is really unsettling, as if the danger is approaching at its own pace, and it will only stop on its own terms. The reverb, stereo mixing and layered chants make it feel like you're being surrounded by the danger. It does a really job at conveying a sense of helplessness.  Nintendo made a lot of creepy ass music during the N64 era."
truezelda,2za6gs,NeilPeartReddit,2,Tue Mar 17 05:45:59 2015 UTC,What a good description! Reading that makes me want to dust off ye olde n64 and revisit the game just to turn on and wander around the temple. Ty for linking!
truezelda,2za6gs,easycure,2,Tue Mar 17 05:54:50 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that before, because I first played and beat OoT on the Wii VC version. This is definitely way creepier."
truezelda,2za6gs,Stack42,2,Tue Mar 17 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"I prefer this track over what it was replaced with. The original song is a very common chant in Islam. While I personally don't take offense to it being used in this type of context, it's definitely not creepy chanting or dark. The chants translate to a praise of God (the judeo-christian-islamic God) who is merciful and benevolent. The way its chopped and edited make it sound creepy but when you actually listen and translate the words from arabic to english, it's quite beautiful."
truezelda,2za6gs,Stack42,2,Wed Mar 18 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the words themselves aren't dark from the translation I've read."

truezelda,2za6gs,Stack42,15,Tue Mar 17 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"The Shadow Temple.  It's got a low and high pitch dynamic that I find really eerie. I always thought the low one sounded like a sinister chanting, and the high one sounded like an unearthly wailing. As if peoples' ""spirits"" were doing both."
truezelda,2za6gs,easycure,2,Tue Mar 17 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"yeah! the percussion in the music makes it sound like someone is engaging in demonic sacrificial rituals, lol. It's been a while since I heard the Shadow Temple music."

truezelda,2za6gs,TexasDex,15,Tue Mar 17 04:31:38 2015 UTC,That's my first choice as well. Additionally I'd add the original Fire Temple music from Ocarina of Time. I know the muslim chanting was controversial but it made for a very creepy theme.
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,3,Mon Mar 16 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"I also agree! I am not a muslim, and wasn't exposed to that at all when I was a child, so I didn't know it was ""offensive"" until like 4 years ago, lol. But I agree that that temple was eerie. I will always remember the first time I entered that dungeon, the long hallway with the heat waves... was good man."
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,8,Mon Mar 16 22:39:29 2015 UTC,"I always thought the theme for TP's Arbiters Grounds provided an incredibly creepy atmosphere. The fact that at the time this was the most realistic Zelda to exist, mixed with those mini stalfos.. This was probably the first time I wanted to nope the fuck out of a dungeon.   Also, after listening to the shadow temple theme before this one, the intros sound pretty similar. Never noticed that until I heard them back to back."
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,7,Tue Mar 17 04:11:25 2015 UTC,whoa... just listened to it. What's the story of Arbiter's Ground?
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,6,Tue Mar 17 04:38:17 2015 UTC,"It's the 4th dungeon in TP and is basically an ancient prison deep in the Gerudo Desert. It's full of all kinds of stal and other undead creatures. It's pretty terrifying and it was my favorite dungeon the first time I played TP, the dungeons item and boss fight are very awesome and unique."
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,3,Tue Mar 17 05:22:03 2015 UTC,"I have TP for wii, and never played it because... You know... Motion controls :(   I'm a huge sucker for story line though. I'll play it as soon as I am finished with MM :)"
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,4,Tue Mar 17 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"I first played TP on the Gamecube as soon as it came out and loved it. Then a few years later my mom got a Wii to her Zelda fix (my mom is a bigger Zelda fan than I am and I consider myself to be a very big fan) and got some of the old games she hadn't played in forever on Virtual Console. Then about a year before SS came out I got TP to prepare. I disliked the motion controls in most Wii games but I decided to try it, it really isn't bad and it's vastly easier than SS. The hardest thing for me to get down was precision aiming the bow and hookshot but eventually I got it down. It really is about time I replay it, I should go to my moms soon and commandeer her Wii for a few weeks."
truezelda,2za6gs,Jlove1982,3,Tue Mar 17 05:56:54 2015 UTC,"If you go into settings, there is an option to control aiming with the joystick on the Wii version."
truezelda,2za6gs,Nervousemu,3,Tue Mar 17 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"Really? I usually look at the settings before I start any game, I can't believe I never noticed that. I'll have to remember that next time I play if I have trouble with aiming again."
truezelda,2za6gs,CitizenWolfie,2,Tue Mar 17 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Hahaha your mom sounds epic. I have a couple trade in game stores in my town, and everytime I am in there I check to see if they have a GC version of TP... No luck yet. Maybe I'll just suck it up and play it. After reading your comment it doesn't seem that bad, after all I did not mind SS motion controls one bit"
truezelda,2za6gs,Peugeon,3,Tue Mar 17 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"I wasn't able to find it again in my game stores back in 2011 either, I just went ahead got the Wii version. Oh yeah it shouldn't be bad at all if you didn't mind SS, TP's controls are a cakewalk compared to SS. I'm not saying TP's are bad, they just aren't as particular or strict about the direction and motion, it feels like someone mixed a normal controller played Zelda with SS motion controls, for me personally I think it's a good balance."
truezelda,2za6gs,KingKolder,2,Tue Mar 17 06:13:20 2015 UTC,"I say give it a shot on Wii. The motion controls aren't bad, by any means, just lackluster. As part of the minority (or so it seems) on this sub, I actually liked the motion controls for SS and has no problem with them. Because of this I haven't gone back and replayed TP.   In TP, sword swinging isn't precise and doesn't have to be, you just waggle instead of a button press, which feels lame. And as is the case with most pointer controls (in my opinion), the precision in aiming the bow is beautiful. Nothing felt better then shooting enemy arrows out of the air using the Wii's IR controls, something I just couldn't do using sticks."
truezelda,2za6gs,TekHead,3,Tue Mar 17 17:59:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah eventually you get really good at it, I wasn't super used to the Wii before plying TP so I had trouble, but once you do get the hang of aiming the bow you feel so awesome unstoppable, the Hidden Village ghost town place is so awesome just popping bulblins off with longshots is epic."
truezelda,2za7gv,pdelponte,14,Mon Mar 16 22:18:01 2015 UTC,"Could be, though I don't really see any reason why they would. ""Evolution"" in the Zelda universe seems to work in more-or-less the same way real evolution does. There has to be some need to adapt. For example the Zora only evolve into the Rito in the flood timeline. Not sure what reason the Loftwings would have to evolve into anthropomorphic chickens."
truezelda,2za7gv,milhouse92,9,Tue Mar 17 00:09:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, the Zora evolved into Rito in a world almost entirely covered in water?  ...Why?"
truezelda,2za7gv,mkol,22,Tue Mar 17 00:15:20 2015 UTC,"There are a few theories as to why, most of which Zeldapedia covers.   It is unknown why this change would have occurred since the Zoras in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages have been shown to be able to live in the sea off the coast of the island of Labrynna. However, unlike the Great Sea, the Zoras seemed to be living in a controlled environment without interruption from other sea dwellers. In The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, the Zora have trouble living in murky water or in water that is not at optimal temperature, thus suggesting that the change in water conditions might have forced them to evolve. This assumes however that Terminian Zora and Hyrulean Zora share the same characteristics. Also, as the Great Sea is quoted as being mainly devoid of fish to catch, it is possible that the Zora's main food source dried up, forcing them to become land creatures. As the Great Sea is filled with numerous monsters and other dangerous sea life, the Zora might have had to evolve to avoid being eaten or constantly attacked. This would explain why they now had to fly over the water rather than swim through it. A small rumor states that the goddesses did not want anyone to find Hyrule hidden beneath the Great Sea, and as Zoras would have found the land quite quickly, the goddesses evolved the Zora on their own. Though because of the appearance of Fishmen, who are also sentient beings that live in water this appears to be untrue."
truezelda,2za7gv,milhouse92,10,Tue Mar 17 00:17:56 2015 UTC,I actually think the fishmen 'prove' it was some wish/magic/divine intervention. Remember how the fishmen 'owed' KoRL a favor?  Which is why they are being the information gatherers.    The fishmen were MADE to be the only ones in the water.

truezelda,2za7gv,Xattm15,2,Tue Mar 17 14:07:09 2015 UTC,"I know the lore directly says otherwise but personally, I refuse to believe that the Great Sea is devoid of sea life (excluding the monsters). I know I'm wrong but I like to believe that there are all sorts of critters living in the aquatic Hyrule, big and small, underneath the waves. I mean, it just makes the world more interesting. Besides, the monsters and gulls have to eat something, right?"
truezelda,2za7gv,CantankerousFox,2,Tue Mar 17 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"The bigger octos could eat the smaller monsters, the gulls eat whatever bits don't get eaten by the monsters."

truezelda,2za7gv,Supersnoopy323,10,Wed Mar 18 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"/u/milhouse92 covered the ""why"", but the ""how"" is less evolution and more transformation.  Most likely, the zora transformation into the rito occurred in a single generation, when the entire species was changed by Valoo, who then became (or possibly already was) their patron deity.  We know for a fact that rito can't fly without a scale from this entity, so it's clearly not a natural evolution into bird people."
truezelda,2za7gv,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:01:19 2015 UTC,"Well.  Maybe.  Or, more likely, they're genetically compatible with humans/hylians, so the Ruto are descended from land-based hominids but (some) have Zora blood.  The games don't really specify and for some reason people assumed the thing that makes less sense."
truezelda,2za7gv,BlueJoshi,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:21:38 2015 UTC,How would fish being able to breed with apes and then turning into dinosaurs make more sense?

truezelda,2za7gv,BlueJoshi,0,Tue Mar 17 19:19:31 2015 UTC,Magic.
truezelda,2za7gv,jesuswig,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:07:43 2015 UTC,Bad answer.  We don't do that here.
truezelda,2za7gv,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:36:13 2015 UTC,OK......
truezelda,2za7gv,jesuswig,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"Well, don't act shocked when someone verbally slaps you for saying: ""It's magic, I don't gotta explain shit.""  That kind of attitude toward fiction stopped being respectable years ago."
truezelda,2za7gv,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:12:55 2015 UTC,But within the context of this series that is an acceptable answer.  The gods magicked the Zoras into bird people to keep Old Hyrule a secret.  A lot of times we get an official answer from Nintendo that completely ignores/invalidates something that has already been well established. Magic is an acceptable answer until we get something truly definitive is the only place holder we have throughout Zelda.
truezelda,2za7gv,jesuswig,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"And yet I've determined a perfectly reasonable answer that has nothing to do with unseen and unproven gods, based on in-game evidence from Wind Waker only.  Rito can't get wings without a scale from Valoo, so Valoo is probably the person who transformed them, since he has that power.  If they were transformed by gods, it's pretty nonsensical that they cannot fly without the input from a third party (who is also mortal, so if Valoo ever dies, the rito would be fucked).  We see that the kokiri transformed into the koroks, and there's no implication whatsoever of ""gods"" doing it - the Deku Tree merely says the koroks take on forms that are appropriate for their environment.  So even within the same game, there is precedent for an entire species transforming into something different without divine intervention."
truezelda,2za7gv,Serbaayuu,10,Tue Mar 17 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"It's a possibility, for sure, although I find it more likely that the Oocca evolved from humans who remained in Skyloft, for a number of reasons. Most prominently, their much-revered ancient technology (such as the Dominion Rod) seems to be designed for use by more humaniod creatures that the yellow, chicken-like people. Ooccoo refers to the rod as the technology of ""my ancestors"", thus hinting that the Oocca might once have been humanoid in shape, or at least taken on a form more suited to handling such technology.  Furthermore, supposing there is a relation between Skyloft and the City in the Sky, i.e. the two locations being the same, some major changes have been made through the millenia, such as the building of giant propellers and wind machinery, presumably to keep the city airborne (hinting that the powers keeping Skyloft floating begun to fade long ago). However, again, these things could hardly have been built by the Oocca in their current form. This, combined with the apparent crumbling and decline of the city in several places, seems to indicate that the Oocca were at some point a race able to actively build and maintain Skyloft/the City in the Sky, but evolved into what the are now, leaving the city to fall into disrepair. Why they would evolve into these strange little creatures inspired by M.C. Esher, is beyond me, however.  EDIT: Sorry for the over-the-top ""academic"" and pretentious style of writing. Just finished writing a ridicolously long paper for a university course, and I'm still stuck in bullshit-mode."
truezelda,2za7gv,CreepyPancakes,6,Tue Mar 17 10:11:28 2015 UTC,"I am more or less permanently stuck in the mode of stuffy academic since majoring in philosophy.   It's helpful in that I can write now write a 5 page paper in about 3 hours of real work (spaced over about 10 hours of reddit) , but when I write any thing longer than a few sentences I come off as a pretentious twat."
truezelda,2za7gv,Zankou55,6,Tue Mar 17 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty clear the Oocoo are descended from the people of Skyloft, the ones who didn't leave for Hyrule.  They're basically all descended from Groose, is what I'm saying."
truezelda,2za7gv,BlueJoshi,7,Tue Mar 17 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"No, Groose went to live in the desert.  :U"

truezelda,2za7gv,Dismas423,3,Tue Mar 17 02:49:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with this. After Hyrule was established, the Loftwings started to become smaller since they no longer served as mounts for humans. Since they still interacted with humans, they developed speech and some other human-like features and became the Ooca. This might not make perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective, but in the Zelda universe fish people can evolve into bird people in a few hundred years so I don't think this theory is too outlandish. I also like to think that the bird Link summons with the ocarina in MC is an intermediary stage between Loftwings and Ooca."

truezelda,2zayq7,invaderzz,9,Tue Mar 17 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"Zelda U Link holds his bow right-handed. If he's ~14, that means the Great Bridge of Hylia was fully constructed in under 5 years.  That's... a stretch, I think. The Salesman appears in Labrynna several hundred years after the era of Ocarina of Time, so he can appear anywhere. Another game for the Hero of Time is pointless because his character has to end full of regret and without any recognized accomplishments."
truezelda,2zayq7,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 11:42:29 2015 UTC,"Huh, I forgot that the HMS was in Oracle of Ages. That's on an entirely different timeline too.  ...the same timeline as ALBW."

truezelda,2zayq7,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Mar 18 11:07:00 2015 UTC,How come the Hero of Time has to end up with regret again? Because of the Hero's Shade?
truezelda,2zayq7,SMKM,3,Tue Mar 17 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Because he's the only one (in the timeline that he was sent to) who actually remembers what he did for Hyrule, and because apparently he never found anyone to pass on the skills he acquired."
truezelda,2zayq7,malaroo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:28:20 2015 UTC,I always interpreted the ending to be that Zelda and Link both knew what had happened to Hyrule. Guess I'm wrong haha
truezelda,2zayq7,SMKM,3,Tue Mar 17 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"Link knew, and he told Zelda so yes she knew, but she didn't remember because she wasn't actually there.  In that timeline, Zelda hadn't grown any more than when she first met Link, and the events that took place when Link was an adult never actually happened."
truezelda,2zayq7,malaroo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yup.  He can't pass on his skills to anyone, and by extension that means he probably can't have an adventure where he's recognized as a Hero, because being recognized as a Hero would mean he'd definitely get the chance to do that, even if it wasn't to his children."
truezelda,2zayq7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"Not that I really agree with op - I feel that the game could take place anywhere from just before OoT, to just before TP, or before Wind Waker - but not everything has to be so cut and dry, and rarely is in Zelda.  The Great Bridge of Hylia could be a case of 'was actually already there' in lore, but simply not thought of or possible on N64, and then I also don't see why it couldn't be made in five years.  Five years of constant building can get a lot done, especially in a fantasy world with magic and ancient technology.  Though HMS's 'hint' is too vague to be really thought of as anything at this point.  As for Link having regret over not being recognized for saving Hyrule from Ganondorf, I don't think that means he couldn't do anything else memorable; or maybe he simply isn't remembered in this one for another reason. He does hide his face, after all, and he does save Termina which ends up being irrelevant to his regret over OoT's events.  But like I said I'm not backing up OP.  I'm just trying to make the point that in both cases, acting super sure about when something may or may not take place in a series with as many possibilities and variables as Zelda is kind of jumping-the-gun, especially when he know next-to-nothing about Zelda U.  All we know is that it probably takes place in Hyrule, and Link doesn't wear green initially."
truezelda,2zayq7,malaroo,2,Tue Mar 17 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"or maybe he simply isn't remembered in this one for another reason   At that point there's little reason to make the story about the Hero of Time, since it won't and can't advance his character, and any events that occur in Hyrule must be necessity be a null-difference plot where nothing important actually happens.  So yeah, you could put him in another world or make his actions hidden or make the threat super minor.  Why is it about the Hero of Time anymore then?"
truezelda,2zayq7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"since it won't and can't advance his character   Hows that?  He doesn't need to be remembered by a nation for his own character to develop.  But then, it's never really been much about Link's development any more than ""you were a little kid and now you're a hero"".  It's usually about the setting.   and any events that occur in Hyrule must be necessity be a null-difference plot where nothing important actually happens.   Not really... any number of things could happen to Hyrule between OoT and TP, if it were to take place in the child timeline.  The only thing that is predetermined is that Hyrule still exists once TP comes along.  Otherwise, the same could be said about OoT's story, which despite Link not being remembered in one of the timelines, is one of the most important parts of the story.  Nintendo could write up pretty much anything they like and make it fit where ever, as has always been the case.  A 'secret' mission known only to a few? Why not?  Or maybe he is remembered, but this has no influence on how he still feels about OoT's events? I think it's safer to assume he did something with the rest of his life, especially if you're willing to consider that the Hero's Shade's missing eye is more than just a design choice.  Maybe literally anything, because a story like Zelda's can really go anywhere Nintendo decides to take it.  But I don't really care where it takes place.  I only care that it's a good game.  I just think it's silly to act so sure about something, on any side, when there's hardly a solid word to go on.   Why is it about the Hero of Time anymore then?   No more reason than why any Zelda game is about any other Link."
truezelda,2zayq7,malaroo,7,Tue Mar 17 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"This does seem rather well thought out, and I like the idea, but there are some inconsistencies.    Time travel in Ocarina of Time puts you in the body you had/will have, meaning that there would only be one link. The Links in the child timeline are all descended from the OoT link, meaning that there would not be another hero when the OoT link is only a teenager. OoT Link is still the chosen one, as the Triforce is still, technically, broken apart. Link is recognized as the bearer of courage even though the triforce never split, creating a paradox where he is and is not holding one third of the triforce. The green tunic is a garment showing his affiliation with the Kokiri; now that he has grown older, he would don something less conspicuous in order to blend in with other Hylians.   Other than those, good theory; it's rather sound, all things considered, with only a few minor details being incorrect."
truezelda,2zayq7,yay855,2,Tue Mar 17 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"creating a paradox where he is and is not holding one third of the triforce.   It's less of a paradox than you make it sound.  The Triforce exists in both timelines.  In the Child Timeline he still holds his piece.  In the Adult Timeline, his piece shattered since he vanished."
truezelda,2zayq7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"But in the child timeline, before Ganondorf's second rise to power, Link is the holder of the triforce of courage before it actually split; that means that he is holding a third of the triforce while it is whole and complete. How is that not paradoxical?"
truezelda,2zayq7,yay855,5,Tue Mar 17 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"that means that he is holding a third of the triforce while it is whole and complete.   Not necessarily.  I don't believe there's anything to suggest that the Triforce is still full in the child timeline.  Link still has his piece, Ganondorf still has his in Twilight Princess, and I suppose it can be assumed that Zelda still has hers but I don't think it's ever actually mentioned."
truezelda,2zayq7,malaroo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Ganondorf also had a second rise to power to gain the triforce between OoT and TP. He could have easily gained the triforce of power during that period, causing the Zelda of that time and her descendants to bear the triforce of wisdom."
truezelda,2zayq7,yay855,2,Tue Mar 17 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Ganondorf also had a second rise to power to gain the triforce between OoT and TP.   Where are you getting that?  As far as I know, the attempted execution scene in Twilight Princess is the direct result of Link going into the past and warning King Hyrule at the end of Ocarina of Time.  The official timeline has Ganon's execution happening pretty much at the exact same time Majora's Mask is happening, and it clearly shows that Ganon still had the Triforce of power.  Then, he's sealed in the Twilight Realm with it until Zant comes along."

truezelda,2zayq7,yay855,2,Wed Mar 18 02:06:51 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's only paradoxical for an instant.  The Triforce immediately splits upon his arrival, and Zelda and Ganondorf get the other two pieces."

truezelda,2zayq7,Link5794,-1,Tue Mar 17 22:59:14 2015 UTC,What do you make of the fact link is not seen with a hat? Even though you listed some good points this alone could point to the game fitting in the timeline directly after SS and before MC. I could be wrong but after MC link always has his hat...?   Just a thought...also I'd be willing to bet the happy mask salesman miiverse interview is for hyrule warriors DLC. Just my opinion doe.
truezelda,2zayq7,ehjackz88,3,Tue Mar 17 14:53:06 2015 UTC,What do you make of the fact link is not seen with a hat? Even though you listed some good points this alone could point to the game fitting in the timeline directly after SS and before MC.   ...Huh?  Every Link since Wind Waker has started without a hat.  It's not like hats are a permanent feature once on your head.
truezelda,2zayq7,malaroo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"In the beginning of MC the lore talks about ""the hero of men"" and in the pictures of him it shows he doesn't wear a hat. Green or otherwise.   Since MC follows SS in the timeline this is obviously referring to a period between the two games. I'm just suggesting that due to the fact the link seen in the gameplay footage/trailer isn't seen with a hat this may be Nintendo filling that void.   Sorry I should have explained my self better. Also just an opinion. Can't wait for this game."
truezelda,2zayq7,ehjackz88,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:25:31 2015 UTC,"That might mean something if we do see U Link with the green tunic but no hat.  Until then, it's just his usual unique starting clothes."
truezelda,2za2h7,YoungGunSilver,9,Mon Mar 16 21:41:33 2015 UTC,This is extremely interesting. What would you think of time shifting as this game's gimick? As in gimick I refer to things like the wolf form from TP or the transformation masks from MM which allowed different ways to use Link for interesting puzzle solving
truezelda,2za2h7,PenguinNukes,6,Mon Mar 16 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"It seems quite possible, seeing that they weren't really expanded on in SS, and something about Time mechanics and Zelda really go nicely together."
truezelda,2za2h7,GengarWithATriforce,12,Mon Mar 16 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The time shift mechanic was used in several different ways in SS. The entire Lanayru region (a third of the game) was devoted to the mechanic. The mechanic had a good run, and it doesn't need another yet.   Plus, they're are so many Zelda games with the two versions of the same world gimmick, I don't want that again. This last bit is just my opinion though."
truezelda,2za2h7,PenguinNukes,5,Tue Mar 17 00:56:47 2015 UTC,"Your point is incredibly valid, but I'm thinking more in the lines of 'same lore, different mechanic', slow-mo horse leaps for example."
truezelda,2za2h7,spud1988,3,Tue Mar 17 01:39:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'm thinking puzzles along the lines of shooting an arrow and then slowing time to push a block out of the way while the arrow flies slowly towards a switch."
truezelda,2za2h7,Serbaayuu,5,Tue Mar 17 02:53:19 2015 UTC,"hmm... that sounds interesting. Do we know if the link in WiiU is the same link in SS? if it is, then I can't see a real reason as to having a blue tunic, as Link had a tan skyloft tunic in SS. But, that is quite an interesting point you make about time-shift stones.  I feel that as SS being the earliest Zelda, and Zelda WiiU is a sequal, maybe it'll have some more back story of the earlier times in hyrule pre-SS."
truezelda,2za2h7,spud1988,9,Mon Mar 16 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"No, we have no idea what the relation of this new Hero is to the previous ones.  I will make a personal assertion that I seriously doubt he is the Hero from the Sky, since he looks much younger."

truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,7,Tue Mar 17 01:06:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't dare to make such a broad comment like that when the possibilities for future Heroes to get their own sequels is quite endless.
truezelda,2za2h7,spud1988,4,Tue Mar 17 00:36:15 2015 UTC,He is practically guaranteed to be a new Link. He looks completely different.
truezelda,2za2h7,BunsofthePatriots,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:58:37 2015 UTC,Sweeeeeeet... Im so excited for this game to come out! =D
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,3,Tue Mar 17 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"What this looks like to me is a brand new timeline derived from the events of OoT. Between OoT and WW the legend tells about Ganondorf making good on his promise to come back and seek revenge on Link, Zelda, and the Sages. He does, and he wreaks incredible havoc on Hyrule.  The people of Hyrule pray for the return of the Hero of Time but he does not come (because he's dead and in Termina forever and ever). So they begin praying to the Goddess to help them rid Hyrule of evil. She does just that by flooding the land and sealing Ganondorf's power away with the Master Sword as the key. This creates the Great Sea and the events of Windwaker/Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks.  What if Zelda U is a scenario on what would happen if the Goddess never sealed Hyrule away? The reincarnate of the hero is born again. Ganondorf rules the land with an iron fist of authoritarianism. The royal family has been overthrown and Hyrule is now Ganondorf's. Our new hero sets out to free Hyrule from Ganondorf's grasp.  A few things that make me think this:   The technology showcased in the trailer shows fully automated weaponry, and explosive-tipped arrows suggesting it is definitely long after the events of OoT. Hyrule's landscape, though much larger, has remained relatively unchanged since the Hero of Time age. Link looks more like a dystopian rogue than the atypical hero that we're used to. I believe that he is this silent hero that has limited-to-no support from the enslaved land around him The graphics are bright and cartoonish (doesn't have anything to do with the story but it's a detail similar to Windwaker). That machine Link was fighting in the trailer looked like it was in hot pursuit of him. That makes me think that it is sort of an automated sentry and possibly pre-programmed to kill anyone that defies Ganondorf's rule. Epona obviously makes an appearance which tells me that it is definitely akin to a more OoT feel. (That one is a bit of a stretch). At the beginning of most Zelda titles, when link is not in his tunic, he is never ""battle-ready"" and always completely gearless. This incarnation looks to be battle-ready in his blue tunic. Which, to me, supports the whole rogue theory. He fights for his life and the liberation of the kingdom wearing his blue tunic and eventually stumbles upon the garbs, sword, and shield of the Hero of Time.   So that's my theory. The Goddess abandoned Hyrule, the flood never happened, Ganondorf overthrew the kingdom, Link was reincarnated, Link became a freedom-fighting rogue, Link will eventually become the Hero of Freedom, and an entirely new (fourth) timeline will begin.."
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,8,Wed Mar 18 00:25:29 2015 UTC,"That's reaching way to far imo.    ""this stone is purple-blue, Link wears blue, must be connected"" is practically what you are saying.    IF the slow down has an explanation, it MIGHT be time shift stones, but I doubt it. Time shift stones seem to just create tunnels through time and space that are anchored to specific times.    .  If we really 'need' to find a pre-existing thing that works the same as the time slow down.... Then we need to go back to the original for a little something called : The ""(magical) clock""    Either way, it is WAY to soon to actually be able to deduct anything."
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,5,Tue Mar 17 00:04:59 2015 UTC,"I was more just referring to the similar white on blue designs that the tunic and stones share. The rumour stems more prominently from the special arrow head shown in the E3 trailer. Also keep in mind that it's been officially stated that the Ocarina of Time is made from the timeshift stones, so perhaps if made into different objects (ocarina, tunic, arrow heads, etc.) they might react differently. Granted I'm just speculating for fun, no need to take this too seriously.    Edit: sorry, Officially alluded to* http://www.gamnesia.com/images/uploads/ocarina-timeshift.jpg"
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,4,Tue Mar 17 00:12:44 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of time doesn't do shit though... It resonates with the door of time, that's it.      It's the SONG of time that holds the actual power in majora's mask, (and even that seems to be an external force instead of the actual song/instrument) to restart the loop  .  Like I said, you are reaching IMO. Time-shift stones are purple-gold when turned off and light blue-white (cause  of glow) when turned on. neither of the colors match Link's tunic's hue. The time shift stone's their markings are also finished geometrical shapes in an almost motherboard way of spreading out. The markings on Link's shirt look more like tribal markers, swipes, lines, swirls etc...   If anything it seems to be a reference to the blue crayfish shirt Link wears in Windwaker. some of his clothes also call upon inspiration from the sheikah and (strangly) the gerudo. possibly implying this link is from a more nomadic heritage.  .  The special arrow head looks even LESS like timeshift stone to me, and seems more like something you'd rip out of Gohdan    I doubt we will see timeshift stones return personally. not in a prominent way atleast."
truezelda,2za2h7,CaptainNooodles,3,Tue Mar 17 02:32:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the song of time would be useless if not played by the Ocarina of Time. Otherwise the hunt for the Ocarina at the beginning of MM was useless. Regardless, maybe it's reaching but who cares this is for fun. What are your theories?"
truezelda,2za2h7,ViggyPiggy1999,2,Tue Mar 17 05:16:42 2015 UTC,"Song of time works on all 4 instruments in MM, and it IS useless in OoT. In OoT, it is nothing more but a glorified key."
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:00:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, if you wanna keep going I'll keep going. If you remember, Deku Link can't use his pipes until he gets the Ocarina, which probably means that the Ocarina transforms when in contact with the transformation masks like Link does, meaning it's the same instrument. Also remember that instruments that belong to the hero can preform magic songs and others cannot (windmill guy from Oot, dancing man from WW) and time being the Ocarina'a main magical point here it's possible that it's made of timeshift stones."
truezelda,2za2h7,androsphere,2,Tue Mar 17 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"Note that you say ""instruments"" in general, the fairy ocarina could do the same shit the ocarina of time could except for resonate with the door of time.    The magic is in the songs, not the instruments."
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,0,Wed Mar 18 05:24:54 2015 UTC,"In Majoras mask the song of time can be played on 4 instruments and have the same effect, so I think the mission to get the ocarina at the beginning of the game was actually to remember the song.  They never really did explain how the mask forms got their instruments apart from Mikau's guitar and even then it is clearly seen on his grave so where did Link's guitar come from?  I think the song was more important than the instrument. Sure I bet it would still work if Link whistled the melody, it works on the pipes, drums and guitar."
truezelda,2za2h7,androsphere,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:45:55 2015 UTC,"yeah, what the other guy said.  the song of time does shit next to nothing unless played on the ocarina of time"
truezelda,2za2h7,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 10:26:18 2015 UTC,"Song of time does nothing at all in OoT except open doors and seals, and you don't need to play it on the ocaria for it to work in MM"
truezelda,2za2h7,Mattocrazy,2,Tue Mar 17 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"At first, the Ocarina of Time being made out of timeshift stones seemed farfetched, then Nintendo kind of alluded to it in the historia.  So it's sort of been established that this material can warp time in multiple forms.  However, I feel like this over-explains the lore. If Nintendo fully confirms that timeshift stones are the only time manipulation material in the Zelda universe, it would make them as hated as midi-chorians."
truezelda,2za2h7,henryuuk,2,Tue Mar 17 04:44:00 2015 UTC,"Except that the ocarina never warps time by itself, it's the song of time in MM and in OoT it's the PEDESTAL of time that does the actual traveling."
truezelda,2za2h7,CaptainFalconProblem,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:01:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, I forgot that detail! I'm just saying I'd hate for the magic side of the lore to be fully explained.  For example, if the historia 2.0 says that the pedastal had a time shift stone in it, I wouldn't like that."
truezelda,2za2h7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, that would make a lot of sense if Link didn't age when he switched times.  But he does, so it can't be a stone.  It also can't be a Gate of Time.  It really is as simple as ""he gets put into a coma"", but there's some property of the pedestal that also lets him reverse it."
truezelda,2za2h7,TheGoatGod997,4,Tue Mar 17 22:05:08 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who wants more RPG mechanics in the game? I just want a game that I can play for a long time without beating fully. Side quests and upgrade mechanics are the way to go for me.
truezelda,2za2h7,Serbaayuu,6,Tue Mar 17 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"Upgrade mechanics have a good chance of coming back I think. SS touched on it, and in a big gamelike this, it would fit home especially well.     Personally I am expecting both equipment upgrades and the like, as well as some minor customization with bonuses and whatnot."
truezelda,2za2h7,TheGoatGod997,4,Tue Mar 17 02:36:51 2015 UTC,I loved the gear upgrading in Skyward Sword. I thought going back to different regions to collect parts and materials would be tedious but I actually really enjoyed it. Plus the satisfaction of upgrading. Weapons to their most powerful form was fantastic. Sacred Bow? I loved that weapon.
truezelda,2za2h7,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, and if there's no master sword in this game I hope there's a big selection of weapons that you can equip yourself with, it would be cool if everyone's Link looked and played differently."

This is the most asinine and pointless argument anyway, since my statement still applies perfectly well to a beta build.   Do you even know how games are even made?

And yes - I currently play an MMO that was in beta for less than 1 year of its 5-year development cycle.  Betas are not long, they are for final debugging.  If your beta is more than 25% of your game's development cycle you did something wrong or forgot what ""beta"" meant.  Most of a game's dev cycle is going to be spent in pre-alpha or alpha."

truezelda,2z97k7,cow_co,7,Mon Mar 16 21:05:47 2015 UTC,"If the new game takes place in Hyrule (which I think Aonuma has said that it does), and it's a brand new Link, then I only see 7 places where it would really make sense for the game to go:  1) After AoL, 2) between TMC and OoT, 3) some time after TWW when Old Hyrule has been restored by the Koroks, 4) some time before ST in New Hyrule, 5) some time after ST, 6) some time after ALBW, 7) some time after FSA.  Of those placements, the ""after AoL"" would definitely be my favorite choice, especially if this game deals with the unresolved plot lines from the end of AoL. (It would also be the easiest place to put the game without us having to fear Nintendo doing something that messes up the series's lore, because some of the above 7 placements can't work unless Ganon, the Triforce, and/or the Master Sword is absent; the ""after AoL"" era could theoretically contain any of those without issue.)"
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"Remove some time before ST as ST is the first game set in New Hyrule, and unless they want to put another game some 80-100 years before ST it isn't going to make any sense at all."
truezelda,2z97k7,Epicfaillord,2,Mon Mar 16 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"We know that there were people in New Hyrule prior to Link and Tetra finding the land, and as you said, we know that there are 80-100 years before ST in New Hyrule, so a game could take place in either of those gaps if Nintendo wanted.  (I don't think that this is a likely place for a new game to appear, of course, just a possible place.)"
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,3,Mon Mar 16 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"It's still possible that the Hero of Winds was among the war against Malladus, if we posit that Malladus was born the instant Ganon died.  I don't think that would make a terribly interesting game, though, since Malladus himself is pretty boring.  I'd rather see New Hyrule after Spirit Tracks so they can start building a brand new set of lore around it, mostly separated from all the Old Hyrule lore & relics."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"Since Malladus needs a vessel from Old Hyrule in order to be reborn, I've been operating under the assumption that Malladus was sealed away back when Old Hyrule was still in existence (otherwise that limitation wouldn't really make sense).  This could also explain why Tetra's mother was searching for underwater Hyrule if she (or more likely her ancestor) had been away helping out the spirits fighting Malladus when Hyrule was flooded (otherwise she and her ancestors probably would have known what happened to Old Hyrule and thus negated the search and the whole ""nobody knows what happened to that kingdom"" thing).  So I wouldn't expect to see Malladus in a pre-ST game unless it just featured the natives of New Hyrule before Tetra and Link found the land and started calling it Hyrule."
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's specifically a vessel from Old Hyrule, it might just have worked because Zelda is a pure incarnation of Hylia, thus divine.  Any other person of divinity, and probably any sufficiently powerful demon, would likely have worked just as well.  Malladus' status as a spirit without a body parallels Demise's status as a body without a spirit extremely well, and they both ended up hunting Hylia."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 00:39:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's specifically a vessel from Old Hyrule   I'm actually referring to this quote from the game:  ""A vessel from the royal line of ancient Hyrule, with sacred power coursing through its veins. Yes, Malladus requires YOU in order to return."""
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,2,Tue Mar 17 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"To me, the fact that Malladus needs Zelda to be revived is compelling evidence that he is an incarnation of Demise. Demise needed to absorb Hylia's spirit from Zelda in order to be revived, and Ganon could only be properly resurrected in OoX if Zelda was used as a vessel. Malladus requiring Zelda for his revival fits this pattern perfectly. This would mean that Malladus came into existence almost immediately after Ganon's death, but this is not impossible given the ambiguity of when ST's backstory takes place."
truezelda,2z97k7,Dismas423,2,Tue Mar 17 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"Ganon could only be properly resurrected in OoX if Zelda was used as a vessel   There is a line in the game that makes me wonder if Zelda was the sole perfect sacrifice that could have been made. Right before Twinrova fights you, she says ""We'll sacrifice you so the Evil King can return!"" as if they have now decided to sacrifice Link instead of Zelda to resurrect Ganon.   Granted, they don't mention whether sacrificing Link will create a perfect resurrection or an imperfect one like they did by sacrificing themselves, but I think we have to assume that this would have been a perfect sacrifice since they could have just as easily turned around and sacrificed Zelda after killing Link unless the power of the Flames is just that the first person who dies while nearby them acts as the sacrifice. So Link may have been just as perfect a sacrifice as Zelda would have been."
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,2,Tue Mar 17 01:13:29 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered that. Maybe the process worked differently because Ganon was actually dead in OoX, while Demise and Malladus were only sealed. Ganon could be revived in AoL if Link, the person who killed him, was in turn killed. Since OoX Link killed Ganon in ALttP, he could also serve as a proper sacrifice. Since Demise and Malladus weren't dead, sacrificing Link wouldn't work, so Hylia/Zelda was the only proper sacrifice."
truezelda,2z97k7,Dismas423,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's interesting.  I wonder if the peoples outside of Hyrule knew about the Royal Family's status as divinity and built their own legends about them, to the point where someone like Cole could do his research and find that they were his best chance to get a vessel."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"Well, if Nintendo DID put anything there, it would definitely retcon half of ST, so there's that.  I don't care what Nintendo does because its all good."

truezelda,2z97k7,Empha,10,Mon Mar 16 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"For me, I'd worry that it was a sign of stagnation: Nintendo's clearly capitalizing on the nostalgia market of Zelda lately, with the 3DS remakes of OoT and MM, and ALBW. If this game is set after MM in the timeline, it would worry me that Nintendo was just jumping on the nostalgia bandwagon for Zelda in every way, and that would also make me worry that the game would be less than innovative, or that they'd be wary to stray away from the familiar in future games"
truezelda,2z97k7,starlitepony,2,Mon Mar 16 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not completely convinced it's a sign of stagnation. Nintendo may just be trying to make a successful console game, something that's been getting more difficult in recent years. When SS was released it received a lot of criticism, but the remakes of the Hero of Time games (OOT3D and MM3D) were very successful. This may make Nintendo believe that a console game based between MM and TP will be successful. Granted I'm not the most knowledgable on this specific subject so any explanation as to why another HOT game would be a flaw on Nintendo's fault is appreciated"
truezelda,2z97k7,NeilPeartReddit,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"That's also fair, but I think since the remakes were really well recieved because of nostalgia (I love both games, but I will not try to pretend that Ocarina of Time aged really well...), that does mean that they might end up just rehashing the gimmicks/style of OoT or MM if they made another game in that series.  To be honest, I don't think even 10% of the people who bought those games want to see a new game starring the Hero of Time: They want to see a new game that plays exactly like OoT and MM. Which I worry is stagnation."
truezelda,2z97k7,starlitepony,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"I never considered I may be in the minority, I personally want to see the HOT not the style. The idea that the style will transfer over makes sense though. Have to admit that would imply stagnation. ^"

truezelda,2z97k7,jey123,5,Mon Mar 16 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"It would be one of the worst retcons in Zelda history and would be shoving something into a crowded area of the timeline when you have the whole of time and space at the ends of each timeline, at least one hero before Skyward Sword, and tens of millennia between SS and OoT with plenty of events that could easily have an adventure tied to them and haven't been explained via a backstory (coughfloodcough)"
truezelda,2z97k7,Phoxxent,2,Mon Mar 16 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't think you should worry too much about the official timeline. Nintendo clearly doesn't, as it's peppered full of holes."

truezelda,2z97k7,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:42:42 2015 UTC,"They've also stated that the current timeline is likely to change with new games, so there's not much purpose in putting a ton of stock in it."
truezelda,2z97k7,liquidDinner,2,Tue Mar 17 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"That's because new games would make new points on the timeline, but the games themselves already lend themselves pretty well to the official timeline, so I don't see why they would change it."
truezelda,2z97k7,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't there only be two potential retcons if we got a sequel to MM, 1) that the Hero's Shade isn't the Hero of Time, and 2) that the Hero of Time did return to Hyrule and do something of value?  Would those retcons really be among the worst in Zelda history, especially considering that the Hero's Shade being the Hero of Time is something that is only found in Hyrule Historia (which says that it's a rumor anyway), and any other game that featured the Hero of Time in Hyrule could just be minimized or hidden from the kingdom's knowledge like the events of TP were?"
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"There are various hints in the game, and the HH outright says it as well on a different page. As for the final point, not as much as you would think. It would be very difficult to do something like that, TP worked because the citizens of Hyrule couldn't tell twilight from daylight, but the resistance certainly took notice, so it's safe to say that others who were paying attention to kingdom events would have as well. Yes, most heroes aren't talked about in the games that follow, but they also follow 500-1000 years after, while those that are closer have the heroes remembered, and TP definitely takes place in the 100-500 year after range."
truezelda,2z97k7,Phoxxent,2,Mon Mar 16 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"ALBW (and statements made by Aonuma recently) has (have) already rendered small portions of HH inaccurate, so I doubt Nintendo will be holding too firm to the book going forward. So I wouldn't be surprised if the Hero's Shade doesn't end up being the Hero of Time in the long-run, especially since the only in-game evidence that the two are the same is the fact that the Hero's Shade('s wolf form) reacts to the howling stones which are triggered by songs, five out of seven of which we know that the Hero of Time learned in his lifetime.   Yes, most heroes aren't talked about in the games that follow, but they also follow 500-1000 years after, while those that are closer have the heroes remembered, and TP definitely takes place in the 100-500 year after range.   But the Hero of Time was referenced multiple times in TP. Renado even says that the hero performed ""countless deeds"" in Hyrule, and that TP Link reminds him of those deeds."
truezelda,2z97k7,Petrichor03,2,Mon Mar 16 22:41:10 2015 UTC,"The big issue is that we already know the Hero of Time's fate. He ends up a restless spirit full of regret for not being recognised as the hero he is.   A new Hero of Time game, with a new adventure and new heroic deeds, would either break continuity by giving him the hero worship he regrets never having, or it would remain consistent with his regret by having his new adventure go unrecognised.  The former goes against Nintendo's new stance. They've canonized the connections between the games, which means they need to stick to the lore they've already created. The retconning this would require would piss off tons of fans.   The later won't solve anything. The main reasons people want a new Hero of Time game is because they're not satisfied with his closure, and if Nintendo sticks to the established lore, they'll just be pissed off even more, because now he'll have three adventures unrecognized.  To top it all off, there's tons of space in the various timelines for Nintendo to put brand new Links and adventures into.  In the end it would just be a giant clusterfuck and so much drama fuel."
truezelda,2z97k7,FlakJackson,8,Mon Mar 16 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"In New Hyrule, or The Story of the Flood.  New Hyrule is a possible suggestion because:   Cel-shaded art style and blue tunic evokes thoughts of Wind Waker The map we saw somewhat resembles New Hyrule at a different angle.   Story of the Flood is possible because:   It is one of very few timeline events that we know occurred but have no game for yet.  (Minish Cap prequel, Skyward Sword prequel, A Link Between Worlds prequel are the only others.)  There should be a Hero there because of Hylia's Curse. If you believe the theory about the Great Bridge of Hylia being seen in the demo, the Adult Timeline can work.  In Zelda U, the bridge appeared pristine.  In Twilight Princess the bridge appeared fairly ruined.  There's no room for a game before TP and after OoT, so if we assume the bridge's construction was planned before the timeline split, then it should exist in all three timelines - meaning that during the time of the Flood, it's perfectly reasonable for the same exact Great Bridge of Hylia to be there.   We have very little information to go on.  Speculation might turn out better after E3."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Mar 16 21:55:34 2015 UTC,But what could they do? The Goddesses flooded Hyrule because there was no Hero there at all to save them
truezelda,2z97k7,dan0314,5,Mon Mar 16 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"There had to be a Hero.  Hylia's Curse says that she and the Hero will be reborn whenever Hyrule is in danger.  Hyrule was in danger.  The Hero failed to stop Ganon before King Daphnes enacted the Flood.  Why?  Because nobody believed he was the Hero.  Think about Wind Waker's backstory: this is one instance in Hyrule's history where the regular populace KNOWS about a Hero.  They worship the Hero of Time.  The legend even says that they specifically waited for him to appear - not a new Hero, the HERO OF TIME.  The people of Hyrule, including King Daphnes, did not know about the reincarnation cycle.  They did not know other Heroes existed.  They thought the Hero of Time was a time traveler who went to different eras to help people.  Imagine the Hero in that world.  A boy who is asked if he is the Hero of Time, and has to say ""no"", and is disregarded.  Imagine if he tried to get the King to trust him and stop the Flood.  Why would the King believe him?  The King is positive that the Hero of Time is the only person who will appear and defeat Ganon.  The Hero of the Flood failed because he had no aid, and was lost to history.  The Legend of the Flood is far from airtight.  Are you forgetting that the same people who keep the legend alive don't even remember Hyrule was real?  Why would they remember a failed Hero that nobody cared about?"
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:42:59 2015 UTC,"Also, it's very heavily implied by the end of Wind Waker that it was Daphnes who called down the Flood, not any gods."

Therefore, the people who would build a new civilization above the floodwaters were instructed to flee to the mountaintops. Ganondorf's army had reached the gates of Hyrule Castle and was in the process of invading the structure when the gods answered the people's cries. After Hyrule's people had safely escaped, the gods created a great storm that swept the skies over the land of Hyrule, sealing Hyrule and Ganondorf's army under an immense ocean."""
truezelda,2z97k7,dan0314,0,Mon Mar 16 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"Nothing about the situation in Hyrule remotely suggests that any gods were involved.  People say the gods were involved, but we have not seen the gods do anything at any point throughout the rest of the series.  Mortals do things.  Sages do things.  Heroes do things.  Do you know what would happen if the King chose to flood the land himself?  He would likely perform some kind of ritual to do so, and he might even believe he was invoking the gods to perform it while doing it.  Daphnes has a huge regret lingering over him during Wind Waker.  He is not a man who has not done something terrible in his past."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,0,Tue Mar 17 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"But you said there was a Hero who failed. There was no Hero at all to save Hyrule, that's why it was flooded. It was a desperate attempt to seal Ganon once he took his opportunity to break free of his seal."
truezelda,2z97k7,dan0314,-1,Tue Mar 17 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"But you said there was a Hero who failed.   Yes.   There was no Hero at all to save Hyrule   Which I've given evidence to debunk as nothing more than a legend.   that's why it was flooded.   Right, because he failed and/or was too late to stop the flood ritual."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe flooding Hyrule was the only option the Hero of the Flood had? Assuming he existed.

truezelda,2z97k7,Drekner,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible that the Hero could have done the Flood himself, I believe it was the King since Daphnes feels such personal regret over the state of Hyrule.

truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,4,Tue Mar 17 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"Direct sequel to Majora's Mask, with a now naturally aged adult Link. I know this is definitely some wishful thinking, but it'd be nice to see what adventures he got into after returning to Hyrule from Termina. It's established in Twilight Princess that he went on to become a hero in Hyrule (even though his heroics from Ocarina of Time were essentially forgotten due to time travel) so we know that some adventures took place upon his return."
truezelda,2z97k7,TJourney,2,Mon Mar 16 23:20:34 2015 UTC,"Between Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess.   I always thought it was weird that in the Child Timeline after the events of Ocarina of Time and before Twilight Princess Ganondorf was sentenced to execution. All we know is that Link told Zelda what Ganondorf's true plans were and therefore Zelda sent Link and the Ocarina of Time far away and out of Ganondorf's reach; thus foiling his plans of entering the sacred realm. If that is all that happened then having Ganondorf sentenced to death is some Minority Report ""pre-crime"" type bullshit. I imagine that Ganondorf, having his Plan-A foiled, went for Plan-B; and Plan-B is what Zelda Wii U will be all about.  Possible events in no particular order that may occur in The Legend of Zelda: Ganondorf's Plan-B (Zelda Wii U):   Link returns to Hyrule and starts a family and settles down. Link has a son and attempts to teach him the skills of the hero. Ganondorf learns of Link's involvement in spoiling his original plans and/or Link's possession of the Triforce of Courage. Ganondorf kills Link's son who never mastered the skills of the hero which could have saved his life. Ganondorf rips out one of Link's eyes. Ganondorf is ultimately defeated, but at the cost of several lives including Link and his son. Leaving only the sages to deal with him. Ganondorf learns of Link's travels to Termina and of Majora's Mask. It is revealed that Majora's Mask came from the Twilight realm. After being defeated Ganondorf comes up with a Plan-C that involves being sent to the Twlight realm and finding the power behind Majora's Mask. His banishment to the Twilight realm ends up actually being orchestrated by himself in a sort of Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baylish Game-Of-Thrones-Style type plotting.    From a business perspective a title that falls between Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess makes a lot of sense for Nintendo. Majora's Mask 3D will have been the most recent release in the Zelda franchise so the excitement surrounding that story line will be high. Then queue the rumored Twilight Princess remake/rerelease and bam sales sales sales.  Edit: Given what we know about Zelda Wii U: landscape, familiar landmarks, beastiarity, items (sailcloth), etc; what I have just proposed is highly unlikely. However I still think it would make a great Zelda game.  Edit Two Electric Boogaloo: Eventually I am going to turn this into a full fledged fan-fiction."

truezelda,2z97k7,Jammintk,5,Tue Mar 17 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"There are a lot more connections than that. WW directly references OoT, and ST takes place 100 years after WW/PH. TP also ties in to OoT, with a highly similar world and the Master Sword lying in the ruins of the Temple of Time. AoL is a direct sequel to LoZ. OoX leads directly into LA, which is also a sequel to ALttP. ALBW takes place in the same world as ALttP centuries later. MC-FS-FSA also form an arc which, if one accepts the Palace of the Four Sword as canon, also ties in to ALttP. SS shows the origins of the Master Sword and the cycle of reincarnation for Link, Zelda, and Ganon, thus binding all the games with these characters together in a common past. The Zelda games are all interconnected in numerous ways, so it makes sense for them all to fall in the same overall continuity."
truezelda,2z97k7,Dismas423,2,Tue Mar 17 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"It's funny to me that people think Nintendo plans to destroy this thing they have just established, and have in fact been working to keep consistent decently well ever since Ocarina of Time and even before that.  Nintendo's spoken on the continuity of certain games in relation to each other since forever.  They've established clear connections between many.  They said they had an internal timeline for a long time, even though nobody believed them.  And they finally released the official one.  What is there throughout the entire history of the Zelda series to suggest that Nintendo doesn't want a consistent timeline?"
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"What is there throughout the entire history of the Zelda series to suggest that Nintendo doesn't want a consistent timeline?   Nowhere.  Pretty much every Zelda has references a prior Zelda, and while it may have not been completely consistent in the past, they have since remedied that fault.  I don't understand how people feel that a bunch of 'random' stories is a more interesting way to go than cohesion and coherency inside a wide universe of events.  One of the biggest things that makes it so interesting to me is the whole concept of ""I was here before"" or ""a lot of history has happened in this spot."""
truezelda,2z97k7,malaroo,2,Tue Mar 17 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"how people feel that a bunch of 'random' stories is a more interesting   Yeah, I agree with that as well.  I happen to really like the fact that the hero, goddess, and Demise are caught in an eternal battle.  As well as the fact that the world has a massively rich lore that can always be delved into or expanded, instead of just randomly inventing new shit for new worlds (not that they can't do that, too)."
truezelda,2z97k7,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 17 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I was never big on the whole Demise explanation but it's certainly better than 'here's a bunch of people with the same name and face but they're not actually connected"".  Finding the Master Sword in Twilight Princess for example wouldn't even have been half as cool if not for the fact that you saw Link put it back there in Ocarina of Time.  Seeing sunken Hyrule in Wind Waker would be... whatever, if not for the fact that it was where you did your adventuring in the previous games.  Zelda is finally starting to gain legitimate story ground beyond 'hero saves the princess repeatedly' and people want to see it diminished back to that.  Why?"
truezelda,2z97k7,malaroo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that they will or that I think they will. I think its better for them to have the freedom to make a story in a Zelda game that doesn't jive with the rest of the series. With the current continuity we will never see Zelda be a hero, we will never see a relatable Ganon, and we will never see a dark side to Link. It just will not happen.  I would love to see a Zelda game where there is no Hero so Zelda has to go protect her own kingdom and be her own badass. I want to see a game where the character have to put aside their differences and work together against a greater threat. I want to see a game where Link isn't the pure, perfect hero that we know now.  With the reincarnation cycle established in SS, we will never see any of these outcomes because in canon, as it is now, Demise/Link/Zelda are locked in a reincarnation cycle and cannot change roles and there cannot be any kind of new story innovations based on switching up the character roles. Unless, that is, Nintendo abandons the universe they've established or somehow break the curse, which seems unlikely."
truezelda,2z97k7,Jammintk,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"we will never see Zelda be a hero   Dream Drop Distance style.  Link and Zelda working separately on the same mission, both having an adventure.  Replacing the role of Link entirely with Zelda would be asinine, anyway.   we will never see a relatable Ganon   This isn't even remotely true.  All Ganon and any other Demise incarnation needs is a lust for power that will put him at odds with his two counterparts.  Their motivations are, otherwise, entirely their own.   we will never see a dark side to Link   Also not true, just because it hasn't been done.  They're not all the same person, and they don't share a ""ghost"".  Every single one is a unique person who simply shares the traits of being willing to help others at all costs.  In fact, this is probably the easiest 'problem' to solve, because it's so easy to convince a hero to do bad things.  You can also circumvent your entire issue completely just by giving an existing Hero a sequel game.  Sequels don't need Demise, nor Zelda."
truezelda,2z64cm,bleedinginkmusic,22,Sun Mar 15 22:36:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the trading quest is hardly unique to those two games. Trading questlines are pretty much a staple in Zelda games, and adventure/RPGs as a whole."

truezelda,2z64cm,joshuran,8,Mon Mar 16 02:58:18 2015 UTC,"You've overlooked one of the largest things to come over from MM into WW: dynamic town with large, world-spanning quest lines.   Windfall is very much a throwback to Clock Town, and even without the 3 day timer, it's a vibrant place where every interaction you can have introduces a problem you can solve. Before MM, the stories centered around a town and its inhabitants were mostly throwaway one time fetch quests or parts of trading sequences.   Remember also that MM was Aonuma's first solo directed game, and WW was his second. Similarities in pacing and style are absolutely to be expected."
truezelda,2z64cm,joshuran,2,Mon Mar 16 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"That's definitely true, but I kind of feel like that's something that's not exclusive to these two, but more of something that became a staple of the core Zelda series starting with Majora's Mask. ...

truezelda,2z64cm,specnar24,3,Mon Mar 16 12:44:17 2015 UTC,"a lot of  things were probably carried over because Wind Waker started early development while Majora's mask was being finalised, it's just a case of overlapping development, the same reason that Ravio looks like Nabbit, the games were in development at the same time and the development teams were on the same floor, this is probably also the same reason that some of the masks from Majora's mask are visible behind the desk at the figurine gallery.  Games often have nods to other games in the series, even small things like the figurine gallery visitor having an 8 bit octorock on their bag or a lot of music in Wind Waker containing snippets of music from other games (mostly OoT)"

truezelda,2z7nhv,reallybigzeldafan,5,Mon Mar 16 07:51:28 2015 UTC,"Since this is a flagship console game, I am pretty confident when I say I don't think we'll see any true multiplayer.  I think for a game like Zelda, the Dark Souls system would be fantastic.  In Dark Souls, there are a few things you can do that involve multiplayer:   Players can leave messages on the ground pretty much anywhere.  While playing you'll see some of these, and they can tell you when a boss is coming up or where there is a secret passage etc. Bloodstains appear where some players have died.  If you interact with them it'll show you an apparition of that player's death, so you might get some idea of what not to do. Sometimes you'll just see an apparition walking around on its own - I think this might actually be a player playing in real-time, but you can't interact with it in any way.  (Someone correct me on that one if I'm wrong.) You can summon up to two players to help you, if they leave a summon sign similar to the messages.  They will be ghostly and can assist you up through a boss, at which point they disappear and are rewarded. Your world can be invaded by a player who will attempt to kill you for rewards, and if you defeat them you'll get rewards.   I think the final two notes are less likely, but the rest could work really well."
truezelda,2z7nhv,Serbaayuu,4,Mon Mar 16 11:10:17 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that Wind Waker HD had its own version of ""bloodstains"" with the messages in bottles that you could find from other players."
truezelda,2z7nhv,Mutericator,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"VS  Using an item obtainable in-game (Shadow Crystal? idk) spawns a shadow link, controllable by a second player. This second player can do everything link can do, including accompanying you through the game. There will be a few optional dungeons that require a second player, but they are separate from the main set.  You can also duel. This allows you to fight using all the tools you have available, using wherever you are currently as a battlefield. If you want, you can fight on horseback (shadow link can call a shadow Epona). There is a guard break mechanic employed that prevents shield camping - after three consecutive hits on a shield the player will stumble and be open to attack.   It's a simple feature but I think it would do the game wonders. Integrate it into the single player story, don't have it separate. Let us have link x link sword fights dammit!"
truezelda,2z7nhv,benoxxxx,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:17:37 2015 UTC,"i thought about shadow links too at one point, i thought that maybe they could have your game randomly connect to someone else's around the world and you's just get to  see them walking around as a shadow link and walking up to and attacking them could engage them in combat, sort of like an evolution of ALBW's system, i don't think they'd tie it to an item though, it'd probably just start happening after a certain point in the game, i also don't think they'd use the name shadow crystal as iirc that is the Japanese name of the fused shadow"
truezelda,2z7nhv,SuperNeonManGuy,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"That could be cool, but as awesome as Dark Souls style multiplayer is, it's deliberately difficult to match up with friends which really isn't Nintendo's MO. They prefer to encourage local multiplayer, which is why I can see a local second player tied to an item as somewhat more likely (though chances are we'll have zero multiplayer whatsoever unfortunately). And yeah that name was just me spit-balling - I'm sure they could think of something more original."
truezelda,2z2baz,starlitepony,53,Sat Mar 14 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"The fact is there are more OoT fans than Zelda fans. Now, you can have an individual game be your favorite game and still be a series fan, don't get all defensive about that. But do ask yourself: ""Do I love the series or do I just love this tiny part of it?""  All I want in a StarFox game is slick, arcade-style action with minimal plot and fun chatter. I hate StarFox for the SNES, I hate Adventures, I hate what little I played of Assault, and I never gave Command the time of day. Every time I thought about these games, I thought to myself ""These games are all missing the point of what makes this series great.""   As an adult, I finally realized that I don't like StarFox and that I just like StarFox 64. All this time that I had been complaining about the series missing the point, I was the one who was missing the point. The series has grown steadily more focused on mechanical complexity and plot and drama with each passing game, asking you to care about the characters as more than just portraits and charming sound bites, and its actual fans are eating that up. StarFox isn't a series for me, it's a series for them. If I got my way, the series's actual fans would be upset by that change.  Ocarina of Time is Zelda's StarFox 64, its Final Fantasy VII. People who love it don't understand that it's not representative of the whole. (Nintendo constantly aping its iconography in every Zelda game since it isn't helping matters.) And they think that if we go back to it that it will get the series ""back on track""."

truezelda,2z2baz,Drinkmydespair,22,Sun Mar 15 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Hero of Time needs to be revisited, and in fact I believe it would do more harm than good.  As it stands we know that the Hero of Time doesn't have any more grand adventures, at least none that he is recognised for, that he learns some fancy sword skills, has kid/s and dies with regret in his heart.   And I think that's perfect. My personal headcanon has the Hero of Time returning to Hyrule, working as a knight or mercenary (where he learns his swordsmanship), seeking the heroic recognition he deserves, but never received. Eventually he settles down with Malon to have a kid or two and before he can start teaching his kids the sword he's called back to action and dies a hero's death saving one or two of his comrades (which he is remembered for, but only by them and their families).  The Hero's Shade shows us a tragic figure, steeped in regret and sorrow. This is important, because all too often our protagonists (in all forms of media) have everything work out for them in the end*. We need flawed, failed and defeated heroes every now and then to keep things interesting. This is, arguably, the greatest hero in the Zelda timeline** and the implications from the Hero's Shade show us that in his entire adult life he couldn't live up to the actions of his childhood. It's interesting and beautiful.  A new game centered on the Hero of Time would invalidate all of this.  * This is why Kvothe (Kingkiller Chronicle) is such an interesting character. From the very beginning we know he's a washed-up fuck-up.  ** This isn't true by any measure. The Hero of Legend (LttP, OoA, OoS, LA) is the greatest Hero in the Zelda timeline. The Hero of Time, to add insult to the injury of his life, is wholly responsible for Ganondorf's ascension and the terror he reigns on two (likely all three) timelines. He is not, thankfully, aware that these reigns of terror exists."
truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,4,Sat Mar 14 23:58:23 2015 UTC,Zelda's more responsible. Link acted out of ignorance (due to Zelda's lack of knowledge regarding the Master Sword) not incompetence.
truezelda,2z2baz,androsphere,3,Sun Mar 15 05:58:48 2015 UTC,"Zelda is more culpable, but Link still should have used some common sense.   Zelda wanted to get to the Triforce first and use it to defeat Ganondorf. While noble, it's also tremendously stupid and they both should have realized this. With access to the Triforce held entirely in their hands the best course of action would have been to scatter the stones anew so there would be no chance of Ganondorf entering the Sacred Realm.  They aimed too high and the world suffered."
truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,7,Sun Mar 15 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"He is probably responsible for all 3 timelines, as the most probably reason for Ganondorf getting the triforce in the child timeline is that Link still had the triforce of courage, causing the other 2 pieces to split up, ganondorf probably didn't know he had it thanks to the time travel shenanigans, and it surfaced when he was in mortal danger (execution)    The greatest hero is indeed hero of legend. Going up against a full triforce Ganon without any pieces (obviously) himself. Then saving 2 other lands and rescuing the wind fish from his dreamprison. All while keeping casualties super low (thanks to his wish, but still) mastering the use of many, MANY items, etc... The only thing he doesn't have on his record is actually finishing ganon off for good, but because of him getting the full triforce, this is most likely impossible in the Fallen timeline."

I've even realized this in the past and just overlooked it in my post above."
truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,9,Sun Mar 15 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"What I love about the timeline is how opposite everything works.    In the timeline where you prevent ganondorf from getting the triforce and conquering hyrule : he gets the triforce and conquers hyrule through zant.  (child timeline)    In the timeline where Hyrule is saved : Hyrule gets flooded and left behind (adult timeline)    In the timeline where we 'fail' : Ganon keeps coming back, BUT is constantly triumphed over (in most games without even being able to cause any decent damage) and Hyrule kept existing for a lot of games. (also at this point : the timeline where we fail has the most games, despite technically being behind a 'game over')"
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"i don't want to write up the whole thing but i wrote a long theory about why the downfall timeline isn't necessarily a ""game over"" timeline and it also explains the sudden appearance of an age limit on the master sword,  in summary:  ""The reason that the master sword has an age limit during the events of Ocarina of Time (which is absent in literally every other game) is because Link pulled the sword, freed Rauru (and the other ancient sages?) from imprisonment AS A CHILD and was subsequently killed by Ganon, to prevent everything falling to chaos Zelda used the Ocarina of Time to send Rauru (or possibly herself) back in time to make Link sleep for 7 years instead of dying as a child, the game then plays out as we see it, it means that the downfall timeline did happen, it's just that we couldn't have possibly seen it in-game as it was negated in the continuity that we see. The adult timeline continues on after link was sent to his childhood at the end of the events of the game, one would assume that the catastrophic events of the downfall timeline would continue on even after Zelda/Rauru left the timeline using the Ocarina,  there's nothing in the games to disprove this so it's my personal headcanon until it is disproven by the games"""
truezelda,2z2baz,SuperNeonManGuy,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"I actually had a similar theory, but in mine, Link dies when ganondorf blasts him with magic after Zelda escapes. Then zelda (or 'someone') warns link through his vision at the start of OoT. when it happens in the actual game, Link braces himself for the attack, which results in him surviving it.    The only problem with it is that they said the split happens during the final battle with ganon. You idea is interesting too."

truezelda,2z2baz,jey123,3,Mon Mar 16 15:50:10 2015 UTC,"Wall of text below. You have been warned.   I can tell you why people want to revisit the Hero of Time: nostalgia. OoT was the biggest game on the N64, and it has become nearly impossible to think back to N64 without nostalgia goggles. This was a lot of people's first trip into Hyrule and they will always hold that first game close to their hearts.  On top of that, the Hero of Time's story is more open ended when it's all said and done. OoT returned him to childhood, MM has him depart to realms unknown, still a young kid looking for Navi. Most Zelda games had more closure. The endings go like ""Hurrah! you saved the princess and defeated Ganon. Your quest is now at an end. Good Job!"" It leaves Link very little room to go. There are exceptions, Link's Awakening chief among them, but they never achieved that kind of success of OoT. It also seems like Nintendo has been setting up a return to the Hero of Time's story. Every single Zelda release since 2011 (SS) has been capitalizing on nostalgia. WW HD, OoT 3DS, MM 3DS. Hyrule Warriors was a mish-mash of nostalgia and beloved characters from almost every 3D Zelda game. Link Between Worlds was marketed as Link to the Past 2.0.  The only Zelda game with more nostalgia connected to it than Link to the Past is OoT. If Nintendo can capitalize on the success of any Zelda game, it is OoT It also saves them the trouble of creating new characters or too much world building because they already have a strong foundation to build from. I can't deny that the idea of revisiting Saria, Darunia, Ruto, and Sheik excites me to no end. So long as Nintendo can keep their story-telling on point I would absolutely welcome a return to OoT Hyrule. Skyward Swordwas the most recent console release and, say what you will of motion controls and hand-holding, it told one of if not the best story of any Zelda game. So I trust Nintendo to deliver."
truezelda,2z2baz,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"the Hero of Time's story is more open ended   Really?  Because from my perspective, his story is one of the few that had a distinct end.  He died with his regret."
truezelda,2z2baz,jey123,3,Sun Mar 15 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, we met his angsty ghost, but we never got to see how he went from the kid in Majora's Mask to the saddened ghost of Twilight Princess."
truezelda,2z2baz,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Mar 15 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it probably wasn't by having an adventure, considering he regrets not being able to pass on his skills and not being recognized as a hero for his actions in the Adult Timeline and in Termina.  Not to mention it's pretty unlikely that he'd encounter Ganondorf in his lifetime, since the King of Thieves was being hunted by the Royal Family and eventually executed.  So in order to ""finish"" the Hero of Time's story, you'd need to give him yet another adventure where nobody knows who he is, located in some other region or dimension, and doing little to advance his character beyond what he ended on in Majora's Mask.  At that point, why are you even making it about the Hero of Time, instead of a new Hero altogether?"
truezelda,2z2baz,jey123,3,Sun Mar 15 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Shit, saving the world three times for no credit would make anyone bitter."
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,7,Sun Mar 15 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why people want to go back to him either. He already had 2 games, and his games didn't focus on the hero/his personality at all, making him the most lacking out of the 3D Links, personality-wise. A new Link will always be more interesting IMO.    The only thing that would be interesting is if he brought the transformation masks with him. But I doubt he would have them in a sequel, he'd probably start with nearly nothing again, and there is no reason why they can't have a new transforming hero.    If the MM masks actually had Darmani, Mikau and Butler's son their souls in them then it could be an interesting story if that be played with, as a sort of 4 souls sharing 1 body, but the masks don't work that way, so that's out the window too.    All in all, I think people are just nostalgic to that hero and think a third game would automatically feel like those games or something."
truezelda,2z2baz,GallantBlade475,5,Sat Mar 14 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"The Hero of Legend had four games. Then again they're 2D games, and his story was never set in stone like the Hero of Time's was."
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,7,Sun Mar 15 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"And tell me, does ""the hero of legend"" have a better rounded out story because of it ? No, if anything his story ends on the biggest 'cliffhanger' of any link so far.    Also, those games are very loosely connected and would have worked perfectly as a new Link every time."
truezelda,2z2baz,jey123,2,Sun Mar 15 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"After Link to the Past, Link was transported to the world of Oracle of Ages/Seasons because they needed a hero. After helping them, he departs by ship and is shipwrecked, setting into motion the events of Link's Awakening. Link's Awakening also gave us the Link/Marin ship, so I won't say it didn't add to his character over time."
truezelda,2z2baz,Phoxxent,2,Sun Mar 15 08:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well, he had 2 until recently when the oracles were concretely set as his adventures. Those two could really fit just about anywhere on the timeline."
truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,6,Sun Mar 15 20:00:11 2015 UTC,Actually the true ending of the Oracle games hinted at their current placement in the timeline all along. In a linked game ending Link sails away in a ship very similar to the one he wrecks in the beginning of Link's Awakening. Very many theorists correctly placed the Oracle games immediately before Link's Awakening for years before Hyrule Historia.
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,5,Sun Mar 15 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"Not at all... Alttp > Oracles > awakening was the longest stretch of the timeline we could know, and it was certain.    After alttp, link places the triforce in that temple at the start of the oracle games, and as his wish is most likely to help as many people as possible, the triforce sends him to where he is needed.  The Boat the true ending of the oracle games, he leaves on a boat, the exact same boat he is using at the start of awakening."
truezelda,2z2baz,Petrichor03,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:32:05 2015 UTC,"It really wasn't certain at the time because Zelda tells Link in the Oracles games that she's never met him before, and that she's only heard stories of him from Impa before actually meeting him. Since the games say that Oracles Link isn't the same guy as ALttP Link, at the time we couldn't be certain about a ALttP > Oracles > LA order."
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,5,Sun Mar 15 03:41:03 2015 UTC,"That is probably cause Link un-wished the events from Alttp though. Would also explain why the master sword gets reforged to golden during ALBW again.    Then again, with the way they made the fallen hero timeline split off, alttp's lore might as well not exist anyway..."
truezelda,2z2baz,Petrichor03,0,Sun Mar 15 04:17:56 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but it just reinforces the uncertainty of the Oracles being able to be placed between ALttP and LA since we don't know exactly what Link wished for. For example, it seems unlikely that Link simply un-wished the events of ALttP, because if he did, that would have brought Ganon back to life or at least transformed the Sacred Realm back into the Dark World, but LA tells us that Ganon did die and remain dead at the end of ALttP, and ALttP just shows the Dark World transforming back into the Sacred Realm as a result of Link's wish. Plus there's no Impa in ALttP taking care of ALttP Zelda, but Oracles Zelda does have a nursemaid. And LA's back story tells us that everyone remembers Ganon attacking Hyrule and Link fulfilling the ""Hyrulian Prophecy"" by defeating him, so even if Link did un-wish the events of ALttP, Zelda should have still remembered them."
truezelda,2z2baz,Petrichor03,2,Sun Mar 15 05:22:38 2015 UTC,"The placement of the Oracles is a bit limited thanks to the state of the Triforce in those games. Since all three pieces of the Triforce are out in the Light World, as well as the fact that the pieces are split rather than together, we know the games have to take place after OoT. Since all three pieces are in Hyrule Castle, we know that the Oracles take place during an era where Hyrule and Hyrule Castle exist (as opposed to, say, LoZ/AoL when there is no Hyrule Castle). And since the Triforce is relatively unguarded, not to mention the fact that Twinrova decided to attack lands other than Hyrule, this implies that Hyrule is at peace during these games. As of right now, we only know of three eras when Hyrule was at peace: 1) before monsters invaded in TMC, 2) between FS and FSA, and 3) during the Golden Age following Link's wish on the Triforce in ALttP. So the Oracles most likely take place in one of these three timespans (and since they have to come after OoT, that rules out the first timespan)."
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,12,Sun Mar 15 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"He is filled with regret for not being REMEMBERED as a hero. Cause he left Termina and his heroics in Hyrule ""never happened""    But his main regret is not passing on his skills"
truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,6,Sun Mar 15 04:15:02 2015 UTC,Not to mention the fact that a good deal of his heroic deeds in Termina were performed in the guise of other people.
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,2,Sat Mar 14 22:41:58 2015 UTC,"True, in fact all of the ones that are 'remembered' except for some minor once like stopping the bomb bag theft and the couple sidequest.    The ones that are 'big' happenings were attributed to Darmani or Mikau or ""some deku kid"""

Perhaps clearing Woodfall Temple, if anyone actually believes the Deku Princess when she claims to have been rescued by a Deku who can turn into a Hylian."
truezelda,2z2baz,henryuuk,2,Sun Mar 15 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"Actually the deku's say that themselves, the soldiers on the throne room mention it."

truezelda,2z2baz,TheDetective13,3,Sun Mar 15 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"It's because it's most people's favorite game, including mine. We just want to be able to revisit the Hyrule we grew up with or at least continue our favorite Link's story. It'll be like completing a journey we started (even though Majora's Mask kind of did that). However, I'm thinking with Adult Link this time, but who knows. Honestly I'd like another game where you switch between child and adult although that won't happen. It's just because I can't decide on whether I want child Link or adult Link!"
truezelda,2z2baz,Phoxxent,2,Sun Mar 15 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"I think the problem lies in that that area of the timeline is already rather crowded, and another alternate dimension would be rather trite to say the least. We know nothing happened in Hyrule, and to just live out the rest of his life would A) have official shipping, which makes some people mad, and B) be more like the Legend of Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing of Time than the legend of Zelda."

truezelda,2z2baz,cbfw86,0,Mon Mar 16 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"I have been playing the Legend of Zelda since the original came out on the NES. The only games I haven't played are the televised, serialised ROMS from the 80s which are gone forever, and the other is Spirit Tracks because I just haven't got the time now that I'm a grown man.  I can tell you, however, that without equivocation, hesitation or the slightest shred of doubt, that the Hero of Time is THE Link of the Legend of Zelda franchise. When someone talks about Link, he is the guy people think of, whether they realise it or not.  Why? The answer isn't easy to grasp. It is a partly because of what Ocarina of Time did to the gaming world, not just Nintendo or Zelda. OOT changed everything. There was no going back. There is a reason why many consider it to be the most influential video game of all time. Much like how the Mona Lisa looks absolutely mind blowing in the Louvre surrounded by it's contemporary pieces of artwork, so too does OOT stand out from every other video game of the late 1990s. The only think that came close was Shenmue and Soul Calibur, and even then they didn't have the intense history and prestige that Zelda had enjoyed for 13 or so years at that point. I remember queuing outside an Electronics Boutique at midnight to get a copy. The queue was insane. It snaked around for at least a kilometre, Many didn't get a copy because the shop simply sold out.  But it's more than that. The Hero of Time is a bona fide badass. More so than any of the others. Let's compare.   The Legend of Zelda: We have little information about Link's backstory. Hard to pass judgement The Adventure of Link: Again, little is known about Link A Link the the Past: Link is dragged into a conflict by a telepathic message by Zelda and the passing of his mysterious Uncle Link's Awakening: Sailor Link learns to not be afraid of the dark Ocarina of Time: Orphan Link rises to the call of duty and destiny and single handedly quests through the land to save the world, saving civilisations and races alike in the process. He receives no fame. No accolade. At the end of all of it, he goes home and continues an unassuming life as a lone wolf, knowing that, much like Frodo, he can't go back and pick up the threads of an old life. Thus, he goes his own way on his own adventures. (Which leads us to...) Majora's Mask: Orphan Link continues his questings as a world saver and takes on a mystical enemy from another land. He takes on the guises and talents of a war hero, a lead guitarist, and a junior butler to go into the moon - the MOON - and ensnare the power of entire land in a superior form of being to notch up a second saved world on his bedpost Seasons: Link takes LSD and shrooms Wind Waker: Link saves his sister Twilight Princess: Link saves a bunch of kidnapped kids and helps and imp Phantom Hourglass: Link saves his damsel in distress Spirit Tracks: Link drives a train Skyward Sword: Link saves his 'special friend'   I would say, in the balance of things, the Hero of Time is a bigger hero than the others. He has no agenda, no vendetta, no secondary motive at all throughout the entire game. He's not saving his horse, his sister, a kidnapped princess. No, he's saving the motherfucking world.  Admittedly all Zelda games get there eventually. EVENTUALLY, but from the get go in OOT, the Hero of Time ponies the fuck up like a man's man and marches off to save the world.  He is without question the pinnacle of Zelda game characters. Everything about him is heroic. He didn't pussy foot around a dungeon entrance and gulp, he didn't lose control of his sword in the spin attack and get dizzy. He just got shit done."
truezelda,2z2baz,tinytim0,1 point,Sun Mar 15 07:18:46 2015 UTC,"The only games I haven't played are the televised, serialised ROMS from the 80s which are gone forever   Before addressing the actual point of your post, there are copies of those ROMs available online. They don't have the voice-over of the original radio program, true, but you can either choose to play one that is time-dependent (and uses on-screen textboxes instead of voice-overs) or to play one that is completion-dependent, and changes the world as you collect more pieces of the Triforce instead of using the clock.   But it's more than that. The Hero of Time is a bona fide badass. More so than any of the others. Let's compare.   I think you're being very overly generous to the Hero of Time and ignoring the similar qualities in other heroes. You overstate his experiences while understating that of others.  Wind Waker was about far more than ""Link saves his sister"" and Spirit Tracks was about far more than just ""Link drives a train"", and it honestly feels very unjust to summarize them into those single sentences while writing paragraphs about the games you want to present in a better light (and that implies for virtually all of the games here).   the Hero of Time is a bigger hero than the others. He has no agenda, no vendetta, no secondary motive at all throughout the entire game.   Sure he does: His initial quest is not to save the world, it's to just save the Deku Tree, then it's just to help Zelda get the Spiritual Stones. He never even seems to think about 'saving the world' until we enter the adult timeline: Up until then, he just wants to stop Ganondorf from doing generically evil things, with no mention of the world being in danger.   Everything about him is heroic. He didn't pussy foot around a dungeon entrance and gulp, he didn't lose control of his sword in the spin attack and get dizzy. He just got shit done.   Like virtually every other Link in the series? In the first game, Link is about thirteen years old at the most in the first Zelda game and saves Impa from a band of Moblins with no weapon but a shield and a few rocks. He then accepts the quest to conquer the eight dungeons of Hyrule, find Ganon, kill him, and save Zelda.  In A Link to the Past, Link receives a telepathic message from Zelda, watches his uncle die in front of him, and immediately saves her from the evil and most powerful wizard in Hyrule, who is actually controlled by Ganon. He becomes hated and feared by virtually the entire townspeople for 'kidnapping' Zelda and still presses on in his quest, eventually killing Ganon.  In Twilight Princess, in Wind Waker, even in Skyward Sword, the hero has far more personality than the Hero of Time."
truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,-2,Sun Mar 15 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about 'I don't think you really get more mileage out of Zelda II or Majora's Mask by having already played the original Zelda or Ocarina of time, for example'  At the same time, some Links have more full stories, and we have both been retelling the Hero of Time's story with the rereleases of OoT3D and MM3D, as well as have the fact that his story is incomplete.  People want to know what is next in his story, and it's on the forefront of everyones minds."
truezelda,2z2baz,tinytim0,6,Mon Mar 16 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"His story is complete.  He lives a life of relative obscurity, has a kid or two and dies filled with regret."

They hate that this Link, their Link in oh so very many cases, is reduced to such a state. They want a game where he can be the hero one last time and have a truly happy ending.  But he can't have that. He told us himself that he never realized his deepest desires, that he was never lauded, never celebrated. To remain consistent a new game would have to end on the same sour note these people currently complain about, which wouldn't fix anything. And now that Nintendo has committed to the timeline and the lore they've been crafting for the past two decades they can't retcon something like that.  The problem isn't that the Hero of Time has no finality. The problem is that he does, and people don't like it."

Of course it's also possible that the Hero's Shade isn't actually the Hero of Time because Hyrule Historia does say that the two being the same is just a rumor."

He searches for Navi to fill the hole of a lost friend (and almost certainly because she's the only person who remembers his heroic deeds) but through his adventures in Termina he finds new friends and performs more heroic deeds that those friends can relate to.  Navi never struck me as a friend to Link, through her own eyes, at least. She was tasked to help and guide him by the Deku Tree, and left when he no longer needed those things. He was just a job to her, and I like to think that Link realized that, saw that his new friendships were far more genuine and fulfilling and stopped searching for someone who wasn't committed to him."
truezelda,2z2baz,GallantBlade475,2,Sun Mar 15 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man. That's just kind of... boring. I completely understand that you're looking for a less ""classic-happy-ending"" type of conclusion, but there's a reason most stories don't end that way. It's unsatisfying and inconclusive. Link set off on an adventure to find someone he holds very dear and it's sincerely understandable that people who have grown up with this character and invested a lot of time into it would want to see that conclude.   Besides, it's Zelda. Let's not pretend this is a series with this completely against-the-grain Shakespearean plot. It's a classic adventure tale with a hero, a princess and a snout nosed villain. Some traditional closure would be fitting"

truezelda,2z2baz,FlakJackson,4,Sun Mar 15 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"Unlike what happened at the end of OoT that left him feeling empty, he probably left Termina of his own volition. He likely experienced a great deal of emotional growth."

I really expected myself to sink maybe 15 - 20 hours tops into the game, but there's so much content in the Adventure maps I played the game pretty regularly for the last few months (until MH4U came out).  OP, it's a fun game and it helps if you get deep into collecting all the extras (characters, weapons, costumes, pictures, etc).  It has very few actual ""Zelda"" gameplay elements (no puzzles), but I was pleasantly pleased by how well the Dynasty Warriors ""hack-and-slash"" melded with the Zelda story elements.  Edit: It also fulfilled my long-held wish of playing characters like Zelda, Sheik, and others outside of Smash Bros.  If you have ever wanted to play as (Hyrule Warriors spoilers) Ganondorf with dual swords, Darunia with the hammer, Twili Midna, or Fierce Deity Link, this is the game for you."

truezelda,2z1et1,Dalfamurni,2,Sat Mar 14 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"Best Warriors game to date. The lock on, magic + Special meters (Which are very different), the varied weapons per-character, the extremely varied enemies including massive ""bosses"", the dodge-rolling + Locked on dodge-rolling, the weak point attacks, and the standard combos combine perfectly to make the most interesting and fun Warriors game to date. It also seems to have just the perfect selection of characters. It has enough cool characters to let you pick a favorite, a secondary, and a couple of others that are fun, and then it has some silly ones that are just fun to play as. It's really cool.  On top of that, there are a ton of game modes, and I know what you're thinking. You are probably thinking ""Yeah, but I only ever play one mode in a warriors game for more than 5 hours maximum"". In this game you will find yourself devoting a ton of time to every game mode (Including challenge mode after the latest update).  The only thing missing is Empires mode.

I don't really feel like a pro either. A rewarding combo would be something you had to memorize, like in street fighter or killer instinct. This game is basically just ""oh just remember to hit X after the SECOND press"" and that's it.  It just kinda preys on the fact that you're killing ~1000 enemies per level, basically making you think you've accomplished something when you really haven't done much.  oh and adventure mode was kinda fun till I realized I was spending time unlocking 2 shittier characters  and I was gonna drop $20 for the season pass but I didn't want to after a while"

You feel most rewarded when you find your mains and develop them.  The game disguises itself as a mindless hack-n-slash at times because you could feel like you're kicking butt at first, then lose the battle all of a sudden because you weren't watching your ""allied base"". So hack-n-slash in those important places first! Press pause and check out character statuses to get an idea of who is where because it's easy (for me) to get lost when someone needs saving."

truezelda,2z22rp,Noahtheboatguy69,11,Sat Mar 14 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"Four Swords Simply cause it is so limited and feels like a 'demo' to Four Swords Adventures.    This is mostly cause I played FSA earlier though.    I still liked it though, it's just my least favorite, for me there is no bad zelda game."
truezelda,2z22rp,henryuuk,2,Sat Mar 14 23:12:53 2015 UTC,I played FSA first too. Four Swords is disappointingly small by comparison.
truezelda,2z22rp,serpent-tailed-angel,4,Sun Mar 15 03:32:52 2015 UTC,It's mostly the fact that it was sort of a 'bonus game' yet is still counted as a full game by the lore. Which causes it to be very lacking.
truezelda,2z22rp,henryuuk,2,Sun Mar 15 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"I have not played FSA, but I still have to agree. It's far too limited compared to other games in the series. There's no overworld, just a level select. Granted, I've only played the DSi version, alone, so I still may not be getting the full experience."
truezelda,2z22rp,GoshDarnBatman,2,Sun Mar 15 04:29:18 2015 UTC,"Actually the Dsi version is 'better' the original was even more limited.    Now it should be said that FSA also works with a level-select, but that is because of the way the game is 4 player."

The sailing was a stripped down version of Wind Waker's that wasn't as interesting, the overworld was forgettable, the dungeon design was meh, the story wasn't very memorable, the music was terrible (with the only good songs being from other Zelda games), and the Temple of the Ocean King manages to be both frustrating and boring due to having to go back to it multiple times and replay parts you've already done.  On the bright side, Linebeck was cool, and some of the touch-screen puzzles were good.  That's it."
truezelda,2z22rp,theshinymew64,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"I hated the idea of the Temple of the Ocean King at the start, but I ended up loving it. I thought it was amazing to go through the same temple, see a spot where you can use your new item and then skip a very lengthy part."
truezelda,2z22rp,keltond95,5,Sun Mar 15 22:52:22 2015 UTC,"Skyward Sword, I still like it, there are no official zelda games I think are bad. However Skyward had a lot of potential that was squandered, the Skyloft overworld is boring, with very little in it, the only thing I remember is a pupkin shop and the whale parasite boss. Fi is a very intrusive companion, with unnecessary handholding, Zelda companions are meant to point you in the correct direction when prompted if you get stuck or forget your place, not to constantly point out the obvious. And the amount of recycled bosses and enviroments was unessecary, was there really a need to fight the Imprisoned 3 times? couldn't they think of a better boss like a robot bull or an ant lion dragon? also it really adds a lot of tension to your game when the main antagonist is the first boss and gets his ass kicked 3 times, it doesn't hold a candle to the sense of overpowering dread from Majora or Ganon, I don't like the fact that the 3 provinces of Hyrule are revisited 3 times, with the exception of the sand ocean they don't really seem to do anything new with the re visited environments, like the Shadow temple or the Temple of time which are good examples of how to do revisited areas correctly."
truezelda,2z22rp,nazishark,10,Sun Mar 15 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm one of those who dislikes SS. The game gets too much hate, and I can see why people like it, but as much as I wish I did I don't actually like the game myself.  There are lots of reasons, including the ones you've all heard before many times (like motion controls - I not only have a personal preference against motion controls, but I also have a medical reason to dislike using them), and some which are... less common. For example, I don't really like that incarnation of Zelda - which as you might imagine was a rather large issue considering her being a focal point of the plot. I feel like comparing her to Midna in TP (in the extremely plot-centric main character regard), but while Midna is actually my favourite fictional character, SS Zelda is probably my least favourite main LoZ character. I mean, I don't hate her, but I can't think of anyone who I'd consider a main character that I like less.  That's just one of many reasons though, and I don't think it's worth going through all the reasons (plus it would take a while). I suspect most of it just comes down to personal preference. I wouldn't say I felt any of the elements of the game were outright bad... but my reaction to the entire game can pretty much be summarised like this: ""meh"".  I found it surprisingly... unexciting, in general. Odd, for such an apparently lively game. I want to replay it to see if I'll like it more, but I somehow doubt it and the prospect of replaying it.. is not really that appealing."
truezelda,2z22rp,Hypheran,2,Sat Mar 14 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"I agree. I can understand why people enjoy it, I can see the game's good aspects, but I personally cannot stand it."
truezelda,2z22rp,dragsmic,3,Sat Mar 14 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time, I think.  I also wholly agree with /u/henryuuk's answer of Four Swords, I don't even think that game should have been made canon and FSA should have just been considered a straight remake/improvement of it.  Things I like about Ocarina of Time:   Ganondorf's beginnings The implications of the war in Hyrule around that era It invented Z-targeting which is a perfect system   Things I don't like about Ocarina of Time:   Zelda is not very good at making decisions Sheik is a terrible character and nothing more than a talking signpost for the player, yet for some reason has become one of the most popular series characters for years Hyrule Field is empty and boring Many of the bosses are boring and/or really trivial.  This especially includes Morpha and Bongo-Bongo if you got the Biggoron Sword Playing the ocarina and learning new songs is really, really slow.  Makes me feel like the game thinks I'm stupid This game suffers the strongest from the ""Get these relics because I said so"" trope.  Most other games in the series that make you get a relic, the relic actually does something.  Nabooru is the only sage it really feels like you actually help, since all the other ones are either unseen or just vanish immediately. Link has no meaningful relationship with any character, even though lots of them say he does. The game has some of the least exciting environments.  I realize this was the first 3D title, but most places you go to are a straight path with barely any obstructions, or giant flat planes."
truezelda,2z22rp,Serbaayuu,8,Sun Mar 15 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"Skyward sword.   It interrupts you every few minutes while playing. You got a blue rupee, you got a bug, Fi telling you where to go, telling you your batteries are dying twelve hours before your batteries die, Fi, Fi, Fi.   Motion controls. If you like them, cool. But I didn't even want to play with other people in the room. Then they just jam shit in there to make you use motion controls even more. You are playing and having fun then ""what the fuck? tilt this puzzle piece to open the door? Fuck this shit."" so the controls interrupt you just like Fi.   The puzzles aren't difficult and then Fi literally tells you what to do.   The world is empty and so segmented.   Half the missions are just fetch quests.   Girahim is awesome and at the end there's some new standard looking bad guy. They developed Girahim, probably the best part of the game, and some new dude is like ""oh I'm the real bad guy."" what? Give me Girahim back.   At one point you literally point your wiimote at the screen and it directs you exactly where to go. I thought while that was happening ""this is it. This is the lowest a zelda game can get. No puzzle, no journey, but literally the game telling you exactly where to go. This is the exact opposite of what zelda should be.""  There were things I did like. Groose, Girahim, I liked that version of zelda. She's kinda more normal and chill. Some cool bosses. Awesome music. Graphics were better than twilight princess."

I think they thought exploration of the vast sea would be fun enough and didn't include any dungeons. I also wanted to explore Old Hyrule more.  Spirit tracks eventually took the bottom spot. I just didn't enjoy playing it, didn't enjoy riding around on the train, didn't enjoy the story, and didn't enjoy using the microphone. It didn't help that my DS's mic died during the final battle.  I know a lot of folks hate on Skyward Sword. The controls drove me nuts and the game was a little too linear but I thought the story was great and made up for the other issues."
truezelda,2z22rp,ximenez,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:09:33 2015 UTC,Old Hyrule would have been amazing to explore but I think that incarnation of link would have been out of place amidst the ruins of Old Hyrule.

truezelda,2z22rp,starlitepony,10,Sat Mar 14 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"there was no real exploration in the game,   If you do your sidequests, you unlock new rails. If you ride new rails, you discover optional stops and shortcut portals and collectible rabbits. The optional stops all have unique challenges that you don't find in any other part of the game.  That exploration is more real than anything you'll find in any game in the series since the first two. The fact that it is accomplished by means often used as a metaphor for restriction, railroads, has nothing to do with the realness of its exploration.  Now, if you don't like the game, that's cool. You get to not like the game. But ""no real exploration"" is quantifiably wrong."

A big problem I had was that I kept seeing missed potential everywhere. The only place that actually felt complete to me was Windfall. All the dungeons felt overly simplistic, like any one of them could have easily been the first dungeon in another Zelda game. The only two bosses I felt were enjoyable, good fights were the Helmaroc King and the final sword fight with Ganondorf. I also felt the tone they were aiming for was uneven, and at times ruined what should have been significant moments (Puppet Ganon in particular just felt like a joke).  It certainly wasn't all bad, and I don't even dislike the game overall, but it pales in comparison to the other games in the series that I've played so far."

I didn't like some of the choices they made in game design, like revisiting dungeons. It felt like a cop-out to me. The game also felt more linear due to all the unwanted help I was getting from Fi.

I have finished all of them except SS, and have found all of them to be great games, though given the choice, I'd probably have to put OoT at the bottom of the list of those.  My issues with OoT are the emptiness of Hyrule Field (which is no better than SS's sky), the fact that it didn't actually feel all that expansive, Navi, and the way the sudden shift to darkness is set up.  I felt like TP in many ways is an improvement on it.  Hyrule Field has more going on, the game world is considerably larger, Midna is a fantastic character, and while it's quite a dark game, the darkness is set up more tastefully.  There's this sort of highly-stylized grotesqueness with the Twilight, whereas OoT at times seems to want to be a horror game.  And while Zelda II gets a lot of hate, it was actually the first Zelda game I played, and I've probably played it all the way through more than all the others combined.  It might be quite different than the other Zeldas, but it's just a really fun game."

I caught back up with Wind Waker, which remains my favourite. Having only played OoT 3D, I found the game somewhat clunky - I felt that having no manual camera control was horribly unintuitive, and the inventory felt similarly slow. This was greatly improved in the MM port, largely down to the fact that I can control the camera as I please. I still haven't completed Ocarina, which is kind of sad - I really should finish it off."

One day I hate it, another I love it.  Twilight Princess on the other hand, I have a consistent opinion about. It's a good game, but, when compared to the other Zelda's, it falls short. The game takes forever to start. And the game's two gimicks it has going for it are simply ""Being A 2nd Ocarina of Time"" and ""Wolf Link"". With the former, the whole game feels like its just emulating Ocarina and the latter lacks much depth and isn't really fun to play. None of the dungeons were memorable for being fun or interesting, and everything involving Illia in the story is just stupid. The Hyrule field areas, while cool, also feel incredibly barren and once you can warp,, there's almost no reason to try and find new routes within them, making them feel pointless later on."

Everything felt tedious to me.  Twilight Princess is a close second.  There's a lot of content and takes a while for it to get really going.  I also always wondered why he was transformed into a wolf of all things.  In a curious way.  I liked teh main story and some of the temples but I never got attached to any of the side stories or side quests.  I was also greatly dissapointed in the final battle.  It was between dissapointing and annoying.  I liked that the final end was with Ganondorf himself, but the battle itself wasn't as interesting to me.

truezelda,2yzsjq,Xattm15,2,Sat Mar 14 17:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well my reasoning for how Yuga took over as the primary ego is because Ganon was turned mindless after his resurrection in OoX, so presumably he would stay that way."

Well it's more of that only the Hero's spirit can use it to it's full power. Which is why there's the spiritual stone tests. And perhaps to draw the sword from it's pedestal as well.  Functionally, this pretty much always means it's gonna be link pulling the sword and wielding it. But that's not to say that other people can't.

The Hero appears when Hyrule is in danger.  This is universal law thanks to Hylia.  The actions or status of a single Hero have absolutely no effect on that law.  Gramps [ALBW] even shows that more than one Hero can be alive at once, meaning that multiple people can possess the Spirit of the Hero at the same time (i.e., it's not a literal ghost, it's a set of personality traits).

truezelda,2yxoeg,SvenHudson,9,Sat Mar 14 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"Well, we know that the Master Sword has been in every game since A Link to The Past, so we can expect it to pop up.   It's been in six of the thirteen games that came out after A Link to the Past, less than half. (EDIT: seven out of fourteen if OoX counts as two, but that's only half and still far from all)  I'm sick and tired of this ""handhelds don't count"" attitude."
truezelda,2yxoeg,daft1,2,Sat Mar 14 00:27:57 2015 UTC,I know its not supposed to be canon but I feel like the best representation of the Wars is Hyrule Warriors where Ganondorf is able to retrieve the parts of the Triforce from Link and Zelda.
truezelda,2yxoeg,Kafke,5,Sat Mar 14 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat, there's already so many things wrong with the article. There isn't three timelines. And the branches aren't 'possible' they are actual. There's three simultaneous branches. Not three possible timelines.  The author then attempts to show how the timeline is 'confusing' because he's attempting to follow it in terms of release, instead of by story. That's like acting confused because MGS 3 takes place before 1 and 2.   Admittedly, the timeline has some awkward retconning devices and questionable paradoxes, but who cares? Time travel is fun! And I think we’re all willing to grant Nintendo a few liberties in trying to make all the games fit together after-the-fact.   I'm curious about what ""questionable paradoxes"" there are. Because as a seasoned time travel fan, I personally don't see any. The only points in which a paradox arises is within games, not between them. And the only one that really sticks out is OoA, which can be hand-waved by saying it's a god's tool doing it.  As far as 'awkward retconning', not much is awkward. The worst is trying to fit LTTP after OoT (it's rightful place), but then introducing MM and WW to take up the two legitimate branches. Any other retconning is fairly minor and is just stylistic changes, rather than dramatic story retconning.   That being said, now that Nintendo has established a unified timeline, they’re bound by it, to a certain extent.   Not really. They have always been bound by it. Even when it wasn't released. The HH timeline is easily possible to come up with on your own. And several people (myself included) had done so. The problem is that there's no direct proof for the downfall branch, despite it's place being obvious.   Ocarina of Time begins in what we’ll call Year 0.   Well there's your problem. There's 3 whole games before OoT.   Now, there are two possible “endings” to OoT according to Hyrule Historia; either Ganondorf defeats Link – whether in Year 0 or 7 – or Link defeats Ganondorf as an adult in Year 7.   No. There are two concrete endings. In one ending, Link is victorious. And in the other, Ganon is victorious. These are not hypothetical 'choices'. They both happen. There's a split earlier which is still unexplained. This is the common problem that you run into when constructing the timeline. There's no direct statement on what caused the 'third' branch (though evidence points to it being the original branch).   The Fallen Timeline is really the Retconn Timeline, existing mainly to cram the three games released before OoT in with the others.   Again, this is false. If anything, OoT retconned everything into a 'successful' timeline where Link is the hero, instead of the sages. The timeline was already flourishing before OoT came along.   If Link defeats Ganondorf as an adult in Year 7, the actual split in the timeline takes place.   When Link defeats Ganondorf. And an actual split had already occurred, as the author himself mentioned. The two outcomes being whether Link or Ganondorf win in those particular branches. The Link wins branch splits once again at the end of OoT.   Why? Because Zelda wants Link to go back in time and prevent the events from happening that led to Ganondorf corrupting the Sacred Realm, and eventually Year 7.   Nope. She wants him to live his childhood. And obviously stop Ganondorf as well and be able to live in peace.   After all, it was Zelda’s original plan in Year 0   IIRC, her actual plan was to get to the triforce before Ganondorf so they can hide it from him. Not mess with time shenanigans.   Wait? How does that work? Obviously Link needs to pull the Master Sword to start the chain of events that lead to Year 7, but how does the Adult Timeline exist if it always ends with Link going back in time to create the Child Timeline ?   Because the author is stupid and doesn't understand how the 2-split works, I'll explain. When Link travels back in time (thanks to Zelda), this particular method of travel isn't locked to Novikov's principle, which means Link is free to act. This diverges his path into an alternate timeline (branch of the timeline), and thus events and situations change. The original series of events still happened, and are in an alternate branch and act as link's original history. Technically this means there should be two Link's running around, which is a goof on Nintendo's part. But for the sake of sanity, we'll just say that the particular method of time travel by the Ocarina is a mix between mental and physical.   So how does this split make sense?   It makes sense to any ""time traveler"". I thought this was a guide for time travelers. Apparently not...   To a bystander in Hyrule, Link pulls the Master Sword in Year 0, disappears for seven years, then reappears briefly in Year 7 to defeat Ganondorf, only to disappear again.   Ehhh not really. He's just in the sacred realm. Rauru is watching over him.   The way the timelines work in Hyrule Historia, no matter what Link does after he defeats Ganondorf in Year 7, the Adult Timeline remains unchanged. The only changes in Year 0 that effect Year 7 are those made before Link travels to Year 7 the last time to defeat Ganondorf   Correct. This is another time travel goof on Nintendo's part. It's a more minor version of OoA's mechanics, and it's only used for a couple of small parts (well and spirit temple). Again, we could let this slide. Or say these are timeline branches that aren't particularly noteworthy.   We can see then that the split between the Adult and Child Timelines is really based on viewpoint: the Adult Timeline follows the viewpoint of the Hyrule of Year 7 that went through the events of OoT, while the Child Timeline follows the viewpoint of the Hero as he travels back through time.   Correction: The adult timeline is the original line that OoT Link comes from (if the downfall branch doesn't happen in that time as well). While the child line is the new one that branches off due to Link going back in time. While you could say it's a matter of perspective, they are two actual branches of the same timeline.   The unresolved question is how did the Master Sword get where it is in Wind Waker?   Does it matter? Zelda put it there. Done. Answered.   Link is the only person that wields the Master Sword in any of the Zelda games.   Well, I guess it depends on how you define 'person'. The spirit of the hero is what usually wields it. And ""new link"" (in Wind Waker).   It also seems that the Master Sword only exists in one physical and temporal place.   It's pretty clearly in the Lost Woods during LttP and in the temple of time in Wind Waker, and in the Lost Woods during TP. So... more than one temporal place. And more than one physical place doesn't make sense, seeing as it's a single object. How can something be in two places at once?   When Link pulled the Master Sword and was then defeated by Ganondorf, what happened to Sword?   Probably my biggest beef with the HH is that ""Link loses to Ganon in the final fight"". There's lots of logical errors with this. But to role with it, someone managed to move it over to the Lost Woods, for whatever reason. Probably the sages who sealed ganon moved it.   We can assume Link was defeated after he pulled the Sword because Ganondorf was able to enter the Sacred Realm, implying Link opened the seal.   Or.... Ganondorf found his way in anyway (as per LTTP backstory). HH says Link's defeat is at the end of OoT's story.   In a way, the one event that took place in Year 7 of the Adult Timeline that followed Link to the Child Timeline was winning Epona, the horse.   Ehhh not quite. Child Link makes friends with Malon, but Epona is too young to ride, so you can't. By the time you return as Adult Link, the ranch was taken over. So obviously when MM occurs, Epona is old enough to ride. No need for the 'winning' to carry over.   Link never rides Epona as a child in Year 0, but he’s riding her as a child to begin Majora’s Mask. So what’s different?   The reason you can't ride epona in the first place. Link and Epona are both older in MM. Did this guy even play OoT?   and knows what she did in the Adult Timeline.    What did she do? To me it looked like Adult Link played Epona song, won a race and used her as a horse. I don't see why Epona's knowledge of this is necessary at all.   Epona was Link’s main companion in Year 7 and we can assume he would carry that attachment back to the Child Timeline.   Sure? He's the same guy after all. And as evidenced by his different actions, he retains his adult memories.   It’s a stretch, but it makes sense, as we’ve only seen Epona in the Child Timeline, the timeline that follows the the Hero through his life.   If Epona was reincarnated, we'd see her in all of the branches, such as the downfall line.   Well, we know that the Master Sword has been in every game since A Link to The Past, so we can expect it to pop up.   This is false. MC, LA, MM, ST, FS, and FSA all don't have the master sword.   We know Epona is in the game, which indicates the Child Timeline.   What? How does that indicate the child branch at all?   But there’s a sexier reading. What if it’s implying that Link, the Hero of Time, doesn’t die in the Fallen Timeline, but instead survives his defeat and then fights in the Imprisoning War?   Because that would require completely ignoring the Hyrule Historia in the first place. The only reason Ganondorf 'defeats' Link is because he needs to obtain the triforce in time for LTTP. How he goes about this is relatively unexplained, and HH gives the 'link is defeated' explanation.   and rather than being a timeline where the Hero dies, it’s a timeline where the Hero fails to defeat Ganondorf in Year 7?   I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the Historia says. That Link is defeated and Ganondorf gets his hands on the triforce. No where does it say Link physically dies. I can only assume something similar to the end of Wind Waker happened.  Continued in next comment"
truezelda,2yxoeg,Kafke,3,Sat Mar 14 10:52:20 2015 UTC,"This means defeat, rather than death, is actually any scenario where the Hero doesn’t create the Child Timeline.   Not so. It really means that defeat is sometime after Ganondorf splits the triforce and personally engages both Link and Zelda and obtain their triforce pieces (according to the HH). The most likely time for this is the final battle of OoT.   Link used it to seal the Sacred Realm in the Imprisoning War.   Nope. Otherwise Link would get credit. Sages got credit. Link may have put it back. But not to seal away Ganon.   So the timeline is a blessing and curse; just as many questions are raised as are answered, and Nintendo reserves the right to make it up as they go along.   As did Harry potter when those books were coming out. And MGS when the games come out. And literally anything else with a multipart story. Why the fuck can't people make shit up as they go along?   And let’s be real, it’s a video game and at the end of the day Nintendo wants to sell games.   Implying games aren't true story telling mediums...   It’s clear that in-game plots have become more important and more complicated in every Zelda release since OoT   You mean since AoL.  All in all, this article was awful, and doesn't even take into account basic time travel stuff. Hardly a guide for Time Travelers. And more like ""babby's first attempt at looking at the Hyrule Historia and Zelda timeline""."

This is most likely done in order to allow the player to become more immersed in the game and let them 'become' Link. Lately Link has been showing a bit more of his own personality in games--such as his expressiveness in Wind Waker or his clear devotions to Zelda in Skyward Sword--but Nintendo has been quite adement in keeping Link's namesake relevant: he is a link between the player and the game."

I am sure not EVERYONE wanted motion controls.  Don't presume to know what other people are thinking all of the time. Also, even if someone did want motion controls, it doesn't mean they were happy with the way they were implemented. They were glitchy at times. And, my biggest gripe, they were shoehorned into tasks that really didn't require them in the first place. Just because they could use motion controls in a certain situation, didn't mean they should.  Secondly, you are conflating two entirely separate ideas with the linearity of the game-play and the goal of the story. They are seperate. You can have a linear story with giving more freedom to the player. The sparse overworld with the drop-in to a level design is what made the gameplay feel linear. It had nothing to do with the story they wanted to tell.  tldr; don't presume to know what others want and are thinking and don't conflate separate concepts"

truezelda,2yic41,malaroo,-9,Wed Mar 11 01:50:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, you design a way to make the game less linear while keeping the story integrity. As someone else said if you think about it most Zelda games are linear anyway. Look at OoT. It was linear and it was story based. It's the same thing but people cream over OoT all the time. The main difference is you have to walk through Hyrule field and if you're caught there at night you have to fight a few weak enemies.   Also I'm comfortable with my generalization. There are outliers when it comes to how hyped people were about motion controls, but do you remember when the Wii came out? People were going nuts over it. It got to the point that Microsoft and Sony both tried to get in on the action by making Play Station Move and Kinect. The vast majority of gamers and Zelda players were hyped as hell. I'm pretty sure most people would agree with me on that."
truezelda,2yic41,instantiatedObject,7,Tue Mar 10 05:43:50 2015 UTC,"Look at OoT   Look at Wind Waker.  IMO, the greatest Zelda story, and probably one of the most non-linear 3D titles.  Yes, you have to do the story in order, because that's how the story goes, but that doesn't dictate whether or not the game itself is linear, and never has.  Linearity is walking down a tunnel with no other options as to what to do, like Skyward Sword.  In pretty much every Zelda, despite the fact that the story is linear, you can almost always go off and do your own thing in an expansive world.  It was small during the N64 era, sure, because that's all you could do with the hardware.  This is no longer the case however, yet Skyward Sword took it back to a place that wasn't even on-par with N64's world-size/freedom capabilities.   People were going nuts over it   Uh, maybe some people, but I remember the general reaction being ""What the hell is this?! You can still use a normal controller, right?""  There were even photoshopped mock-ups of how the Wii controller would slide into a Gamecube controller and allow you to use normal controls, stemming simply from the fact that a lot of people were not okay with the concept, which is also the reason the Move and Kinect were huge flops.  It's cool in concept, if you're into that, but it's a whole different story if it doesn't work as well as it should."

truezelda,2yic41,danschemen,15,Wed Mar 11 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I, for one, never wanted motion controls and get a little upset when people tell me how they work fine and I'm just not doing it right.  I know I'm not doing them right.  Though I'm not technically disabled or anything, I have a lot of trouble with coordination and fine motor skills.  Button pressing is easier 99% of the time.  I recently bought Heavy Rain for my PS3 and I've had trouble with that too.  Not because the controls are complicated or hard to understand, but because I physically have trouble doing them.  My body doesn't want to make the movements I tell it to.  This makes the game much less enjoyable for me because of the frustration of wanting to play a game that's designed in a way that makes it incredibly difficult for me to play with any amount of consistency.  I get what it was doing, but it was such a large departure from the controls of any previous incarnation of Zelda that I simply don't appreciate what they were going for.  (TP was designed for the GCN, so I don't count the Wii version, though the controls for it were much easier for me to use).  As for the linear story, I enjoyed it enough the first playthrough, but I tried playing through the game again and couldn't even bring myself to want to finish the first Forest Temple.  It's a beautiful game, and the linear story didn't bother me that much, but I felt it just wasn't particularly memorable, by which I mean that I can't think of anything I remember that makes me want to re-experience it.  Between that, the controls, and the constant re-use of levels that I didn't care very much for, I honestly don't think I'll ever make it through this one again."
truezelda,2yic41,malaroo,2,Tue Mar 10 04:43:31 2015 UTC,I'm sorry that you couldn't enjoy the motion stuff. That really blows man :/
truezelda,2yic41,FlakJackson,3,Tue Mar 10 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"Don't feel too bad for me in particular. As I said, I'm absolutely not disabled. The control scheme was just a perfect storm in my case.  Though it uses a controller, the controls in Heavy Rain are difficult for me because it's very much a game where you have to hit the right button or move the control stick a certain way quickly. I also had slight trouble in Twilight Princess for the Wii, but it was okay because most of the time, a regular swing would work fine. They weren't specific requirements so much as simple omnidirectional jerks.  Skyward Sword combines the two: an immediate and specific style of input requirement requiring a physical movement of my body a certain way to make it happen. And because I had trouble with it,  my controller came uncalibrated all the time. I'd move too jerky, trying to make Link swing his sword the right way, which in turn threw the calibration off further. The worse you are at the controls, the more likely it is that they'll get worse of their own accord as well.   I imagine other people have similar issues with it. With other Zelda games, I could clumsily hack-and-slash my way to victory, as long as I was patient, used my items properly, and could solve puzzles. Skyward Sword has sword in the name, so it's obvious where the focus is, and the rest of the few items available also rely heavily on the motion controls (the whip, beetle, and even stuff like rolling bombs).  So if you have trouble mastering the motion controls, you'll suck at the game, even if you know what you're supposed to be doing. I played through and beat the entire game but never was able to make Link swing his sword consistently, because my body sucks at stuff like that. I used that mega invincibility potion to narrowly defeat Demise after Ghirahim kicked my butt for over an hour. I still have no clue how I pulled it off.  Whether this is a separate issue from people sucking at video games in general or not is up for debate. I've never been particularly good at any of them. But at the risk of sounding like a SJW, which I absolutely am not, I think the ""you're just not using the controls right"" argument so many people make is dangerously close to ableism. Some people can't do it and button pressing with a larger selection of various items actually is an easier alternative, and one more in line with the series in my opinion.  While every Zelda game has its own ""thing,"" Skyward Sword's motion controls will likely always be my least favorite. Other Zelda titles are criticized for their stylistic choices, gameplay style, or lack of originality. Skyward Sword is the only one consistently criticized for its real life physical controls. I think that's worthy of being noted."
truezelda,2yic41,FlakJackson,3,Tue Mar 10 06:09:14 2015 UTC,"It is noteworthy but I just don't think it's a flaw. It was a choice that ended up alienating a few people. The whole system had that problem. Some people just couldn't play the Wii with games like Wii Sports and the such, but that isn't the games fault. It's no one's fault. If you ask me it's just something that merely is. I guess what I'm trying to say here is that the blame can't always be placed on a game or on the player. Sometimes things just don't work out for some people."
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,12,Tue Mar 10 06:18:20 2015 UTC,Don’t complain about the motions controls that we all wanted.   I for sure as hell didn't want them and I'm pretty sure i'm not alone on that stance. I've never liked any of the games that went overboard with the motion plus or the games that put it in just because it's a wii game.
truezelda,2yic41,FlakJackson,2,Tue Mar 10 07:09:05 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't want the motion controls either (I'm a huge controller fan), but I still think that Nintendo was attempting to cater to a large portion of their audience while also taking advantage of the console available to them at the time. I was absolutely dreading the motion controls, but I personally felt like it wasn't the worst thing Nintendo has ever done."
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,-9,Tue Mar 10 18:01:54 2015 UTC,"Come on, surely you were at least a little bit excited about the prospect of being able to sword fight in a Zelda game. That was every 12 year olds dream back in the day."
truezelda,2yic41,FlakJackson,8,Tue Mar 10 07:15:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly not really, and it really was the 2 hour intro of doing absolutely nothing at the beginning that really killed the game for me. I don't know why people complain about TP's start when SS has you doing nothing for hours.  I actually did enjoy TP's sort of motion controls because there wasn't much, they kept it simple and fun. I don't like most games with motion controls because they always go over the top with them."
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,5,Tue Mar 10 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"I bought a Wii mostly for Brawl, and I bought Skyward Sword only because it was a Zelda game, knowing that I didn't want/wouldn't enjoy the motion controls, and I didn't.  You're having trouble grasping the fact that not everyone feels the same thing you do.  I understand why you might think it's cool to swing around a sword in Zelda, using your hand like an actual sword.  I understand it completely, but I do not feel the same way.  Maybe I would feel different if I was younger when it came out, but as it stands... no.  No part of me wanted to control a game like that, and furthermore, no part of me wanted a Zelda game that forwent the freedom and exploration that made me love the series in the first place."

I don't care if someone has a different opinion, that's whatever. What I don't get is how some people are rubbed so hard the wrong way that when motion controls even get spoken of they come bearing torches and pitch forks. That is what I find hard to conceive."
truezelda,2yic41,Earthshoe12,3,Wed Mar 11 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"It's not cancerous cynicism, it's legitimate opinions regarding something intensely disliked.  Look, the Wii was a very controversial console. The motion controls did not have universal support from the fanbase, and a big reason why the Wii succeeded is because Nintendo branched out to appeal to the casual player base. For them motion controls were cool and novel and fun. The staggering amount of third party, gimmicky cash cow games on the Wii is a testament to how influential this group was to the system's success.  Nintendo's core fanbase though? They had very mixed feelings about the Wii. A minority was outright enthusiastic, but most of us were cautiously optimistic at best with a deep, intense fear that everything would go wrong.   We warmed up a bit after release. Wii Sports was nifty, all five times it was played, but the motion controls were just...meh. They had no real appeal to most people, they were just used when a game required it and complained about when they harmed the experience.  Twilight Princess on the Wii did a lot to sour people on motion controls and Zelda. It was clearly done for the sake of the gimmick and implemented rather poorly. For many people this was the only way they could experience Twilight Princess, and knowing there was a version out there with traditional controls was bad enough, but not being given the choice to use them with a Gamecube or Classic controller was a massive slap in the face.  Skyward Sword was supposed to be the chosen one. It was going to bring balance to the force make up for it's sibling's mistakes. The Wii MotionPlus, true 1:1 translation of motion, was supposed to create amazing gameplay and make you feel like you were right there in the middle of the action. But the damn thing didn't live up to the hype. The result was a game with dodgy controls.   But this wasn't just a game with bad controls. It was a game that relied on those controls in every situation imaginable. Flying? Fighting? Moving? Opening a door? ""Playing"" an instrument? Aiming? Taking a shit? Breathing? All check. So many things require the use of these glitchy controls, and it got old fast when they didn't cooperate. Even fighting canon fodder became a chore, because while you're trying to swing from the right the game thinks you're trying to shove the sword up your own ass.  Throw all these trouble in with the fact that many of us didn't want change in the first place, that we wished the Wii had never had motion controls at all, that we'd seen many cool game concepts ruined by Nintendo's alternate control schemes on both the DS and the Wii and you have the perfect recipe for justified enmity. When something is essential to every aspect of gameplay and someone has bad experiences with it, of course they're going to be vocal about it.   I don't care if someone has a different opinion, that's whatever.   You clearly do care, very much, because you can't seem to understand that most people have very good reasons for acting the way they do. People don't just get out of bed in the morning and randomly decide to spew venom for no reason whatsoever."
truezelda,2yic41,emelbee923,-1,Wed Mar 11 03:10:58 2015 UTC,The result was a game with dodgy controls.    I've played the game for over 120 hours and can count the number of times I've had the controls go shitty on me on two fingers.  The controls in Skyward Sword work just fine.

Don't discard the improbable as impossible.  That aside, your anecdote holds just as much water as everyone else's. Some people had good experiences and, for whatever reason, some had bad experiences. They aren't invalidated just because you think you know how everything works. Age, environment, manufacturing defects, interference, user err and a whole host of other things can cause problems.   There's one big thing you're not taking into consideration. The Motion Plus is marketed as a 1:1 translation of movement, but that simply isn't the case. People play expecting perfect controls and get far less."

truezelda,2yic41,MisterParagon,4,Tue Mar 10 03:56:07 2015 UTC,"I had 3 problems with this game, and I understand not everyone thought this way, but here goes-   Aesthetically the design of details seemed a bit rushed- same arrow bundle from TP, Beedle looked suspiciously familiar, and just seemed to be missing a little texture in terms of color and surface The motion controls, love em or hate em, weren't one-to-one, and still were a means of triggering an animation.  I know some people loved it, for me the less-than-a-second delay between moving IRL and on screen just drove me NUTS.  I beat the game, but I found myself just avoiding a lot of play. If it was linear or not, I think it could be immersive either way.  What I didn't like was near-constantly being reminded by NPCs and Fi that it was linear.  I just thought there were too many hints. Goddamnit I just missed the boomerang.  Like the gerudo desert missed the rain."
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,5,Sat Mar 14 15:44:55 2015 UTC,"Your argument about motion controls, as many have already pointed out, is incredibly weak. There are plenty of people who dislike motion controls as a concept. And even if you were looking forward to them, it doesn't negate your right to be disappointed in how they turned out.    That said I quite liked the motion controls. I don't think it would have been possible to make satisfying ""realistic"" swordplay (I still don't think it's been done) so I loved the ""make every enemy a puzzle"" approach. So...   I've posted in this sub before that my beef with SS isn't so much about the linearity as it is about the repetition. It felt to me like the developers were so busy making the motion controls awesome that they then ran out of time to make an interesting world to interact with using said controls. But there is an expectation of how ""big"" a Zelda game is supposed to be so they kept artificially lengthening the game by sending you to the same areas over and over.    Tl;dr Motion controls were good in my opinion but people are allowed to disagree, linearity isn't bad on its face but repetition killed the game for me.   Edit: I don't know if it is posting on an iPad in chrome or what but this is my second edit trying to fix the formatting of my comment and I don't know how. Sorry this is so ugly, and that both my sub points say 1."
truezelda,2yic41,ButItWasMeDio,9,Tue Mar 10 11:30:06 2015 UTC,"The gameplay was lacking because, rather than enhance the standard Zelda experience with sprinkles of motion controls, we got motion control centric gameplay that comes across as gimmicky rather than innovative.   Every enemy or puzzle shouldn't require motion control components, particularly since the tech is far from perfect and ends up being simplistic to compensate.  The story being linear means the world is linear which means there are fewer reasons to explore the world. I appreciate the separation of the sky and the surface, but even that isn't given its proper due. A town in the sky and a way to the surface is discovered and no one really bats an eye at it. Rather than make it a huge deal, it is handled as just another day in the life. There's no weight to it  And what good is a flying mechanic if it is only applicable in the world's hub in the sky?  I personally did not care for the Link/Zelda dynamic. I get what the story was trying to do, but attempting to foster a connection by all but telling the player ""THIS IS ZELDA, SHE IS IMPORTANT, YOU MUST LIKE HER"" is not really immersive.  There was no build to it, no basis for the connection. Just a hero chasing after a damsel.  And I'm not overly fond of the finale that connects the series in a cyclical fashion that hinders things for the future"

Now creativity is stuck into what Link must be, who Zelda must be, and who our antagonist must be. It sort of robs each game of the individual struggle.  Why did Ganondorf rise to power in OoT? WW would tell us it started with a drive to give his people a better life. SS retcons that whole idea to ""Well you see, he's the incarnation of this terrible, nasty spirit."" This extends to all of our characters. Link's TP origins as a humble farm boy don't matter. Each of our characters have become shells for greater forces, robbing them of who they were before the conflict. Just look at Zelda in SS - she nearly became an entirely different person by the end as she remembered her ""true"" self.   Early Zelda games lacked depth as a result of the technology. We couldn't have expected too deep of a story from LoZ. Things got better with LttP, and improved immensely as technologies allowed for greater artisitic expression and story telling methods. I hope new Zelda games don't cling too tightly to the cycle as it was introduced in SS. I'm completely fine letting each Zelda be a standalone epic."

No more mystery or wonder when considering why things are the way they are, how things happened, etc.  No more true individuality between the three main characters, respective to each game.  None of that.  Now, it's just ""because evil dude is evil and he's gonna continue to be evil forever. You're the good guy so be good and stop the evil dude.""  It took a basic formula and locked it into the most formulaic, preordained monotony possible.

The only things that have been established are:   Link must be courageous. Zelda must be regal and kind. The incarnations of Demise, including Ganondorf, must be hungry for ultimate power.

Nobody complains about it because it was a retcon made in the name of good storytelling, but the Ganondorf we see in OoT, even before time skip, isn't anything that could be mistaken for noble.

Not saying you're wrong, I just think that people in general paint Ganondorf as much more morally ambiguous than he actually is.

Super Man 64 and Shadow of Collossus had horrible controls and were button focused, does that mean traditional controls suck? No it just means some implemented it horribly. No shit that traditional controls are going to have a better implemention because they can literally copy and paste (like how ALBW is pretty much ALTTP with a painting gimmick) do I think motion controls are perfect? Fuck no! But I'm willing to give it slack because they don't have a templet to build off of. I understand not being a fan of motion controls but come on don't tell me the reaction to them being implemented in gaming wasn't a tad irrational. People were fine with the Occulus Riff because it was implemented in a limited way yet no one seems to scream gimmick. Open world gets thrusted all the time in gaming and yet once again no peep on it being a glorified gimmick. Touch screen? Not really a gimmick. Light rail gun shooting? Clearly not a gimmick!

Not just with motion controls. games like bayonetta 2, Wonderful 101, Darksouls etc... which have gameplay based around learning, natural practice and becoming better all get stamped with the : ""I couldn't master it in 5 seconds therefor it is the controllers/controls fault."" Or they ""aren't balanced"" right, etc..."
truezelda,2yic41,saintjimmy64,20,Thu Mar 12 03:03:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the motion controls in Skyward Sword were friggin awesome in my opinion. IT's one of my favorite Zelda games for many reasons, the awesome challenge with the swordplay being one of them. 2nd to last boss... that was crazy difficult for me and I LOVED actually having challenge from a Zelda game. I usually have no issues with them but man SS was great.     The linearity didn't really bother me, to be honest. I guess I just really didn't mind it, it was different, sure, but it was still done really well. Story wise.. when I reached the end, that's when it finally resigned itself as one of my absolute favorites. I was hyped for days after beating it simply because of the amazing end.    Truly enjoyed the game. It makes me sad when I see that the general thoughts on the game were that it was bad. I loved it!    Upvote for you, sir!"

truezelda,2yic41,bleedinginkmusic,5,Tue Mar 10 01:58:59 2015 UTC,"Your point about Miyamoto making the game linear for the timelines sake doesn't make any sense. Miyamoto and other devs for Zelda have stated several times that when making a Zelda game, gameplay comes first and foremost while the story is secondary. This explains the formerly unknown and still somewhat oddly connected timeline and lore of the Zelda franchise, as to them it is not as important as gameplay (As it should be). Because of the fact that they have said this in the past, your point on Miyamoto purposely making it linear for the sake of the story makes no sense, and I honestly have no idea where you got the idea of that from.   I have never seen an article where he said that the need to connect the story and the time line influenced him to such drastic and unfortunate design choices such as the linear nature and lack of exploration compared to other titles found in SS. This just sounds like you are trying to justify a glaring fault in a game you like. It's not inherently wrong to do this, but don't just say that this is why they made this design choice when you actually have no real idea on why they did what they did."
truezelda,2yic41,xSymbiont,-1,Tue Mar 10 04:30:42 2015 UTC,"You're right that I don't have any documented evidence and I'm working on theory here, but it seems obvious to me that Skyward Sword was an answer to what the fan base wanted. Hyrule Historia never said that Skyward Sword was made with the game play put first. It said that previous games were, and if it was like the other games in the series I don't see the liner game play as a fault. Miyamoto and Aonuma aren't foolish enough to screw up like everyone thinks they did.  edit: Also, Skyward Sword is far from one of my favorites. It just bothers me that people rip it apart for being different."

And I ESPECIALLY didn't want motion controls that barely functioned.  Don't arrogantly put words in our mouths.

EDIT: You put forward two of YOUR opinions and presented them as fact. That's what I take issue with, for the record. You've claimed that everyone asked for Wii controls and a linear storyline. Well let me break it down for you. Not everyone wanted Wii controls and I'm sure that at least some of the people who did want the Wii controls didn't want them to be shoehorned in to every puzzle under the sun just because OMFG LOOK GUISE WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY YAAAY. Also, pretty much every advocate for the Wii controls I've spoken to in real life has said that they would have liked to see an option for GC controller support. As for the linear feel of the game, personally, I'm indifferent. That's not what makes me dislike the game, but it certainly wouldn't convince me to play it.

I've played the games since I was a kid, I have so much head cannon it's embarrassing. I've also love game design and I've been breaking them down to their roots trying to see what makes them so good and to me motion controls and linear game play simply don't make a game bad. The circle jerk isn't just on reddit either. I enjoy the game grumps but they constantly shit on SS when it was brought up. I think it's just a bit silly.   As for the comments that went negative, they're now in the positive now that more people are coming in and it pretty much proved a theory I had in my head. As I said at the beginning of the post you either love it or you hate it and right now the post is at 68% upvoted. I was expecting it to be a little less and it's dipped to about half.

We all know that when the Wii first dropped every Zelda fan’s first thought was “Holy crap I’m going to be able to use my wii mote as a sword” I doubt anyone didn’t want this. I know I sure as hell did. What bothers me is that when it came immediately everyone started bitching about them, and if you ask me they weren’t that bad. This could be just my experience, but nevertheless many people hated them. My gripe here comes down to this: Don’t complain about the motions controls that we all wanted.   You're wrong. I never wanted motion controls. In any game. I don't know a single person who ever did. They are a gimmick at best and a hindrance at worst."

Granted when it all came out people's enthusiasm didn't last long and Nintendo tried to address that the Wii Motion Plus.

Competing companies did make their own motion peripherals, and look where that got them. Microsoft lost hard trying to push the Kinect on people once the fad was over.

truezelda,2yic41,ArtistCook,2,Tue Mar 10 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"The idea of the motion controls was definitely desired by many people. I also loved the idea. However, I didn't think they were executed very well. It may have just been me - the way I held the controller or the placement of the sensor - but I had a hard time with it and it quickly became frustrating; I wished for the option of a gamecube controller.  More importantly, I don't see why the game had to be so incredibly linear in order to fulfill its role as the series' foundation. The only thing actually required of it was the confirmation of the archetypes' reincarnations. Frankly, it didn't even need to do anything with the creation story as that was already touched on in Ocarina of Time to an acceptable degree. It could have explained the reincarnations of Link, Zelda, and the respective antagonists any number of ways without relying on linear gameplay. The unique setting and the establishment of the series' beginning are the best things that Skyward Sword had to offer. Don't get me wrong - those are amazing things. But the gameplay was sub-par at best in my opinion, and objectively did not require such a degree of linear gameplay."
truezelda,2yic41,TheGoatGod997,5,Tue Mar 10 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"My problem with the motion controls is that they don't give the option to not use them. But they're required to play the game. They already had the GC port and the classic controller, it's not like they didn't have the option. Or if they were to use motion controls and not implement any kind of regular controller then they should have at least given the option to make it like TPs motion controls. TP did it right with the motion controls in my opinion. The combat wasn't centered around motion controls, all you had to do was wiggle the remote a little. With the amount of controllers the Wii had at the time SS launched, they had enough time to give a controller preference. And just because we wanted something doesn't mean when we get it we should just thank Nintendo that we got it. People have been wanting a game where it feels like you can swing a lightsaber around like a jedi and when Kinect Star Wars came out people were critical about it because they knew it could have been better. When SS came out i'm sure Nintendo had already known about people not liking the motion controls. All i'm saying is that the game would have been so much better if they gave controller options instead of making it so that a well respected franchise is used to promote a gyroscope attachment for the Wii."
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 10 02:12:50 2015 UTC,I've thought about that a lot as well. I think giving the player options is always a good idea but Skyward's gimmick was the way you fought. It wouldn't have been Skyward if you didn't have the depth of battle that you got from planning your attacks. I can't think of a way to relate that to a classic game consoles controller. I get what you mean though.
truezelda,2yic41,J-012,6,Tue Mar 10 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"That's what i don't like though. Usually, Zelda's combat system and the way you solve puzzles was based off of your surroundings and what equipment you have. Instead SS made it so that it was based off of where your hand was in real life, which means that two completely different people in games like WW where you have a controller and buttons, could have the same amount of skill because everything is within tapping distance from their hand. In SS it's all based off of how hard you swung your remote around and where your hand was. You can tell  someone to press b and hold forward and no one would have a problem. You could base puzzles around the fact that you have everything you need to complete it, not just item wise, but information wise. The puzzles in SS consisted of the complexity of trying to do something. You could be told to thrust the controller forward in a stabbing motion and the puzzles would still be based around the fact that you have to stab him in a certain place, making regular combat turn into easily pressing buttons to directing your attack in a certain way to make it so that you can then hack n slash the enemy."
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,0,Tue Mar 10 02:32:47 2015 UTC,I didn't have a problem with it but everyone has their particular likes and dislikes when it comes to Zelda.
truezelda,2yic41,TeekTheReddit,2,Tue Mar 10 02:35:11 2015 UTC,Ocarina of Time had directional sword attacks. It's not like this was some crazy new mechanic.
truezelda,2yic41,Serbaayuu,0,Tue Mar 10 06:51:27 2015 UTC,It was in the fact that you had way more control. Link only has so much maneuverability with his sword in OoT. Now we had stabs and undercut strikes and the like while the most attack strategy in OoT was waiting for an opening. In Skyward you got to make the openings.
truezelda,2yic41,EmbersToAshes,3,Tue Mar 10 06:56:10 2015 UTC,And that could have been emulated with a proper controller just fine if Nintendo put the effort into it. The Right Analogue/C-Stick would have worked just as well for sword play and I sure as heck would rather control the bird and beetle with buttons and analogue sticks than tilting a wii-mote.
truezelda,2yic41,Adm5163,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"Except that would be incredibly horrible as a concept and design, what happens if you accidently move the second joystick? What if the joystick ends up fucking up how you swing your sword. How would you be able to move the camera around? And the buttons would overly complicate the game even further, how would you be able to hold the sword up in the air if it was mapped to the b or c button? What happens if the analog stick ends up fucking up the flight pattern of the beetle or your bird? With motion controls I can recalibrate them. Taking the motion controls out of Skyward Sword would have defeated the point of both the Wii console and the game. I get that you don't like them. Hell I had way more fuck ups with how glitchy the buttons can be in Ocarina of Time; arrows being fired without letting go of the button, Epona not moving, sometimes the sword doesn't respond. Hell there were plenty of times in some of the 2D Zeldas where pressing on the Dpad didn't do anything to movie Link. Maybe I have some buggy n64 controllers but blaming the game because the hardware doesn't work seems a bit silly. Maybe you have faulty wii remotes?"

truezelda,2yic41,malaroo,2,Tue Mar 10 07:52:51 2015 UTC,"The controls honestly were not my favorite and made me very frustrated throughout the whole game, but usually the problem was the calibration, which could be easily fixed by opening up your map and centering the cursor. For myself, the controls would never make me stop playing the game. However, they stopped my mother--an avid Legend of Zelda fan since it first came out--from playing the game because the controls were too complicated for her. She was only about 49 or 50 when it came out, but she still felt like she couldn't keep up with the controls.  The linear gameplay thing, I kind of feel like people were just pissed off that the timeline was actually put into concrete terms versus being able to hypothesize about it--especially for those who had differing theories. Nintendo gave the people what they wanted, and they were kind of dicks about getting it. I thought it was awesome to have a prequel and to have an official timeline, but I'd never really let it detract from the game play."

If you can I'd recommend getting the 3DS versions of OoT and MM, better graphics and the 3D looks really good in both games.   I definitely recommend you do also play a link to the past and a link between world's if you are able to.   I have not played many of the hand held ones (something i must work towards). Phantom hourglass and spirit tracks were alright, but nothing I'd go too crazy over."
truezelda,2yi6e8,Nervousemu,2,Tue Mar 10 05:40:30 2015 UTC,"Start with Ocarina of Time and Link to the Past. These are the center-pieces of the series in both gameplay and story.  From there I'd recommend digging into similar titles (MM, TP, WW, Oracles, LA, etc). And then finishing with the more niche/fringe titles (LoZ1/2, FSA, etc)."
truezelda,2yi6e8,Kafke,2,Tue Mar 10 07:32:30 2015 UTC,"I would personally recommend starting with Ocarina. I know it's a bit overrated and everyone loves it, but it really is an amazing game no matter how you feel about it's fame.  Not to mention the events of it's story directly impact some of the other major games in the franchise, like Majora's Mask and Wind Waker. It also took the formula that defines Zelda, introduced in Alttp and brought it into 3d for the first time.  So yeah, I feel Ocarina would be a good starting point! A Link to The Past is my second choice."
truezelda,2yi6e8,Crazyman221,2,Sat Mar 14 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"I'd recomend Ocarina, then Majora, then Wind Waker. I think of these as the 3D ""Zelda Trilogy"" and the various aspects of each, show off different reasons why the Zelda games are so great. After that, I don't think it would matter a whole lot. But, for your first 2D Zelda, I'd say A Link To The Past, since all later 2D Zeldas really feel like they are branching out and building from this game's gameplay."
truezelda,2yi6e8,DinoPilot64,3,Sun Mar 15 13:48:05 2015 UTC,Skip LoZ II. Will most likely leave bad taste in your mouth. Just my opinion
truezelda,2yi6e8,Tomes2789,2,Wed Mar 11 01:32:27 2015 UTC,I also recommend release order.
truezelda,2yi6e8,Tomes2789,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:31:56 2015 UTC,"To just repeat an answer I gave earlier to another user...  If you didn't grow up on NES games, I would probably recommend skipping the first two games outright. They were beautiful for their time and set the standards for action-adventure games, but they have not aged well at all. In the original, the game is literally about trial and error, and the second one is very cryptic with a very high difficulty level that curves painfully.  As for the order otherwise, I've heard wonderful things about A Link Between Worlds being a good blend of the freedom of earlier games, and the structure and guides of newer games, so I think that might be a great start. Else, ALTTP is fun if you can enjoy games that are a bit dated, and I'd recommend playing it early because a lot of later games expand on its ideas, so you might feel let down if you play it much later than them (like I was). Ocarina of Time has not aged well graphically, but if you can forgive that and don't mind a bit of an easier game (and a wide open hub world with next to nothing inside of it), it can prove to be an exceptional introduction to the series. The handheld games (besides ALBW) should all wait until later since they're much smaller and more constricted than the console games, and it might give you a weak perspective on the series for a new game.  After playing through those ones, I'd recommend moving towards Majora's Mask or Skyward Sword since they fit the pattern and style of the other 3D games in a creative way (though neither is without its flaws, and you should absolutely not feel compelled to finish one if you're not enjoying it).  After those, consider taking a look towards The Minish Cap, the Oracle Games, Link's Awakening, then maybe the Four Swords series and the new DS games (Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks).  After aaall of that if you still want more, and you really enjoyed the exploration and freedom of ALBW, then maybe you could consider trying the NES Zeldas, but make sure you fully read the manuals and the maps they came with before even thinking of touching those games."
truezelda,2yi6e8,starlitepony,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"If you've already started playing a few of them, I'd recommend in timeline order.  After Ocarina of Time, start with the Child or Adult timeline depending on which games look more appealing, then do the Fallen timeline last, as that one finishes out with the two hardest titles in the series."
truezelda,2yi6e8,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 10 02:19:26 2015 UTC,So should I start with Skyward Sword and work towards the timeline split then?
truezelda,2yi6e8,Serbaayuu,2,Tue Mar 10 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, sure, if that sounds fun to you."
truezelda,2yi6e8,shadowlink_486,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:41:04 2015 UTC,I would play them chronologically. You get to really see how the series develops and matures which is something that always had fascinated me. A lot changed with time and with nearly every game improves just a little bit on the ones before it. Chronologically is the way to go.
truezelda,2ybe3r,Cranyx,14,Sun Mar 8 06:21:03 2015 UTC,"The original first quest level 6 is actually brilliantly designed with tedium in mind, and the more times you just ""go for it"" after you die, the more the game designers win.  A few notes.  The dungeon system is designed in a way that if you die, the number of enemies you have defeated in rooms throughout the dungeon remains the same as long as you don't kill all enemies in the room. Leaving the dungeon resets this value for all rooms. Thus, level 6 (like others) encourages you to ""just keep going"" even though the smartest option is to go out to the graveyard, grind a bit, and get full life.  The next point is how the enemies and rooms in the dungeon are laid out. The first screen are orange wizrobes, you can EASILY kill all enemies on this screen without taking any damage. Most times through, you'll get some dropable, and maybe 1/2 the time you'll get a heart. Ok, looking good. Keep pushing on.  The next room is the room with the Zols. These buggers almost always drop life. Now you've continued on and killed two full rooms. no turning back now. You may have actually netted a heart of two in your quest, and with 5 hearts of life, you are starting to feel invincible again. Luck is on your side!  The next room is that room with the bats and the statues. Not the easiest room, but you can clear it maybe with taking 1/2 heart damage. Keep moving.  The next room is the one with the traps, you can skip that room and not take damage.  The next room is the challenge room with the wizrobes/likelikes/bubbles. Because you didn't leave the dungeon, only the bubbles remain. This is the kicker - if you leave the dungeon to go heal up, all of the enemies will be back in this pretty difficult room. If you don't have the big shield, knowing that this room is empty re-enforces the idea that you should just go for it and not leave and come back.  This is where the dungeon starts to suck, even for veteran players! The next room has all of the blocks and 3 blue wizrobes/1 orange. You will pretty much always take damage in this room, even if you are just trying to get to the bombable wall on the right side. You really really want to get to one room up and one room right of here so you can pivot to get the wand (if you haven't yet) or go one room right and start working down. You will take damage in the dark room with the ring of blood on the floor and wizrobes, and poorly timed sword thrusts with the vires will probably knock some life out of you. It's ok, you only have 2 screens left!  And once you realize that most of the dungeons are designed this way, you will see the deeper richer design even if it's super frustrating as a player. After almost 30 years, we aren't seeing games that have this kind of nice mental puzzle. You don't have quandary as a player in COD or Halo; I'm not making brash decisions in Final Fantasy 13. Even the newer Zelda games lack some of this. You may not see it as a problem though since Zelda 1 is so damn hard :)"
truezelda,2ybe3r,synopser,2,Sun Mar 8 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say. You're just describing each room in the dungeon, yeah? What exactly is the ""mental puzzle""?"
truezelda,2ybe3r,Empha,2,Sun Mar 8 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"When you restart, you have the choice to exit the dungeon or try it with 3 hearts. It's foolish to attempt it with 3 hearts, but the room progression is set up in such a way that you feel like it's the best course of action.   The mental puzzle is whether or not you should exit at grind at the cemetery for life or play again and quickly die, leading you to that same choice over and over again.  EDIT let me make it clear that this game came out right after the arcade boom, and this type of design is based around people inserting quarters into arcade machines. It is just an optimally designed level for people to die, put in another quarter, and retry."

truezelda,2ybe3r,TheMcDucky,2,Sun Mar 8 13:46:32 2015 UTC,"Older games like the original Zelda had to lengthen gameplay through difficulty. Back then you were paying 60 to 80 bucks on a cartridge and you wanted your times worth. The fact that it's time consuming through difficulty makes it what it is. This also pushed you to get better as a player. People talk crap about Zelda II all the time because of its difficulty but when you play through it and get better at it the whole game becomes so much more rewarding. If you want a game that fits in your time frame then anything from the NES or the Super Nintendo won't fit the bill. If you want to play through those games set aside some time to really give it your all. Zelda games aren't just games, they're challenges, especially the older ones. You have to treat it like a challenge and spend time getting better at it to fully enjoy it."
truezelda,2ybe3r,shadowlink_486,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:40:08 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating, but they did add the teleportation system which lets you go straight to a spot below a fairy fountain.

Most of the ""puzzles"" rely on pure trial and error, often with arbitrary limits on how many times you can try (burn every bush, but you can use the candle only once per screen; bomb every wall, but you can only carry sixteen bombs).  Back then, we loved it because it was all we had, but there's no going back to that sort of thing once you've had better."

I think it depends on what your first experience is.  For example, my first Metroid game was Fusion, then Prime, then Zero Mission. To this day, i still have trouble enjoying Super Metroid that much because the physics and controls are so clunky and convoluted compared to the GBA Metroid games, even after beating Super twice.  But put me on a retro game in a series that i did experience first, like SMB, and I'll do just fine. Because i wasn't ""spoiled"" by newer Mario games first."

But at the same time, I'll be the first to admit that it is an absolutely terrible game for a new player to pick up and play in this day and age because /u/brberg is absolutely right, the game is intentionally difficult to progress in because it hides everything behind unmarked, arbitrary secrets."
truezelda,2ybe3r,Empha,0,Wed Mar 11 03:28:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really isn't great by modern standards. The only thing it's really got going for it compared to the sequels is the high difficulty. I personally enjoy that, but far from everyone does."

And discounting arcade-like games such as Tetris and Pacman as ""one trick ponies"" is silly. Sure, they don't have levels or endings or anything like that, but a lot of work went into designing their mechanics in a fun, fair way.  Is Zelda more complex and ambitious than those games? Sure. But that doesn't make it magically immune to criticism. It's no different than people who defend Halo: The Master Chief Collection or Assassin's Creed: Unity for being buggy messes because ""they were just so ambitious and complex!"""

truezelda,2ybe3r,henryuuk,2,Sun Mar 8 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/demonic_hampster said, SMB makes it very easy to advance quickly with the two main warp zones, which are very easy to find (as a 5-7 year old, i found them just by playing like i normally would). Plus no saving is a result of there being no save battery, though i suppose they could've added a password system (instead they opted for the warp zones, which were more sensible for a game already that short). Remember, Zelda was the first game with battery-backed save.  Either way, there's a difference between difficulty and tedium. Having to start a world or the whole game over again in SMB is tough because you have to overcome all the challenges again (or just use the warp zones). Grinding for hearts or rupees in Zelda while relying on the RNG isn't challenging at all, just time consuming and based entirely on luck, rather than skill. And unlike Mario, where you can use your platforming skills to get places very quickly, Zelda gives you very limited tank like movement which makes getting to places slow, even if you have the flute.  Either way, the OP didn't say Zelda was an outlier. He said that Zelda 1 is tedious in some ways. He doesn't owe it slack in comparison to other games: This is a ZELDA discussion sub, so criticism will be levied at ZELDA in particular.

Hyrule's geography has varied over the years, but it almost always has a mountain in the north/northeast, a desert in the west/southwest, and a forest in the southeast. Both SS and TP fit this framework. Since Eldin Volcano and Death Mountain are in the same position relative to the forest and desert, it makes sense for them to be the same place. I don't think the blank spaces in the SS map represent actual distances between the charted territories, but rather indicate an unknown amount of unexplored land. The future locations of Hyrule Field and Castle Town are in that area. I have no idea what's going with Lake Hylia. While it's usually fairly close to the desert, it's never really had a consistent location."

OoT and TP's death mountain are in almost the exact same spot.  The difference is that TP's playable/visible map extends far more North than Ocarina of Time's, including new areas that weren't part of Hyrule until then, thus putting Death Mountain slightly more south in the whole map.  This is also the case with ALTTP.  It's always top right, but in some games, there is more land beyond it because they expanded Hyrule.

truezelda,2y7jwg,serpent-tailed-angel,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yeahh that's what I'm leaning towards. I'm having trouble linking FSA's hyrule to any other hyrule besides maybe LttP, and even then, LttP is definitely not on an island"
truezelda,2y7jwg,Dismas423,4,Sat Mar 7 05:56:55 2015 UTC,"I think Hyrule was always on an island. The country had an eastern coast in LoZ, and AoL showed Hyrule to be part of a vast network of continents. Link tries to sail to Hyrule in LA, indicating that Hyrule in ALttP is accessible by water. SS shows there is an ocean beyond the Desert, proving that Hyrule has a western coast as well. And as /u/SvenHudson pointed out, the pre-flood world appears as a series of islands or continents from the Wind Palace. So it appears Hyrule has always been an island, or at least the greater part of a continent, and FSA's map is consistent with other depictions of Hyrule's geography."
truezelda,2y7jwg,Dismas423,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:04:04 2015 UTC,"i totally agree that hyrule is on an island, but respecting the geographies of TP, OoT, and SS, FSA is simply way too small of an island"
truezelda,2y7jwg,locustgate,2,Sat Mar 7 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point. I'd say that Hyrule is on an island, but the FSA map is a highly stylized representation of that island. If we take the map on its face, Hyrule Castle is almost as large as Death Mountain. The map emphasizes locations that are relevant to the quest instead of presenting a totally accurate layout of Hyrule during the time period."
truezelda,2y7jwg,Dismas423,2,Sat Mar 7 18:36:11 2015 UTC,More akin to Australia?
truezelda,2y7jwg,Petrichor03,3,Sun Mar 8 18:03:29 2015 UTC,Hyrule does have some insane spiders and most of the animals are trying to kill you...
truezelda,2y7jwg,Serbaayuu,3,Sun Mar 8 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind an out-of-game explanation, the creators probably originally intended FSA to take place some time after TWW, which also explains why the Helmaroc King and TWW-design Phantom Ganon and Tingle appear in the game. (And why Navi/Tetra Trackers comes included in the game in Japan.) It would also explain the line about the cannons that the brainwashed soldiers brought out being ""ancient"" if these cannons belonged to the TWW era (since no other game really featured cannons at that point). So FSA Hyrule may have originally been the first incarnation of New Hyrule, or it may have been the restored Old Hyrule thanks to the work of the Koroks. Either would explain why Hyrule is surrounded immediately by a giant ocean in that game."
truezelda,2y7jwg,Petrichor03,2,Mon Mar 9 00:18:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, that'd also explain the ""reincarnated Ganondorf"" thing, too!"
truezelda,2y7jwg,Dismas423,2,Mon Mar 9 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, good catch. I also forgot to mention the minigame where the Links are taught how to read Old Hylian, which TWW explicitly stated had been mostly forgotten about by the time of that era."
truezelda,2y7jwg,SvenHudson,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that FSA was originally supposed to serve as a bridge between WW and the classic games. Hyrule is laid out in a similar manner to ALttP, but it has many distinct regions and looks like a bunch of islands coming together, similar to what the Deku Tree envisioned in WW. Its graphical style is a mix between WW's cel-shaded style and the sprite-based graphics of ALttP. FSA's story was also originally a lot closer to the Imprisoning War than the final product turned out to be. FSA would have then supplanted OoT as the prequel to ALttP and brought the classic games into the two-timeline framework Nintendo was using at the time. Obviously Nintendo decided to go in a different direction, but FSA's original placement seems pretty evident."
truezelda,2y7jwg,jesuswig,6,Mon Mar 9 19:12:16 2015 UTC,Hyrule was also shown to be an island in Minish Cap which way predates the flood.

truezelda,2y7jwg,SvenHudson,2,Sat Mar 7 05:55:40 2015 UTC,"gotcha, looks like these are what you're talking about?   they kinda look like dragon roost island and forest haven tbh - obviously they're not but interesting either way."

truezelda,2y3gpw,Izitnu,2,Fri Mar 6 03:41:22 2015 UTC,"Well, considering Rosso is a sage, wouldn't he be related to Daraunia anyway, in some fashion?"

truezelda,2y3gpw,henryuuk,2,Fri Mar 6 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"True about TP, I don't remember enough about WW, but even without titles, it seems like they all follow the same sort of ""theme"". Y'know?

truezelda,2y3gpw,henryuuk,0,Fri Mar 6 16:15:54 2015 UTC,The actual ALttP sages are not the ones being referenced here.  The sages in the back story of ALttP are.  They are the ones who originally sealed the Sacred Realm.  And they're definitely the same sages as in OoT.
truezelda,2y3gpw,MisogynistLesbian,2,Fri Mar 6 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess since they made the timeline split on such a way as to ruin the consistency of the back story of alttp you are right, since it can't work otherwise. I forgot they did that for a second"
truezelda,2y3gpw,henryuuk,0,Fri Mar 6 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"That said, the 'sages' that sealed the sacred realm in alttp's backstory can't be the OoT revived sages, because they were : ""7 wise men""     The reason we have this predicament is because they decided to put the ""fallen hero"" timeline to split off during the final battle with Ganon (in OoT), which is a stupid and illogical place to make the split happen."
truezelda,2y3gpw,henryuuk,2,Fri Mar 6 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"I think it all makes sense, because there are two sets of sages in Ocarina of Time.  OoT Link only meets the sages that he awakens as an adult. However, we're shown that the sages in Twilight Princess pretty much had to have been around when OoT Link was a child. There's only one Ganondorf, so the flashback we see of them trying to execute Ganondorf had to take place relatively shortly after the end of OoT.  It's not clear what happened to the ""TP"" sages in the adult timeline, though it's likely Ganondorf killed them. We also don't know exactly when the fallen hero timeline split happens or why. It could easily happen when these sages are still alive.  Seeing as they are all human, and could easily all be men, it makes it likely that they are the ancestors to the maidens in LttP and the sages in LBW."
truezelda,2y3gpw,stryker101,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, NORMALLY this would work, there is only 1 problem.   However, they made the fallen hero split happen during the final battle with ganon in the historia, which is the only thing that doesn't make sense, cause it completely destroys Alttp's backstory.    Now if the split happens before the timeskip, it makes perfect sense, and the sages from alttp's backstory are in fact the ones from Twilight Princess.  .  But like I said, the issue with that is : the historia places the fallen hero split during the final battle with ganon (OoT) which makes no sense and destroys their own lore."
truezelda,2y3gpw,henryuuk,0,Sat Mar 7 09:08:37 2015 UTC,Uhm I never implied anything isn't canon ? I said they decided to make the 'canon' split on a horrible place since they are working against their own lore.

truezelda,2y3gpw,Petrichor03,-1,Fri Mar 6 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"If Rosso is part Goron, that would probably knock a couple of these possibilities off, but it wouldn't limit us to the sexual reproduction options. For example, if Gorons reproduce by spores or by breathing life into their offspring, this could theoretically be done to a Hylian child, turning it into a part-Goron child.  Furthermore, it's also possible that Rosso is a unique scenario, and one of his parents was a Goron who was transformed by magic into a form that was able to reproduce with a Hylian. I.e., Gorons normally can't reproduce with Hylians, but something unique happened with Rosso's Goron parent (likely via magic) that allowed this ""Goron"" to reproduce with a Hylian. (This isn't likely, of course, but given how a dragon scale can magically alter the bodies of a Rito to allow them to fly, it's not unheard of.)"
truezelda,2y3gpw,henryuuk,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:35:31 2015 UTC,"The dragonscales for the rito are just ""strength enhancers"" though, or possibly even just a meaning off : ""If you can reach the dragon you will be strong enough to fly"""
truezelda,2y3gpw,Petrichor03,2,Fri Mar 6 13:01:53 2015 UTC,"The scales grant the Rito wings and alter their bodies, making them more birdlike, so that seems to be a little more than just a strength enhancer. (Remember, Rito use the Grappling Hook in order to get to Valoo before they get a scale from him.) Regardless though, we know that the Kokiri became the Koroks through magic, and we know that the Zora most likely became the Rito through either magic or evolution, so the point is that if Rosso has Goron ancestry, it may not tell us anything about Gorons as a whole. We just can't say anything for certain about the Gorons as far as Rosso goes based on what little information we have right now."
truezelda,2y3gpw,Epicfaillord,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:41:14 2015 UTC,The Rito don't even have wings before they get the scale. After that at will they can grow wings from their decidedly human arms to fly.
truezelda,2y3gpw,Toon_Lonk,3,Fri Mar 6 09:58:26 2015 UTC,Another thing worth noting is the ages gorons are when they reproduce.   In MM the baby in Goron Villages father was a very old Goron. Now this may just be because he's a dirty old rock that likes to fock but I can't recall any younger gorons with kids in the  games.

truezelda,2y3gpw,CaptianZaco,4,Fri Mar 6 10:18:06 2015 UTC,"One of the elders from TP has weird things growing on his back, and the elder Goron from MM has a HUGE rocky back.  I've always figured they reproduced via budding, like coral, where the rocks on their backs grow into new Gorons.  It explains why they eat rocks; they don't need nutrients but they intake minerals to reproduce and grow larger by calcifying new rock in their body.  Gorons also might have been inspired by the golem from Jewish folklore, a being animated from clay or stone (usually for the purpose of defense).  That would support them being rock creatures who are given life by the goddesses, or something."

truezelda,2y3gpw,SuperNeonManGuy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:41:56 2015 UTC,"Gorons are all-male and asexual, and they reproduce by budding.  There is a very, very strong ""brotherhood"" amongst all gorons we've seen.  It's really hard to say that they aren't simply all male.  We've also only ever seen two young gorons, if I remember correctly - both of them fathered by male gorons without a mother in sight or even mentioned.  Gorons are already a biological oddity.  They somehow gain nutrition from rocks and nothing else, and we know outside of Termina that they don't even need to breathe (this may also be the case in Termina, but Goron Link ""dies"" when you fall in water just because it's impossible to climb back out as a goron in most places).  There's zero implication that goron reproduction is sexual and in my opinion if it was ""magical"" (carving out of stone etc.) we'd have heard about it in some game.  So I feel it must be something like budding.  Also, Rosso is not part goron.  Gorons cannot breed with other species."

Or since we see them in her Army in the Skyward Sword intro, it could be that they're artificial life like Lanayru's Aincent Robots too i guess...

truezelda,2xzfva,DemosthenesLocke2012,12,Thu Mar 5 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"However, in MM3D, these Triforces are gone!.   I think this is actually a VERY important retcon.  That old symbol is the basis for a lot of theories, and if Nintendo felt the need to rectify it some ~15 years later with the lore they have updated since the original came out, there's probably a good reason for it.  I think it's good evidence against the idea that the Ikana Kingdom and Stone Tower etc. were built in direct relation to some influence of the Hylian Triforce."
truezelda,2xzfva,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Mar 5 05:57:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at first I thought maybe they just censored out the bottom due to the nakedness (the whole bottom appears darkened), but the triforce isn't on the Termina Field statues either, and I don't think those were even supposed to be naked."
truezelda,2xzfva,henryuuk,3,Thu Mar 5 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, that only does the bottom face. From the triforce, there are feet directly to the upper right and left, right above it is the tongue, and the entire lower half is butt.  Here is a side picture that shows the figure squatting."
truezelda,2xzfva,IThoughtThisWasDigg,7,Thu Mar 5 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"I think they weren't expecting so many crackpot theories to come out of including the triforce somewhere like that, so now that it happened they decided to remove it."

However, in MM3D, he has a different reason: ""I was distracted, and those punks took advantage of me.""   There are a lot of subtle updates in the text, both in OOT3D and MM3D. I think they just had a better translator this time around to be honest. I don't think they were trying to censor or rewrite anything."
truezelda,2xzfva,brberg,3,Thu Mar 5 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"Have played the Japanese version and can confirm that the new translation of that line is better.  Edit: Well, not unambiguously. ""Those punks"" is wrong, obviously, since it was one guy acting alone."

If that is true, I'd have to believe that the translator(s) Nintendo chose are so incompetent that they would make mistakes like that. If in the original game the dialogue implies that it was one person, why would the translator write it as more than one?"

They more or less have to tell their own story that strongly resembles the game's story, so you should be fine without having played the game they're for--so long as you don't try to discuss the game based on what you read in the manga. My personal favorite was Four Swords, but they're all good."

truezelda,2xzfsb,hprshredder,9,Thu Mar 5 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"The... roughness is definitely overlooked by people focusing on the conceptual aspects of it.  I've always been a huge fan of the game, but when you distance yourself from actually playing it and don't just intuitively know what to do, it's nowhere near the tightly designed experience OoT is.    There are aspects even early on, as someone remembering what to do, which are not necessarily intuitive.  For example, with Koume and Kotake's potion shop/boat ride, you're guided to talk to the person at the counter, then sent to look for them at the potion shop.  But I had been messing around since I didn't want to reset to day one for the sake of resetting, and was on day two, so when I got to the shop the witch flew off to look to her sister.  And so I followed the witch into the woods and encountered both witches, but I couldn't get a healing potion to give to the other.  Then there was the matter of me wearing the Deku Mask, which, while there are definitely people that react differently to you based on mask, there's no indicator from speech that the reason the witches reacted to you that way is because you're a Deku unless you speak to one while she was in the potion shop.  And, decent chance you ARE a Deku at that point due to having to follow/chase the monkey.  I also got stupidly frustrated at the part where you need to plant a Magic Bean because I was in Deku form.  While you spend the entire rest of your time in that area in Deku, you for some reason can't plant a bean in Deku form, so you have to switch back to human just to plant a bean before switching back.  There's also little triggers where you have to talk to people in the right order, like having to talk to the Pictograph clerk, then check the empty boat ride booth, and THEN talk to him again to get directed in your quest, as opposed to just talking to him once or twice (you HAVE to try to talk to the empty booth; simply seeing it and realizing it's empty is not enough).  As you might've noticed from all the early game commentary, I haven't played very deep into the remake (only to Mask of Scents), but while I absolutely adore MM from a conceptual level, a lot of it doesn't translate so easily into a streamlined gameplay experience.  Which, is what happens when your game is splintered into countless sidequests.  MM goes big on the concept it tackles, and it's rough for it.  OoT is designed in a more much straightforward way, but that's also let its design stay easily conducive for the modern age/player in comparison to MM's."
truezelda,2xzfsb,SteveWoods,2,Thu Mar 5 09:40:30 2015 UTC,You can get a healing potion from Kotake even if she left the shop. You just talk to her in the forest.
truezelda,2xzfsb,Lobonerz,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"I think one of the points I like most about MM is the fact that the people in the world react differently depending on what mask you are wearing. While it might not be intuitive at first, that feeling doesn't last long. The first time I noticed the different reactions I then begun to try different masks on different people. If I was stuck or not getting the reaction I wanted, I tried different masks. Even as Link, when going to the Trading Post with the Bunny Mask he won't let you buy anything, only comment on the mask.    I'm a big fan of exploring and experience the world. The different masks and reactions add to that. My biggest gripe would be the 3 day time line. I actually do like the different events that take place on different days and different times, but I do hate resetting. I always feel rushed in dungeons which I dislike. I like to take my time, not feel rushed. The 3 day time line means I'm constantly going back to dungeons and redoing them to try and get into every nook and cranny."
truezelda,2xzfsb,BlueBlurDown,10,Fri Mar 6 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MM is overrated as hell right now.  The hype train for that game is as strong as Hoenn Remakes and Half-Life 3.  Like you said yourself, it's still excellent, and there are plenty of perfectly valid reasons it could be someone's favorite game in the series.  But it's not Foursome With The Golden Goddesses-good."

It seems a lot easier than the original with the more frequent save points and the song of double time allowing you to skip forward made the kafei and Anju quest feel waaay shorter and easier. I remember that was a notorious side quest on the gamefaqs message boards back in 2000. The bombers notebook is really useful, though it makes some things a bit too obvious and kind of stops you stumbling across events so much, which was really cool in the original.  I really enjoyed it though. My only real complaints are the obvious and perplexing Zora mask nerf and how often I had to beat Goht to restore snowhead to spring time. You should be able to instantly beat a temple with fighting the boss again as optional with time challenges and stuff. It's just annoying doing the same fight several times."
truezelda,2xzfsb,Osafune2,2,Thu Mar 5 15:33:55 2015 UTC,You should be able to instantly beat a temple with fighting the boss again as optional with time challenges and stuff   Thats what i like about it though. You actually go back in time.
truezelda,2xzfsb,duhhidkyurgetndvoted,2,Fri Mar 6 03:51:13 2015 UTC,duhid... is completely correct.  Osafune2 all you have to do is enter the dungeon and if you have beaten the boss you can teleport to his lair and just beat him again.

truezelda,2xtzko,Serbaayuu,10,Tue Mar 3 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"Me first.  The Fallen Timeline  At the end of the Adventure of Link, we would see Hyrule in the late stages of its slow, inevitable decline.  The land has been eternally tormented by war.  The Master Sword is lost or depowered so much it's unrecognizable.  As is the Four Sword.  The Triforce has been fought over again and again, and while the Royal Family holds on to it now, it always seems to slip away from them.  The world has been covered in monsters for a long, long time.  People have spread to protect themselves and the great Hyrule Kingdom is fractured into many smaller provinces and countries.  This timeline is the perfect place for us to meet new one-off villains that are attempting to take advantage of Ganon's residual influence.  People like Veran, Onox, and Yuga, who either work for Ganon or are attempting to control his spirit.  I also think it would be very interesting to retcon Yuganon into being a permanent fusion, since Ganon was a mindless beast, and it would make sense that any future resurrection would resurrect the fused-Yuga's mind with him as well.  In terms of gameplay, this could bring us new & experimental mechanics (like Zelda II) as well as new lands outside of Hyrule.    The Childhood Timeline  This is where Hyrule has prospered for the longest.  The kingdom is strong and with a rich lore & legends that detail the stories of Heroes past.  Here is where the classical Zelda Formula would be the mainstay.  We encounter Ganondorf, use the Master Sword to slay him, pursue the Triforce whether it has been stolen, sealed, or protected, and remain in Hyrule with Epona, interacting with Zelda and the six elemental sages, as tradition goes.  There's also plenty of room here for more Four Swords games, since in both of the other timelines that relic probably isn't reachable anymore.    The Adult Timeline  In this timeline, Ganon is dead, the Master Sword (and Four Sword) is buried, and the Triforce is nowhere to be seen in New Hyrule.  The lineage of the Hero, Goddess, and Demise incarnations all continue, but they're not burdened by the rest of Hyrule's past.  This is the perfect time to introduce a new series villain.  A permanent one.  Now that Ganon is dead and under a LOT of water, the only way he's coming back is with reincarnation, like in Four Swords Adventures.  But that's no fun.  We should see a brand new Demise incarnation born just to torment New Hyrule.  Malladus was a start, but kind of boring.  Ideally, the new villain would be just as powerful and intimidating as Ganondorf ever was, but he wouldn't be restricted to the ""Power"" section of the Triforce, so he might be more subtle.  He might prefer a political takeover to a military one, even going as far to rally the Hylians to his side to depose Zelda.  Or he could be a rogue knight who leads his armies through charisma and wit rather than through fear.  This villain would remain in the series for many years, becoming New Hyrule's equivalent to Ganondorf.  He'd be just as powerful and capable of being sealed, unsealed, killed, resurrected, and reborn.  But he'd also give us something new to look forward to."
truezelda,2xtzko,Phoxxent,2,Tue Mar 3 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"All of the above, except I would like to see Adventure of Link start the rebuilding of Hyrule. Now that they have the triforce, the Kingdom can be restored, but not first without someone trying to destroy all magic (but really take it for themselves) for the triforce to show it's true power once more. The timeline then looks much like the pre-split timeline with wars for the triforce and sealing the sacred realm and whatnot. They then craft either a new Master Sword (magic sword just seems to have a spell, not a blessing, could be wrong) or restore the old one after finding it buried away in some overgrown wood buried in the mountains of North Hyrule."
truezelda,2xtzko,henryuuk,2,Tue Mar 3 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"I theorize that the White Sword is the depowered Master Sword, and the Magical Sword is the depowered Four Sword.  The Master Sword has been shown to lose its power over time, and presumably the Four Sword would do the same... and presumably they decay at the same rate, so since the Four Sword was created after the Master Sword, it makes sense that it would actually be stronger than it in a later era.  So they could restore it if that's true."

truezelda,2xt1d6,RuafaolGaiscioch,15,Tue Mar 3 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think we had this thread already, but I'll give it another go:   Defeat all the bosses again to save the individual regions.  Presumably this would be required to be done before beating Majora, as the mask essences are consumed (and likely destroyed in some way) during the final battle.  Who knows if that would lift the curses on the lands itself, anyway. Help Anju and Kafei.  This is time-limited as Sakon will steal the mask if Link doesn't help. Save Romani Ranch from the aliens.  Obviously this is something that must be done in the allotted time. Save the monkey in the swamp - there's a chance that if he doesn't, the monkey will be executed by the 4th day. Speaking of the swamp, save Koume.  Being downed in the Lost Woods for 3+ days can't be healthy. Rescue the zora eggs!   That's all that I can think of that might be required to be done during the three days before the moon comes down.   the last three days of his journry?   I don't see any reason Link wouldn't stick around for a little while afterward to help everybody else.  *Added point 6."
truezelda,2xt1d6,Serbaayuu,9,Tue Mar 3 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"In terms of canon I think everything gets completed. Every quest completed, every mask obtained, every problem resolved, etc. Canonically speaking Link is a super badass and gets everything done in a 3 day time span.   In terms of how much a player can actually do in three days of in-game time I'm not sure, but I'm sure there are speed runs out there done in 3 days of in-game time."
truezelda,2xt1d6,pdelponte,28,Tue Mar 3 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"Canonically, yes, everything is completed. But that's technically not possible, as some of the goals contradict each other. To finish the Kafie and Anju sidequest, Sakon needs to deliver the Big Bomb Bag to the Curiosity shop; that's how Kafei is able to follow him to Ikana Canyon. This means that you haven't helped the bomb shop owners.  One theory I've heard from a few people is that all the good things that Link manages to record in his Bomber's Notebook converge at the very end, and the ""Dawn of a New Day"" is all the parallel timelines created by playing the Song of Time become one. This is, I think, the best explanation of how everything is completed.  This also explains a couple odd things. For example: If you go back and defeat Odolwa on a new cycle, then take the Deku Princess back to the palace, the monkey thanks you for keeping a promise that you made in a different cycle."
truezelda,2xt1d6,glenbolake,5,Tue Mar 3 17:57:45 2015 UTC,Or maybe the monkey had asked Deku Butler's Son to save the princess and he instead got caught in the forest between hyrule and termina and turned into a tree stump.
truezelda,2xt1d6,vanceandroid,4,Wed Mar 4 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"I like to think that too.  That somehow, defeating Majora, merges all the timelines you/Link created on his quest.  However, I think this can create some conflicting timelines.  For instance, you can't simultaneously save and not save Cremia.  So that means either only positive things are retained or some people just end up remembering two different memories."
truezelda,2xt1d6,theWallflower,7,Wed Mar 4 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"It's possible to help everyone in the Bomber's Notebook as long as you leave out the bomb bag lady and let her get robbed. (However, she makes it home safe either way, so nothing too bad.)  The tricky part is remembering the things you can do to help people that aren't in the notebook. Beating the bosses over again should be fairly simple, but helping out the Indigo-Gos, Koume, the Business Scrubs, the scientist in Ikana Valley, etc....that's a lot to account for, and while most of it isn't time-sensitive, you gotta find times to help out there in between all the time-sensitive stuff.  There's a lot you can do, but when you expand good deeds to things like ""helping Skull Keeta, Igos du Ikana every single Gibdo in the bottom of the well pass on, get all the Zora eggs back again, etc.,"" you may have to start prioritizing."

truezelda,2xu751,MrBoobieBuyer,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:02:07 2015 UTC,You mean the ghost that looks like every other ghost in the game that isn't evil? The Hero's Shade that looks nothing like the mindless Stalfos you fight in Arbiter's Grounds?
truezelda,2xu751,Phoxxent,12,Mon Mar 9 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"No, definitely not.  In fact, I am pining for games that occur outside of the known lore boundaries.  I want to expand those boundaries, not explain every relic or every adventure every Hero ever had.  I want new villains, new lands, new Heroes, new weapons, and new relics.  I don't want to get 3 pearls, get the master sword, get the Triforce, and then fight Ganon in Hyrule after going through the Lost Woods, Death Mountain, and Lake Hylia."
truezelda,2xu751,Serbaayuu,6,Wed Mar 4 01:26:51 2015 UTC,"A little bit, but what bothers me more is the constant requests to revisit old Heroes, specifically the Hero of Time. Fans constantly clammoring for games in crowded areas of the timeline and ignoring the whole of time and space that exist at the ends of the timeline and even the beginning."
truezelda,2xu751,Phoxxent,2,Wed Mar 4 00:20:09 2015 UTC,"WW/PH wasn't that long ago, and ST was basically a continuation of that. You definitely couldn't call ST a reboot, anyway. I'd also draw comparisons between ALBW/ALTTP and TP/OOT.  So, no, not really. I don't think it's a big issue."
truezelda,2xu751,samueldlockhart,2,Wed Mar 4 00:00:26 2015 UTC,This has been going on since forever. Only a handful of games continue from each other.  I like the broken chain of Links that tie together through their legends.
truezelda,2xu751,neoslith,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:45:18 2015 UTC,The continued stories can be pretty cool but I'd be more wary of the series getting locked into one story. I think I prefer it the current way because then I don't go into the game expecting certain things. For example I was very disappointed by Spirit Tracks just because I didn't like the train compared to the boat. The rest of the game was actually really good but the train bummed me out.
truezelda,2xu751,voxxy,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from. I also really enjoy the life and story of a single Link being more fleshed out with a followup game - the example that comes to mind is OoT and MM. I got attached to that Link and invested in his story and what happened after, you know? I wanted to see him get his happy ending.  That being said, I think the Zelda series does so well because of the numerous instances of Link within the ""mythos,"" so to speak. Like Serbaayuu said, if it was the same Link in the same world, it'd get stale pretty quickly.   The different Links in different points in time give the Zelda lore so much more depth, in my opinion. You can see how one game's events affected another, even if they're hundreds of years apart. With the stories being so varied and so far apart at times, it gives the world both a history and a future... that makes it way more immersive."
truezelda,2xu751,ladyundaria,1 point,Wed Mar 4 09:10:43 2015 UTC,"That's tough to answer, I don't think anyone is as sure as their answers make them out to be.  New worlds in a Zelda is great, and Link's Awakening is the first example of how amazing ""completely new"" can be.  But LttP and Majora's Mask are perfect examples of how re-used tools and gameplay can make for masterpieces.  The real answer is this: As long as the story is compelling and the gameplay rich, then it doesn't matter.  Zelda fans were drawn to the games for the story first, how else can you look at it?"
truezelda,2xu751,TheMovieMaverick,-4,Thu Mar 5 07:17:21 2015 UTC,"um, YES, it's bothered me for a while that, instead of continuing a story, they keep setting new games further and further in the past, and now the original games take place chronologically towards the end of the series. Why is this necessary? why not build on what you've already got rather than ""well, none of the events of the other games have happened yet, so we can do what ever we want"""
truezelda,2xpkc2,pbeverly,34,Mon Mar 2 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"ALttP takes place on the Downfall Timeline, which is characterized by a constant diminishing of the Kingdom of Hyrule in comparison to the other branches. The Imprisoning War took place in this timeline, leading to massive loss of life and destruction of Hylian culture. Some of the races absent from ALttP may have been completely wiped out in this war. Judging from OoA, the Zora split into two tribes: the Sea Zora, who fled to Labrynna, and the River Zora, who remained in Hyrule. The Gorons also apparently abandoned Hyrule and settled in Holodrum and Labrynna, but the presence of Rosso in ALBW indicates that there may be some Gorons left in Hyrule. The Kokiri and Gerudo may have been assimilated into the general human population. Many human characters in ALttP, such as Flute Boy, wear Kokiri-style clothes. The OoT Sages have human descendants among the ALBW Sages, indicating that racial assimilation did indeed occur. The Kokiri and Gerudo populations may also be hiding deep in their respective homelands outside the player's view. We never saw the Gerudo in TP, but FSA proved they were always present in the Child Timeline. In summary, the chaos of the Imprisoning War likely led to emigrations from Hyrule and the assimilations of certain species into the Hylian population."
truezelda,2xpkc2,Dismas423,7,Mon Mar 2 21:57:01 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this summary! So let's talk about the Imprisoning War then: Would this be something that Nintendo would explore in a game? Seems awfully dark but very important to the timeline. And do we know whose leading both sides?
truezelda,2xpkc2,Dismas423,8,Mon Mar 2 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"We know from Hyrule Historia that after a brief period of peace after Ganon was sealed away, the people gained knowledge of the Triforce and started fighting for control of it. The king commissioned Seven Sages to seal the entrance to the Dark World (formerly the Sacred Realm) in order to end the conflict. Ganon's forces came from the Dark World to stop the Sages, but thanks to the protection of the Knights of Hyrule the seal was successfully cast and the war ended. I don't think Nintendo will cover the war in a future game since it doesn't involve Link, and Nintendo tends to focus on telling new stories in the Zelda series instead of fleshing out background material."
truezelda,2xpkc2,callmeon,5,Mon Mar 2 22:55:18 2015 UTC,I think i disagree with this last statement due to all of the prequels zelda goes through.
truezelda,2xpkc2,Dismas423,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:11:02 2015 UTC,"There have been prequels, but none of them have matched up with another game's background material. OoT originally appeared to be ALttP's back story, but it was later shown OoT and the Imprisoning War are separate events. Then FSA was going to be the Imprisoning War, but Miyamoto prevented this and made FSA its own story. Nintendo had another chance to adapt a back story with MC, but it ended up being totally separate from the legend recounted in FS. Nintendo has consistently refused to adapt an older game's background material into a new story and I don't think it will do so in the future."
truezelda,2xpkc2,MisterParagon,2,Tue Mar 3 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"The Kokiri and Gerudo may have been assimilated into the general human population.   I doubt this is true of the Kokiri, what with them being eternally children and living secluded lives hidden deep in the forest. More likely that other thing you said, they're still out there, just hiding and out of focus.  I also like to think they may have somehow become something else. Like in Wind Waker it was implied they became the Koroks or how in Skyward Sword the Kikwi seemed to fill the same role. Either way, out of focus."
truezelda,2xpkc2,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"I doubt this is true of the Kokiri   See: Agitha.  Not confirmed, but likely."
truezelda,2xpkc2,MisterParagon,4,Tue Mar 3 21:55:29 2015 UTC,Because she's weird and likes bugs? How does that make her a Kokiri?
truezelda,2xpkc2,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Mar 4 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"There's a theory that revolves around the people in Hyrule being branded with the three dot-tattoos below their eyes as part of either reparations for war, or a signal of loyalty.  Those three being the gerudo, sheikah, and kokiri, if I am remembering correctly.  Both Telma and Agitha have them.  Also, Agitha comes with the odd detail of the fact that she lives entirely by herself in a large city, plus her obsession with wildlife (including having a tree inside her house)."
truezelda,2xpkc2,MisterParagon,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"Wait... what? I have never heard of that. I mean, that's not to say it isn't a pretty interesting theory, I have heard that Telma may be a Gerudo, but never anything about three dots. Is there any more foundation to this? Because if there is that's pretty cool, but otherwise it sounds like an example of fans putting more thought into the series than the actual creators."
truezelda,2xpkc2,SuperNeonManGuy,3,Wed Mar 4 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"I cant actually visit the link posted by Serbaayuu so I'll just give what I know and have speculated myself.  Fanadi the fortune teller, Telma the bar owner and Agitha the self proclaimed Bug Princess all bear an identical marking, the ""three dots"", it is speculated to indicate that they all secretly belong to (or are diluted descendants of) the Sheikah, Gerudo and Kokiri. This is supported by the fact that Fanadi has pointed ears (something that has become rare by the time of Twilight Princess), Telma has dark skin (which has only really been shown to be a trait of the Gerudo) And Agitha is a child with blonde hair who is very-interested in nature and has a tree inside of her house... as opposed to a house inside a tree as most of the Kokiri are shown to have.  It is also entirely possible that these three characters are not related to these races at all as in Fanadi's case the only known Sheikah villages have been shown in a long-since abandoned state and the only character that has any more evidence for being a Sheikah in Twilight Princess is Impaz. In Telma's case she would be the only Gerudo shown in the entirety of Hyrule throughout the game and she also lacks the characteristic Gerudo hair (though this may have been abandoned in favour of art style) and Agitha's case can go many ways, since the Kokiri are in fact forest spirits and not actual humans i doubt they'd be able to have children with Hylians so if Agitha is anything to do with the Kokiri at all then she is probably just the sole pure Kokiri in a town filled with other species, it's highly possible that she is Kokiri and aware of it though as she seems to be closely tied to nature and wildlife. There's no denying that the ""three dots"" exist though but it's also entirely possible that it was just a nod to the game's three missing races by the developers.  edit: ""missing races"""

truezelda,2xpkc2,Kafke,4,Tue Mar 3 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"The best answer is war, I'd like to think. Hyrule has always had war, but the Gorons and Zora population were attacked at that point. If you play ALBW, the Zora Queen says that she told other Zoras to play nice with people, but they're still sore and disobey her."
truezelda,2xpkc2,Crim_drakenya,3,Wed Mar 4 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"From everything I can tell, the Gerudo fled or died off, the Kokiri fled or died off (personally, I think they're still alive in some form), while the Gorons and Sea Zora fled the OoX kingdoms. As for the Deku, I have no goddamn clue. Like with the Gerudo, they came back in FSA, so there's that."
truezelda,2xpkc2,noopenusernames,2,Tue Mar 3 03:09:53 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that traditional Gorons/Zoras simply don't appear but still exist (as seen in the Oracles).
truezelda,2xpkc2,brberg,2,Mon Mar 2 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"My opinion on the Zora bit. Zora's are evil in the downfall timeline, which means that Ganon has frozen their land, conquered them etc etc meaning...they have good reason to be dicks to humans/human-like entities.  That and inbreeding. I mean seriously in OOT we see one female zora. Same for MM and TP."
truezelda,2xpkc2,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"I think one of the things we need to remember with these kind of instances is that, back when ALttP was made, the designers probably never really thought about adding additional races. Then when N64 came around, someone was probably like, ""hey lets create an additional race for this game and call them Gorons. Hey, and let's also create a race of kids that don't leave the forest and call them Kokiri"". I really don't think they planned so far into the future that, back when they were making ALttP, the producers had this grand scheme of having all these races, and purposely not putting them into the games until a decade later. It's just that nowwe have all these races in some games, but not others, so now people have to come up with reasons why after the fact, to fit the ever-growing, ever-changing story. The Zelda series is very much an evolving thing. It's not like Miyamoto had the whole story planned out decades ago, and decided it was going to be released little by little until he died, and then some. It's like, ""Well, if we add that into the next game, we have to either make the timeline go this way to make sense, or we have to go back and probably recant that other thing..."" and so on. This is why I don't cling to the Nintendo official timeline. One day, they're gonna back themselves into a corner with some series-defining detail and they're either going to have to recant something, or they'll have to throw in some really over-the-top stuff in a game to logically fill the gaps they make between games. It's better to loosely follow the Nintendo-official timeline as a guide, but fill the gaps yourself. Lets face it... a third timeline branch for ""if the Hero theoretically fails""? I just can't buy that. It doesn't make sense. 2 branches I can live with, but the 3rd branch sounds like someone panicked one day and thought that that explanation would be a cure-all for some other timeline mistakes that didn't add up after a few of the games came out."

truezelda,2xnfwy,TheHynusofTime,3,Mon Mar 2 15:23:47 2015 UTC,One 3 day cycle seems pretty crazy to me. You would have to skip a lot of stuff and maybe even have to semi-speedrun the main stuff.
truezelda,2xnfwy,legendtriforce,3,Mon Mar 2 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the worst part is the first twelve in-game hours, because you have to get Epona and the Garo mask before the first night starts. Meaning you have to do all of the Deku stuff, complete Woodfall up until you get the bow, leave, do the Goron stuff, do Snowhead up until getting the fire arrows, then melt the ice to biggoron to earn Powder Kegs so you can blow up the rock blocking the ranch.  After the first day ends, you really don't have any more time sensitive events to worry about, aside from getting the Song of Storms. All you have to do is beat the rest of the game."
truezelda,2xnfwy,TheHynusofTime,2,Mon Mar 2 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, there's an easy glitch you can use with Goron Link to get into the Great Bay area anytime.

""Then that moon is going to become your new puppet?""  Or something with equal meaning.  There's no symbolism involved, I think.   like was the mask the moon or was the moon created by the mask?

truezelda,2xibr4,milhouse92,8,Sun Mar 1 02:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yes - Skull Kid is the puppet in the first sentence.  Tatl's response could possibly mean that Majora is taking the moon as its new host.  And, no, Majora isn't the moon.  It's sealed in the mask.  Kinda the point."
truezelda,2xibr4,Serbaayuu,0,Sun Mar 1 02:25:19 2015 UTC,"We actually don't know that. We only know that the mask is powerful and that through it, Majora could control the Skull kid. It could contain the spirit of Majora like the transformation masks, but Skull Kid never transforms wearing it, so maybe not. We also know that Majora only manifests out of the mask when inside the moon. We also know that the Carnival of Time takes place when the Sun and Moon are in alignment. This might extend from the ancient tribes that used masks to worship deities like Majora, that now inhabit the sun and moon. There might also be a reason the moon has a spoogy face on it."
truezelda,2xibr4,milhouse92,8,Sun Mar 1 02:39:21 2015 UTC,"I will need to doublecheck, but I am pretty darn confident that the Happy Mask Salesman says that the evil is sealed inside the mask."
truezelda,2xibr4,Serbaayuu,0,Sun Mar 1 02:43:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, only that an ancient tribe used it for hexing rituals, but sealed it away after it proved too powerful.

truezelda,2xhr50,SvenHudson,10,Sat Feb 28 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"Probably because most changes were self-fulfilling prophesies. A lot of things that exist in the present at the start are because of Link's actions in the past, a lot of which was simply correcting interference from Veran."
truezelda,2xhr50,Phoxxent,7,Sat Feb 28 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"...Not really?  Most of the open-world puzzles and events in Oracle of Ages rely entirely on the ""Dynamic Time Travel"" seen here.  You find something impassable, go to the past and change it, and then it's changed in the present.  If I am remembering correctly, this includes bringing Jabu-Jabu back to life by saving him as a baby whale.  You only have to look at the opening cutscene, where a person in the present turns to stone because of events in the past affecting their present, to realize that Oracle of Ages' time travel is silly and should not be taken very seriously."
truezelda,2xhr50,Serbaayuu,5,Sat Feb 28 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"You simply un-do whatever Veran did, in the end all the results are the same both before her influence and after, so while there may be a split, it is virtually indistinguishable from the given timeline."
truezelda,2xhr50,Phoxxent,14,Sat Feb 28 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"The answer could possibly be that they did, but that no games have been made in those other timelines.

truezelda,2xhr50,MisterParagon,2,Sun Mar 1 03:21:41 2015 UTC,"It overwrites, back to the future style. It's a single timeline that's being modified, rather than branched.  It makes no god damn sense (fucking capcom), and there's no reason for it. But that's just how it is.  As for OoT making a branch, this is clearly evident. Seeing as he is physically removed from the adult line, which remains separate. We know this because the events of OoT are still recorded and shown in WW. While MM takes place when link is a child. Two clear events from the different outcomes. No overwriting took place.  It's jut the different natures of time travel. Two different kinds. Branching and non-branching. Non-branching typically results in the novikov principle, if you follow logic."
truezelda,2xhr50,Kafke,2,Wed Mar 4 08:51:52 2015 UTC,"sorry for being se late but i thought i'd just correct you  in that it isn't ""Link chang[ing] enough things to make [the timeline] split"", he is sent to the future not by time travel but by sleeping for seven years and when he is ""sent back in time"" time is rewound and the future events undone... When you finally defeat Ganon in the future you are sent back to the past (via a different kind of time travel where rather than time being reversed, future Link is taken from his time and sent back into his childhood body) by Zelda, this is what creates the split as there is now a future where Link has defeated Ganon but is now absent as he was sent to the past and there is an existence where Link has appeared in the past from the future and had Ganondorf sealed BEFORE he could do anything bad, hope I helped :P  Oracle of Ages had the re-windy sort of time travel employed by Ocarina of Time for the first part of the game. going back in time affects the future (yes creating a new branch) it's just if you are inside a timeline branch then that's always how it's been for you and you won't perceive the change  Exaggerated example for the sake of explanation, pretend in OoT you played through the game and met Malon as usual, you saw her again in the adult portion of the game and all is correct. but then you go back to the child portion and through a long chain of events you cause the eruption of Death Mountain sending a flaming boulder flying into Lon Lon Ranch (over the top i know but stay with it) Then you go back the the future and meet Malon, she isn't going to be freaking out saying ""OMG suddenly there's a GIANT rock in Lon Lon ranch with grass growing on it"" because for her there's been a giant rock there since she was a child, but since you've already visited her before you went back and changed things then you know that there is an existence out there where there is a Lon Lon Ranch without a rock in it but since THIS Malon grew up with the rock always there she never saw the change. The reality of it is that you ARE creating a split timeline whenever you move a block in a different time period on OoA, it's just not a big enough change to warrant an entire game, one block moving 1 foot isn't going to change the universe, but link dying is a big enough variable to allow for things such as Hyrule to be flooded or for Ganon to take over...  THIS is how i choose to apply my Theoretical Physics Degree... ugh :/ anyway... hope i helped!"

truezelda,2xhr50,Grantus89,2,Mon Mar 2 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"Considering the games fit nicely before ""Nintendo made the timeline up"" I really doubt that. Evidence of a timeline starts at the second game released. And each one has fit in nicely at the time of release.  Edit: Though I agree there's no overarching plan.

Minish cap is the outlier, due to relying on improper zelda tropes. FSA is in a weird spot in my opinion too. But there's certainly not contradictions. Unless I seriously missed something. I spent a good month and came up with the same timeline (albeit with FSA between FS and OoT).   Minish cap was kinda the origin of the green cap but then link has in in skyward sword.    No it's not. MC has never been the origin of his hat. ""His hat"" isn't even a hat. Did you play MC? It's a guy. Besides, it's different links/clothes in each game.   Links clothes in OoT are just kokari clothes    So? Link's clothes in LoZ1, AoL, LTTP, and LA didn't even have an origin story. Who cares?   but then in all the games that come before they are ""Heros clothes"", do kokari wear Heros clothes.   No. ""Heroes clothes"" are only when they are recognized as the heroes clothes, such as in wind waker or TP (both of which follow OoT). In SS it's simply the guard outfit, which comes in multiple colors.  As for the Kokiri, no. They wear green tunics. It doesn't have to be 'inspired' or 'based' on anything.   These aren't contradictions. These are stupid assumptions you made that are debunked by simply looking at the games in question.   Also I seriously doubt that when they were making LttP that they knew that this took place in a timeline where in the past Link had been defeated.   That split is easily the most arguable. But you are right. The games are designed gameplay first. That doesn't mean they don't have a place in the timeline.  DO you think the MGS guys thought about 3 taking place in the past when they were making 1? No. They fucking didn't. That doesn't mean it's not a valid timeline.  But you know what? It doesn't matter. The timeline fits perfectly fine. As they take care to make sure this is the case.  I think the only slip up was during the creation of WW/TP, where aonuma came up with the split timeline idea, and sort of forgot about LTTP (which he didn't work on at all).  Which is where the awkward unexplained branch comes from. But it still fits canonically. It's simply unexplained.  Is there some master plan for the timeline? Probably not. Did they make up the timeline last minute to make fans happy? Not even close. The timeline has been present since the second game."

In theory, there's no reason there can't be an infinite amount of timelines branching off from every game if they can just do that. The Legend of Zelda: Potato of Destiny happens Link is knocked out of his body in Spirit Tracks instead of Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Gym Shorts only happens if Link gets Game Over and Ganon Returns in Zelda 2.

I disagree. The method of travel can certainly be part of it. MM creates branches which are merged at the end. OoT makes branches using the Ocarina method of travel.  OoA uses the harp, which doesn't branch, but overwrite. This makes sense, as it's a goddess's (or oracle's) tool. Just like the rod of seasons overwrites, rather than branches.  SS uses the gate of time, which naturally functions differently than the ocarina.

truezelda,2x2k91,JFM2796,3,Wed Feb 25 04:35:36 2015 UTC,I've always hoped for a trilogy of the Hero of Time. I could see that just being absofuckinglutly amazing! I would throw money so fast.
truezelda,2x2k91,BenignLarency,11,Wed Feb 25 15:47:15 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Not about the Hero of Time, because part of the Hero's Shade's story is that nothing adventure-worthy happened during his lifetime.  But I want to see that engine used for a new title, I actually really like the aesthetic of it when the graphics are improved.  And we might as well get something worthwhile out of those remakes being made."
truezelda,2x2k91,Serbaayuu,11,Wed Feb 25 12:32:49 2015 UTC,"Nintendo has repeatedly shown, despite the now official timeline, to have any real concern with the minutiae of the story.  Fans have always clamored for the next game to show some referenced legend or been frustrated because the newest game added yet another contradiction to the timeline.  If they really wanted to make a third game starring the Hero of Time they would regardless of how it damages the ""Hero's Shade's story.""  Fans would just have to come up with some unofficial retcon to explain any discrepancy as we've always done."
truezelda,2x2k91,Ginkasa,2,Wed Feb 25 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"If it completely breaks the Hero of Time's canon, why even make it about the Hero of Time and not just a different Hero instead?"
truezelda,2x2k91,Serbaayuu,6,Wed Feb 25 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"That's kind of my point.  They don't care about ""canon.""  Nintendo has repeatedly chosen to reference back to OoT to the point where it no longer made sense for every game that references OoT to have actually all occurred.  This is largely the reason for the BS ""death"" timeline they came up with when they finally caved and pushed out an official timeline.  If Nintendo chose to make a third Hero of Time game they would do so because they recognize how popular that particular Link is and are hoping to capitalize on that (and no longer have any Hero of Time games to remake).  They won't really care how it potentially messes up a vague cameo in a game that seemed primarily focused on filling itself with almost-but-not-quite direct references to OoT."
truezelda,2x2k91,Ginkasa,0,Fri Feb 27 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, but why HOPE for that, just to get a third installment of the most boring 3D link we have gotten."
truezelda,2x2k91,henryuuk,7,Wed Feb 25 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"Your post seems kind of a non-sequitur to what I was saying, but I'll go ahead and bite...  I don't think OoT/MM Link is really any more boring than any other Link, 3D or otherwise, except for maybe TWW Link.  TWW Link is the only Link to really display any actual personality, IMO.  Sure, TP and SS Link have a little bit more facial reaction than OoT/MM Link, but its little more than what could assumed one would feel in whatever situation they're in.    I also think that the Hero of Time's situation is probably one of the more interesting of all the Links.  He's a complete outsider throughout both games he features in.  He thinks he's a Kokiri, but he's not and is seemingly ostracized by everyone except Saria for it. When he leaves the forest he's exploring a world he's never known and doesn't really belong in.  Adult Link is even a stranger in his own body as he's really still a child despite outward appearances.  Then, of course, he spends a unknown number of repetitive 3 day time periods fixing everyone's problem in an alternate dimension where he probably won't even be remembered.  A third game with perhaps a bit more narrative focus, or just a decent narrative adaptation of OoT and/or MM, could make it very clear how much real potential the Hero of Time has."
truezelda,2x2k91,Ginkasa,0,Fri Feb 27 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"So your reasoning is : ""they could do something with it"" well my answer is : they could do so with a new Link even better.    Their is very little reason to make a third hero of time story, we already know the most about him out of almost all Links."
truezelda,2x2k91,henryuuk,6,Fri Feb 27 02:02:56 2015 UTC,"If you say so.  I'm not campaigning for a third Hero of Time game (hence why I felt your initial reply to be a non-sequitur to my comment).  My only point was that Nintendo wouldn't be deterred from making a third HoT game due to any canonicity issues, which is what Serbaayuu seemed to be stating."
truezelda,2x2k91,Ginkasa,6,Fri Feb 27 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Curious.  Where are you finding that the Hero of Time could have no more journies?  The only thing said about his life post-MM is that he could never find anyone worthy of passing his skills on to, and that no one remembered his deeds saving Hyrule.  Obviously that (along with the fact that he just did) means he's not going to save Hyrule again, but I don't see anything at all suggesting there's no more room for him to have adventures."
truezelda,2x2k91,malaroo,7,Fri Feb 27 14:47:54 2015 UTC,I agree really. I cant just see the Hero of Time waiting for his death to come after MM. He had to have had some sort of journey in life beyond Termina. I refuse to think that all Link does after that game is become a guard.
truezelda,2x2k91,Robingshade,-2,Sat Feb 28 10:22:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, you could say the Hero of Time went on more adventures outside of Hyrule but then you're really starting to make it seem like the Hero of Time is kind of an asshole who wants to be glorified for his heroics so much that he continues to exist in existential torment for centuries after death.  Of course there are ways to twist and bend the lore to fit the Hero of Time's canon.  I don't think doing so is worthwhile, when at that point you're disconnecting him so much from the Hero of Time anyway it might as well be another Hero."
truezelda,2x2k91,Serbaayuu,3,Fri Feb 27 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"twist and bend the lore to fit the Hero of Time's canon   I don't really think writing what isn't written anywhere is bending or twisting the lore.  There is obviously time cut out for whatever his life might have entailed, and I don't see why anything else says he couldn't have done anything interesting."
truezelda,2x2k91,malaroo,3,Fri Feb 27 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"A third Hero of Time story would be amazing. Personally, I'd like if it dealt with a version of Hyrule years later, possibly after Twi Princess. Time travel and such. Maybe even a happy and sappy ending with him finally seeing Saria again.  Hell, the Hero's Shade could just be made into the Fierce Deity or something."
truezelda,2x2k91,IstheLieReallyaCake,2,Sat Feb 28 01:42:01 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. After playing OoT3D, a great 3d Zelda game on a handheld system I felt there was no going back, I would never again be able to play a new, top-down 2d style Zelda game. When ALBW was announced I had very strong mixed feelings, nostalgic excitement for a return the classic 2 style and a return to the ALttP world no less, and a step back from the full 3d (and 3D) capabilities of the 3ds. In the end my disappointment was missplaced as ALBW is easily one of my favorite entries in the series, but I would still LOVE to see an original 3d entry on handheld, and to be in the style of OoT and MM AND to be a part of that series? That would be incredibly amazing."
truezelda,2x2k91,dildokTheUnpleasant,2,Wed Mar 4 04:13:59 2015 UTC,Agree entirely. These systems are powerful enough for fully 3D Zeldas then why persist with making original games in the top-down style? Nostalgia? Let's seen an original 3DS Zelda in real 3D.

He is the most boring 3D Link we ever gotten, with no emotion or even personal drive behind anything. The most emotion we ever got out of him is : ""OMG THAT DOOR JUST CLOSED, like the 50 doors before it"" and ""I found something in a chest""    And his reasoning for going on his adventure is : 'I was told too'    Windwaker Link shows way more emotions, and his reason for his adventure is to save his sister. Twilight Princess Link shows more human emotions while he is a wolf then OoT Link does. And his reasoning for his adventure is cause he wants to save his friends, as well as being turned into the wolf and promising Midna to scratch her back for saving his. Skyward Sword Link same deal, way more emotion, ranging from distressed when Zelda is gone to my favorite : ""I'll rip your head off and shit down your neck"" anger when Ghirahim takes Zelda away. Again, his reason for starting the adventure is to save Zelda.    .  hell, even several of the 2D Link's show more emotion then OoT Link ever did.    Maybe some people think this is a REASON to give him a third chance, but personally the only thing from the hero of time and masks's story I would want to see again is the transforming masks to become the other races, and there are different ways to give us the ability to use the other being's their powers."
truezelda,2x2k91,henryuuk,3,Wed Feb 25 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"TP Link is clearly the one with the least emotions. Isn't it great that he smiles almost constantly? Even during Zant's fit he's just there, smiling away. He rarely changes expression throughout the game.  I won't argue with WW Link though. He's got a ton of expressions to him."
truezelda,2x2k91,legendtriforce,0,Fri Feb 27 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"TP link shows more human emotion in his wolf form then OoT Link does through his 2 human forms. He snarls each time Midna lands to rough on his back, he gets annoyed at Midna's constant 'humans are so useless, wish i could just do this myself' attitude, he is concerned for Midna when she is light-sick, Must I even show this That alone shows that Link is still flawed by human emotions like greed and that realizing that is a horrible blow.    Hell, just in the final battle : When Midna is throw out of the final boss room he is concerned, when she teleports him and zelda out of there and goes into eldritch twilight form he is scared for her safety, and when ganondorf taunts him with her helmet, he is visibly angry. he is hopeful when he sees the light spirits and midna's silhouette, and visibly stunned and relieved when he sees twili Midna.    .  EVERY SINGLE TIME he goes into battle his face change to his : ""Focused get ready face""    Honestly, I don't see how you could even THINK TP Link shows no emotion throughout the game unless you haven't played it for 10 years and barely paid attention then."
truezelda,2x2k91,henryuuk,2,Fri Feb 27 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"TP shows only a little bit of emotion, and that's in the beginning of the game. He barely reacts to Midna's departure, Midna destroying Hyrule Castle, killing Ganondorf, killing Zant. That link is a huge interpretive cutscene. It... didn't all actually happen, as you can tell by the fact that there are three dark Links and a Triforce in the cutscene. That's not to say he doesn't ever have expressions. They're just extremely mild/tame. Why didn't he chase after Midna at the end? It was such a mild reaction that I'd barely have thought they spent an entire adventure together if I hadn't played the game.  OoT Link shows emotions throughout the entire game, in reaction to many of the characters, like Saria, Ruto, Darunia, Zelda, Sheik, Ganondorf, etc.  That last line is an attack on my character (ad hominem) and I will refuse to acknowledge it. If you want to bring a fallacy like that into this debate then I could return the very same question to you. But I won't."

truezelda,2x2k91,legendtriforce,3,Fri Feb 27 22:59:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I just can't agree with you here. If any Link showed the least emotion it would be TP Link save for a very brief period in the very beginning of the game as a wolf. When he finds the children or Ilia he has very little reaction. He also barely reacts to Midna's departure. OoT/MM Link on the other hand are quite expressive. He shows his reluctance to leave when Saria sends him off. He screams and runs when Darunia and the others try and hug him. He's surprised when Ruto appears close to him, falls and screams into the water. He smiles when he's with Zelda at the end and he's defeated Ganon but then is shocked when he hears the loud boom, even moving forward a bit instinctively to protect Zelda. He's also the only Link to go out and seek a companion that has left him instead of just moving on because ""it has to be this way"" or some other random reason.   WW Link does show the most emotion, but the art style allowed him this very easily.   SS Link was incredible yes, but the main characters of that game were able to be highly developed with orchestrated music and dedicated cutscenes. This is why SS Zelda is most people's favorite Zelda as she gets a lot of one on one time with Link for development.   I'm not sure why you hate OoT and MM Link so much, but there's no way the 2D Link's show more emotion then him (MAYBE A Link Between World because of cutscenes, but even then I'd argue not even close)."
truezelda,2x2k91,Vivo999,-1,Fri Feb 27 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't hate OoT and MM Link, he is just incredibly overloved, and the only reason is cause he is from those specific games. it's the same with people wishing for skullkid in smash or hyrule warriors. skull kid, even with the mask, does NOTHING, yet people 'love' him so much, bu in reality they just love MM and know that is the only thing they could really take from that game    For just a few of the moments TP Link shows emotions, see my comment to the other guy."

Sometimes, not having a concrete story explaining where things came from (Majora's Mask, Fierce Deity, the Great Flood, the various tribe origins, etc) is acceptable.  Every time Nintendo and/or the Zelda team makes a deliberate decision about how/where/why something exists, it upsets people.  While I am all for Nintendo being more involved in the Zelda stories (I often feel like the stories could have more resolution/concreteness actually), I feel like one reason why people love the Zelda games so much is because there is always this room for personal imagination and interpretation.  Where did the Fierce Deity Mask come from?  How much of MM is symbolic?  How did Ganondorf break out of the Sacred Realm?  What is the true nature of the Triforce?  No one can answer these sorts of questions conclusively, but instead we get these really incredible ideas and theories and collaborations between fans who love the series.  So what sort of game would I want to see with the 3D game engine and style?  Pretty much a brand new Zelda.  It can go anywhere in the timeline and it doesn't necessarily have to be related to OOT or MM in anyway."

truezelda,2x2k91,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Feb 25 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"""how about a new game""    We haven't had a Zelda game that's properly disconnected from the rest of the lore in a really long time, and I really want that.  Just, aside from being set in Hyrule and having the standard Triforce, Ganondorf, Zelda, (maybe) Master Sword, and (even more maybe) a reference/cameo to some other lore bits, make something new.  I don't want an origin story for every relic, I don't want a sequel to every Hero that doesn't have one.  It seems like that's all people ask for out of this series nowadays.  *I realize the irony of this whole comment when I'm one of the top advocates for the Story of the Flood as a game."
truezelda,2x2k91,henryuuk,2,Wed Feb 25 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, one of the most recent games to be as standalone as possible, is A link between worlds, despite being ""a reimagineng of a link to the past""    it uses generic Ganon to come back, but doesn't make him the end boss. it doesn't explain anything that happened before and actually RAISES questions for the inbetween lore(how did the triforce become split since alltp and the oracle games) And it's most important story part is a self contained plot point that doesn't leave anything open for later : Lorule.    Personally I expect Zelda U to be a very separated Zelda game, with only very small amounts of links to other games, possibly not even enough to immediately place it in the timeline with certainty    but who really knows, guess we'll see."

I really wouldn't mind seeing Young Link return in say, Smash 4 or Hyrule Warriors with the transformation masks.  Unfortunately, Smash 4 is now no-transformations and Hyrule Warriors game him only one transformation (and basically broke the game with it).  But why do people keep asking for direct sequels?  I love Majora's Mask (it's my favorite Zelda game), and I actually really like Phantom Hourglass and the like, but I would take a new Zelda any time.

But it was a good game overall, one problem I had with it though was the fact that it made you grind to level up, kind of like the old Castlevania mishap."
truezelda,2x207z,androsphere,5,Mon Mar 2 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Oot is still my favorite, but I'm willing to accept that its limitations graphically and spaciously have made it age badly. More recent Zeldas have made gameplay smoother, and made visuals more appealing. Thus, more recent Zelda are arguably better in quite a few ways.  That said, I think that the wii u has graphics powerful enough that a more realistically styled Zelda (like oot) wouldn't age horribly anymore."
truezelda,2x207z,Phoxxent,2,Wed Feb 25 02:09:16 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, it's powerful enough that a realistically styled Zelda wouldn't feel right. It worked for TP because it was not too powerful and was still somewhat stylized."

LA is probably better in an objective game design sense, but SS enraptured me more.  I still gave LA a fair chance and I ended up enjoying the game still.  I'm okay with preference, but hate biaseses.  A preference is when you try different things but prefer some over the others.  A bias is when you refuse to give games a fair chance just because they don't align with your comfort zone.  And I'm all okay with people who just want to try 1 or 2 Zelda games out and not try all of them.  But if someone is going to be a fan and compare all of the games, at least give them a fair chance.  I've beaten every Zelda game except FSA, ST and AOL.  ST, I played half of.  AOL, I played 3 hours of before I quit.  And FSA, I still haven't played yet because I don't own it yet.  So, I'm not saying people can't have an opinion unless they beat every single one, but at least expand your horizons before you judge."

The only game I don't specifically like is ST. Which is still a solid game when taken in comparison with other non-zelda games."

Even the games that I'd rank from #8 to #12 I still replay and enjoy a lot.  It doesn't irk me that ALTTP and OOT are considered the best.

It's that when they're considered leagues ahead of the others, especially when the other games have rarely been played.   Read the next sentence ;). I don't consider either game 'the best'.

Then I got oot the year it came out, same with mm and I always liked mm better. Tp is my favorite so far though.  Thanks for sharing!"
truezelda,2x207z,Lord_Boo,-5,Wed Feb 25 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"LTTP and OoT are easily the definitive Zelda games.   How can you say this with such confidence? Did Nintendo release a memo stating that these games define the Zelda series and are what the series as a whole represents, and all other games in the series aren't? Maybe what makes those 2 games in the series ""the definitive Zelda experience"" according to you is how someone feels about Spirit Tracks or Majora's Mask. Does that mean that those games are the ""definitive Zelda games?"" No. Your first sentence is opinion stated as a fact."
truezelda,2x207z,Kafke,15,Wed Feb 25 01:34:25 2015 UTC,"How can you say this with such confidence?   LTTP introduced and set the general standards of the series, which have held for the majority of the series.  OoT took LTTP and rehashed it into 3D, introducing ideas/concepts that again are used through the majority of the series, as well as other games/series entirely.   Did Nintendo release a memo stating that these games define the Zelda series and are what the series as a whole represents, and all other games in the series aren't?    Nope. But practically every game released after LTTP relies on the plot/story/mechanics/etc introduced in LTTP. And OoT is a 3D recreation.   Maybe what makes those 2 games in the series ""the definitive Zelda experience"" according to you is how someone feels about Spirit Tracks or Majora's Mask.    Spirit Tracks is literally just Phantom Hourglass with a new coat of paint, and an on-rails movement system. Majora's Mask is Oot with fresh mechanics not used in the rest of the series. Neither are definitive, because they are both black sheep. It's like trying to call AoL the definitive title. It's a great game, but in no way is the definitive Zelda game.  LTTP and OoT are 'definitive' because when you say 'Zelda' the tropes introduced in those games are what come to mind.   Does that mean that those games are the ""definitive Zelda games?"" No   You seem to be taking definitive to mean 'best'. Read my very next sentence. ""But they are not even close to my favorites, nor the ones I'd consider the best.""  OoT I feel was an overall lackluster game (though good for the time). LTTP is one of my more favorites, but it's still far from the top.  But it's pretty hard to argue that those aren't the definitive Zelda titles. If you really want to get down to it, you might be able to include Twilight Princess or Link Between Worlds as newer 'definitive titles'. But it's a bit harder for newer games to be definitive, because they typically introduce new things, which we can't see if it influences the rest of the series (because new things don't effect old, and there's not newer games yet).   No. Your first sentence is opinion stated as a fact.   Please explain how Zelda 2 can be definitive, and what it's defined exactly. Or if you'd like, go with MM. Or even ST. All three of those games, while good, haven't defined anything in the Zelda series as a whole, and thus cannot be said to be definitive. Even though MM and Zelda 2 are both amazing games (ST is still pretty good as well).  But there's a clear difference between definitive and good."
truezelda,2x207z,OMorty,10,Wed Feb 25 01:48:39 2015 UTC,"Your points are true. Also, you are correct in assuming I confused the word definitive for best in the spur of the moment. I'd have to say I agree with you."
truezelda,2x207z,Epicfaillord,3,Wed Feb 25 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's important to make the distinction. LTTP and OoT are pretty clearly the two definitive titles. Which is why they are commonly recommended to new players. I have a feeling Zelda U is going to take that spot as well.  Favorite, one the other hand, is entirely subjective. You can like stuff that isn't the definitive title. And 'best' may be determined entirely different. 'Best' might be the one with the best story, or best dungeons, etc."
truezelda,2x207z,tilsitforthenommage,2,Wed Feb 25 01:53:48 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel like your reasoning for OoT being ""definitive"" is kinda shaky. You establish ALttP as being definitive because it establishes things such as plot/story/mechanics/etc. that are used consistently in later games and then claim OoT is definitive because it... uses plot/story/mechanics/etc. already established by ALttP? I don't see how this logic can't be extended, at least to some degree, to any given Zelda game that borrows from ALttP, which as you've pointed out, most of them do, which is what makes ALttP so definitive."
truezelda,2x207z,Phoxxent,3,Wed Feb 25 05:14:36 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel like your reasoning for OoT being ""definitive"" is kinda shaky.

You establish ALttP as being definitive because it establishes things such as plot/story/mechanics/etc. that are used consistently in later games and then claim OoT is definitive because it... uses plot/story/mechanics/etc. already established by ALttP?   More of expands upon them and converts them into 3D. It's the LTTP of the 3D Zeldas. It introduced the Hyrule creation mythos (goddesses, triforce, etc), the 3D Puzzle tropes (shoot eye with arrow), Ganondorf, etc. Along with introducing things like L/Z targeting, and other such things.  It's also the Zelda game that attracts the most players and is a starting point for many fans, along with being the centerpiece of the timeline.   which as you've pointed out, most of them do, which is what makes ALttP so definitive.   Yea. ALttP is (IMO) the definitive title. OoT feels like a 3D reimagining of LTTP, as well as introducing quite a bit to the table.  To put it in another way, I see LTTP and OoT as the two definitive Zeldas. LTTP being the 2D game, and OoT being the 3D one.  But that kind of stretches into my thought that Zelda is really 2 series packed into one."

I have my favorites but they all have certain strengths and weaknesses that make them hard to truly measure against each other. To me, it's much more interesting to take the judgment part out of it and look at consecutive iterations in the series to see what's changed and what hasn't. It's fascinating to see what features or staples are introduced or abandoned with each new game as the series evolves.   And even though I'm not as fond of some games in the series, like Skyward Sword, there's still plenty of things I like about the game too. I thought the motion control combat to be really limiting, not just in the combat techniques you could perform but also in the way that enemies had to be designed around it. However, I'd say that the story and characterization of Link, Zelda, and Impa is the best in the series and the art style is second only to Wind Waker. People would do well to remember that their subjective opinions of a game are just that; subjective. Just because a game has some flaws doesn't make it a bad game because certainly every Zelda game has a flaw somewhere."

truezelda,2x01hb,Knoxisawesome,2,Mon Mar 2 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"Compared to LttP, much shorter. Dungeons are similar to most 2D Zeldas. I don't know if you've played any of the Four Swords games, but it's part of the Four Swords subseries, although it is a full Zelda game, unlike the other two. So, the plot involves Vaati and the Four Sword, although the Four Sword mechanics are not as complex in this, only splitting you into four copies of yourself that walk with you, like Swapper if you've played that. Along with the Four Sword is holes that you can jump into around the world that turn you the size of a Picori, a race of little mouse people. So, some dungeons are smaller than a person, but are full dungeons to mini Link, meaning there are sometimes giant enemies like a giant Chuchu boss. There is also at least one dungeon in which you switch between big and small to solve certain puzzles. The game also brings back items like the Roc's Cape and Pegasus Boots and adds new items like the Mole Mitts and Gust Jar. The areas in the game are ridiculously good looking and incredibly colorful, as is everything else in the game. The music is nothing to write home about as most of it remakes of music from previous games, but that means it's as good as the music from those games. There is also a new kinstone mechanic. You find kinstone pieces around the world. These are circular stones of a certain color and certain shape in the center that fit like a puzzle piece with kinstones other characters in the game hold. When you fuse kinstones with another character in the game, it opens up something to you in the world, like a tree or rock blocking a path will disappear or a treasure chest will spawn. I don't recall a time when they were necessary to do anything in the game, but they give you something to collect and are used if you want to do extra stuff, or 100% the game. Overall it is by far my favorite 2D Zelda (I haven't played Four Swords Adventures or Oracle of Seasons) and hands down the best looking Zelda game, especially on Wii U, as it is a Virtual Console title. Some people don't like a lot of things about it like the kinstones, its length, or its difficulty (it is fairly easy). The only thing I don't like is how short it is, but that's just because I like the game enough that I want there to be more of it, so I don't think it's much of a complaint."

Going through OOT for the first time myself, I can definitely say that dated, oversensitive controls (mainly for aiming and minigames/side quests that require it, fuck you Big Poe Quest) absolutely is keeping me from enjoying this game as much as I want to, and I already enjoy it a good bit.

truezelda,2x01hb,noopenusernames,5,Tue Feb 24 16:34:38 2015 UTC,Its more of a spiritual successor. Its not related to the original other than the overworld. I don't recommend playing that first though because it kind of spoils you with items and isn't accurate to the zelda formula.

truezelda,2x01hb,noopenusernames,6,Tue Feb 24 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"Are you just a casual gamer, or are you willing to be sucked into the world of Zelda? I would try Ocarina of Time first, since I think thats the game that got so many people into the series, then maybe backtrack and do A Link To The Past (most people will say go right to Majora's mask from OoT, but MM is kind of a special case, and I think you should really cover some of the old school stuff before you get too hinged on the newer games.) I don't have a DS, so I honestly have no idea what games are available on it. I'm guessing Twilight Princess is not, but that would probably be my next suggestion. If not, then go with Majora's Mask if you want, since the graphics and gameplay will be what you were used to in OoT. There's benefits to not playing MM immediately after OoT for someone brand new to the series.  For someone brand new to the series who wants to just play them all because everyone says they're good games, I would just recommend playing them in the order they came out (thats how most of us did it and we're in love with the series)  Otherwise, an alternate list I would suggest would be: 1. Ocarina of Time 2. A Link to the Past 3. Twilight Princess 4. Majora's Mask 5. Link's Awakening 6. Wind Waker 7. Phantom Hourglass 8. Spirit Tracks 9. Oracle of Seasons / Oracles of Ages 10. Legend of Zelda 11. Four Swords / Four Swords Adventure 12. Adventures of Link 13. Skyward Sword 14. A Link Between Worlds 15. Ocarina of Time Master Quest  I think this is the best list to give you the most diversity without you playing through all of the similar styles at once. This list should mix it up enough that in some cases, the story lines are not directly following one another, but in some cases they are, the graphics style will generally change up (not play all the 2D games after one another and all the 3D after one another), and it splits up some of the more eclectic Zelda games (ie. WW, MM, and AoL, which are games people usually have very strong opinions on) from each other so that, as a new player, you're not just like ""wtf?"" I've played all of these except Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, and Link Between Worlds, and as a huge Zelda fan who would try to get someone brand new into the series, this would be my list. OBVIOUSLY, your DS will not play all of these, so just skip whichever ones are not available and go to the next one on the list. Some people will give you lists that they think might make the story ""flow"" a little better, but honestly sometimes its better to get bits and pieces and piece it together yourself. This will force you to replay the games when you get to those ""wait, what was it they said in that other game that has to do with this one part in this game? I have to go back and play it now..."" Replaying the games will make you look for shit you overlooked the first time and thats how you get deeper into the series, and thats when you start falling in love with it.  TL;DR 1. Ocarina of Time 2. A Link to the Past 3. Twilight Princess 4. Majora's Mask 5. Link's Awakening 6. Wind Waker 7. Phantom Hourglass 8. Spirit Tracks 9. Oracle of Seasons / Oracles of Ages 10. Legend of Zelda 11. Four Swords / Four Swords Adventure 12. Adventures of Link 13. Skyward Sword 14. A Link Between Worlds 15. Ocarina of Time Master Quest"

If you want something more challenging try Ocarina, Skyward or Twilight princess, the Zelda timeline doesn't fit well together aside from the Ocarina timeline so chronology doesn't really matter.  I'd leave Link to the Past and Majora's Mask for when you've gotten used to playing Zelda games, I'm confident they can be completed by novices but they are both very punishing for a first Zelda game. Link between worlds is also challenging, but it's not as difficult, however it's only loosely based on Link to the past so it's worth experiencing as its own game."

truezelda,2x1yuk,cooperific,8,Wed Feb 25 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"it occurred to me that each of the games in the ""Hero is Defeated"" timeline could occur   That's why I subscribe to theories that explain why the timeline split happened, based on reasons other than merely Link being defeated.  Theory 1 is that Link was defeated and then Zelda sent Navi back in time (creating a split just like she did for the Childhood Timeline) where she helped Link succeed.  Theory 2 is that the three Spiritual Stones affected the time travel in such a way that they fractured the universe into 3 different aspects: Forest = Prosperity, Fire = Destruction, Water = Flood.  I do not accept the idea that Link being killed is enough of a universe-shattering event to spawn its own timeline every time it happens.  That implies that there is also a timeline where Link runs in circles in Hyrule Field for 60 hours and then falls over dead from a stalchild, or where Link drowns himself off Outset Island on his birthday.  Which is ridiculous."
truezelda,2x1yuk,Serbaayuu,6,Wed Feb 25 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"I love your first theory! I've never heard that one before, so it gives me a lot to chew on!   My personal theory is similar to your spiritual stones theory. If I'm not mistaken, when Ganondorf touches the Triforce in OOT and it splits, it's the first time it's ever split in the timeline. We've seen in other games (ALBW especially) that the Triforce is integral to the stability of the land it inhabits; it's not a huge leap to me to think that it would cause major repercussions like a timeline split.  Furthermore, each timeline can be pinned to a different Triforce affecting their respective holders in a stronger way. The Hero is Victorious timeline is due to Link's courage being amplified enough to defeat Ganon (arguably manifested in his sword glowing before his final strike in OOT). The Child storyline is due to the Triforce of Wisdom giving Zelda the knowledge to prevent the events of the Adult timeline from coming to pass (presumably somehow convincing her father that Ganondorf really is as bad as he turns out to be). The Hero is Defeated timeline comes from the Triforce of Power giving Ganon the power to defeat Link.   I totally agree about the need for a theory besides 'for some reason Link died here and there's no explanation'. That annoyed the shit out of me when there was literally no explanation for it in the Historia."

Which is ridiculous.   I...actually really like the idea that there's a split for every Link, mainly because it presents the possibility of multiple endings.  Fans debate on the Great Flood/the possibility of a game featuring the Great Flood, but I think there's an interesting opportunity for Nintendo to create a game where 1) a Link did exist during the Great Flood and 2) failing leads to WW while suceeding leads to a whole different version of Hyrule.  I was slightly optimistic at the end of Spirit Tracks that we might see more Zelda games with multiple endings (however small the options are), but now I'm convinced they won't happen.  And - however exciting I find the idea - I don't think Nintendo dabbling with even more canon timelines is a good idea."

More details on the Spiritual Stone theory:  I based the theory primarily on the fact that every other instance of time travel in the series utilizes a singular relic.  In Ages, it's a harp, and there are no known timeline splits.  In Majora's Mask, it's the Ocarina, again no splits.  In Skyward Sword, ""real"" time travel is done via the Gates of Time, which also don't cause any splits.  In Ocarina of Time, the Door of Time, which could be considered the gateway to time travel, is opened by 3 keys, each of them very powerful relics in their own right.  The moment Link opened the Door, all three timelines were destined to happen."

truezelda,2x1yuk,kiramythos,4,Mon Mar 2 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"You're correct about the superfluousness. But there are a couple of things in your post that aren't 100% accurate.  1) ALttP says that the Sacred Realm turned into the Dark World when Ganondorf accidentally found an entrance to the Sacred Realm and then made a wish on the Triforce to rule the world. The Sacred Realm was the world that he was given rule over, which caused it to turn into the Dark World. Ganon wasn't even sealed until the Dark World started producing monsters. Ganon simply couldn't find the exit (and neither can Link when you play the game; he had to use the Magic Mirror or the portal Agahnim opened in order to escape back to the Light World every time), but the monsters produced by the Dark World did manage to find it. The sages in this game weren't specifically trying to seal Ganon away; they were just trying to seal the entrances to the Sacred Realm to keep all of the monsters from coming out and into the Light World. So the Imprisoning War couldn't directly follow from the way Ganondorf was imprisoned in the Sacred Realm at the end of OoT. (One particularly good place to put ALttP would be after FSA since FSA was originally intended to be a prequel to ALttP. ALttP Ganon and FSA Ganon are the only Ganons to call themselves the ""King of Darkness"", and they're the only Ganons in the series (besides Oracles Ganon) to own a trident (which is what transformed FSA Ganondorf into Ganon in the first place). Plus since FSA Ganon was sealed in the Four Sword, and ALttP GBA shows the broken Four Sword in the Dark World, that would be the perfect explanation for how the Four Sword got into the Dark World in ALttP: FSA Ganon broke out of the sword and carried it with him, ultimately finding the entrance to the Sacred Realm while he still had the sword in his possession.)  2) We're told in TWW that the Triforce was split into three pieces during OoT and those pieces remained split until the events of TWW. So any game that features the unsplit Triforce would have to take place after TWW or before OoT. (But because Link and Zelda find a new Hyrule after the events of TWW, and the Koroks are working to bring back the old Hyrule towards the end of the game, this isn't really a problem.)"

Same deal with the princesses. SS only said that Hylia reincarnated into Zelda once, and Demise's curse only mentions the blood of the goddess, not her spirit, which more literally means descendants than reincarnations. And only once has Ganon been confirmed to reincarnate, but FSA talks more about how the demon Ganon is reborn, rather than the Gerudo man being a reincarnation himself.  We accept that Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf reincarnate because it makes sense, not because it's confirmed by the games. It's the same reason Nintendo expects us to accept that Malon, Tingle, etc. all reincarnate.  EDIT: And in the event that Nintendo one day changes their minds and decides that none of the NPCs reincarnate but just have really sturdy family lines, Oracles Twinrova would easily be able to fall into that category as well, just as they fall into the accepted-reincarnation category now."

I mean, do you guys think that Mr. Myamoto & co. deeply thought about those timelines, like the quantum physics behind them? Do you really think that they spent hours and hours developing it?   We do know, however, that they have a timeline to place every title of the series, but I think that this is just for reference, maybe to get the “feel” that the game must have or something of sorts. Maybe they already have the placement for another 5 future games in the series, who knows. The thing is there are many factors that contribute to the overall inconsistence of the official timeline. The most noticeable are the fact that the early games in the series barely have a story (they are more like concepts than stories per se) and most of those were lost in translation to English.   Other than that, Nintendo’s game development relies more on the game design than the game story or overall consistence in the meta-story of a franchise. They (most of the time) first design the game then focus on how to implement a story. For example, there IS a Super Mario timeline, but the Mario games focus primarily on the gameplay and the game design [do someone play Mario for its story?].   Time-travel in the Zelda games are no Bioshock Infinite time-travel (or dimension travel or whatever). They are not as complex or deeply thought-out as Bioshock.   For me, the official timeline is just a way to see how the stories of the games and the lore behind it evolved, which I think is good enough. In that sense, thinking about paradoxes and inconsistences just make no sense."

It felt absolutely majestic, and the music in the temple and outside of the temple (sacred groove) were great. I also loved how you get to the temple by walking through that door that seemingly leads to nowhere.  Edit: Some links:  Sacred Groove Music  Entrance to Temple of Time  Actual Temple of Time  And while getting these links, I also was reminded of the City in the Sky theme, also one of my favorites- probably my favorite dungeon gameplay wise."

truezelda,2wyr46,CaptianZaco,10,Wed Feb 25 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"This may be an easy out since it's usually most people's answer when asked their favorite atmospheric dungeon, but I feel there is no easy out since the dungeons in the series are so diverse. I think Snowpeak Ruins from Twilight Princess has the best atmosphere in the series with the Shadow Temple from Ocarina of Time coming in a close second. It's cool because they are totally in the opposite spectrum when it comes to atmosphere. One dungeon being a homey, cozy, yet oddly dangerous mansion, and the other being a dreadful, eery, place. In the end, I personally feel as though Snowpeak Ruins's atmosphere is better presented to me than the Shadow Temple's by a very slim margin. Honorable mentions go to the Forsaken Fortress from WW, Forest Temple from OoT, Stone Tower Temple from MM, and the Ice Ruins from ALBW.  As for favorite music piece in a dungeon? I am quite confident I am the minority here, but this theme is far and away my favorite dungeon theme in the series:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2H8bv_e2wA"
truezelda,2wyr46,ItsZant,1 point,Tue Feb 24 06:55:27 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with Snowpeak Ruins. Mainly, I think, because its atmosphere was unique for the game and the series. As for the Shadow Temple, I might even put it in a shared first place. It's definitely not my favorite temple, but its atmosphere is just impeccable. As a child, it scared the living daylight out of me. Despite not being the grandest or most ""epic"" of the OoT dungeons, it did, and still does to this day, give me the undisputedly most thorough feeling of descending through darkness into hell itself. I felt like I was fighting my way downwards through a sacred, hidden place where Hyrule's deepest, darkest secrets and the remnants of a gruesome, blood-filled history was locked away, a place where no living being was supposed to walk. Still gives me the chills to this day.  EDIT: Not to mention a frequently repeating noise in the Shadow Temple's music which greatly resembled the swooshing sound of a Wallmaster coming down to grab you. Constantly kept me on the edge of my seat."
truezelda,2wyr46,CreepyPancakes,18,Wed Mar 11 12:30:55 2015 UTC,"You'd be hardpressed to find more fitting music to fit a dungeon than the Stone Tower Temple Theme Playfully daunting with a strong undercurrent of caution and doom. Forest Temple Theme might be a lock, though."
truezelda,2wyr46,TheMovieMaverick,19,Tue Feb 24 06:53:46 2015 UTC,"Forest Temple fully drove home the idea that ""Holy crap Link is an adult and this is scary!"", and I believe this is in no small part due to the theme, especially when the poes would laugh at you from the picture frames."
truezelda,2wyr46,grntplmr,5,Tue Feb 24 06:55:49 2015 UTC,"Yes! Playing this temple was such a shock after playing the Young Link dungeons.  Forest Temple took me a while to beat, so the song had time to marinate into my nightmares."
truezelda,2wyr46,TheMovieMaverick,17,Tue Feb 24 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"Not really a dungeon, or at least not a dungeony part of the dungeon, but the Organ music while climbing Ganon's tower in OOT is another top pick for me. How it gets louder, and louder the closer you get to the top and then stops as he stands up from the organ to taunt you when you enter the room. The beat of silence between the end of the organ and the boss music is really intimidating for a 9 year old."
truezelda,2wyr46,grntplmr,8,Tue Feb 24 07:30:28 2015 UTC,"As far as atmosphere goes, I think a lot of people in this sub would agree the Ancient Cistern is pretty high up there. And hey, the music there adds a lot to the atmosphere, in the parts above and below.  Bottom of the Well has a pretty crazy atmosphere, if only because you're acutely aware of where this dungeon is located...  I've always been a fan of the Forest Temple theme, as has been mentioned here. Ikana Castle, though, really does it for me. That is some imposing music.  Edit: Links (huehuehue)"
truezelda,2wyr46,dahahawgy,4,Tue Feb 24 07:05:48 2015 UTC,"The Ancient Cistern has my vote for best atmosphere. The framing of the music and imagery in Indian style around some really excellent level design, puzzle construction, and overall dungeon progression (the ""horror"" sequence at the bottom? epic.) which culminated in one of my favorite zelda bosses: Koloktos. It really was sublime.  Skyward Sword in general I find is pretty... underapreciated for the amount of artistic excellence in game design and atmosphere that it displays. It's one of my favorites."
truezelda,2wyr46,IAMYourReason,4,Mon Mar 2 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"For me, the best music is from the Forest Temple. Man, to this day that whole temple – the atmosphere, the music, its “theme”, the boss – everything is really well executed. I remember the first time I played the game; the Forest Temple gave me more chills than the Shadow Temple. There is something eerie about it, and most of this eeriness comes from the music. More than that, the narrative behind it is fantastic: you go there to rescue Saria. You go through the Lost Woods, which has that catchy music, and then BAM! eerie music starts. And this rapture of the music contributes to the overall feeling that we players have towards the Temple.  I really can’t decide about the best atmosphere, though. I mean, there are so many! The Forest Temple, the Fire Temple, the Spirit Temple, Ganon’s Castle, Arbiter’s Grounds, the Stone Tower Temple… so many! And this is a good thing.   It shows me that one of the most unique things about the Zelda games is how well made the dungeons are. You never feel like you are in Random Dungeon #6 or #7 or whatever. No, each and every dungeon has its own “feel”. They are unique. I really can’t think of any game that has such a charming sort of dungeons as the Zelda franchise."
truezelda,2wyr46,TrueLegendsNeverDie,4,Tue Feb 24 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"Great Bay Temple. The music is cold, metallic, and disorienting which contributes to the already cold, metallic, and disorienting nature of the temple quite well."

truezelda,2wyr46,njozzy,2,Tue Feb 24 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"It's fresh in my mind because I only just recently played it, but the Skull Woods dungeon in A Link Between Worlds did a fantastic job."

truezelda,2wyr46,gresslok,2,Thu Feb 26 15:40:32 2015 UTC,I thought the Bottom of the Well/Shadow Temple fit the dungeon the best. Not that I think it was the best stand alone music in Zelda.

truezelda,2wrdhy,Nickerdoodle,18,Sun Feb 22 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for a hero mode at least, optional difficulty would of been great."
truezelda,2wrdhy,njozzy,7,Sun Feb 22 17:07:17 2015 UTC,I really wish they would've done a Master's Quest or Hero's Mode type thing this time around. Majora's Mask is already known as one of the more challenging Zelda's and if they had of added a second quest or harder difficulty then this would of set the game over the top. The more I think of it Majora was like Zelda's version of Dark/Demon Souls and I wish they would've added a extra difficulty to make it feel more like those games.  Don't get me wrong I love L.o.Z. for what it is but it would've of worked but only for Majora's Mask in particular.
truezelda,2wrdhy,MetroAndroid,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"I would say Zelda 2 is Zelda's Dark Souls, especially with some of the dumbing down they did in MM3D (like making the floating platforms in Deku Palace not move until you land on them ESPECIALLY when they fixed the camera angle, so it's much easier to see where you will land)."
truezelda,2wrdhy,Neskuaxa,16,Mon Jun 8 09:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'm about half way through the great bay area, and I think the only changes I don't really like, is the Zora mask swimming controls. Everything else has been pretty great, albeit I have not started the Anju and Kafei side quest yet."
truezelda,2wrdhy,TheOriginalDovahkiin,14,Sun Feb 22 16:27:06 2015 UTC,I really dislike the Zora swimming controls too because I cannot dolphin dive in the 3Ds for shit. Trying to get the heart piece in the moons water level was such an awful time for me and I never want to do that again
truezelda,2wrdhy,knuxo,8,Sun Feb 22 17:25:06 2015 UTC,I hated that so much I kept diving bad and going all the way back to the start. I don't know why they changed the swimming.
truezelda,2wrdhy,IchTuDirWeh,7,Sun Feb 22 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"I actually ended up crying slightly from how frustrated I got because I had the same problem, like, if they didn't make it time based with the door, it would of been so much easier"
truezelda,2wrdhy,Neskuaxa,2,Mon Feb 23 00:15:34 2015 UTC,Racing the Beavers was the hardest part of the whole game.
truezelda,2wrdhy,IchTuDirWeh,8,Mon Mar 2 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"The Anju and Kafei quest is much easier now. Mostly due to permanent save points, and being able to use The Song of Double Time to go to a specific time now.   Also the controls for swimming are different but if your beef with them has to do with the magic speed boost and dolphining then there's a simple solution to that. If you only use the burst for a split second it won't consume any magic and will shoot you straight out of the water if you're swimming upwards and you'll flop out just as gracefully as a dolphin if you do this when you are near the top of the water.  EDIT: Meant if not is in that last sentence."
truezelda,2wrdhy,seiriyu,3,Mon Feb 23 00:01:47 2015 UTC,I also dislike the sparkles on the water. They also changed the freezing mechanic :/
truezelda,2wrdhy,seiriyu,2,Tue Feb 24 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"I just finished the GBT last night, It helped a bit, but I wish they'd let you freeze where ever like before. I loved the changes to the Boss though, it made the fight much less mundane."
truezelda,2wrdhy,qwoodmansee,2,Wed Feb 25 00:19:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I love the boss changes and pretty much everything else. Those are my only two gripes with the game so far. Currently collecting as many heart pieces as I can before stone tower. Still got a bit to do.   Some things I really like are small like how they shortened the deku business scrub cutscene
truezelda,2wrdhy,Serbaayuu,10,Wed Feb 25 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't need the Zora swimming changes, the extra bottle, or the boss strategy changes... But I really wanted them to speed up the Elegy of Emptiness sequence. I really hoped it would be like Wind Waker HD's Command Melody, where if you played it once in the dungeon, all subsequent times you played it, the ""You've played the Command Melody"" text wouldn't come up and you'd just get the result of the song. Playing Elegy of Emptiness, seeing the text pop up, and then having to wait for the animation of getting the stone figures is just so time consuming."
truezelda,2wrdhy,unkind_throwaway,5,Sun Feb 22 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"They did speed it up, after you play the song when it's doing the animation of Link cloning, if you press A or B you can move again, you don't need to stand still throughout the whole scene anymore... of course, you still have to play it lots but that change was nice"
truezelda,2wrdhy,Rew4Star,-1,Sun Feb 22 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"That was it being sped up? Jesus, I guess it's been a while since I played the N64 version, but I don't know how I dealt with an even slower process. I guess I was just spoiled by the significantly quicker WWHD sequences, and expected something similar in MM3D."
truezelda,2wrdhy,Way_Of_The_Garo,9,Sun Feb 22 22:49:40 2015 UTC,"I would have liked some more changes as well, but I think it is specific to Majora's Mask. Massive changes in OoT, for instance, would make me more upset. I think this is mainly because of how special OoT is to me as a game, and also they spent so much time making it that I think they made a lot of it ""perfect"" so to speak.  MM on the other hand, is a great and BRILLIANT game. But they only spent a year or two making it, right? Surely after all these years they must have thought of some really nice changes to add. In fact I think we see some of them in the current remake. I'm sure there are more though that didn't make it to stay true to the original game. As with any game additions, I prefer additive to destructive. Add a new item but don't replace an old one, that way we can decide whether we want to use it or not. Make the Zora have some new swim abilities but don't destroy the original...   On another note, One wish I had is that they would make made changes which make the game easier optional. I know they did a decent job of that in this remake (we aren't forced to talk to the help stones, etc.) but so far (I'm two temples in) I have felt kind of babied through the game. Maybe choose the notebook style at the beginning of the game, and maybe choose classic or new boss battles. I figure that would probably be a decent amount of code to write though, maybe more than is even worth it to add such a feature.   Tl;dr That's my opinion. I like really like optional and additive changes. And I agree that there should have been some more of those :)"
truezelda,2wrdhy,Crim_drakenya,2,Sun Feb 22 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"maybe more than is even worth it to add such a feature.   Casuals sell games, especially on handhelds; unless you're specifically marketing toward people who want hard games, there's no reason to make it hard.  Which is why every game in the past decade is mind-numbingly easy."
truezelda,2wrdhy,WhereAreTheBears,2,Sun Feb 22 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"There's a market for ""hard"" games, such as the Souls franchise. But there's a reason the Souls series stands out in that regard....it's unusual for a game to avoid the handholding and casual friendly gameplay, so the titles really stand out as a niche in modern gaming."

Man, just thinking of that epic battle gets my fan boy adrenaline going."
truezelda,2wrdhy,MarvinGarbanzo,3,Mon Feb 23 00:10:10 2015 UTC,Does anybody have a link to a video or something summarizing these new little changes?
truezelda,2wrdhy,IThoughtThisWasDigg,2,Sun Feb 22 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's perfect man, and had they of changed and/or added anything more they might of crossed the line and ticked off some of the fanbase. I really enjoy the fishing aspect they added as well; there is a new Easter Egg in there that is awesome. I have yet to accomplish catching it yet though; it's become my Moby Dick and I'm the crazy captain who won't quit chasing it even though the moons gonna come down in fifteen minutes and kill everybody.  Man, I love this game."
truezelda,2wrdhy,IronPandemonium,2,Sun Feb 22 23:57:29 2015 UTC,This game needs more masks and more side quests. The bomber's notebook is fun to populate in the original and challenging. It would make sense to build upon it even further and have even more stuff you can do.
truezelda,2wrdhy,TennisEnnis19,3,Tue Feb 24 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"I would have been happy with any of these changes:  A. A ""Master Quest"" type of addition like they did with OoT  B. Added length to the dungeons  C. An extra dungeon at the end; either between Stone Tower and Majora, or unlocked after the Majora battle.  I know these may take a lot of work and potentially change the design of the game, but they would have made me happy since I loved the Master Quest in OoT. Made the playthrough feel fresh and like a new game. MM had excellent dungeons but too few of them IMO."
truezelda,2wrdhy,SimplisticBiscuit,2,Sun Feb 22 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Most of the changes I would have made wouldn't have taken a great deal of time, a month maybe. It's all nitpicks mostly. Some of the new effects sound like they belong in Skyward Sword, both in style and in sample rate. They clash against the use of original sound effects. This is something I would have thrown a couple guys at during the polishing stages.  Overall map geometry needed an update, and it really didn't get it in some places, though they did a lot more than they did in OoT3D. The most glaring examples are slopes with stair textures plastered on them. One in particular is the staircase in the Romani house, which isn't even scaled properly to the length of the slope. That may sound like a minor complaint, but it crops up quite a few times, and it means somebody on the dev team went ""ya that's fine whatever moving on"". I'll give them credit for some areas getting an update specifically to natural terrain to make it more natural, but it unfortunately wasn't consistent.  A notable example of the above issue is the moving of the banker. I'm...not entirely sure why he (she?) was moved, and I don't have any serious attachment to his original position, but I do think it would have been better if they just left him because they didn't bother to do anything with the expanded South Clock Town. He's just a guy sitting in the middle of an empty nowhere. Besides that, it made a lot more sense for him to be in either West or East Clock Town, since those are the two places in town you can actually spend rupees. Not sure why he was moved to South Clock Town.  And my most minor of nitpicks: the loading icon. I just find it grating to have a loading icon that doesn't really need to be there. When it's not there, unless there is a particularly long delay between areas, I don't feel that the world is chopped up. When it's there for even half a second though, I do.  I'm sure if I sat down and spent the time on it, I could nitpick MM3D all day, down to every misaligned texture and slightly out-of-place effect in the game."

truezelda,2wsovw,TinyEnemyShrimp,2,Tue Feb 24 06:02:14 2015 UTC,"I started to come around with it when I realized it helped with the gameplay mechanics, then fell in love about a quarter of the way through the game. It was a pretty big change but the controversy got people talking about it and it was a gamble that paid off."
truezelda,2wsovw,lord_owen,2,Sun Mar 1 23:33:49 2015 UTC,That was not an easy time for the Nintendo defenders. I.E just me.

truezelda,2wsovw,Jammintk,2,Mon Feb 23 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Space World wasn't so obscure a few years ago. That used to be Nintendo's big expo for showing off all their latest games and consoles. They occasionaly do something similar now a few months before the release of a new console generation, although it no longer goes under the name of Space World."
truezelda,2wsovw,malaroo,2,Mon Feb 23 13:51:45 2015 UTC,"I've been pretty involved with GDC for the past few years. Nintendo got the honor of doing the keynote speech for GDC's 25th anniversary in 2011, and instead of making it about the past 25 years of video game history, they turned it into a big ""aren't we so great!"" marketing thing. The people in charge of GDC were pretty pissed about this, and since then Nintendo's presence there has been greatly diminished. Usually, they just have a space on the Expo floor for their web framework, maybe a recruiter for NOA in the Career Pavilion, and a few people from there do talks, but that's it. They certainly didn't use GDC to make a hullabaloo about Skyward Sword, though they may have shown a couple things from it; I don't remember.  So no, I don't think we'll hear anything new about Zelda U at GDC; they might not even have the demo out to preview. Like another commentor said, GDC isn't for the public or press, and Nintendo doesn't usually have much of a presence there anyway."
truezelda,2wsovw,TinyEnemyShrimp,4,Tue Feb 24 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"Unlikely.  GDC is for game developers,  not for the press. I would want them to not announce anything just on principle for GDC. That kind of thing is better done at pax or e3"
truezelda,2wsovw,malaroo,3,Mon Feb 23 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"SS had a trailer revealed at GDC, but I still think it's pretty unlikely, because of how oddly tight-lipped they've been about this one.

This one has only seen a teaser, and extremely brief gameplay over the course of two years.  It doesn't even have a real trailer yet, and it's supposed to be released this year."
truezelda,2wor8t,Sphexus,46,Sat Feb 21 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'd probably say the Great Palace in Adventure of Link. You have to go through a gauntlet just to get to the place, it's a huge labyrinthine dungeon with fake floors (and walls?) so you have to know exactly what path to take or experiment a lot in order to get to the final bosses, and then you have to have almost full magic (and use up a lot of magic) to even be able to hurt the next-to-last boss. Then you have to go into the final battle with virtually no magic and no way to replenish your life from the previous battle."
truezelda,2wor8t,Petrichor03,11,Sat Feb 21 21:00:25 2015 UTC,the one upside is apparently if you get a game over after defeating Thunderbird youw on't have to face it again.

truezelda,2wor8t,keltond95,14,Sun Feb 22 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely Midora Palace from Zelda II. Even though it's only the second dungeons in the game, it's location being a considerable distance from the starting point (as well as the plethora of swamp you need to traverse to get into Midoro Palace) of the game means, unless you are decently skilled at Zelda II, you won't be arriving at Midoro Palace with full lives. Couple the long trek with the much stronger enemies Midoro Palace introduces and likely lack of magic and/or health at this point of the game, and Midoro Palace will consistently be the dungeon you don't look forward to.  Granted much of Midoro's Palace challenge comes from the trek to the dungeon and not the dungeon itself. That in mind, I'd say Skull Woods (ALttP) is the most challenging when looking at just the dungeon itself, if nothing else because having to constantly exit and re-enter the dungeon in the proper spot is rather obnoxious."
truezelda,2wor8t,JB1990,4,Sat Feb 21 20:32:49 2015 UTC,I agree with Skull Woods. I played it last night and got grabbed so many times by the wallmasters I almost did a controller throw

'Hug' the left wall/path of the dungeon, flipping anything along the way. Repeat on the right side. Return to the middle, walk forward, and beat the boss.

I didn't know that you had to grab him, so I knocked him down probably three times and just started to hit his tail. Something felt off about this, then I realized you could pick up the bolder. So the next time I knocked him down, I threw the boulder at him and completely missed. It was finally the next time I knocked him down that I was trying to get to the bolder quickly again, which happened to be in between him and I. As I was rolling over to it, I accidentally picked him up, finally figuring out how to damage him. I finished with half a heart. It was the first time I almost died in the game.

Because earlier I saw something about getting out of the water with Gyorg and now this ""new Twinmold fight""? Please tell me about this. I've beaten Odolwa and Goht on the 64 version, but no more than them."
truezelda,2wor8t,Zubat_Breeder,2,Mon Mar 2 08:27:49 2015 UTC,"In essence, each boss now has a weak spot that must be exposed before true damage can be dealt. The original mechanics still exist for all of the bosses, they are just changed somewhat.  Odowla: when burrowing in a deku flower, odowla will stop and look around for Link. This is your opportunity to drop a deku but on him while gliding. After that, he will crumple forward and his weak spot will be revealed for Link to shoot with the bow.  Goht: the fight is largely similar. When goht is knocked down (by goron-rolling into him) a large eye extends from his back and is his weak spot. It must be shot with the bow.  Gyorg: in the n64 version, gyorg could be stunned by shooting an arrow at him or by hitting him with the Zora Boomerangs. While stunned, he could be damaged by an attack from Zora link walking on the bottom of the pool or by Zora link's magic attack. In 3d the first part is largely the same as the old fight, except when stunned gyorg reveals a large eye. In the second phase, gyorg will force the central platform and sink. Water mines will spawn from the floor on chains. To stun gyorg in this half, you must cut the chain on a water mine close to the boss while he's sucking in water.  Twinmold is the most different. In 64, Twinmold could be damaged by hitting either of the worms' heads or tails with arrows or with the sword as Giant Link (wearing the giants mask simply makes you much bigger) in 3d, the red worm isnt vulnerable at the start and will simply attack you. The blue worm has a number of target to be shot with the bow (I used light arrows out of habit) when all targets are hit, he falls and will reveal a weak spot to be shot with the bow. after the blue one is destroyed, the giants mask spawns in a chest and is the only way to beat the red one. As giant link, the red worm must be punched quite a few times before he falls to the ground. If he burrows, the hit counter is reset. He can be immediately stunned by throwing a huge boulder at him, but the boulder breaks on impact and another one doesn't spawn. While stunned, you can approach the end of the tail or his head and press a to do a canned animation and some damage. You must do this 4 times to defeat it."
truezelda,2wor8t,Grantus89,1 point,Mon Mar 2 09:19:01 2015 UTC,You have to get your magic meter upgraded in this game. You get it from a side quest which is a questionable design choice but it's a fairly easy one that's hard to miss that is also near the beginning(first dungeon to be exact). If you don't do this then you'll only have a quarter of the magic power you're supposed to.  However you could just also get a bottle of Chateau Romani and use infinite magic. If you do though I'd advise getting multiple bottles.

truezelda,2wor8t,TennisEnnis19,4,Sat Feb 28 19:27:26 2015 UTC,Of the games I remember right off hand due to playing them all the time I would have to say shadow temple in OoT and stone tower temple in MM  I really should get around to finishing TP and SS

The water temple isn't even that difficult. I've beaten it without a strategy guide plenty of times. It really isn't all that hard. I have more trouble with the stone tower temple in Majora's Mask. THAT is a somewhat difficult temple. Not the water temple.  edit: Spelling"
truezelda,2wor8t,Serbaayuu,7,Sat Feb 21 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"I think the thing isn't so much the ""difficulty"" of the water temple, so much as the absurd tedium of using the boots in the original N64 version of the game, which then made the dungeon itself feel pretty terrible.  The 3DS version makes significant improvements in this regard, with better inventory management and controls."
truezelda,2wor8t,Serbaayuu,2,Sat Feb 21 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly find Jabu Jabu's Belly to be actually more truly difficult, the water temple is just annoying."
truezelda,2wnzdl,bacloldrum,19,Sat Feb 21 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda game, probably my favorite of all video games, but I can understand why a lot of people disliked it. For me, the ""flaws"" the game had never really bothered me. People claimed that sailing was too slow and boring, but I personally loved it, and once you got the Song of Gales (I believe that's the name, whichever one let's you teleport), you only had to sail around for a minute or two at a time, hardly an inconvenience. People hated the Triforce hunt, because it was tedious and clearly padding for an otherwise short game. I do agree that it was clearly padding, but I enjoyed that section because that was the point where the world was fully opened to you, and it was the best time to explore. People complained because of the lack of dungeons, but I thought each dungeon was creative and aesthetically pleasing, plus Majora's Mask was worse in this regard, having only four dungeons.  Then on top of my more personal feelings, there's the stuff that a lot of us can agree on. Great characters, great music, a fun and colorful artstyle, an interesting setting, an awesome story, probably the best iteration of Ganondorf the series has ever seen, and some pretty cool side quests, namely the Nintendo Gallery.  But yeah, aside from all that, I can understand why people dislike this game, but I guess I just never had a problem with those aspects myself."
truezelda,2wnzdl,TheHynusofTime,10,Sat Feb 21 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"Sweet baby Jesus was Ganondorf epic in WW. He may have been a pretty easy boss ( in what is probably the easiest Zelda, nonetheless ), but everything about him and his fight was badass.  He was just so... human. And those two katanas were to die for!"
truezelda,2wnzdl,mkol,6,Sun Feb 22 08:13:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, Ganondorf makes a fantastic tragic villain. And while Wind Waker is definitely on the easier side of things, I wouldn't say it was the easiest Zelda game. Both A Link Between Worlds and Twilight Princess were much easier in comparison, at least in my opinion."
truezelda,2wnzdl,TheHynusofTime,5,Sun Feb 22 08:16:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say that ALBW was much harder than WW, especially when you take Hero Mode into consideration. While it simply changed some aesthetics in WW, ALBW was HARD, particularly the beginning. Three hearts was nothing in the Eastern Palace.  Oh well. To each his own!"
truezelda,2wnzdl,mkol,6,Sun Feb 22 08:44:02 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, it took Hero Mode to make ALBW hard. Just the vanilla game was extremely easy."
truezelda,2wnzdl,TheHynusofTime,3,Sun Feb 22 08:54:46 2015 UTC,"Well said. It really depends on what kind of gamer you are.   I always used sailing in WW as a way of meditating, which may sound kinda weird but there are plenty of fast paced, instant gratification video games out there. I think it's nice to have games where you can be reflective and not have to think about anything.   WW nails that for me and which is why it's my favorite Zelda title as well.   EDIT: I have a friend whose favorite game is WW and he says the game doesn't take itself too seriously. It's just simply fun. Gave me more reasons to love it."
truezelda,2wnzdl,dustyn_echoes,2,Sun Feb 22 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a week kate, but you're not slone, WW was AWESOME! and is still my favorite Zelda game."
truezelda,2wnzdl,skrimpstaxx,26,Mon Mar 2 05:39:06 2015 UTC,"I don't get how you see the sea as boring. There are dozens of islands to that you never really NEED to visit. They're there for exploration and loot. I think the Great Sea is much, much more interesting that any variation of Hyrule Field we've gotten recently. Twilight Princess made the Field as pretty and Big as I could ask for, but there wasn't much reason to dismount and wander off the trails."
truezelda,2wnzdl,TRB1783,10,Sat Feb 21 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"The sea is boring for me because it's so huge with islands so few and far between.  Most of the islands were essentially a reworked version of the holes from OoT and MM.  They generally didn't have much to offer other than charts, rupees, spoils items, or the occasional heart piece.  There might be quantity but I just don't see the quality.  Where are the incentives to explore?  It's just not fun for me and I find myself wondering what everyone else sees in it."
truezelda,2wnzdl,athanc,3,Sun Feb 22 04:39:09 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion and can understand where you're coming from. Yes there is quantity but every island isn't really quality. There aren't many towns to visit and most of it is just open sea. Allow me to tell you what I like about WW:  The game starts you off as a child in his pyjamas. You're a kid enjoying a regular day and you live with your family and everything is as calm as I recall my summer days. All of a sudden, an adventure presents itself and the legend unfolds.  I love the idea that you're truly a kid and the visuals have a kid-like aesthetic to it. The colors are vibrant and its like the imagination of a child conjuring up these wild quests like a dragon on a volcano and bird people and this world trapped underneath the ocean. You set sail with pirates and fight evil and it's pure adventure.  I loved Wind Waker because I felt like I child playing as a child in the imagination of a child. WW link was fast and nimble and easily the most fluid moving of all to date. His face was expressive and I felt like it was just a freaking cool take on the series that was a really nice transition after the Hero of Time games of OOT and MM.  There was no moment that made me feel like I was sucked into the legend more than the master sword reveal.   The islands were okay and the ocean was whatever (I hate boats lol) but for me the experience was really feeling like a child again in a world that was beautifully painted and conveyed."
truezelda,2wnzdl,squeezyphresh,3,Mon Mar 2 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"The islands are so small that you can basically just make a map on paper and write down what item(s) you think you need if you don't have it yet and return later. Technically you can do that in a normal overworld but it is made much, MUCH easier and more efficient to do that on the grid-like island overworld in WW.  On top of this, the sailing itself is pretty boring."
truezelda,2wnzdl,PwnosaurrusRexx,6,Sun Feb 22 02:32:34 2015 UTC,"I like windwaker, but not nearly as much as most Zelda fans. Most people would rand it #1 or #2, but it might just be on the bottom of the 3D Zelda list for me.  I liked exploring islands and finding extras by myself, but overall the game tends to be more tedious and unrewarding (and this is coming from a guy who loves MM). I think most people like the game for it's style and story. I kind of recommend just playing through the main quest and ignore side questing altogether."
truezelda,2wnzdl,squeezyphresh,2,Sat Feb 21 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"Same! MM might be my favorite Zelda.  I spent an unspeakable amount of time on the side and mask quests.  I explored everything that game has to offer, but when it comes to Wind Waker I just feel really indifferent."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Phoxxent,1 point,Sat Feb 21 16:54:18 2015 UTC,I'd say WW is within my top ten but FAARR from my top two. Maybe its the third top of the 3D Zeldas.  Wind Waker was an excellent game but I enjoyed Majora's Mask and Skyward Sword leagues more.

Every opportunity I get, I find myself playing the game.   However, WW was the sole exception to this. For once, my enthusiasm playing the game was so low, it took me close to 5 months to get myself to complete it. People laud the overworld, but  it just seems lazy to me. So much distance between uninteresting islands made it a pain to navigate. I found myself missing the grand and epic scale that galloping through Hyrule had, and sailing just didn't cut it for me. Of all the 3D Zelda games, it is by far my least favorite. However, I still enjoyed playing it, but it just doesn't reach the caliber that Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and Ocarina of Time did for me."

truezelda,2wnzdl,Thehyliancats,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"Also, in my opinion, the music in OoT was so much more ""adverture-y"" than the music in WW. Maybe that's not the right word for it but there was something about the music in OoT, it was really immersive and everything."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, the music has a profound impact on the atmosphere. I can't remember my first experience sailing in WW, but I can never forget the first time I walked out onto Hyrule Field in OoT, even though that was 3 and half years ago as opposed to WW being 1 year ago."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Thehyliancats,2,Sun Feb 22 06:52:05 2015 UTC,"Dude, MM's over world was much smaller than OOTs . And for it being barren, that is completely false. There were big poes plus using the stone of agony to find secrets that were hidden in the map. You can't blame it for being small because it was breaking the N64's limit at the time as well as being Nintendo's biggest game."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,3,Sun Feb 22 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"You're correct, MM's Termina Field was much smaller than OoT's Hyrule Field, and it was that much better for it!  They put everything that needed to be out in the field in there, and didn't leave a bunch of extra space.  That is the correct way to do that.  OoT Hyrule Field is boring and empty as shit.  You can clear 10 big poes in a few minutes once you know where they are, and there are only like 2 hidden holes in the field with Gold Skulltulas in them."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Thehyliancats,-1,Sun Feb 22 04:24:48 2015 UTC,"Termina field was ugly as hell, even on the 3ds. As soon as you leave one of the clock town exits, it only takes a gallop from epona to get to one of the areas, and another gallop to get to another area. Termina field was small and compact but it didn't feel as good as the other overworlds.   Also to mention, the GameCube was much more powerful than the N64 so it could make a larger over world which was the great sea and add a lot more content such as bigoctos.   There are more than 2 hidden holes on the field. The main purpose of Hyule field was galloping on Epona, so that's why its so big. And besides there were more secrets in then other areas like Death Mountain and Zora's domain. You are a silly billy if you think OOT is short on secrets."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"in other areas like Death Mountain and Zora's River   So, not part of the field.  Similar to the Southern Swamp, Faron Woods, and so on...   the main purpose was galloping on Epona   That's not really fun."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Thehyliancats,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:45:44 2015 UTC,"That really depends on who. Most people on this sub love the fact about riding on Epona across Hyrule field. And when you say barren, I hope you are exaggerating, there are still secrets to uncover on Hyrule field."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Feb 22 04:49:46 2015 UTC,"Let's list them.  There are:   10 Big Poes which do not respawn and have no variation in their spawn locations 8 Hidden Holes:    Hole 1 has a Skulltula Nothing but trash loot Heart Piece Trash loot Gold Skulltula Fairy Fountain (a.k.a. trash) Heart Piece Trash loot   So, when you enumerate it all, there are a total of five points of interest across Hyrule Field.  The Poes and four secret holes with useful items in them.  There were more than five points of interest in Termina Field, and it was smaller and more compact.  OoT Hyrule Field is terrible because it was a wide-open space with nothing in it for massive stretches.  Oh, I suppose there's also the Running Man - finding him consists of running in a circle until you happen to encounter him.  Super exciting stuff."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Feb 22 05:02:15 2015 UTC,"As I said before, OOt's Hyrule field was to give the player the feeling of adventure of galloping through a huge field, the secrets for other areas such as Death mountian and Zora's domain.   Although I wasn't around when this game came out back in 1998, I'm guessing everyone was floored by the sheer hugeness of Hyrule field. This is a case of different strokes for different folks."
truezelda,2wnzdl,malaroo,2,Sun Feb 22 05:09:06 2015 UTC,"""Omg, it was awesome in 1998!"" is not an acceptable excuse.  We judge games on their merits, not how groundbreaking they were when they released."

truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,7,Sun Feb 22 00:38:56 2015 UTC,"I love it because it's got a big open world that you have to just sail through (mostly) peacefully.  I hate the Swift Sail, never used it even in my 100% NG+ playthrough of HD.  And the fact that most of the game's islands aren't required to beat the game, so you can just wander off into the edges of the Sea Chart to find cool stuff for hours.  The Triforce Quest is my favorite part of the original game because it forces you to do that.  Go into the Great Sea, sail around, find stuff on islands with mini-challenges."
truezelda,2wnzdl,fullmetalraz,1 point,Sun Feb 22 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"But the swift sail is great because I can just aimlessly go. I don't have to think about which direction I want to go, I just go. Yeah, you could sort of do that with the old sail, but I found that was more ""on my way to dragon roost, ooh what's over there?"" and then ""woo! beat the game, never touching this save again!"" while the swift sail can still do ""on my way to dragon roost, ooh what's over there?"" but it also does ""I'm bored, let's just sail around and see what we find"". And that is much more in the spirit of Zelda. Sure, you could make the case that you go too fast for it to be used for anything except going places, and that would be true. However, it's just way more of a convenience to not have to plan this stuff out."
truezelda,2wnzdl,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Feb 22 11:08:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like being able to do that.  The Wind Waker is the tool to control the wind, not a sail."

It also should be mentioned that my favorite boss fight in the game is still upcoming after you collect the triforce charts. Which I would say is easily the worst section of the game.    Also the side quests on windfall island are my favorite Zelda side quests apart from majoras mask, which is my favorite game of all time so tough to beat.

The last time I had that experience was with SC2 and ST, both of which made me want to marathon the campaign.), but when I play it the  style and atmosphere really sucks me in and immerses me. The sound design makes every action feel rewarding, and the unique music is just plain awesome. It makes me want to keep playing it, because it feels so fun to play. Whenever I see a wind waker character on the internet I do a double take. I don't understand the frankly quite profound effect the style had on me."

I really appreciate the story and over world, but for those who love dungeons I can see how it can feel lacking.   I feel that WWHD really polished a few of the rough edges that the original had and made me appreciate the game even more."
truezelda,2wnzdl,ximenez,2,Sat Feb 21 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'm playing through it on Wii U for the first time in HD. I'm still loving it. I'm not as patient (nor have I as much free time) in regards to sailing long distances as I was 10+ years ago when I played it. Otherwise it's still a superb game. Amongst all Zelda games I've played, it's definitely in my top 2.

Killed Helmaroc King in a day, day two I got through the two temples, and then I had to find the Triforce, and I lost all interest. BUT one thing about this whole section of the game is that, like other commenters have said, you can explore. What I did was go from island to island starting with one corner until I had explored every island and filled up my map. This is a great opportunity to try and 100% the game, and exploring all the islands contributes to the quest you're stuck in. Maybe this didn't help much, and if it didn't, you can always do what I did and start the game over."

There were not enough true dungeons when compared to other Zelda games. 2 sages instead of 7. The ""other world"" of old Hyrule was tiny.

The Wind Waker is my second least favorite 3D Zelda game (Skyward Sword taking the top--or should I say bottom--spot 'cause of it's excessive handholding and lack of exploration) despite it offering the best environment for exploration in my eyes.  The things that I really love in The Wind Waker:   The artstyle - I admit that when the game was released I was bit disappointed how it looked so different than OOT and MM but after I started to actually play the game, I quickly fell in love with the artstyle. I think that the artstyle is a perfect fit for the game's world and it has way more character and expression than any other Zelda game (even more than Skyward Sword). The characters - TWW has some of the best characters of the whole series. They are expressful and have clear, enjoyable personalities (even though Tetra gets kinda downplayed later in the game..). The exploration - I think TWW offers the most enjoyable environment to explore out of all 3D Zelda games. The world is bright, colorful and vast. The sailing music is one of my favorite Zelda themes ever. Sailing in TWW felt enjoyable and relaxing where as riding Epona (or loftwing or being in wolf form)  made me feel like I was in a hurry to get somewhere most of the time.   These are the things that I absolutely adore in TWW. Unfortunately there are couple things that really bring the game down for me:   The difficulty level - Zelda games aren't generally known for their difficulty but usually they still offer enjoyable challenge. TWW never did that to me though. The game was extremely easy from start to finish. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for everyone (TWW was the only Zelda game one of my friends had ever managed to beat and it made the game feel that much more fun and satisfying to him) and while I'm certainly not saying that Zelda games should aim for Dark Souls level of difficulty, I still want to feel at least some level of challenge in games I play to feel satisfied by the experience. The dungeons - I honestly can't remember much of the dungeons in the game and none of the bosses aside from Puppet Ganon + Ganondorf have stuck to my mind. TWW dungeons were really unmemorable for me and that is a bit of a letdown in my books. The Great Sea - I know this will sound very contradicting 'cause I love sailing in TWW but I wish that the sea itself had had a bit more to offer. I'm not even sure what exactly would have been good content to add to it but after exploring a square in the map I never felt any need to visit it again unless a quest demanded it. It basically turned to additional ""unnecessary"" piece of water that I had to travel through. Despite loving sailing, it felt like a chore at times. The side quests - There isn't really that much wrong with the quests themselves but rather with their lackluster rewards. Especially the mask that showed enemies health bars (the quest to get it was quite long too if I remember correctly). It sounded cool, but wasn't exactly good looking and it was pretty useless as most enemies would die from 1-2 hits anyway (and I'm not even sure if the mask was even usable on bosses). Coming from OOT and MM, the side quests and their rewards just felt like ""meh"".   TL;DR: I love the feeling of the game but the actual game part of it felt lackluster and at times tedious to me compared to other 3D Zeldas.  Edit: Sorry for the spam. My phone said that it failed to send the reply but instead it seemingly DID send it each time I retried sending it (despite giving error each time)."

When it first was released, the art style bummed me, but then after playing it, I feel in love with it. it was perfect for WW."

truezelda,2wnzdl,jmazala,1 point,Sun Feb 22 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the part where you have to sneak around Ganondorf's island fortress. Other than that, it pretty much just felt like a chore to me. I think it is because I found it so darn easy. I never really had to think about anything I was doing. I caught a fairy in a bottle early on and there it remained until the end of the game. Having to carry people around with me through the dungeons irritated me as well. In addition, the non-dungeon parts of the game were uninteresting to me. I just didn't care about the world very much."
truezelda,2wnzdl,The_First_Mimzy,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of exploration. This is why I love so many Nintendo games. Pikmin, LoZ, Metroid and Pokemon have big vast worlds that have many secrets and paths. Each of these games requires you to re-visit areas after you have upgraded equipment (or in Pikmin's case, different Pikmin types) in order to reach a new path.    To go along with that, exploration is also why I love MineCraft. There's always a new place to explore and something new to see.  Wind Waker does what other Zelda games don't: Treasure Hunting. I'm not saying you can't look for secrets in other Zelda games, but in WW you're given treasure charts and if you have the sea chart mapped out by your fishy friends, you can try your hand at sunken treasure.   It's fun finding a treasure chart in a dungeon chest or even through character's as side quests. Then you look at your sea chart and try to recognize the island shapes to where your potential booty lies.    I understand that the game can lag at times with the amount of sailing that takes place (that's fixed in the WW HD release though) but I still love seeing islands fade in and out as you pass them-- how the Tower of the Gods can be seen from almost anywhere on the map due to its massive size."

To me it just felt clunky and it took a lot of work and time to just navigate the map. On top of that, the map just felt kind of empty. It had some cool ideas, but to me it is no where near as good A OoT, MM or TP."

truezelda,2wha3f,Tsurii897,10,Thu Feb 19 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"For sure. But, if you have Epona and a bow before the green tunic, I feel they must have another big reveal.

truezelda,2wha3f,grntplmr,4,Thu Feb 19 23:20:03 2015 UTC,I doubt they would go out of their way to make a tunic that's NOT at all like the green one and then show it off in all the footage if they intended the green tunic to be with you early in the game. That wouldn't make sense.

truezelda,2wha3f,SquishMitt3n,1 point,Fri Feb 20 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"For sure. But, if you have Epona and a bow before the green tunic, I feel they must have another big reveal.   I have a feeling that the green tunic is going to be treated as a mid-game upgrade, similar to the Master Sword. Perhaps after the obligatory mid-game plot twist (which I hope they do away with in favor of something less predictable, but you get what I'm saying), in addition to getting the Master Sword, you get the Hero's Tunic."
truezelda,2wha3f,xwatchmanx,4,Fri Feb 20 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a gimmick though. ""Epona"" has been a staple in 3D Zelda games, taking alternate forms as various other transportation methods (the king of red lions, that dumb bird thing, etc) in some cases. Faster transportation is pretty much standard and no longer a gimmick.  A gimmick would be a new item that they show off for the sake of ""wow factor."" In fact, OP saying ""not controls"" is stupid, because more often than not controls are where the gimmicks are. Ala skyward sword."
truezelda,2wha3f,Knoxisawesome,7,Thu Feb 19 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"I guess gimmick was really the wrong word, and I loved the bird. Was meaning more of a theme or gameplay mechanic. We will probably get a ""magic"" mirror or camera or something with the gamepad."

truezelda,2wha3f,cesclaveria,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"Damn, I forgot about that! Its just a random drop from enemies, right? Also, the bullet time shown has a sinilar effect, but whats up with the magic meter in the demo, then? You could be in to something..."
truezelda,2wha3f,AspiringRacecar,3,Fri Feb 20 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"Back then yes, it was just a random drop that freeze'd enemies in place for a short time. However, there is so much you could do around 'time' that LoZ has never done, despite having a 'hero of time' and having time travel be a reoccurring plot point in several games.    Namely : manipulation of time We always just travel back and forth through time, and in MM we can slow it down and 'skip' through parts, but we never have had something like being able to slow enemies down (or speed ourselves up depending on perspective I guess) or even something like maybe being able to rewind small parts of time, almost prince of persia style.    I mostly came up with the ""time freeze"" idea thanks to the clock item in Hyrule warriors tbh And I just remembered that we did see a ""frozen time"" moment before, namely in Windwaker with the seal over the monsters in sunken hyrule... Who knows, we might see time manipulation in the next game    but it could just as easily just be an archery 'technique' involving high reflexes"
truezelda,2wha3f,AspiringRacecar,3,Fri Feb 20 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome thoughts! I forgot about Prince of Persia and that dagger or whatever, that could be neat. I also love this idea because of the musical element in Zelda. You ever slow down a record? Changes everything, maybe new ""instrument"" could be a metronome. Thats kind of like a clock and kind of like an instrument. Anyway, you got me thinking :)"
truezelda,2wha3f,NeuroCavalry,2,Fri Feb 20 04:38:58 2015 UTC,There is another small 'time freeze' moment. In Phantom Hourglass the final boss fight lets you stop time to hit his weak point.

truezelda,2wha3f,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"My theory is since Skyward Sword gave the origin story of the master sword, here with the large focus on archery, we could see the origin of a certain other weapon that almost always used in conjunction with the master sword to defeat Ganon. A certain, mythical luminious weapon..."
truezelda,2wha3f,benoxxxx,2,Fri Feb 20 03:27:42 2015 UTC,"Damn I really hope we get a story that isn't just ""Origin Story Checklist #82"" this time.  You don't need an entire epic centered around every single item in the series.  Doing one for the Master Sword was fine.  Let's leave it at that and just say the Light Arrows are ""powerful divine magic""."
truezelda,2wha3f,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:02:14 2015 UTC,"Besides Light arrows, isnt the Heros bow sort of a fabled weapon like the MS? Maybe made out of ancient tech and time stones..."
truezelda,2wha3f,AspiringRacecar,2,Fri Feb 20 03:55:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's just a dearly beloved bow. The only thing special about it is whoever owned it previously. However, there is the light bow in Spirit Tracks, as well as the silver arrows from the first few games."

Archery is probably my favorite thing to do in video games and Zelda is my favorite series, I have always loved using the bow on Zelda games but some other games have implemented it much better... an archery focused Zelda would be ideal for me.

They would be a little like a combination of MM's masks and TWW's Fishmen.  A second world, a large connected underground, and/or multiple mounts (this could go with my first idea) would also be great.  I'm not sure what I actually expect, though. I guess the three above seem the most likely, if there really is a ""gimmick."""

This time, we’ve brought back Link’s horse, Epona, and his bow and arrow, but what we’ve decided is really fun is being able to freely walk around in this world and choose what you want to do and how you want to explore. I can’t talk much about it, but one of the things we’re working on right now is that, as you play, the world will change and be affected by what you choose to do.""   Source"

Imaging a temple that has you blowing up pillars and magically rebuilding them in order to solve puzzles. In the over-world you could blow holes in the sides of mountains, or craters in the ground, or knock down trees, and they'd stay that way until you chose to reverse it."
truezelda,2wha3f,creative_sparky,2,Sat Feb 21 00:47:13 2015 UTC,That would be a cool game mechanic to base an entire game around.

truezelda,2wha3f,henryuuk,4,Fri Feb 20 04:19:49 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it might be more ancient robot/technology-based. The arrow and the enemy with a laser scream that to me. Game Xplain also noticed that Epona has saddle bags and a rolled up blanket. So maybe more traveling and camping?
truezelda,2wha3f,henryuuk,5,Fri Feb 20 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, awesome! I hadnt thought of that, I love that boss from the cistern, and Twilight realm seemed pretty scifi. Camping could be sweet, like saving the game, changing between day and night. Now I hope we get a banjo or something :)"

truezelda,2wha3f,noopenusernames,6,Fri Feb 20 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"Fast travel destroys open worlds.  It turns them from open worlds into a closed series of points of interest.  Obviously there is going to be some form of it, because if there isn't the casuals will cry, but I hope it's in the form where you can access some form of ""teleporter"" out in the overworld that connects several locations together, not something you can use whenever you want."
truezelda,2wha3f,Crim_drakenya,3,Fri Feb 20 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I definately agree. I'd love to be able to gallop around an open world, fighting roving bands of whatever, hunting poe, ect. I'd list like to do it without having to watch a food/sleep bar, or set up a camp and sit around for 10 minutes for a Blizzard to pass. It was fun in Skyrim, but I don't think that kind of thing would work in Zelda.  I totally agree about fast travel, though. I wasn't suggesting we should just fast travel everywhere."

truezelda,2wha3f,TedEmpty,-1,Fri Feb 20 17:48:02 2015 UTC,I blocked that one out of my memory :P
truezelda,2wha3f,samus1225,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:49:50 2015 UTC,"True, but I would also venture to say the instruments in the last few games - namely skyward sword and twilight princess - didn't make use of instruments to the same extent that say WW, OoT and MM did."
truezelda,2wha3f,grntplmr,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Skyward Sword's instrument was pretty lame. Seemed like just another way to implement motion controls. I really liked the howling statues in TP though. I guess music could have been a bigger part of that game."
truezelda,2wha3f,Phoxxent,2,Sat Feb 21 04:53:39 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that these are gimmicks because they are central plot points. Also I want an entity that assists  you and actually levels up or gets new abilities etc.
truezelda,2wha3f,yay855,2,Thu Feb 19 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I said gimmick for lack of a better word. It looks to me like we might be getting a horse and bow pretty early in the new one, so Im wondering what sort of theme will Nintendo come up with?"
truezelda,2wha3f,shoboy94,2,Thu Feb 19 22:29:26 2015 UTC,I'm thinking combat overall. The slow-mo arrow shooting might just be a taste of a new combat system. I'm all for it because holding sheild and pressing b has pretty much been the extent of combat this far and it's kinda getting old.
truezelda,2wha3f,Ninjuto,2,Thu Feb 19 23:56:13 2015 UTC,I think TP did a really good job on changing this up.

truezelda,2wha3f,metoharo,2,Fri Feb 20 05:23:56 2015 UTC,"In the first game ? You can do a couple out of order, but in some of the dungeons you find items that you need to reach other dungeons. for example : in one dungeon you find the raft, which is the only way to reach dungeon (I think) 4"

truezelda,2wha3f,Serbaayuu,2,Fri Feb 20 18:20:33 2015 UTC,"So far the gimmicks I can see so far: 1. Horse riding 2. Giant bosses in the over world 3. Random encounters and event in over world 4. Craftable weaponry (that arrow totally looks crafted from ancient tech) 5. Damageable environments possibly (at least by enemies) 6. Day night cycle being important 7.  Non-linear story  Though to be honest I don't see these as gimmicks. A gimmick to me is something like utilising motion controls or the fact a screen folds or has a touch screen.  So if we went really gimmicky.   Touch screen WII U game pad integration. This will include map, markers, inventory etc.   Also those saying that the world's size is being emphasised so much. I think this is more to compare an advancement of the hardware as each game has pushed the hardware to its limits with world size."

Anyway, just my thoughts, thanks for sharing yours."
truezelda,2wha3f,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Feb 20 09:50:09 2015 UTC,Yeah i'm all good using the gamepad for that. Totally works for me and seems almost what it was designed for.

Like, a Zelda game that connected the worlds of OoT and MM within one game and you could travel between both of those, but those maps together were still only a small piece of the overall map"

truezelda,2wha3f,magna_in_vitam,2,Fri Feb 20 02:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely interested in seeing more on ancient tech. I think this is an aspect of the Zelda franchise that has been latent for a while and I think is something that is going to explode in future Zelda games. I think its going to be a big plot twist for the entire series. We see it in MM, TP, SS, and from what I've heard, ST (and maybe PH?). I think whatever this ancient tribe is, its really going to change the balance of the Link-Ganon-Zelda triangle. The ancient tribe was supposedly really powerful, so I want to learn more about it in upcoming games."
truezelda,2wdumn,zerachielle,23,Thu Feb 19 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I believe it should be mostly new, perhaps based on one of the many backstories we've seen. I'd prefer it to be canon, assuming it's a good show. I think Zelda should definately be a major character, but I'm not sure about Link.  And once,  only once, will someone say, ""Well excuuuuse me, Princess"" in the snarkiest tone a human being can muster."
truezelda,2wdumn,GoshDarnBatman,34,Thu Feb 19 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"I think a prequel to OoT is the best backdrop for a TV show. Making it centered around Link would require either making a pretty bad lead for a TV show or making it unfaithful to the character.  Plus the Hyrulean Civil War would allow a backdrop that's interesting yet still unexplored, and would also feature some familiar faces."
truezelda,2wdumn,JFM2796,17,Thu Feb 19 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"When I heard stuff about being compared to a more family-friendly Game of Thrones, my mind immediately went to the Civil War. We could follow Ganondorf as he plays politics to wiggle his way into the royal court, while also using the Gerudo to increase anxieties between the factions at war.  In the end, a dying woman carries her child into a forest, where she's found by a child with a fairy."
truezelda,2wdumn,liquidDinner,2,Thu Feb 19 04:41:55 2015 UTC,I have goosebumps just thinking about that ending.
truezelda,2wdumn,SilentReflection101,9,Thu Feb 19 12:46:46 2015 UTC,maybe it could be about the seven year gap? maybe both? from the perspective of a knight that includes the time of link's young adventure?
truezelda,2wdumn,hyperhedgehog7,5,Thu Feb 19 04:43:31 2015 UTC,"maybe both?   Possibly the best I've seen yet. The first part of the series is from Ganondorf's perspective, as he tries to maneuver his way through the civil war and into the king's court, since we know, more or less, from Windwaker that he intended to use the Triforce to make the desert a lush and bountiful place (at least that's my interpretation) but then these two kids get in his way and he's denied the triforce. Then we switch PoV to a knight of Hyrule, someone who's been introduced and expanded on in the first half of the series, for the 7-year gap, watching Ganondorf descend into near-madness and destroy all of Hyrule. All we need to see of Link is him confronting Ganondorf then pulling the Master Sword, and then the final battle between the two."
truezelda,2wdumn,CaptianZaco,3,Thu Feb 19 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"Seeing things from Ganondorf's perspective would be refreshing. My favorite thing about Windwaker was that they finally gave him motivation beyond ""more power!"" They attempted to humanize the villain. Including Ganondorf as a main character could let us see some of the struggles of the Gerudo, his connection to them, and his desire to give them a better world.   Throughout the story, we see the power corrupt Ganondorf - rather than wanting to enrich the desert, be wants to bring the desert to the world. He goes from wanting to improve conditions for his own people to wanting to punish everybody else."
truezelda,2wdumn,liquidDinner,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"I really like the ganondorf idea...  or just centering the series around a big villain in general. Villains/anti-heroes seem to be all the rage lately (House of Cards, Breaking Bad, etc all seem to center around a main character who is pretty much a villain by the end of it..much like ganondorf, who started out with semi-relatable intentions and ended up a villain)"
truezelda,2wdumn,musicalfeet,0,Sun Mar 1 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"But do we need more Ganondorf?  Zelda as a series has so much room for stories that aren't GANON'S BACK BITCH. Imagine if lord of the rings was a video game series and 90% of the games were sauron coming back and the exact same protagonists fighting him in an identical manner to the first 5000 fights. This is part of the reason I think TP is a very good Zelda title-Ganondorf isn't even mentioned, and Zant is developed the entire game before Ganondorf is introduced as a Mcguffin. They really should have just kept Zant and developed him as a main villain, similar to how Ghirahim was developed as a main villain. What people don't understand is that Ghirahim's mission was clear from the beginning. He spent the entire game trying to revive his master-this much was pointed out multiple times throughout the game. That his master appeared at the end is not surprising because he clearly spent the game trying to revive him."
truezelda,2wdumn,Epicfaillord,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"I was extrapolating on the idea that the show could flesh out some of OoT's back story, or in-between stories. If it's the back story, Ganondorf's really one of the only characters who could be present for the Civil War, and I think his character could have a really interesting story to tell as his goals change him from being a savior to a punisher.  But you're right, there doesn't need to be a Ganon. There doesn't even need to be a Link or Zelda. We can get a really interesting story about any period of Hyrule and come out with really great content."
truezelda,2wdumn,liquidDinner,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"i would like to see this from zelda's POV. Going into hiding, become sheik, always on the run or doing little things to try and fuck with ganondorf until link gets back. i think would be pretty cool and could see it being easily episodic. for some reason firefly comes to mind, kinda like a robin hood-esque outlaw type deal."
truezelda,2wdumn,mrhamsandwich,2,Thu Feb 19 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"I could definitely see Zelda's POV. The process of becoming Sheik, under Impa's guidance, could fill in time gaps while also providing interesting character development arcs."
truezelda,2wdumn,liquidDinner,3,Thu Feb 19 19:00:18 2015 UTC,That could be the end of the first season. Second season could be him in the background trying to stop link from collecting the stones/trying to get to them before link. Third season could be during the time link is frozen I  time. It could be about the guerilla type stuff sheikh is doing trying to set stuff up for link when he wakes up.
truezelda,2wdumn,CaptainPolarBear,15,Thu Feb 19 05:03:53 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that it should not have Link.. personifying Link with an actor is far too hit or miss, and might just make it bad.

I'm scared and excited."
truezelda,2wdumn,Jillianmd777,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:53:56 2015 UTC,"Another issue is : Does he talk, or is he mute?  As soon as Link starts talking, we're taken away from what we're used to.  If he doesn't talk, it's awkward as hell to watch"

He has run-ins with ghosts in the graveyard, there's a drought, a fire, a mysterious kid that comes and travels through time...the bootstrap paradox. If that works they can try another area of the canon, but start small and DO NOT involve Link much or at all."

truezelda,2wdumn,Don_Corneo,3,Thu Feb 19 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ways I think it could work well.  I think it'd be kind of cool to switch games from one season to the next. Season one could loosely be based on OoT, the second on TP, third on LttP... something like that. Keep the same actors for Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf, but switch up the supporting characters. Somewhat similar to what American Horror Story does, but keeping it all tied together a bit more.  I also wouldn't mind if they just left the games in the dust and created their own ""separate"" universe. Kind of like treating it as a reboot of sorts. They could choose from all the best characters, plot points, locations, legends, bosses, etc. from the entire series and create a story that works perfectly for a TV series. Like both Midna and Zelda/Sheik could be Link's companion while rescuing the sages from OoT. There could be an episode based on the Anju and Kafei sidequest in MM, or one about King Zora's wife being killed, one focused a little more on Groose, etc.   I'd like it to be a serious adaptation. Not all dark and gritty, but not all lighthearted and silly either. So not as extreme as Game of Thrones, but not as light and over the top as Once Upon a Time. There's a lot of middle ground there, and it can be really amazing when a show shifts from one end of that spectrum to the other. I've always imagined it as a sort of combination of Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones.  I'd also throw out there that hour long episodes would be ideal as far as I'm concerned. That'd give them time to explore the stories, perhaps have it follow both Link and Zelda, and still have plenty of time for some fun action scenes."
truezelda,2wdumn,stryker101,2,Thu Feb 19 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"I think someone who really, really, REALLY, loves all the Zelda games (even the shitty ones) should write an all new story which still draws inspiration from previous games.  Similar to what Bryan Fuller has done with the TV show 'Hannibal':  take everything that came before as canon, mix it all up, and make something we've never seen before but will still love."
truezelda,2wdumn,headcanonftw,2,Wed Jun 17 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"I would really enjoy an original spin on things, where they combine elements from several games to make a new story. I would LOVE it to be something like this:  Link is the orphaned son of a rancher, growing up in a village in the southern forest of Hyrule. The death of his parents left him a quiet, reserved individual, eventually causing him to sell his family's farm to an old friend (Talon) in order to escape from the memories. He mostly communicates in grunts and body language, but will occasionally talk to those he holds in high regard, usually his childhood friends, Saria and Malon. He is a member of the Knight Academy, but wakes up late on the day of his graduation only to discover that the king of the neighboring desert nation, Ganondorf, has killed all the other knights; he takes up a sword, intent on defeating the villain, but is too late to prevent him from disappearing. The end of the episode will have the camera zoom in on his left hand, where the mark of the Triforce of Courage has appeared. He will, of course, say 'Excuse me, Princess' once during the series, with an extremely snarky tone, but no more than that.  Zelda is the princess of Hyrule, showing great prowess in magic, archery, and hand-to-hand combat. She is a tomboy with something to prove, with a great disdain for dresses, dolls, and many other 'girly' things. Most of the castle staff disapprove of her chosen activities and lifestyle, but her father supports her in all her endeavors. Her bodyguard is a female warrior named Impa, who, along with the king, supports Zelda no matter what, Impa teaching her combat and stealth skills herself. Unfortunately, the ruler of the neighboring desert nation, Ganandorf, murdered her father and most of the royal court, forcing Zelda to go into hiding. She dons the disguise of Shiek, the son of Impa, and discovers Link undoing the damage Ganandorf has wrought. Shiek joins Link on his quest, battling physical and mental monsters as he tries to figure out who he really wants to be and if such a thing is even possible.  Groose is the son of a Bombmaker and a former desert bandit, showing great prowess in explosives, engineering, and ranged combat; unfortunately, Groose is also a pompous jerk prone to narcissism. He grew up in Kakario Village, at the base of Death Mountain, and is shown to be fluent in the languages of the Zora and the Gorons. He joins Link and Shiek when they pass through Kakario village to get to Death Mountain, offering his services as a guide and translator, but eventually is proven to be a valuable member of the team and stays with them on the rest of the journey, upgrading the weapons Link and Shiek use along the way.  The final party member, Ruto, is the princess of the Zora. She is bratty, spoiled, and the only Zora to escape the freezing of her home, Zora's Domain. She encounters the group after they beat the death mountain dungeon, demanding they help her lift the curse from her race's guardian, Jabu Jabu, that has frozen the entire place. She seems useless at first, but is eventually redeemed after she begs to learn how to defend herself. She quickly picks up combat techniques from the other three, eventually creating an unarmed fighting style that relies on magically electrified blows and fin-slashes. After they beat the dungeon, she joins the party on their quest.  I think that it should have the next story-arc take place in the Forest, where they discover a child-sized village hidden among the trees. The original inhabitants have all vanished, and wooden beings have taken residence, but the group is taken to shrine built into the remains of a long-dead tree. The shrine describes an ancient legend detailing the ancestors and namesakes of the group, revealing an ancient curse of doom and rebirth. The group is shaken, especially Link, and they spend some time in the Deku Village before discovering that Link's Hometown, Ordon, has been burned down. Nearly Everyone survived, and the Deku are happy to share their homes with the Ordonians. Link is then driven to defeat Ganondorf, and the four travel on to the remains of Hyrule Castle to defeat him.  What do you guys think?"

truezelda,2wdumn,dadoprso,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:42:32 2015 UTC,"It would absolutely need to be animated, I'm okay with Link speaking, the story would be an amalgam of elements that have run through the series, annual festival, Link's heritage being Knightly, and I guess Ganon/dorf being the main antagonist but a unique antagonist might be better. I would probably avoid the ""curse cycle"" and just tell a relatively vague backstory about the lineage of Link and the royal family. I would also try to avoid a lot of the ""chosen one"" tropes with Link, and probably keep the Triforce intangible with other magic and elements of power substituting for it. The world would be a mix of the technologically advanced MM, and the more traditional fantasy of ALttP (blacksmiths, Knights,wizards and such)  with the connection to the Goddesses having been weakened over years of the kingdom dealing with civil and foreign wars.  It sounds like a lot of changes but I still want it to be VERY Zelda, with the importance placed on the bonds of characters, and the ties that they form while experiencing the world together. I grew up loving pokemon and The Last Airbender, so I'm a sucker for ""group of kids traveling"" kinds of stories, even though I know many might not like that.  I would want to see Link be strong willed and not irrational but quick to jump into action to protect people he cares about. Giving him a companion  (be it a fairy or Zelda etc.)that could do most of the social interaction with people would be the best way IMO to keep him from having to say TOO much, but I still think having dialogue would be absolutely fine.   I dont have a dream cast for live action because I inherently dislike the idea of watching someone try to act Link out, thats why I require the animated format to ""pad"" the shock of hearing Link speak and show emotions. With animation we can still connect with the character, and hear his voice, without really worrying about what else the actor has been in."

It makes it easy for the writers because it is a scarcely explored and explained period of time.  BUT: Game of Thrones' strength is portraying a situation from many point of views(especially in the books). What makes you ""understand"" why characters act and behave a certain way. So I think they will not only show Ganondorfs way into hyrulean court but also the betrayal of the Shiekah, hyrulean court in general, Zoras and maybe even we will see some more life to the city of Kakariko etc. (Which is a thing I am realy looking forward too!)  I am at least 90% sure that they won't include Link. It would disrupt the whole concept Link was build on - so the player could empathize and so on.

truezelda,2wdumn,son_of_Urth,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:04:01 2015 UTC,"well i'm split between original, does not affect the timeline plot and an adaptation (and adding original content) the zelda games. the problem with the latter is it may never live up to the expectations i've set for the games. Personally it would seem too surreal to have a live action Zelda tv show, were it a cartoon i'd be less weireded out. how long? 30 mins doesn't seem like enough, 1 hr seems like too little, so 30 mins. Age group: obviously older kids (too violent for little kids since it isn't a game), i'd say older teens who've most likely played a zelda game. it should not be like Once Upon a Time because there is a villain who destroys in an effort to take over hyrule but also not too dark and violent. as for perspective, Ganon wouldn't be a good tv show, more of a spin off book, in most games Zelda is absent a lot even as Shiek. and dream crew? ehh Edit: i see people are posting about adaptations. i would like an adaptation and the first thought that comes to mind is either: each season is a game (maybe OoT being 2 season). But the problem is they'd have to end it somewhere and/or add to the mythology. LoZ is pretty much a curse for the protagonist who has to face Ganon over and over again"
truezelda,2wdumn,HalaMadrid97,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the three goddesses incarnated into a mortal form. Each one being not only themselves but a living entity of the Triforce. With their death (possibility) ultimately causing the destruction of their respective piece of the Triforce.  Hence, a war (political, physical and underground) between many tribes and kingdoms within the world of Hyrule and it's surrounding lands. Varying between factions and peoples that wish to destroy the Golden Power in its mortality to prevent future corruption of it; men who obviously wish to control this power; men who wish to defend and unite, men who wish to defend and separate, and the Goddesses themselves who may or may not wish to benefit mankind any longer.  I would also as a side note really like this incarnation of Link to be a literal mute. Not because he doesn't talk in the games: obviously when you make choices in the games the NPCs respond. However, hearing him talk wouldn't be right. Mutes don't necessarily lack personality, they just portray it differently.  With leaving Link mute also presents the possibility of a rogue-type protagonist. While he is the Hero of Time, what actions will he take? Does he always have to be a selfless hero? Because he won't speak the majority of his deeper thoughts, some actions could catch us completely off guard."

""And then Link figured out what order to push the blocks in. And then he found some rupees in a dungeon."" It's fun in a game setting but fleshing out this stuff into full fledged movie material with back story, characters with motives and relationships, it's just begging to fail. Aside from the vague idea of ""Ganon is the bad guy and wants the triforce, link is a hero and Zelda is the princess"" the rest will essentially need to be made up by the writers. Right now, most of this back story is in the player's head or various competing fan fictions. Hollywood will likely write something that conflicts with players' head canon and just turn into Dragon Ball Evolution or the Super Mario Bros movie. Or the CDi games cut scenes. I'd love for it to work but writing a script based on a game just begs for garbage."

The show is going to blow ass and that's all there is to it. The elements of tLoZ are acceptable BECAUSE it's a video game series.  A show is going to have to abandon what makes Zelda great. Essentially, it'll be like the newest Resident Evil games (bad comparison): its only Resident Evil in name and concept. Nothing else is correct. Is a shooting zombies? Yes. But that's it. Its not horror or survival anymore.  A Zelda show is going to have Link, Ganon and Zelda. That's it. Everything is would have to be completely un-Zelda-y in order for it to be good.

truezelda,2wcn12,Foyet,16,Thu Feb 19 12:00:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry to break it to you, but Hyrule Historia is certified-canon, and is can be used as pretty much irrefutable proof."
truezelda,2wcn12,Vivo999,-21,Wed Feb 18 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry that we don't all see it this way. Aounama has stated the games have been always been designed from a game-play perspective first with the story and timeline coming in secondary so that fans might have fun seeing any connections. If I were to agree with the official timeline they've given then it means literally every Zelda game should also have another timeline branching off of it because there should be one for Link winning and Link dying. Personally I think that's a bit silly, and I also think stopping all discussion of Zelda lore ""because the Historia says so"" isn't all that fun and is certainly NOT what Aounama had in mind when making the thing. But I suppose I'll get down-voted into oblivion anyway for having an opinion."
truezelda,2wcn12,Foyet,15,Wed Feb 18 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"You're not being down voted for having an opinion, you're being down voted because you aren't accepting canon information as canon, which is just silly.  There's no doubt that the Downfall timeline is just a cop-out for the older games that were designed before a set overarching storyline was created. I don't think they would have done it unless they felt like they had no other choice, but they did and that's just something that we have to deal with. Though, just because only one string of events coming from a Link dying was actually put into game-form doesn't mean that there are countless other stories branching off from the other games resulting in the death of a Link. Not every faccet of the story has to have--nor would it be realistically practical/possible to have--a game dedicated to it.  Hyrule Historia doesn't 'stop all discussion of Zelda lore', but rather gives us a bit more information of our beloved series than just the games provide. It is just as canon as information from the games, and should be treated as such. By your reasoning, you could also say that in-game information that can end debates should be kept out theory/lore conversations as well, so as not to 'stop all discussion' when it gives a clear answer on a topic. Which, obviously, is counter-intuitive. After all, what's the point of discussing Zelda lore if you don't want to listen to, well, the actual lore of the series."

Wow...of course all endings have the possibility of being different in all the games. They just don't matter except for the ones from Ocarina of Time.

truezelda,2wcn12,Vivo999,-3,Thu Feb 19 01:55:53 2015 UTC,"Still don't really see it that way, and I'm not the only one.  ""Hyrule Historia and its timeline-related content is not regarded as canon by Zeldapedia due to numerous conflicts and contradictions with established facts.""   At some point you have to regard some things as canon and others as not. Just because Aounama wrote it or Aounama said so doesn't really cut it for me because he also wrote and said things in the past. The story of Zelda, be it this or something else, is something that changes, grows, and evolves with each new game. If the Hyrule Historia = canon because it's the most recent piece of information that links everything together, that could mean something that comes out tomorrow by Nintendo stating otherwise could be the new canon. If the next Zelda had the Hero of Time die, then would the Hyrule Historia no longer be canon? To begin with, Zelda games have always focused on gameplay elements first BEFORE implementing it's story elements. In this way, I'm hesitant to completely entrust all of these definitive and divisive answers on a secular piece of work. A book with 0 game-play elements to it. If the entirety of /r/truezelda has decided that Hyrule Historia is 100% canon that's fine and I'll just take my idea's elsewhere, but the Zelda games were not originally designed with this book in mind. The first Zelda game was not created so the Hyrule Historia could be made 25 years later to clear up any confusion. This is why conflicts and contradictions exist in the first place and it's why I don't accept this book as the end all be all of the questions we always debated over before the book came out. If anything, I'd argue the Hyrule Historia is an in-canon Encyclopedia chronicling all of the games to the best of the knowledge of whoever is writing it (who knows maybe it's Cia/Lana or something), and that these are the answers they've arrived at given what knowledge they had. To me, the Hyrule Historia is Nintendo's attempt to tie everything together, and while it's a good attempt, there are too many problems for me to really buy it or accept it."
truezelda,2wcn12,GVman,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"Unless there's another source from Nintendo that you can use for citation, Hyrule Historia is the end-all, regardless of what the original intent of the early games were. Retcon happens all the time; the Hobbit wasn't originally a prequel to the Lord of The Rings, the Blood Gultch Chronicles probably didn't have Project Freelancer in mind when they were dicking around in the canyon, and you'd be hard pressed to find any long-running series that had it's end-game planned out from episode/chapter one. Things change at the whims of the creators, Nintendo published Hyrule Historia as an explanation for the Zelda mythos, end of story."
truezelda,2wcn12,Phoxxent,5,Mon Feb 23 06:09:29 2015 UTC,"You want the proof that the hero's shade is the hero of time or the proof that TP link is descended from the hero's shade? If the latter, the final 3 hidden skills are said to ""be kept within our bloodline"", and when the Zelda series talks about stuff like that, it generally means literal bloodline (see: ALttP, FSA, TWW, and Mikau and Darmani in MM). As for the former, I'd have to check again, but I believe it has to do with the shade saying that he has regrets of not passing on the skills and that the hero of time is the only hero we know of that came before TP (and probably the only hero given the lack of mention of other heroes. It's really cramped and not much room for adventures of other heroes). I believe he also aludes to having saved Hyrule, but again I would have to check, that could also come from his being a golden wolf. The wolf being a creature of courage, and the Hero of Time having wielded the triforce of courage for the rest of his days (with courage and wisdom being out and power being sealed with Ganon, the triforce could not reform an this stayed with it's wielders)."
truezelda,2wcn12,Vivo999,-4,Mon Feb 23 07:13:56 2015 UTC,"This is what the Historia says:  ""The ghost of the hero who teaches Link his secrets. Some theorize that the fact he holds his sword in his left hand indicates he is actually Link from Ocarina of Time.""  However this is basically hogwash because the Wii version had Link be right-handed...as well as Skyward Sword Link. These two games break the common notion that Link is always left-handed.   Also:  ""A sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage. Remember those words...""  ""You may be fated to become the hero of legend...but your current power would disgrace the proud green of the hero's tunic you wear. You must use your courage to seek power...and find it you must. Only then will you become the hero for whom this world despairs. If you do find true courage, and you wish to save Hyrule from the horrors it now faces...Then you will be worthy to receive the secrets I hold!""  Why would he spend so much time lecturing TP Link about courage and his unworthiness? Why his TP Link only powerful enough in the Shade's eyes after learning these techniques? To begin with, OoT Link was a child when he saved Hyrule. Sure, he went to sleep so he could save Hyrule in an adult's body, but he was still a child, and continued to be so in MM and so on. Why would OoT Link put such importance in techniques he himself never needed to save Hyrule? Why doesn't the Shade look anything like OoT Link? Namely the helmet. Also while Link tends to be mostly silent, the Hero's Shade sure likes to talk. A lot.   Maybe I'm just crazy, but I don't see any real connection between the Hero's Shade and OoT Link. I more just see some ancestor or father of TP Link who knew of OoT Link or the Legend of the Hero and wants to help his son succeed in rescuing Hyrule."

Help that TP Link wouldn't get. He knew this, and sought to train Link in the way of the sword that he mastered in his life-time. Likely as a guard or soldier, explaining why he looks nothing like the young hylian raised as a kokiri. He doesn't talk in game because of gameplay decisions. Him being silent helps him link the player to the world around him. In cutscenes he isn't given a chance to talk, and when he is, he gives an answer to whatever question he was asked. It also isn't too uncommon for people to grow more talkative as they mature."

If he was dead, then how or when did he die? He starts and ends the game the same way; wandering through the Lost Woods. And at the end, you see the carving that the Skull Kid did. If you want to argue that seeing that carving was part of his death dream, then you could argue that the scene in the opening of the game is also part of his death dream. In that case, it means that Link was already dead before you even put the cartridge in and turned the system on. So then, when did he die, and how? Its stupid.

In-game arguments: If Termina was just some purgatory realm, only the dead should be able to enter, and only the resurrected should be able to get out, but we see Tatl, Tael, Skull Kid, Link, Epona, and the Happy Mask Salesman all enter Termina, and we see all but the Happy Mask Salesman leave Termina at some point after having been there for some amount of time without any resurrection spell being necessary for them to leave. We're also told in MM that some of the Gorons occasionally leave Termina to visit Hyrule. And TWW tells us (or at one time told us, if you think this information has been retconned) that the MM Postman left Termina for Hyrule.

In your first post:   And TWW tells us (or at one time told us, if you think this information has been retconned) that the MM Postman left Termina for Hyrule."
truezelda,2wcn12,Petrichor03,3,Thu Feb 19 03:53:29 2015 UTC,Taken directly from the game:   Th-That's it! It's so good that I dream about it... Dodongo Cavern's finest quality rock sirloin!
truezelda,2wcn12,legendtriforce,-9,Thu Feb 19 03:54:09 2015 UTC,"Whoever said that's Hyrule's Dodongo's Cavern? We already know Termina has parallels all over the place. Why assume that Gorons travelled under the clock tower, across dimensions, through the lost woods, and over to Death Mountain, just to get rock food that likely exists on their own mountain already?  Also note that he called it Dodongo Cavern, not Dodongo's Cavern. Subtle difference but important."
truezelda,2wcn12,malaroo,7,Thu Feb 19 03:55:10 2015 UTC,"There are more reasons for why it doesn't work, than why it works (which are: essentially none).    Children don't turn into Stalfos, they turn into Skull Kids.  This pretty much put the theory to bed before it even came around.  Stalfos are physical skeletons.  Is the Shade a skeleton? No. He's a transparent ghost/apparition... or a shade.  Closer to a re-dead, if anything, but still a ghost.  There goes the rest of that part.  TP Link is a blood descendant of OoT Link.  When did he have kids if he was busy ""dying"" at 10-12 years old, right after MM?  A one night stand between two kids in the forest? lol, ew.  Link is the Hero of Time, wielder of the Triforce of Courage... and the thing that does him in is a forest he's gone through a hundred times? A forest that pretty much every Link has gone through, without a fairy or assistance of any kind?  Yeah, makes sense, lol.  Hyrule Historia states that the Hero of Time lived in regret that he was never acknowledged/remembered for his deeds saving Hyrule, and that he could never find anyone to pass his skills on to.   It's just some edgy, fan-fiction bs."

truezelda,2wcn12,Serbaayuu,22,Fri Feb 20 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"Well, it's stupid, for starters.  The basic idea of it is the classic ""omg wut if link wuz ded"" trope.  Majora's Mask is a very, very personal game.  It's a personal journey for a Link and the way he helps individual people is quite different from most of the other games in the series, where most characters are cardboard cutouts.  Link gets close to a lot of people in Termina, and changes their lives.  So, to reverse all of that and say: ""Nah, all of that was in Link's head in purgatory, it was just a journey for HIM to 'get over it' ('it' usually being undefined because reasons)"" is really insulting to the whole premise of the world that was built for the game.  Of course, the Hero's Shade is the primary reason.  But everybody else already explained that."

truezelda,2wcn12,zerachielle,2,Thu Feb 19 15:00:34 2015 UTC,How can Link and Navi even have chemistry when Link doesn't even speak?
truezelda,2wcn12,Serbaayuu,2,Thu Feb 19 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"Precisely so.  Link's relationships with other characters center entirely around the other character, so when it comes to someone like Navi who is basically a signpost, there's no relationship to care about."
truezelda,2wcn12,zerachielle,3,Thu Feb 19 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"You're taking things too literally. Link being mute provides a vehicle for the players to let them personally develop what Link is or isn't. It's viewer identification. The point is to let the players imagine what the relationship or chemistry is. Just because Link doesn't speak, it doesn't mean there is nothing there. It's clear that Link can experience emotions like shock or anger even if he mimes them. A totally emotionless character would be like main character from any Pokemon handheld game.   Out of curiosity, what do you think Link was looking for in the forest in Majora's Mask? So far, you've gone and said everyone's theory is wrong, but you've never presented your own."

I feel like you don't actually know as much about OOT or MM as you think you do.   Please, explain to me any point in all of Ocarina of Time where Navi actually acts like a person instead of a walking-talking-hintbox (which is what she is).

I'm not saying he died, I'm saying your reasoning is heavily flawed. The hero's shade is a shape shifter and shows no human form. Who's to say he didn't die and become the hero's shade, but having experienced adulthood preferred that form and so used it when presenting himself to the future hero.    There's also no good reason that Navi going missing would send him into a spiraling depression that would lead to him going to ""purgatory"" and having to come to terms with death and shit.   There is plenty of good reason. If it was literally told that he was going after her you wouldn't even say that. The fact is they gained a strong bond, and having fulfilled his destiny link had nothing better to do. Why wouldn't he consider trying to find her? She doesn't exactly say she's got a reason to leave other than the job at hand is done. Link would feel pretty empty after that and want answers or to help her at least.    Please, explain to me any point in all of Ocarina of Time where Navi actually acts like a person instead of a walking-talking-hintbox (which is what she is).   Throughout the game it is pretty obvious that Navi follows a predictable and obvious character progression from being forced to side with Link to being his friend and looking out for his well-being. She even defends him on a few occasions both verbally and physically. To have missed this is ridiculous.   I feel like that must be your go-to defensive move.

He had offspring.  TP Link is his direct descendant.  So, unless Nabooru raped him...   Why wouldn't he consider trying to find her?   Yet again, I never said he didn't go find her.  I did say that there's no reason that not finding her would send him into a depression that leads directly to his death.   pretty obvious that Navi follows a predictable and obvious character progression   Lol.  ""Hey Link wake up!"" -> ""I'll help!""  Navi has zero character progression.  She's barely a character.  She's less of a character than Sheik, and Sheik is nothing more than a god-hand guidepost.  Navi pops up to give you hints, and that is it.  She gives raw information on enemies without any personality (like Tatl).  She says ""I wonder what Saria would say!"" or ""Link, maybe we should play that song Sheik gave us!"".  None of this is character development.  This is a hint system wearing a ""fairy helper"" mask.  You're delusional if you think she actually has a personality beyond that."

I wrote this out in another comment the other day but I'll paste it here, although SPOILERS if you haven't finished Majora's mask yet:  It seems strange only having four, but it's definitely made up for in other ways, and I don't mean sidequests. Just look at all the storyline stuff you need to do to even access Stone Tower:  * ikana graveyard to learn song of storms. * play the song to get gibdo mask. * the Beneath the Well shit to get mirror shield. * Ancient Castle of Ikana to learn Elegy of Emptiness. * make your way up to the tower using the song to get to the entrance.  Compare that with getting to the Spirit Temple in OOT:   gerudo fortress  follow the poe in the haunted wasteland walk into the temple.   Or the Shadow Temple:   Bottom of the Well for the lens of truth walk into Kakariko Village to trigger cutscene in which you learn the song that takes you directly to the temple entrance.   I really like all the other stuff they make you do to even gain access to the temples in MM. It adds up to practically another temple."

truezelda,2wa4it,SandSlinky,4,Wed Feb 18 09:37:49 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this... and even some of those bulletpoint could easily have bullet points.... do the bottom of the well in Ikana is not a quick thing to do, and neither is Ikana Castle... Those things are pretty time consuming. I think MM did just fine with only 4 temples, for as much extra stuff they put in... I played the Oracles games last week for the hell of it, and realized just how little there is to do outside of the dungeons. Granted, you can only do so much with a game on the gameboy platform, but still. i remember at one point i finished 1 temple and was then practically funneled into the next temple. i then left the temple because i was sure i must have missed something, only to realize later, nope, i was supposed to go right into the next temple..."
truezelda,2wa4it,noopenusernames,3,Thu Feb 19 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, and with Ikana Castle, that really should be listed as ""Get 75% of the way through Ikana Castle, realize you need a powder keg, throw the controller and groan in frustration, warp to Clock Town, buy a stupid fucking powder keg, warp back, and get back up to the part of Ikana Castle where you need to use it."""

In this sense, yes OP, I think ""Zelda"" is still an accurate name, for a couple of reasons: Someone mentioned how ""Legend of Hyrule"" would be more accurate, and I agree, but if we put that aside, who or what are the main motifs in the series? Well, I would say Link, Ganon, and Zelda. Out of the 3, Zelda has the least amount of 'airtime', so why name it after her? Well, she might get the least airtime, but in the end, shes probably the most important of the 3. Zelda and her bloodline are essentially the protectors of the triforce. Really, ""Zelda"" games are really a batlle between Zelda and Ganon, and Link just happens to be the guy who comes in out of nowhere and changes the balance. Whereas in most games, Link and Ganon are no incarnations of their previous selves, Zelda is more constant in that each Zelda is still related to a previous one. This is important because of the fact that her bloodline protects the triforce. Really, its Zelda's bloodline that keeps the legends alive. True, she might not have the most to do in each game, but between the 3, she is the backbone that holds the legend(s) up. Think of it like this.... if you've ever read the Harry Potter books, you could easy say ""the books are about Harry"", but once you finish the last book, you could say that if you really dig into the nitty gritty of the HP series, you could go so far as to say that the series was actually more about Snape because without him and everything he did, Harry actions would've fizzled out in the first book because Snape pretty much watched over him throughout the whole series.... One could even say that if you were to take Snape out of the equation, it would become the ""failed timeline"" of HP (sorry, i had to throw that in there...)"

truezelda,2wabfl,ArtistCook,3,Wed Feb 18 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"The series started with Link helping Princess Zelda by collecting the Triforce and protecting Hyrule from Ganon. Each game after the original expanded on the idea, except for a few.  At this point, The Legend of Zelda is as recognizable a video game franchise as you can find, save for a few... changing the name now would be cutting into some of that recognition, thus cutting into sales and name value.   It's the same reason that Resident Evil shouldn't change their name, as even though the games have evolved past the mansion/city terror and zombies, the name is still known and (arguably) popular. It's the same reason a company like Disney won't ever drop the Mouse Ears, despite Mickey not doing anything relevant in years.   As a wrestling fan, WWF changing to WWE was such a big change, simply because ""WWF"" was so ingrained in minds as being recognizable. It's all about name recognition."

Almost none of the games story's, if passed down generations, would be described as legends of Zelda. Take OoT, the legend there would be the legend of the hero of time, and that's the story that does seem to be passed down judging by other games, the story of Zelda as seen from the rest of the world is that she went into hiding for 7 years and then got kidnapped and saved by the hero of time, not much of a legend. And I think this is something could do better Nintendo in this regard, not nessisarily making Zelda the main character or anything, I don't think that's needed, but just making some of the story's revolve a little more around her, the idea should be that if the story of any of the games was passed down for generations that Zelda would be the focus and that link should only be a mysterious character in the background."

Everything else would either solve itself after Majora was defeated or he could return and do later.  I don't know about merging or splits - Majora's Mask certainly acts like a timeline that gets split, but we know that doesn't normally happen with the time travel in Zelda except for one special instance.  All other timetravel stays in a single timeline.   Also I fully believe that Link makes it home and lives out his life and doesn't die in the woods.   Of course he does.

In other words, most Links are not directly related by blood, but rather by their ""destined hero"" status.  For example, The Hero of Winds is a spiritual descendant to the Hero of Time, because the Hero of Time no longer existed in the Adult Timeline after Ganon's defeat and thus could not have fathered any children, but they are both related by their shared Heroic destiny.  Also, ""indirect descendant"" is a valid term. Direct means a perfect, child-to-child line to the desired ancestor, whereas indirect must trace back through cousins, marriages, etc."

The giants tell Skull Kid that just because he and the giants aren't together playing or whatever anymore doesn't mean that they are no longer friends. Their long separation also doesn't mean that they will never see each other again. As Skull Kid listens, he breaks down, realizing that he is wrong to try and force a meeting.

truezelda,2w6gsp,IThoughtThisWasDigg,6,Tue Feb 17 10:20:57 2015 UTC,"It always just seemed to make sense to me that if time is fractured and we have ""3 days"" to do everything that in reality we have all the time in the world because time itself is broken. So everything we do, in some ways, is occurring simultaneously across different pieces of one timeline that is broken. Of course Link, and the player through him, is the only one who walks away knowing this but everyone else gets so be blissfully ignorant as time sews itself back up.   I think the time break being an isolated incident might have something to do with the Skull Kid and his past with Termina and Hyrule. I tend to see Termina existing in a different era than OOT, more advanced technologically and all that, but the doorway in the Lost Woods has allowed individuals to slip between eras in the past. We are told the story of the Imp and the Giants, but we also know that Skull Kid was in Hyrule during the events of OOT. I think Skull Kid originated in Termina and wandered his way into Hyrule after being ostracized by the Giants. Upon his return to Termina he finds that a great deal of time has passed, which leaves him lost and alone when he finds Tatl and Tael. I think the events of the game were Majoras manipulation or projection of Skull Kid's memories, but his subconscious desire to see his friends again leaked through and ended up saving Termina when Link and Tatl were able to act on it.  edit: I got sidetracked with Skull Kid and forgot to mention how I think the loss is still felt when you look at things that occurred outside of the 3 day cycle. Mikau, Darmani, and the Deku son are all truly gone, and no amount of time manipulation can change that.

In this time line not only does nobody remember how heroic he was during his time in OoT as an adult, but now people don't fully comprehend how amazing he was during the events of MM.  I think that definitely makes him turning into the Hero's Shade make more sense. So much pent up anguish from being arguably one of the top incarnations of The Hero, nobody truly understands what he went through (He's still just a child or a young teenager at this point), and the only one he can talk to, Navi, is either dead or missing. No wonder he's still around years later as a Stalfos."

I find it interesting too that the Hero's Shade reflects a Terminan aesthetic, something very Ikana-esque, which to me shows how effected Link was by the events of MM.   Sure he ""lived"" OOT but then he was sent back to the start and tried to forget, but MM was the adventure he had before living out the rest of his life. No going back, no forgetting, and I think his connection to Termina, and the idea of lost time, and lost friends, really stuck with him even in death."

Hyrule Historia has pretty much confirmed that MM Link doesn't die, he has descendants who is the swordsman that teaches TP link the moves. The mask salesman pretty much says everyone is bound to move on with their lives and from their friends and therefore must part ways, but it is up to oneself to decide how long the parting lasts. Link then remembers Zelda"
truezelda,2w6gsp,henryuuk,-4,Sun Mar 1 00:34:59 2015 UTC,Personally I prefer the idea that it was all a dream. So I guess we disagree. Ultimately it is a game which uses themes and ideas more than classic historicity in its story telling.
truezelda,2w6gsp,cbfw86,5,Tue Feb 17 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"Well even the backstory for the game suggests it isn't... The hero left the land that made him a hero so that he could search for a lost friend. Nothing in the opening sequences suggests it was a dream. Even in the end, when he's traveling through the woods again, you see the carving that the skull kid did on the tree trunk. if it was a dream, then even that part would be part of a dream, so literally, not even anything in the game would take place during Link being awake.

In Majora's Mask, Skull Kid mentions that Link has the same smell as ""that kid who taught me that song in the woods"". He also has an affinity for masks and recognises Link in the opening sequence. Also, Saria's Song plays during the ending when we see Skull Kid's stump.  In Twilight Princess, we have a Skull Kid who knows Saria's Song, a song that was rarely heard outside of a tribe that doesn't appear to exist anymore.

Although both aren't super fitting    And the original one is often called ""hero of hyrule"", although that title fits almost all of them... ""original hero"" could work, although lorewise he wasn't the original..."

Just the little fold-out map included with the game.  The map itself was sort of incomplete.  Do a google image search and find the one with the top corners cut off making it almost triangular.  By the time I beat it, that map was wore out and held together by scotch tape.  To this day, that ranks as one of my all-time favorite life experiences.  I'd definitely do LoZ first and then ALttP.

I burned and bombed every square inch of the map just testing and combing looking for secrets.  In the end, it was much more rewarding and I remember the sense of awe and wonder 10 year old me had.    These days we're in such a hurry to run to the computer and look up a walk-thru so we can move on to the next thing, that we miss out on that sense of discovery.

A map sounds like a great idea; the dungeons are pretty easy to navigate, it's just the overworld that can be a bit of a pain at times. Printing out a map ala the NES map sounds like a genius way to do this; especially if I can cross out areas I've already gotten secrets out of.

After that, I would whip out a map that shows all the items and start a new game, if you want to do a 100 percent run (keep in mind that's just how I did it, as I knew I found basically every item during my many unsuccessful attempts, you may want to explore more without a guide first)."

I myself like to figure out games without help, but at the same time, my free time to play games is limited: I'll try my damnedest to figure out something in a game for a while, but I'm not going to waste an hour of the only two or so I have that day when I could spend a few minutes looking it up and being on my merry way to experience other fun parts of the game, and maybe even play some other games.

truezelda,2vvpp9,BaltarForPresident,8,Sun Feb 15 08:58:06 2015 UTC,"*TL;DR I don't think the first Zelda is a great jumping in point for 2D Zelda and would recommend using a map and guide for only when you get stumped. I give my opinions on the other 2D Zeldas as well. I think ALBW is the best 2D Zelda game, and the best 2D Zelda game to start with. *  I haven't finished the first two Zelda games. I wouldn't recommend them as a first 2D Zelda game.   The second game was too difficult for my tastes and doesn't really represent the gameplay mechanics of the other 2D Zelda games in general.  The first one is pretty obscure and trial and error-based if you don't use a walkthrough, and I found it to be boring using a walkthrough. I've seen recommend this game as a first Zelda or a first 2D Zelda and I strongly disagree. Since I'm sure you'll get plenty of opinions for why and how you should play the original Zelda, I figured it would be helpful to give a dissenting opinion to consider. Personally I wouldn't recommend it as a first 2D game. I think it all depends on your patience for trial and error based gameplay. When you have to set a bomb against ever wall section to figure out if there's a cave, I feel like it becomes more about guesswork and less about the player being insightful or clever. If you do want to play the original game first, my advice is to keep a map and the walkthrough handy but don't use the walkthrough unless you get stumped. If you get stumped, consult the guide. When you consult the guide ask yourself, Could I have logically deduced that answer without a bunch of trial and error? If the answer is no, don't feel bad looking the answer up sooner the next time you're confused and don't want to engage in a lot of trial and error. If the answer is yes, give yourself more time to figure it out next time. If you go a long time without enjoying the game, you might as well stop. Just because a game is important for the conception and development of it's franchise, doesn't mean you should play it if you don't enjoy it.  ALttP is the first Zelda game that has a good balance of letting you know what you need to do and letting you figure stuff out on your own. You probably won't need a guide. As far as the gameplay, I feel certain aspects of it are dated and can get a bit tedious. I feel like ALBW worlds captures the essence of what makes ALttP great, while ditching some of it's more dated aspects. I think ALttP is better to play as your second (or later) 2D Zelda.  Link's Awakening, Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Season, and Minish Cap are all great representatives of what 2D Zelda is like and would be a good place to start. Out of these I'd probably recommend Minich Cap and Oracle of Seasons the most. Just keep in mind that because of the limited buttons of their original systems, you're going to have to juggle items between buttons a lot (including your sword and shield). If you're like me, you get used to it and don't really notice it after a while. You won't need a guide for these games, except in rare cases where a specific puzzle may stump you.  Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are good Zelda games, but not very representative of the 2D games as a whole, so I think they're better up as follow ups to your first 2D Zelda game. The touch screen controls, the overworld travel, and the puzzles feel a lot different than most of the other 2D games. I liked Phantom Hourglass, but I enjoyed Spirit Tracks much more. You won't need a guide for these games, except in rare cases where a specific puzzle may stump you.  A Link Between Worlds is what I would most recommend for your first 2D Zelda game. The only big difference between this game and most of the other 2D games is the item rental system and the random dungeon order. It is quick-paced but very open ended since it lets you do things in any order you want. Buttons are less of a concern because the sword, shield, sprint, and lift all have their own permanently dedicated button. Everything else can be assigned to X or Y. I don't think you'll need a guide for this...ever. Random dungeon order means you can usually skip stuff that stumps you for a while and still make progress in the game. There is a fortune teller that can tell you what your overall goal is at the moment, and there are special glasses that let you see hint ghosts, who give you hints for almost every problem. But the nice thing is that you don't have to see them if you don't put the glasses on. The only problem you might have with it is that the difficulty is a little low, but I feel like the gameplay is engaging enough that it doesn't matter. Plus, the problem can be diminished by picking up fewer heart containers and after your first playthrough Hero Mode is unlocked which has quadruple damage."

This is why I get so mad when nostalgia elitists go off about how much more ""thinking"" Zelda 1 required than newer Zelda games, blah blah blah. No it didn't. It just required way more patience and free time. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the first two games or that people can't find joy in them, but there's nothing inherently ""smarter"" about requiring you to bomb every wall or every bush to find things, or deducing a moblin's hunger for a particular shop item based on their vague grumbling."
truezelda,2vvpp9,tic17,5,Sun Feb 15 05:57:33 2015 UTC,"At some point you would almost definitely need to look at a walk through as there is one dungeon in particular that I can't imagine finding on your own. ALttP would be a good place to start if you are trying to ""go it alone"". It does a good job of guiding you to your next objective while still leaving plenty of room for exploration.

This was the second NES game I ever played, Super Mario/Duck Hunt being the first. I was blown away by the grand adventure, but remember, back then there was nothing else like it. Figuring out what weapons to use to beat certain guys easier, or finding hidden rupees and items, was awesome. Finding the fairy pool for the first time was a huge relief, and I had to go back to that screen a lot. In July-August 1988 I got nintendo power #1, it showed the map for the second quest. I didn't play this quest as much, it was a lot harder! A couple of years ago, I played through both quests in about 3 days. I can beat the first quest in around 8 hours, so it's not like when I was a kid, took me like a year. Anyways, I wouldn't spoil it, just explore and if you get really really stuck, then I'd google it, but try to give yourself at least an hour or two because we all know Zelda games are about using your brain.     Oh I guess your main question was which games to play in what order. I would say LoZ, then tinker with AoL but don't worry about getting too far, then play LttP. Then if you want to go back to AoL that's fine. The Gameboy game Link's Awakening is also incredibly good."

However, the game has a habit of hiding secrets (including dungeons) behind random trees or walls that you have to burn or bomb.

And while it was fun and left me feeling accomplished, finding all the secrets on my own, you have to bomb and burn virtually every rock and bush in the game to do that. It's a lot of pointless busywork, and honestly even I don't think it's fun in any way.  My honest advice is to play without a map and explore, but if you get stuck for too long, don't hesitate to check where you're supposed to go next."

The latter if you want something smaller, easier, more linear, and with a greater emphasis on story and exposition. Both are amazing games, great entry points, and in my top five in the series."

It feels like any of the 3d titles do, and is easy to get into, although there is a slight learning curve. as much as I wanted to play the first two, I just couldnt get the hang of what to do next, and I didn't want to rely on a guide. They were made at a time when there weren't other adventure games so kids wouldn't mind searching for hours because it was still just a joy for them to be playing. That is not the case anymore.

Its been an adventure going through all the games and i found a new appreciation for these games.  I cant wait to finally go through MM3d so i can say ive played them all.  Play any zelda game you havent beaten with no guide unless youre ridiculously stuck. its worth it."
truezelda,2vvpp9,Ginger_Shepherd,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"I first played LoZ when I was around 15 before OoT came out. I ended up using a guide for most of it. Really upset that I did that now, but nothing I cando about it now. I've played it counties times without one now, but there's no way to completely forget all of the secrets.  Luckily, I've never played through the second quest. I fully plan on getting a map or done graph paper and doing it the way everyone did in the 80's. I can't wait to have the time available to do so. Less then a week until I take my nursing boards. So much more time then."
truezelda,2vvpp9,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:03:06 2015 UTC,I'm glad I am not the first to mention how the original game had a map. here it is.    The game itself even says to check the manual.  Here that is and more.  Study them.  Notice every detail.  Look for patterns.  Write things down.    The game is not that hard and in fact I'd say every dungeon had reasonable hints.  Only one heart container is hidden in a way where there's no reasonable hint nor pattern: this is one you'd have to find by spending a lot of time exploring and experimenting on everything to find those two heart containers.    I just wish Nintendo had the common sense to include that map in any of the game's rereleases and ports.
truezelda,2vvpp9,Ginger_Shepherd,1 point,Mon Feb 16 22:38:59 2015 UTC,The original version of this game did not have a map or so I heard. Not in the original release anyway.
truezelda,2vvpp9,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Fri Feb 20 09:16:00 2015 UTC,Meaning there were multiple versions of the NES cartridge?  I guess I can live with being wrong about that in spite of my running around bemoaning it to anyone willing to listen.  I'd need to know more though.  Thanks for the heads up.
truezelda,2vvpp9,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:29:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I think so. It may have been in the japanese it didn't have the map and in america it did. Not sure on that though. Just remember reading it somewhere
truezelda,2vvoia,judge_dreddit1,28,Sat Feb 14 15:49:42 2015 UTC,"Dense environments are better than vast empty ones.  If you can't do dense AND vast, don't do vast.  With Zelda U touting a large world, this is incredibly important.  I hate to make the Skyrim comparison - but imagine if that game only had ~20 dungeons sprinkled throughout.  That'd suck, right?"
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,14,Sat Feb 14 19:40:45 2015 UTC,"If we are talking dense as in 'a high amount of unique interactive content in a small area', I disagree.  Vast empty landscapes can be very beneficial.  They can give the player a sense of catharsis after a very dense section, they enforce good pacing, and can open the world up to more nonlinearity.  Of course there needs to be a good amount of content, but that goes without saying.  Going back to Skyrim, imagine if all the dungeons/towns were interconnected, with no empty space.  The world would be much more dense, but the pacing of the game would be less comfortable.  Not worse, just less rhythmic, more stressful.  More breathing in, less breathing out.    Too much density also tends to enforce linearity.  If there are several sections that you do not want the player to go, a vast openworld gives designers a way to let the players visit those players without interacting with them just yet.  It gives the option to build a modular universe, and that tends to work really well.  Skyrim is actually pretty empty, but by having a bunch of holes in the universe that lead to the real content, it feels very full.  Take Windwaker.  If that game followed your advice, it would lose that sense of discovery when approaching a new island, as without the vast, empty areas all the islands would be quick to access and likely within sight.  The world would feel much smaller.  If you are building a Zelda game with a focus on exploration and discovery, having a really good, big open-world is important."
truezelda,2vvoia,cis-lunar,12,Sat Feb 14 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"An open world has to have empty sections, but it cannot be empty."
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,8,Sun Feb 15 02:10:53 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  The three things an empty open world helps with (exploration, pacing and nonlinear play), all rely on having plenty of intense, interesting and available content."
truezelda,2vvoia,cis-lunar,5,Sun Feb 15 03:17:49 2015 UTC,This was an awesome discussion. Nicely done. I'm really happy to see fans who intelligently discuss and analyze something they are passionate about. And I also agree with the conclusion of the topic; pacing plays such an important role that not a whole lot of gamers stop and think about.
truezelda,2vvoia,blank_mind,2,Sun Feb 15 17:17:28 2015 UTC,Did you ever play Shadow of the Colossus?
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Feb 16 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah - that format works because of the novelty of it.  The Legend of Zelda is not Shadow of the Colossus.  It is not trying to show us a big, empty, peaceful world with nothing in it except sixteen monsters.  Zelda U is not going to and should not be a game about contemplating your past fights & upcoming battle while you ride across the lands for twenty minutes.  Because when things happen in Zelda games, it's more than just one thing.  You have towns, cities, dungeons, mines, places that are meant to feel like they've been lived in.  If the rest of the landscape is desolate, it is not a place that's been lived in."
truezelda,2vvoia,shoboy94,4,Tue Feb 17 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"This is very true with Wind Waker unless you had some idea or guide of what to do, you where left to do some serious exploration across the map. The exploration factor of the game is really put to the test with the search for the triforce pieces. If one were to apply this formula to the story of OoT and swordplay of skyward sword and overworld of TP we would have rather formidable zelda game that could really appeal to all ages."
truezelda,2vvoia,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the arsenal depth of A Link to the Past. Also, Skyward sword could lend it's ""class"" specialization."
truezelda,2vvoia,cis-lunar,2,Tue Feb 17 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the player. If I'm in a gigantic area that is empty of intriguing content I don't feel a catharsis because I just came from a content rich area: I always get bored and it is invariably my least favorite part of the game upon subsequent play-throughs. I think that your idea works for a subset of players but not all. It certainly doesn't work for me, but as an individual I can't claim to speak for anybody other than myself, so take my opinion with a grain of salt"
truezelda,2vvoia,malaroo,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:34:41 2015 UTC,"Not saying that the other is inferior. Just that it is different. The vast open world does indeed have its drawbacks, which is why eventually introducing fast travel is so important.    What it does do is make exploration more interesting and rewarding, help pacing, and make nonlinear play more possible, but all those things rely on having intense, interesting and available content all throughout the world."
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,7,Sun Feb 15 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"but imagine if that game only had ~20 dungeons sprinkled throughout. That'd suck, right?   It would still suck (though not as much obviously) if it had a hundred copypasta dungeons, like Skyrim does.  The other half of this argument is that while it can't be sparse, it also shouldn't be made up of lifeless, boring 'sandbox' areas.  They need to fill it with those Nintendo-crafted areas, and I'm sure they will, but I'd really hate to see Zelda's overworld become the typical sandbox that consists of running around and doing random tasks for people, in a world made with no 'heart'."
truezelda,2vvoia,TinyEnemyShrimp,4,Sat Feb 14 23:49:30 2015 UTC,Correct.  Let's not have Skyrim with Octorocks here - that's why I said I hate to make the comparison.
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,26,Sun Feb 15 02:12:13 2015 UTC,That we don't want to spend the whole game being told what to do. But it looks like they've worked this problem out already.
truezelda,2vvoia,malaroo,5,Sat Feb 14 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the other day Navi told me we should try playing the Nocturne of Shadow about 5 seconds after I played it and was walking into the dungeon.  That was silly."
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,17,Sat Feb 14 20:11:05 2015 UTC,"That is silly, but Navi is amazingly 'light' on the handholding when looking at their more recent games.  Skyward Sword doesn't even let you try things until Fi explains it completely.  Not so much ""figure out what you need to do"" as much as it is ""do exactly what Fi just told you"" endlessly."
truezelda,2vvoia,henryuuk,8,Sat Feb 14 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""maybe we should pull the only lever in the room"" is a heinous crime much worse than Navi or Tatl."
truezelda,2vvoia,Serbaayuu,4,Sun Feb 15 02:11:45 2015 UTC,Fi never actually says that.
truezelda,2vvoia,henryuuk,8,Sun Feb 15 04:47:49 2015 UTC,Your statement applies to approximately 99% of the things people say she says.  (✿ฺ◡ฺ‿ฺ◡ฺ)
truezelda,2vvoia,blank_mind,3,Sun Feb 15 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"True, it's like Other M's ""The baby"" all over again. She actually only uses it as if it is a name, and only says it when trying ti refer to the actual thing. but hey, let's circlejerk, cause cracking down on a game with actual facts is to hard."
truezelda,2vvoia,TinyEnemyShrimp,2,Sun Feb 15 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"This is the big one. After Fi told me that the big key I got probably went to the special, ornate door we'd seen, I got a little annoyed. After she kept doing it...  Don't know why they thought we needed that level of hand-holding."
truezelda,2vvoia,TinyEnemyShrimp,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, very important point. It's very hard to balance the hand holding, however, when your core fanbase is getting older and smarter, while also trying to engage new fans as well. I really do not know a way around this other than giving you the option to make your companion  more or less helpful."
truezelda,2vvoia,malaroo,2,Sun Feb 15 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We do need to remember many of us are not youngsters anymore. But the solution isn't too difficult. Many games are designed around a difficulty curve that starts out by treating the player like a first time player, and slowly diminishes the involvement, by the end you have very little guidance. Skyward Sword's major mistake was to start treating the gamer like a child, and continue to do so for the entirety of the game. If anything, it's the young players that benefit from a lack of guidance the most, it gives them a much needed chance to think for themselves."
truezelda,2vvoia,gchance92,3,Sun Feb 15 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"Very good point. It is just as, if not more,  beneficial to younger players if there is a difficulty curve. If the hand holding continues,  players will never be challenged, and therefore never develop as gamers, heck, as thinkers!"
truezelda,2vvoia,malaroo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 13:28:02 2015 UTC,"This is cracking open a can of worms that I'm resisting all urge to fully open. But as a veteran gamer, I'm really bothered by the popularity of metagames and tier lists. It gives players answers on what to do, but treats it like doctrine. I'm told what to do in school, work and even socially, so when I get to a game, most of my enjoyment first comes from sorting through the challenges myself and only turning to the net for answers if I'm completely stumped. Games need to be designed loosley enough that a player can make their own ideas work and not just do what's told of them.   Edit: Sure resisted that urge like a f****ng pro."
truezelda,2vvoia,IThoughtThisWasDigg,21,Wed Feb 18 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"Give the players the difficulty they've been asking for, for the past ten years.  It's understandable to try to appeal to new people, who might not be familiar with the game... but it's painful to see Zelda become a 'paint-by-numbers' game, for the sake of those newcomers, while neglecting the old fans.  I haven't been satisfied beating a Zelda game since Majora's Mask, because it's not so much 'beating' it anymore, it's mostly just following pointers until the game ends, at this point."
truezelda,2vvoia,malaroo,5,Sat Feb 14 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"Wasn't their an article not too long ago about nintendo wanting to bring ""nintendo hard"" back into their new games?"
truezelda,2vvoia,Phoxxent,4,Sun Feb 15 05:59:52 2015 UTC,Was there? I'd hope that's the case but I've seen a couple things that make me think it might not be.
truezelda,2vvoia,malaroo,4,Sun Feb 15 09:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'd just like what WWHD did and allow ""Hero Mode"" right at the start without having to beat the game on ""easy mode"" first.  WWHD did it right, yet ALBW did it wrong."
truezelda,2vvoia,Cosmologicon,2,Sun Feb 15 23:16:27 2015 UTC,"I think someone was interviewing Aonuma about this, and he said something like ""we woulda rather the player first play the game at the intended difficulty"" which is pretty annoying."
truezelda,2vvoia,Penguinswin3,4,Mon Feb 16 08:02:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's annoying. I think that's perfectly reasonable. Most games don't allow you to change the difficulty willy-nilly, so if you want people to finish the game, and especially if the difficulty plays into the enjoyment of the game or some theme or something (final boss has massive difficulty spike), then you as a developer will want to make higher difficulty unlockable, to make sure the player goes through on standard difficulty. This is especially true when, like in ALBW, all damage has a x4 multiplyer and you can get KO'd in two hits. That situation is different from a remake where maybe 50% of the players have already beaten the game, so harder difficulty should be available from the get-go, unless the overall difficulty of the game was changed."
truezelda,2vvoia,IAMYourReason,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"It's annoying to me because I would very much like to play a challenging Zelda game on the first-time around, again.  Once I beat it once, I'm probably not going to be as enthusiastic about going right back into it for the sake of more challenge, for multiple reasons.  It's just something I'd like to pick from the beginning.  The modern ""standard"" difficulty is hardly anything at all to old Zelda fans, so I'm sure you can understand why it might get more boring than it needs to be, if we were allowed to pick it.  Lots of games do this, I don't see why Zelda can't.  ""Easy - Normal - Hard"" is one of the first things you see in a massive amount of games - so much so that it's almost become a staple."
truezelda,2vvoia,Penguinswin3,2,Tue Feb 17 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Nintendo must know that their main fanbase is older, and zelda-experienced. I'd like to be truly challenged by a zelda game again."
truezelda,2vvoia,StartingForever,35,Sun Feb 15 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to players when they complain about something new, especially graphics, before the game is even released. Half the time players don't know what they like until they've tried it."
truezelda,2vvoia,GoldBananas,8,Sat Feb 14 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"I found that players always dislike change, but will most likely be accepting to the change."
truezelda,2vvoia,henryuuk,8,Sat Feb 14 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with you on the graphics aspect. WW is now considered one of the best zelda games and people hated the graphics initially. That said,  I do have to give Nintendo some flak for not listening to its fan base enough. Nintendo is by far the best video game company when it comes to ""don't worry. just trust us,  you'll like it"" because for the most part, Nintendo's been right. I just wished they gave their fanbase some voice. You know?"
truezelda,2vvoia,androsphere,5,Sun Feb 15 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"To a large point, it's important for a game design studio to follow its vision and not bend to fan demands, though. Just because a fanbase has an averse reaction to something, doesn't mean that the developers should acquiesce because they are artists creating their own interpretation and vision of the zelda universe.  Art is often underappreciated but it's important for the designers to be able to realize their vision."
truezelda,2vvoia,MrBoobieBuyer,1 point,Sun Feb 15 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Currently, it is very hard to balance the artistic and the business side of gaming unfortunately."
truezelda,2vvoia,shoboy94,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this in smash bros. Melee was awesome. People wanted brawl to be an extension to that. Instead, they changed it way too much, and now it's a lot of people's least favorite."
truezelda,2vvoia,princekamoro,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. Melee is the perfect example of this. I very much disliked the gravity mechanics in Brawl. Granted, Brawl has its own core fanbase, which is awesome. But Melee is such a fantastic fighting game. All they needed to do for a sequel was, as you said, was create an extension of it."
truezelda,2vvoia,shoboy94,20,Sun Feb 15 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"That players tend to like ""weird"" and almost ""spooky"" aspects of the games.   (i.e. graveyards, ghost towns, ghost ships shadow and stone temples, wells, possessed masks, storms, lost woods where you can get ""lost forever"", NPC's actually kicking the bucket, etc)"
truezelda,2vvoia,JFM2796,8,Sat Feb 14 17:40:45 2015 UTC,I completely agree. These spooky elements become so much more real and visceral when they are juxtaposed to the light. Simply knowing that there are dark spots in the world sends shivers down one's spine even when they know they're currently safe. That's how you make something as simple as a well scary.
truezelda,2vvoia,whispen,7,Sat Feb 14 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The basement in the ancient cistern was a really nice contrast to the light,  tranquil upper part of the dungeon."
truezelda,2vvoia,goatsaredumb,6,Sat Feb 14 19:49:55 2015 UTC,People don't like stuff like that when it is overdone though. Creepy vibes are only as good as the 'good vibes' that set them apart.
truezelda,2vvoia,MrLink495,1 point,Sun Feb 15 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the context. If the antagonist is ruling the world at any point, that point in time should be bleak enough for the player to know that the world is threatened. The rest of the game (aside from any particularly dark temples) should be relatively lighthearted."
truezelda,2vvoia,OMorty,3,Wed Feb 18 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"I've always thought a haunted mansion dungeon would be pretty sweet. Kind of like a mix of Snowpeak Ruins and the Shadow Temple. Of course, there would have to be a couple Luigi's Mansion references."
truezelda,2vvoia,bacloldrum,1 point,Sun Feb 15 06:24:29 2015 UTC,very true they should take a moment to show the dark side of the Royal Family that zelda is not aware of. Maybe in a distant time the gerudo and hylian were close but due to distrust the sheikah advised the royal family to banish them to the desert giving the motive behind ganondorf's inborn anger and hatred. Parallel to the uchiha clan story for clarifiaction on what I mean :)
truezelda,2vvoia,OMorty,3,Sun Feb 15 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"I remember somewhere in the shadow temple at one point there is a block of text that says something about Hyrule's dark side.  More precisely, after looking it up, it says, ""Here is gathered Hyrule's bloody history of greed and hatred."""
truezelda,2vvoia,IThoughtThisWasDigg,10,Sun Feb 15 03:24:53 2015 UTC,"They should develop boss battles with much more difficultly and length rather than the simple ""sets of 3"" battling.

truezelda,2vvoia,Crim_drakenya,7,Tue Feb 17 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"Provide more options for controls, for example, in Skyward Sword you could only use the wii-mote which totally ruined the game for me personally. I felt as though Skyward Sword had one of, (if not the very best) story lines and incentives to save Zelda, but it was wasted on those terrible controls that didn't do what you wanted half of the time."

Unless you want a Wii-Kinect; personally, I don't.  Nor should you expect it to work if you just flap your wrist like the thin noodley appendage it is.  Sadly, computers still can't read intent."
truezelda,2vvoia,bacloldrum,2,Mon Feb 16 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"The controls worked fine, the only problem was that the controller would need to be realigned every hour or so which took all of 4 seconds. The story was good but it was backed up by a cast of characters that were more animated than in previous titles so that boosted your perception of how good the story really was."
truezelda,2vvoia,Zubat_Breeder,2,Sun Feb 15 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely not the reason. I am not a fan of overly bubbly or obnoxious characters (I hated Groose and Girahim, but Girahim grew on me). I legitimately loved the story and how new it felt. I also tend to have a soft spot for the romance thing they had going between Link and Zelda. As for my frustration with the controls I hate when things don't react as they should or in the way that I did it, it feels as though it throws in another unnecessary difficulty to the game. Challenges don't bother me but feeling cheated at times does. Again, this is all personal opinion but those were my qualms with the game, overall still awesome!"

That way we could have cool steampunk tech (no guns though) and then mix that with finding a severely overgrown ruin of the temple of time, possibly underground, and the Master Sword could unlock the power of the Godessess that has been lost for many years. I wouldn't use time travel so much as just have Link traveling back into archaic places that were lost to the ages but have seemingly woken back up as a new evil emerges."
truezelda,2vvnnl,grntplmr,1 point,Sun Feb 15 10:01:07 2015 UTC,"yes this is really good but i want to have link a some point have character development and that involves meeting past game links with each representing parts of growth (time, friendship, courage, etc)"
truezelda,2vvnnl,grntplmr,1 point,Sun Feb 15 10:18:17 2015 UTC,"And they could blow our minds by showing us that all the Links actually dont look the same and have different names. (and by blow our minds I mean piss a lot of people off ha, even though I think it might be cool) But I totally get what you mean, the idea of Link learning from himself basically. Maybe have ""ghosts"" of Link's from the past within the temples that pop up to reveal some wisdom about the dangers in them. Or have it so when ""our"" Link touches an artifact he sees a memory through another Link's eyes regarding it."
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,1 point,Sun Feb 15 10:26:22 2015 UTC,that is actually a great idea the artifact thing it can be tied with new items like the hookshot or fairy bow. when link retrieves this item in a dungeon he would recieve a vision from his past life speaking about his past and how he used it. this could also show us the invidual personality of previous games links
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,2,Sun Feb 15 10:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'd play it, but since it isn't a game, write that fanfiction. I'll read it!"
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,1 point,Sat Feb 14 23:41:56 2015 UTC,Thats the thing i have the idea but not alot of plot or innovation. Need some input.
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,1 point,Sat Feb 14 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Well, somebody would have to let Link know what he'd have to do. Maybe Impa, or the last sage who has been living as a hermit or something. Or maybe a book of fables regarded as children's stories.   What's the government like? Is Zelda/The royal family still in charge? The other races, like gorons and Zora? Are the lost woods still around or is it a subdivision? If not, maybe it's a national park with a giant old tree that looks like it has a face in the middle?   How is Link traveling to the past? Technology or magic?   I can come up with more questions if you'd like."
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,2,Sat Feb 14 23:49:44 2015 UTC,This is excellent. I was thinking that it could be a society similar to the one found in the legend of korra. mid industrial age and society has withdrawn from the old ways. racism towards the goron and zora causing them to withdraw from society. Goal of game is to learn of the ways from key characters and past lives of link in previous games so that he can defeat the overpowering new age government and reunite hyrule?
truezelda,2vvnnl,CaptainPolarBear,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:16:04 2015 UTC,"I've never seen Legend of Korra, but that sounds interesting. Which of the timelines were you thinking of putting your story in? In each of them, we don't really see any/many Zora, and they've become evil Zola by then. The Gorons seem to completely gone missing as well, so you can address that too, maybe.  When you say racism, do you mean real-world style, or have they become perceived like Moblins and Deku Scrubs, as in not even really ""people""?   If you're setting it in a mid-industrial society, then I'd go with magic for your method of time travel, as it may be jarring to have just the one piece of super-advanced technology.   If the new-world-order government is evil, maybe your quest-giver could be a historian? Either Zelda, Impa, or the sage of time would work, but I could also see the true king of hyrule or Kaepora Gaebora (but probably not as an owl) filling this role. Or an original character. It's all up to you.   I'm having fun just thinking about the story, so if you are going to write it, please let me read it. =)"
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:27:03 2015 UTC,yea the idea of a history imparting link with his uest would be great but in terms of the time travel to meet past incarnations i was thinking about the idea of the morden people unearthing a broken gate of time. Similar to skyward sword when link approaches it is responds to his spirt of the hero and resemble to its former condition. from there his journey starts starting with the most recent link before him.
truezelda,2vvnnl,CaptainPolarBear,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:28:18 2015 UTC,I like it! Maybe Link is a student or something at a dig site with the quest-giver when they find the gate.
truezelda,2vvnnl,TheCurseOfEvilTim,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:55:32 2015 UTC,maybe a blacksmith or forger of some sort sent on a trip to find some materials. also could give rise to a reforging of the master sword story

truezelda,2vuiva,RezicG,10,Sat Feb 14 08:42:45 2015 UTC,"For those wondering how to duplicate bottles over other items, you need to have a bottle with something in it in Link's hand, hold ESS position (the joystick position where link is just shuffling his feet) and press the button for the bottle and then the button for the item you want to dupe over one frame later.  You can only dupe over masks and items that make a buzzer sound when you press them when they're depleted (such as bombs, bombchus, deku nuts, deku sticks). If you dupe over one of these items you get them back next time you pick up a drop. It's a useful trick for getting all the Zora eggs in one trip, as you can dupe over items you don't need, grab the eggs, and then get the items back again.  To specifically get Fierce Diety early, dupe a bottle with the above method over Kafei's Mask, catch Hot Spring Water in it, and then leave the area and you will be Fierce Diety. You don't receive the mask however, so whenever you want to become him again you will need to do this again."

truezelda,2vuiva,JFM2796,6,Sat Feb 14 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"Been playing for many hours tonight, just taking a short snack/reddit break and hopefully getting back into it in a bit.  It's my first time playing MM, and I want to avoid spoilers in case other first-timers are checking the thread.  I think graphically, it looks absolutely gorgeous. I'm sure some of that is the improved super stable 3d of my N3DS, but it typically does look even better than OoT3D (which I'd been replaying in preparation for MM). I did notice some of the FPS drop in Termina field, which is an especially big disappointment since I'm on the N3DS.  I just completed my first dungeon (forest), and I have to admit, I feel like it was a good bit more difficult than I expected it to be. I was literally fighting the dungeon boss with about 4 hours left on the countdown, which had me concerned as I'm not yet really familiar with what stays and what goes when returning to the first day.  There've been a few times early in the game where the hint system was too aggressive, telling you to go to the place you're already on your way to before it gave you a chance to actually do it. Not sure yet if this is going to be a common thing in the game, or if that was just early enough to still be considered ""tutorial level"" type behavior. It's pretty disappointing when that happens though, as I feel it robs the player of that ""I remember/figured-out what to do!"" feeling when you've got the game saying ""HEY GO DO THAT THING, REMEMBER? WE SHOULD GO DO THAT THING"" as you're literally running toward the door for that objective already.  The camera can still be a PITA sometimes, but I suppose that's going to happen for most 3D environment games that aren't designed around solid camera controls like you'd find with a modern dual analog stick controller. The C-Stick on the N3DS is useful sometimes, but doesn't seem adequate to really use as a full time camera control.  The number of events and threads to follow seems almost overwhelmingly large at first, and it's hard to know where to start. There are a few things I though I'd ""solved"" but don't know how to ""turn it in"", so to speak. For example, I have some journal entries about some mail, to which I feel that I know answers, but don't know how to tell the people in the game what I know :-P It's not quite frustrating (yet, anyway), just intriguing to figure out what I'll have to do to 'confirm' it in-game I suppose.  So far I'm enjoying it, but I can see how some of the scheduling and repeating may end up feeling a bit tedious before I'm done. But there's sooooo much game left, I definitely can't say for sure. I'm definitely having fun though, which was the whole point :)  And with that, I'm going to jump back into it. 72 Hours Remain"
truezelda,2vuiva,unkind_throwaway,8,Sat Feb 14 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"If you're having time problems, allow me to give you a little tip. You may already know this but there's a scarecrow in clock town who can help you, you should go talk to it."
truezelda,2vuiva,SuperMaxPower,2,Sat Feb 14 09:12:45 2015 UTC,"I did notice some of the FPS drop in Termina field, which is an especially big disappointment since I'm on the N3DS.   Yea, I noticed the same. That sucks.   I was literally fighting the dungeon boss with about 4 hours left on the countdown, which had me concerned as I'm not yet really familiar with what stays and what goes when returning to the first day.   Key progress stays. Temporary stuff (arrows, bombs, money, etc) goes. Dungeon progress is reset unless you beat the boss. And then only the area is reset back to it's original (pre-boss battle) form.  As for time, go talk to a certain scarecrow. He'll help you out.   Not sure yet if this is going to be a common thing in the game, or if that was just early enough to still be considered ""tutorial level"" type behavior.    Seems to be a common thing. Wasn't like this in the N64 one.   The number of events and threads to follow seems almost overwhelmingly large at first, and it's hard to know where to start.   That's the point. Many contradict each other and have overlapping times too. I'd recommend picking on person or ""quest"" per cycle to get you going. Then you can double and triple up. The bomber notebook should help you keep track of stuff you've already learned.   There are a few things I though I'd ""solved"" but don't know how to ""turn it in"", so to speak.   You don't turn in anything. If you don't get a reward on the spot, you aren't done with the quest. Some take more than one event.   For example, I have some journal entries about some mail, to which I feel that I know answers, but don't know how to tell the people in the game what I know :-P It's not quite frustrating (yet, anyway), just intriguing to figure out what I'll have to do to 'confirm' it in-game I suppose.   Is it the one about the Stock Pot inn? With the Mailman, The weird purple haired kid, and the girl that runs the inn? If so, that's one of the larger side quests, and you need to be further into the game to fully ""complete"" it. Also note that there's branching paths (for a few of the quests, actually)   So far I'm enjoying it, but I can see how some of the scheduling and repeating may end up feeling a bit tedious before I'm done.

I would also be interested to see what they do with it. An original 3D Zelda on 3DS would be very impressive, and a psuedo sequel to ST with a blimp or hot air balloon would also be fun if it's made like the other 3DS games (which it probably would be)."

Letting you have the large magic meter early improves the pace of the second dungeon area.  Clock town is really well decorated now too.  Zora swimming actually feels really good.  I was worried it would be slow but its fine.  I'll always love the original swimming though, holding R to swim fast isn't great, especially on my original 3ds."

I don't love the relocation of the stone mask but I thought it was awesome that the gainer onto the clock platform still works. I think the thing that is throwing me about the Zora controls is the inverted (or non inverted really) stick directions, I think the original had controls like a plane, up is down down is up.   Also beat Woodfall and Snowhead tonight and thought the changes there specifically to the boss fights were worth while. Haven't gone fishing yet but I did do the beaver race and got destroyed the first few tries with the unfamiliar controls but finally got the hang of it.   I'm bummed out that the Goron bomb jump doesn't work, because its really fun to get into Great Bay early that way but thats just a silly nitpick really.   Its obviously in OOT3D as well but man do I love the gyro controls for the bow and hookshot, really makes the shooting galleries fun instead of frustrating, I can't imagine Nintendo would pass up adding that in Zelda Wii U."

Most of the other changes make sense for the better. There's a lot of little timesavers in this version, which I appreciate. For example, the Temple Opening cutscenes (at the very least the Snowhead one) are shortened after you see them once. When rescuing the Bomb Shop Lady, it will skip the rest of the thief's running out as soon as you cut the bag off of him. The Town deku scrub entrance is shortened dramatically after the first time you see it.  Similarly, there's a lot of small changes to things to make the game a little less frustrating. Some stray fairies are in different locations, and a couple of the Stray Fairy rewards are switched around. It might be placebo, but I feel like magic-consuming items don't use as much magic as they used to, especially the Fire/Ice arrows.  Some other things feel a little different too. The reach on the kokiri sword is pitiful, or at least the visual hitbox is. The Gilded sword is a good fix though, and seems just as crazy long as it always was. You can also equip both your bow (no special arrows) and a special arrow on separate buttons, so you don't have to keep going to your inventory to conserve MP in a temple where you need a magic arrow for utility."

Majora's Mask doesn't need more than 4 dungeons, there's more than enough to do outside of those that it's irrelevant.

It's where the puzzles (like them or not, they're a big part of why a lot of us love Zelda) and the most action takes place.

I only used Recovery Potion +'s and upgraded my items to max.   The thing that bothered me about Character interactions, is that the character was annoying, or that it expected me to care about the characters without giving me adequate time to get to know the character and then a reason to give a shit about them.   I cared so very little for Impa and Zelda's friendship, while the sword saying ""Thank You"" and then effectively killing herself made me tear up a bit in front of my friends. Impa herself was cool and I was a little sad that Old Impa died immediately, but I didn't give a shit at all during the goodbye between Young Impa and Zelda.   It just didn't give me a reason to give a shit, and thus felt like a chore to go through the cutscene since it was so long.   And then, of course, the side characters weren't bad, they were the typical Zelda style NPCs. It's just the longest interactions were the most annoying, or I'd accidentally talk to someone and set off a long conversation with no way to back out. It quickly became tiresome, but I could avoid them.   HOWEVER, I loved everything else about the game. I liked Upgrading, didn't really mind having to find stuff except for when initially loading up for that day of playing, the music was fucking fantastic, even though there were only a few songs. Fi, while bothersome with the obvious comments, was somewhat endearing with her dances during learning a new song, and by the end, when she says that even in the alternate world that Demise creates for your fight, that she will be with you and you are not alone, I'd really enjoyed her simple character. Then, of course as I said above, putting the sword away made me tear up. Groose was amusing and his hardwork was endearing too.   There really was just too little interaction with Zelda for me to give a shit about her this game and all of the scenes she was in. Plus, she was fairly bland in the little characterization that she did get. She wasn't a ninja like in OoT, a Pirate like in WW, nor did she have a hardened-ish personality like TP Zelda. She was also not helpful at all, and could probably have explained all the shit and made everything easier in the beginning to me, when you first catch up to her.   I feel like I'm rambling a little bit now, and have said far more than I intended on saying about what I did and didn't like."

truezelda,2vt0nw,dizzlepwns,4,Sat Feb 14 00:41:57 2015 UTC,But the boss fights are the climax of the dungeon! The feels are so good when you figure out how to beat them and succeed.

truezelda,2vt0nw,Epicfaillord,5,Sat Feb 14 00:14:34 2015 UTC,Try Dark Souls. It seems like a perfect fit for you.
truezelda,2vt0nw,thunderling,2,Fri Feb 13 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of the same way - I much prefer the interacting with NPCs and exploration over dungeons. However the game still totally needs dungeons. They need something to break up the flow.  When I play a Zelda game, I love all the parts outside the dungeons because it feels majestic and fun and ""cool, what else can I explore?"" When it comes time to enter a dungeon though, I get this sense of dread. ""Fuuuck, this looks scary and hard..."" But I love that I even feel that way! I feel like that's what Link is feeling. Fetch quests for the sweet little townspeople are easy. But now it's time to get serious and break this curse. Of course it's going to be scary. That's what makes it all the more satisfying when you accomplish it."
truezelda,2vt0nw,zerachielle,2,Sat Feb 14 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"I would the dungeons to be more naturally integrated into the setting and for the architecture to more realistic/sensable. Like don't make a room be a place to use the spinner to go up and down levels; make it a broken stairwell with vines growing on the wall or points to use hookshots.  Some made sense like the Snowpeak Ruins being a decrepit mansion, but the Water Temple eludes me."

You might find it fun to get a buddy or two to play through games with you; even though they're single player, it's a lot of fun trading off with a partner. I'm playing through all the games with my roommate now this way, and it's been a blast.

truezelda,2vt0nw,LeMayMayPoster,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"My first Zelda was Wind Waker HD. I found the dungeons long and tedious, while I loved the sailing and exploration. In the past couple weeks I played through Ocarina of Time 3D, and I found the experience to be the exact opposite--I loved the dungeons, thought the towns were okay, and found actually getting to the dungeons to be difficult and tedious (the only things I ever got stuck on were overworld tasks). OoT taught me that 3D Zelda dungeons can be fun, so my guess is it really depends on the game.  Then again, since I borrowed a friend's Wii U for WW and thus can't replay it easily, I don't actually know what I'd think of the dungeons on a second playthrough. It's possible that now I'm more ""used to"" them, and I'd enjoy them more (for example, I remember getting stuck on figuring out to light the torches to advance for like 15 minutes).  I've also played ALBW but I don't think it's comparable to the 3D games' dungeons design-wise."

Dungeons for the sake of dungeons seem pointless to me. Dungeons that work for story line or to try and show bonds or whatever like OOT and MM work fine for me."
truezelda,2vt0nw,TedEmpty,1 point,Tue Feb 17 09:35:40 2015 UTC,The Dungeons are the most important part of the game in my opinion.  Twilight Princess has the amount of dungeons I'd expect from an epic like a Zelda game.

Maybe her storyline sometimes crosses with Link's, but you must stay hidden at all times, explaining her absence in his previous games. Definitely not a bad idea. 10/10 would play the shit out of that game."
truezelda,2vufbn,paulstarkey,-3,Sat Feb 14 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"her absence in his previous games.   Sheik doesn't appear in any other games because she isn't in any other games.  She's a disguise used by a single incarnation of Zelda.  Sheik is an awful character, really.  Shows up when it's convenient to be the game's guidepost for the player.  Acts as a glorified item-unlocker.  Does all of two heroic things (frees Ruto, ""helps"" Kakariko after Bongo-Bongo attacks) which we never actually see.  And of course, once she reveals herself to be Zelda, is wearing full princess regalia and becomes completely helpless.  Sheik as played by Zelda during OoT is not a character who deserves more storytelling.  Perhaps the original Sheik, if there was one (maybe the person the Sheikah race is named after?) might be deserving of their own game.  But that would also have to take place far before Skyward Sword, since the Sheikah were already around when Hylia was alive."
truezelda,2vufbn,Serbaayuu,2,Sat Feb 14 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"Guess I need to clarify for those that can't handle problem solving for themselves. Her absence in the rest of OOT**   Way too many people are far too uppity and pretentious about the Zelda series. OP had an idea, and wanted to share it - it's my favorite series above anything else, but I'm all about having some completely hypothetical and experimental conversation about it. It seems like everyone wants to shoot down shit like this with really detailed justification just to prove that they're more immersed in the series or more knowledgable.   I liked the idea, OP."

Either they don't change the gameplay enough, and as such : why bother changing it to zelda. or they change the gameplay enough, and in that case : why bother keeping it a LoZ game, if it could be a new franchise/series."
truezelda,2vufbn,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"My idea for a play-as-Zelda game:  The Next LoZ is mostly normal, you play as Link, Zelda is present active at the final battle (a la wind waker and twilight princess) and the final boss battle is REALLY hard, ensuring that most players will die/fail at least on the first try. This unlocks different ending cutscene that leads to a different reality, like how Link dying in OoT final battle generated its own timeline.   This allows for Nintendo to follow up with a pair of games, kind of like OoA/OoS, each take place at the same time in parallel timelines, one where Link succeeds and is the protagonist again, one where he fails, is captured, and must be rescued by Zelda  As for gameplay as Zelda, I think its already been established that she is an archer, so a lot of the action and battle mechanics would focus more on long range attacks, stealth, and generally a little more planning ahead as she cant just charge in and slash like Link. She would still have a melee attack tho  I know 2 games (or 3 if you include the game leading up to this) seems a little over-complicated, but part of the reason I thought of it in the first place was trying to think of a way Nintendo might actually take the risk of making a game where you play as Zelda, as they have been pretty conservative with series so far. They even stated one of their goals for the new Wii U game was to ""rethink the conventions of Zelda"", and while we certainly don't know everything about the game yet, the biggest change they've made seems to be changing Link's tunic from green to blue. The rest seems like a natural progression."
truezelda,2vufbn,dildokTheUnpleasant,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:32:32 2015 UTC,"I really love this.  I'm no hyper-feminist by any means, but one thing I think is so cool about it is that Zelda fans would be going against the male protagonist criticism and showing they just love Zelda period.  I think there are a lot of possibilities for gameplay like OP mentioned.  I don't think it would necessarily have to be Assassin's Creed-like.  I'm imagining sidling from WW but incredibly fast and gymnastically.  I think it would be cool to see where she goes following her snap-disappearances from Link.  Since we see a lot more of a Zelda character than Link, maybe even a more thematic/emotional take on the protagonist than Link.  For example, what is she experiencing seeing her kingdom being destroyed as she is forced to stay in hiding.  We only see Sheik with a hard face but maybe behind closed doors there is turmoil."
truezelda,2vufbn,bacloldrum,1 point,Sat Feb 14 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"I had an idea similar to this, where Zelda would have several different playstyles depending on what she is transformed into. She would have several forms, each of which is gained after training in a certain style. It would be somewhat similar to Majora's Mask, really.  Hylian Form: Magical Abilities and Archery, similar to Zelda in Smash Bros. Starting Form.  Shieka Form: Stealth-based fighter who uses quick, light, and hidden weaponry alongside martial arts. Gained near the beginning, from Impa.  Wolfos Form: Zelda Turns into a white wolfos, using a fighting style that revolves around speed and defense. Gained after training in the forest.  Burly Form: Zelda turns into a large goron-esque human that uses defense, offense, and fire magic, but is slow. Has heat resistance due to Goron Tunic being used in disguise; Gained from training with gorons, obviously.  Zora Form: Zelda turns into a Zora, using speed and offense with minor magical capabilities. Zelda gains increased swimming capabilities due to a zora tunic being used in the disguise. Gained From training with Zoras.  By going back for further training, Zelda can increase the power of each form and even transfer magical abilities and fighting styles to her basic forms, Hylian and Shieka."
truezelda,2vufbn,yay855,0,Sun Feb 22 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"You have an extremely basic plot synopsis.  Following OoT, clearly.  Where's the gameplay?"
truezelda,2vufbn,Serbaayuu,3,Sat Feb 14 05:32:42 2015 UTC,"Dude like I said, idea literally just hit me. When I asked for your guys opinions, I meant what would you add to the little world i've set up from the paragraph I typed. I did mention the skills of the Shiekah being implemented into the game via free run mechanics, and also the stealth play. But I would like to see different people approaches to the idea."
truezelda,2vufbn,Serbaayuu,-3,Sat Feb 14 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I definitely don't want AssCreed: Zeldo Edition.  And I also don't think Sheik has enough backstory to build a full game's plotline out of.  There is no resistance, and the effort to rescue the Sages doesn't start until Link wakes up (and then he does the vast majority of the heavy lifting).  For a playable Zelda, I would like to see a Dream Drop Distance-styled game in which we swap between Link and Zelda's perspectives throughout the game progressing through two different parts of the same story.  They could actually be partners - maybe even siblings.  That could work well as a New Hyrule game, where Zelda's character has been more-established as a person willing to get her hands dirty (though her character in general has been tilting closer to that for the past few years).  Link and Zelda could get kicked out of their city by a new Demise incarnation and have to work together with the world against them to reclaim it.  The gameplay would be traditional, only Zelda would have a different set of abilities and items than Link does, and her challenges would be geared toward that.  Obviously not 100% ""magic and wisdom"", because that would be stupid and cliche."

I just did it and realized that the stuff i was doing didnt need to be done after i stumbled upon the lens of truth. One benefit of doing it is that there are some gold skultulas.  I personally love how as a kid you get to go to the deku tree, dodongos cavern ,jabu jabus belly, bottom of the well and then the spirit temple as a kid for a bit.  you get to experience forest,fire,water,shadow and spirit as child link and then do the same thing as adult link with the temples."

There's no way you could kill him without it. He's easily the hardest boss in the game.  Secondly, don't you also need it to prompt the ghost in the desert to start guiding you through the desert to get to the Colossus?  This things would make the Lens required, although the rest of that dungeon is more for the completionist."
truezelda,2vtjlm,mistafree,7,Fri Feb 13 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"It's... rather different from most of the other Zelda games. It's more focused on sidequests and exploration than combat and dungeons.  Unlike what I normally say with video games, I would suggest trying to 100% the game the first time you play, and don't use a guide unless you're getting frustrated. What really makes the game immersive is its characters, and you can't get the full experience if you try to rush through the game."
truezelda,2vtjlm,cowmggh,2,Sat Feb 14 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"I greatly agree with this. Someone else here mentioned how the NPC interactions are like puzzles on their own accord, which is very true.  Another cool thing is that you do not need all the masks to finish the game, but you are rewarded if you do find them all, and your reward is something that brings a lot of speculation to the Zelda lore anyway. So, unlike other Zelda games where completing a trade quest or whatever simply results in a stronger sword or something, you can actually add a little bit more to the story at the end of the game if you make the effort to complete the whole thing.  MM can be dark at times. But what I like most is that I felt it was the first Zelda game that really started to dig into some deeper stuff in the Zelda universe. MM brings more in-depth backstories (Ikana Kingdom, the origins of some of the masks, etc), and a lot of that stuff is stuff that Zelda fans are still speculating about."
truezelda,2vtjlm,noopenusernames,4,Tue Feb 17 10:28:09 2015 UTC,"It's dark and unsettling, but insanely immersive. Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster. You'll probably feel crushed at some parts, but all in all it's still in my opinion the best adventure game ever made."

truezelda,2vtjlm,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:58:49 2015 UTC,"This is honestly the best TL;DR to what/how MM is.

truezelda,2vtjlm,IAMYourReason,1 point,Sun Feb 15 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"Really surprising this is the only one you haven't played. This was actually the game that introduced me to Zelda.  Clock Town is amazing.  The way the townspeople interact makes it feel way more real than say OoT Market, Kakariko, or WW Windfall.  I love the way the masks play into the game.  Playing as a Goron or Zora is a blast.  I would also argue that playing the ocarina plays an even bigger role than OoT.  Maybe not in terms of importance, but in frequency."
truezelda,2vtjlm,bacloldrum,1 point,Tue Feb 17 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Is rly good    Majora's mask is 'special' in that the dungeons are actually the lesser part of the game, both in duration and 'design' Mind you, the dungeons range from decent to good, but where the game truly shines (or fails if you don't like that) is in the areas leading up to the dungeons, and especially in all the sidequests.    The game itself is rather short if you just went straight for what you have to do. I'd say it is probably the shortest zelda game if you were to 'speedrun' (without glitches/skips) it. However because of the 3 day cycle and the immense amounts of different sidequests and interactions, it is also the sort of game you could be playing for many many times.    The bossbattles (in the original atleast, they were changed a bit in the 3DS version) range from amazing : Boss 2 and Final boss To lackluster/stupid : Boss 1 and 3 to 'situational fun' : boss 4, imo    The biggest tip I could give you is : read what everyone has to say very carefully, and look at interactions between items, npc's etc...    Also, just gonna give you the best tip straight out : Playing the song of time with double notes or reversed give you 2 hidden songs that are super helpful. (So instead of ABCABC, you play AABBCC, or CBACBA)"
truezelda,2vtjlm,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"Depends how old you are. For a child it seems impossible and (talking about the original game) confusing. In the original you couldn't save the way you did in Ocarina of Time and that made me quit the game early. If you're a teen who can find symbolism in books, it is a really really interesting and great game. The story is darker than that of OoT and WW and there is more character interaction than in OoT, the characters are given more to do that is important, side quests, while sort of optional, become more important. The game is dark in terms of the story and symbols, but it has a really sweet theme. It's hard for me to not praise it and not talk about what goes on in the game but it's really really good. it isn't as big as OoT, but the dungeons are you're supposed to get side tracked by side quests, the side quests make it less about fighting and connects it to the theme that you'll figure out. The game play is much more nerve wracking and demanding than OoT because you have ""3 days"" to save the world. Tips: it's actually kind of easy to find rupees in that game and get rich quick. using the hidden songs will be useful"

truezelda,2voxao,AKittyCat,3,Fri Feb 13 04:50:31 2015 UTC,"Not 100% accurate, but that is how most people choose to interpret it. It's actually because of how the original game was going to have time travel, and the main character was a ""Link"" between time periods. I posted a link to the interview with Miyamoto on another comment."

truezelda,2voxao,Serbaayuu,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Is there any evidence that ""link"" is a title?"
truezelda,2voxao,Petrichor03,7,Thu Feb 12 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"No, there's not. And if anything, Adventure of Link and Link's Awakening both tell us that ""Link"" is the actual name of the hero of those games.  You can maybe make the argument that other heroes not explicitly named Link could have different names, and the legends just incorrectly remember every hero being named Link, but if the games' titles and back stories have any canon weight to them, at least LoZ/AoL Link was named Link, ALttP/LA Link was named Link, and FS Link was named Link (as FSA's back story calls FS Link by name). Others could be officially named Link as well."
truezelda,2voxao,TheJaredactyl,6,Fri Feb 13 02:49:58 2015 UTC,"""Link"" is not so much a title, but a representation of the Player's ""link"" to the game. Miyamoto has also discussed how the original concept of the game was going to take place between past and future, and the main character was the only ""link"" between the two. http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/4/3598112/miyamoto-wanted-link-to-be-a-recognizable-character"
truezelda,2voxao,gilksc1,1 point,Fri Feb 13 14:21:22 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand your question.
truezelda,2voxao,NeuroCavalry,5,Thu Feb 12 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think he is asking if there is any weight to the idea that 'link' is a litle given to heroes - like Lord, Regent, King, ect. But 'link' for heroes. The implication would be that our green tunic friend has another name, and takes on the title 'link' when he becomes hero."
truezelda,2voxao,Petrichor03,19,Thu Feb 12 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"but is every mother in Hyrule naming her blonde son link in hopes he'll be a reincarnation?   I quite like that idea. Of course since every mother of the hero ends up dead before Link becomes a hero, maybe they should start reconsidering their name choices...  But I do think it has to be part coincidence and part the fact that the games only focus on eras where a hero is named Link. For example, the hero of men was a hero in Hyrule who most likely was not named Link. Swiftblade the First tells us that he can teach us a move that only those who wield the Picori Blade are able to use, and since only two people have ever wielded the Picori Blade, that heavily implies that Swiftblade the First is the hero of men/the other Picori Blade wielder (unless he somehow discovered the move by accident when he was tutoring the previous blade wielder).  So that's a bit of evidence in favor of the idea that at least one hero in green wasn't named Link. So perhaps other heroes that have been lost to time weren't named Link either, and the Zelda games only focus on the eras in which someone was named Link."
truezelda,2voxao,JCiLee,17,Thu Feb 12 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"My personal headcanon is that ""Link"" is actually Hylian for the English word ""hero.""  So if you imagine the timeline as one big legend, or a timeline of legends, every time that the teller refers to the hero of that time, he calls the hero a Link. Essentially making the word ""Link"" a Hylian-to-English paronym"

truezelda,2voxao,SvenHudson,7,Fri Feb 13 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"They're not all canonically named Link, or so Aonuma implied in one interview.   Skyward Sword backs up that notion by having Fi's voice acting consistently use the sound ""Mah-Dah"" in places where the text uses the player's name with ""Mah-Ree"" in places where she uses the term Master, causing most of her lines to start with the phrase ""Mah-Ree Mah-Dah"". I also think the phrase ""Saht-Put"" means Scanning or something.  The name Link is given to the player seemingly just for tradition's sake at this point."
truezelda,2voxao,ArcAngelofJustice,3,Fri Feb 13 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"Most of the games don't even canonically have the players speaking the same language. The scripts in most games are radically different and the language of Hyrule changes so drastically. I don't think recurring names are actually supposed to mean anything as most of the the language has completely changed, and recurring names are just ""translated"" to English or whatever for the sake of simplicity."
truezelda,2voxao,TeekTheReddit,2,Fri Feb 13 03:03:55 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad theory. After all, most modern era names have older counterparts that while phonetically different, retain the same meaning.  The ""Link"" from Skyward Sword and the ""Link"" from Ocarina of Time may have completely different pronunciations of their name, which we don't see since they are, by necessity, translated into English."
truezelda,2voxao,Lyude,5,Mon Feb 16 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"Well, we know that some Links are descendants of another one, like Link from Twilight Princess, so at least that one could be explained being a family name. And for example, in WW we know about the ceremony for every boy where they wear the hero's clothes, so the hero must be revered in their culture and maybe his name is a popular one for boys to have."
truezelda,2voxao,noopenusernames,3,Thu Feb 12 21:28:48 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that in most games, when meeting a new character, someone always points out; ""Your name is Link? what a strange name..."" Implies to me that it's not so much a popular name in Hyrule at all."
truezelda,2voxao,Lyude,2,Sun Feb 15 09:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I actually thought about that when writing my comment haha. Well, that doesn't happen in all games, we'd have to look at which games that happens. It could be explained if it just happened in the earlier games on the timeline, since the name wouldn't be popular until the hero becomes a legend. Also, NPC's say that your name is strange whatever name you pick for Link, so I'm not sure how to take that little detail."
truezelda,2voxao,Jammintk,2,Sun Feb 15 09:18:43 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is that ""link"" is the canon name in the same way Yu Narukami is the ""canon"" name in Persona 4 for the protagonist. The player has the option of picking whatever name they like, but there has to be a canon name for advertising or other media the character might appear in. (like the P4 animation or P4 Arena fighting game, or the Zelda novelizations/Graphic Novels and Smash Bros games)"
truezelda,2voxao,LeMayMayPoster,1 point,Fri Feb 13 06:36:42 2015 UTC,"This is how I see it. The only reason we know ""Link"" is that the Zelda series is so popular and they put his canon name in a few titles. For me, playing Fire Emblem Awakening, I named the protagonist after myself and completely forgot about ""Robin"" as the default name. It was weird for me to see the character referred to that way when s/he was announced for Smash."
truezelda,2voxao,Kafke,2,Fri Feb 13 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"""Link"" is just the default name by the game. They refer to him as Link for simplicity's sake. Each 'Link' has a different name (the one you put in as the player)."

That's just my head cannon anyway."
truezelda,2voxao,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:25:11 2015 UTC,There are only a few games where the character is explicitly stated as Link.   Link's awakening and Adventure of Link are the two that come to mind.  It is not guaranteed nor highlighted in most cames that the character you are playing is Link nor that the previous heroes have been Link.  After all in most of Hyrule's history they are referred to as the 'Hero of such and such'
truezelda,2voxao,1_1_11_111_11111,1 point,Tue Feb 17 09:41:39 2015 UTC,I like to think he's named Link because he's the missing link in the conflict over the Triforce and also is the major link between all the titles.

truezelda,2vo7aq,henryuuk,6,Fri Feb 13 11:15:33 2015 UTC,"For Majora's Mask you just need to know that the Ocarina of Time - the blue instrument Link starts the game with - has magical abilities based on what song is played on it, and it was given to him by Zelda at the end of OoT.

When I played as a kid I remember everyone taking about how dark and gruesome it was compared to the rest of the series. I didn't really understand it till I was a teenager and played it again. Just pay attention to everything and don't be afraid to ask questions about what it all means when you're finished.   There's a lot of information to be learned about Termina, especially considering this is the only game it's in, and everyone has a theory as to what it means. Try and make up your own mind before you dive down that rabbit hole. Enjoy the game with fresh eyes before you read people's thoughts on it.   Finally, just some basic information. This Link is the same the Link from Ocarina of Time. But he's the child Link from the time line where he goes back and prevents Ganondorf from gaining power. So he's saved Hyrule, but no one really knows all the work he did as an adult. Take that in consideration for how somber the mood is."

MM also came out only 2 years after OoT and practically uses the same engine."
truezelda,2vo72s,instantiatedObject,16,Thu Feb 12 17:44:03 2015 UTC,"He is not physically travelling in time but;  by the time Link travels forward in time Ganondorf has already corrupted the king. You see him meeting the king before you get the 2nd spiritual stone. He gains ultimate power the second you open the Door of Time and touch the Master Sword. There is no turning back at that point. Everything that's bound to happen will happen.  That's why the ending matters, Zelda sends you back to before you meet her and thus are able to alert her (and the king) at the moment Ganondorfs influence is at its weakest."
truezelda,2vo72s,elirosenau123,2,Thu Feb 12 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure ganondorf never truly 'corrupts' the king, he just gains his trust, and then kills him during his 'coup'"

The scene with Ganondorf chasing Zelda out should most definitely imply that."
truezelda,2vo72s,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Feb 15 23:19:33 2015 UTC,"When you go back in time to your childhood, recall that the Spiritual Stones are still there and the Door of Time is still open.  Link goes back in time to the instant he pulls the Master Sword - which is notably after Ganondorf has already gotten his hands on the Triforce of Power and most likely killed the king, or at least driven him and his family out.  During the events of Ocarina of Time, everything takes place in the Adult Timeline.  The Childhood Timeline doesn't ""start"" until Zelda sends Link back to his childhood, before they go get the Spiritual Stones, at the end of the game."
truezelda,2vo72s,MiT_Epona,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"I always assumed that once he grabbed the sword Ganondorf get the triforce of power. So even if you go back, he still has it and the ability to destroy everything. I think that when you go back in time at the end of the game, you spawn with Zelda in the castle, which is before you take the sword, so that is why she can stop everything before you get the sword and give Ganondorf the triforce of power."
truezelda,2vo72s,ArtistCook,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"I assumed that Link couldn't control what part of time he would go forward and back to.  So when he would go back in time it would be when he last left.  Thus when you do stuff as a child, go forward in time, and then back in time, the things you did as a child still happened.  Same thing when you go back in time and then go to the adult time.  Things are the way you left them and nothing restarted."

In OoT, he's destined to be the hero of time, however it's always been my understanding that he's too young at the start of the game to beat Gannon. So upon drawing the Master Sword, he is imprisoned (for lack of a better word) in the Sacred Realm with Rauru the Sage of Light in order to allow him to mature enough to become the hero he needs to be. Trouble is, that took seven years, and in the meantime Gannon had been wreaking havoc on all of Hyrule. By drawing or placing the sword in the Temple of Time, he is able to travel back and forth between the two time periods and only those two periods. After he defeats Gannon, he replaces the Master Sword and becomes a kid again.   That's always been my understanding of the lore."
truezelda,2vo72s,gabisver,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"there's also the thing to consider that no king would believe a kid claiming to have traveled 7 years into the future, especially a kid he never heard of before"
truezelda,2vo72s,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:49:31 2015 UTC,Due to the fact Link can only travel in time via the master sword (at this point in time) if he travelled back further in time he'd be trapped inside the temple of time with the master sword because the door would be locked.  Its possible the sword is also impossible to be removed until the stones have been awakened by the song of time and thus the door opened. This would thus make it impossible for him to travel forward in time again.
truezelda,2vo72s,xSymbiont,0,Tue Feb 17 09:47:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is what you're asking but:  You're correct. This is why the Zelda timeline splits into three timelines after OoT - the timeline where Link fails as an adult to stop Ganondorf, the timeline where Link succeeds as an adult in stopping Ganondorf and the timeline where Zelda sends Link back to reveal Ganondorf's treachery and Ganondorf is executed but some shenanigans happen and he doesn't really die. I'll look it up in my Hyrule Historia when I'm home."
truezelda,2vo72s,TheHynusofTime,0,Thu Feb 12 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"This actually happened, did it not? I'm pretty sure that after the credits of Ocarina of Time, when Link and Zelda meet in the courtyard, Link warns her of Ganondorf's future betrayal. We even see the consequences of this in Twilight Princess, where Ganondorf was sentenced to death."
truezelda,2vo72s,henryuuk,0,Thu Feb 12 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"Cause the title 'hero of time' is pretty stupid for that Link, he never actually travels through time by his own powers or abilities, and merely uses the pedestal of time to travel back and forth. And the pedestal of time only connects the very moment Link tries to pull the sword originally to 7 years later."
truezelda,2vo72s,Petrichor03,-1,Wed Feb 18 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"OoT operates off the sort of time travel logic that presumes that traveling through time can only fulfill the future, not change it. So once Link has seen the future, he can only fulfill it, not change it. This is how the Song of Storms came into existence, for example.  Of course the split timeline doesn't fit with this idea, but given all of the MM references that can be found in TWW, it looks like Nintendo didn't intend on going with a split timeline until well into the development of TWW at the earliest, which means this OoT plot hole only came into existence after TWW's release (unless we want to argue that the games don't support a split at all, in which case we'd have to discuss whether other things are or are not plot holes)."

truezelda,2vi94p,emelbee923,3,Wed Feb 11 07:20:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed - While not truly dynamic, the activity with the inhabitants is fantastic, particularly since it all ties into something that has to be done.  I also love the progressively more intense music as the days pass and the moon draws nearer."
truezelda,2vi94p,PwnosaurrusRexx,34,Wed Feb 11 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say the Hidden Village from TP. Not really a village because it's practically barren, but sniping monsters to western music is always so fun."

truezelda,2vi94p,aknight99,26,Wed Feb 11 12:14:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely Skyloft from Skyward Sword. How busy it was almost made up for the fact that it was the only real village in the game.   Windfall is a close second, though that might only be because of my love for Wind Waker."
truezelda,2vi94p,TripsEnvy,10,Wed Feb 11 06:16:11 2015 UTC,"I know there's a few more towns in MM but I feel the same way about Clock Town, I think that's why they made it so lively.   I love Windfall too, it's like the major lively hub city, but it's so laid back and amazing. Wind Waker is definitely my favorite game though, but even if it wasn't I bet I'd still love it."
truezelda,2vi94p,aknight99,8,Wed Feb 11 06:26:54 2015 UTC,"Subrosia Village from is one of my favorites for sure, not really sure why. The weird guys that love lava and digging for ore chunks was really fun, the stealth mission to get your feather back was interesting, and Rosa was the first virtual girl I went on a date with haha."
truezelda,2vi94p,0oKIRKo0,5,Wed Feb 11 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"I got Ages for Christmas as a kid, beat it quickly and fucking LOVED it, and was looking at random games in the store when I noticed OoS. I bought it immediately, went home, and played it at all possible times until I beat it. Man, I cannot get over Subrosia. It is so good. I absolutely loved the feel of that world, and the citizens, and just everything.  Thanks for reminding me!"

Man, I should really play that again. Can you get the Oracle games on the 3ds virtual store?"
truezelda,2vi94p,TRB1783,2,Wed Feb 11 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I dont hear much about Seasons or Ages too much anymore. Favorite hand held games to date, and yes you can get them on the eshop. I wanna they they are 6 dollars, just checked. [NA]"
truezelda,2vi94p,TRB1783,2,Wed Feb 11 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"I barely played Ages since I never owned it and just borrowed it from a friend a few times in elementary school. But a while after that my mom me bought a copy of Seasons at a garage sale for 5 bucks, it was my 3rd Zelda game I beat and I loved it at the time. I should get both of them soon, that isn't a bad price at all, thanks."
truezelda,2vi94p,TheMovieMaverick,8,Wed Feb 11 16:17:48 2015 UTC,I can't decide between Clock Town (MM) or Windfall Island (WW). They are both so lively and full of characters that have there own schedules and their own desires/needs. I spent so many hours playing around in these towns.
truezelda,2vi94p,TripsEnvy,5,Wed Feb 11 08:18:46 2015 UTC,"I gotta comment on my own post because I haven't seen anyone else mention them. But I also really love the Forest Haven in Windwaker, and the Goron city in OoT."
truezelda,2vi94p,TheJaredactyl,13,Wed Feb 11 13:20:41 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Kakariko from TP, though Outset Island from WW is a close second. I just love how tall Kakariko actually is(exploring the upper areas as wolf Link), and the fact that the Elde Inn is an actual, canon place in Kakariko(a pun, and an inn with a hot spring on the roof). It just generally has this great feel to it and I love the palette of the place."
truezelda,2vi94p,noopenusernames,5,Wed Feb 11 05:44:55 2015 UTC,"It is a great location and so fun to explore, I just wish it were more lively. If it was as energetic or lively as Hyrule Town it would definitely be my favorite in any game."
truezelda,2vi94p,BandGeek95,6,Wed Feb 11 05:57:59 2015 UTC,"TP Kakariko was actually everything I didn't like about that game. In an effort to for an abandoned Western vibe, they made the town empty, mono-tone, and boring. After the bustle and vibrancy  of Clock Town and Windfall Island, it was hugely disappointing to me."
truezelda,2vi94p,DyllG247,4,Wed Feb 11 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"Hyrule Town was incredible in TP though, much better than any other Hyrule Town in my opinion. Kakariko wasn't really meant to be the main hub like Clock Town or Windfall, it's just a side hub where your friends are hiding out."
truezelda,2vi94p,rainbowmoonheartache,4,Wed Feb 11 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Still, Outset Island was another big, busy town - no one says you have to have just one.   Much of TP felt like a step backwards in size, depth, and complexity  from Wind Waker, and Kakariko seemed to me where that all came together."
truezelda,2vi94p,xitlhooq,3,Wed Feb 11 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda game, but I think Ordon Village is as good a starter town as Outset, in my opinion.   I get what you mean though, WW was just huge, but it was mostly ocean, but TP feels so small in comparison, but I feel it's better to compare TP to Ocarina of Time.   I think TP is meant to be like that, it's obviously meant to be based on the Hyrule locations we knew in Ocarina, but it's older and dilapidated. I think it's meant to be a sign of the way Hyrule is now, compared to how lively and beautiful it was during the child time in Ocarina."
truezelda,2vi94p,Serbaayuu,9,Wed Feb 11 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"I gotta say Mabe Village.  Even though Clock Town and Kakariko from the 64's are the first to enter my mind, the wackiness of Mabe Village inside the weirdness of Koholint Island really stands out for me."
truezelda,2vi94p,SpahsgonnaSpah,5,Wed Feb 11 05:32:16 2015 UTC,"That is a great one. Man it's been ages since I've played Links's Awakening, it's so unique."
truezelda,2vi94p,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Feb 11 05:37:00 2015 UTC,"I'm playing through it now for the first time. Currently in the 5th dungeon. I love the wacky references everywhere (also, piranha plants?!?), it really makes the game stand out."
truezelda,2vi94p,SpahsgonnaSpah,2,Thu Feb 12 01:13:22 2015 UTC,It is amazing and it gets better as you go on. I wish they'd do another really weird or unique game like Awakening or MM again.
truezelda,2vi94p,Link5794,4,Thu Feb 12 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of Skyward Sword, but Skyloft was just so pretty and well designed. But I think my favourite has to be Clock Town from Majora's Mask. There's just so much to do, and it's one of the few towns in TLoZ that actually feels inhabited, there are so many NPCs!"
truezelda,2vi94p,Serbaayuu,4,Wed Feb 11 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"Aw man this is a tough question.  The villages in Majora's Mask were awesome. Clock Town and the Zora Domain are so lively. You could spend hours just doing side quest stuff in Clock Town. And it's one of the few towns where you feel like there's actual character development from NPCs. I spent so much time growing attached to just the events in the Inn.  Windfall is pretty fun and lively too. Like, you would want to live there. I only wish they made it a little bigger with a couple of more 'homes' on the island.  Oddly enough, I always found the towns (especially the ones later in the game) in Zelda 2 to be pretty cool. Yeah, they're simple, but that's what I like. At that point in the timeline, Hyrule is pretty much in the gutter, but these little towns with a few people in each one have managed to survive surrounded by shit tons of monsters and no one to come to their aid if they need it.  Plus, they have those prostitutes that link goes to for health and magic (seriously, am I the only one who thought that thats what was going on?  ""Come into my house and i'll make you feel better"" >they go inside and close the door. 30 secs later, they come out and Link goes about his way and the woman just solicits outside her house again< This is even more disturbing when you think about who he goes to for magic.... Apparently Link is into the GMILFS too."
truezelda,2vi94p,zudomo,2,Wed Feb 11 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah MM has some great ones, the Zora Domain in MM is definitely my favorite Zora town in the series.   Windfall is my favorite town of all but it does have a lack of buildings. I really always wondered where anyone but the rich guy actuallylived.  The ones in Zelda 2 reminded me of early Final Fantasy towns, not much story behind them, but still cool and distinct in their own ways. And I guess I never looked at it that way but it makes sense."
truezelda,2vi94p,cnskatefool,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:24:36 2015 UTC,Zelda II is much more fun with a mind in the gutter.

truezelda,2vi94p,KingKolder,7,Thu Feb 12 14:28:13 2015 UTC,I actually really love Skyloft from SS. I like how it's so fleshed out. :)
truezelda,2vi94p,stryker101,3,Wed Feb 11 05:42:48 2015 UTC,Ordon Village is such a warm place. You feel connected to people there with all the stuff you do for them in the intro. Link even have his little job. The place looks beautiful. The times I got back there to give news from the lost kids!
truezelda,2vi94p,BaltarForPresident,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:40:19 2015 UTC,"Ordon is tied as my favorite starting location with Outset from WW. They're both just so pure and friendly and it makes them somewhat different than the rest of the world (the Kokiri village in OoT is similar but Link is an outcast in a lot of ways though and it doesn't feel as much like home). It's sort of like The Shire in a lot of ways, at least that's how I see it."
truezelda,2vi94p,SimplisticBiscuit,4,Thu Feb 12 04:49:39 2015 UTC,"Windfall Island is my favorite, but Clock Town is objectively the best hub in the series."
truezelda,2vdcp9,CaptainFalconProblem,14,Tue Feb 10 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"The very first Zelda I ever played was ALttP which was given to me by my uncle as a hand-me down along with his SNES. To this day I still love that game. The very next game I played was (again, on behalf of my uncle) OoT on his N64. I loved both games for different reasons. I think that gamers of my (and presumably your) generations who grew up on these games will always have a soft spot for them. But as far as segues go I'm not sure if either really provides a good segue for the other as they are both very different styles of gameplay and arguably rely upon an entirely different mindset with which to approach the various challenges found within them.  To me, both OoT and ALttP still felt large in both depth and scale and the environments immersive, even though the SNES had obvious hardware limitations. The gameplay felt ""simpler"" on ALttP but I feel the fighting was a little less forgiving on the older 2d games versus the newer 3d ones. To clarify, I've always felt that the older games relied very heavily on figuring out boss patterns. Which is not to say that any of the newer games don't rely on that, its just the movement limitations in the 2d games made any deviation from that pattern slightly less forgiving and thus more challenging (to me at least)."
truezelda,2vdcp9,Noob_tuba23,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"I liked the points you bring up. Good read. I especially agree with your commentary about combat. Would you say newer 3D games can ever capture the same level of intelligent approaches that you need for 2D games? And is the change in combat approach style a result of game evolution or just the differences between 3D and 2D, in other words could a modern 2D Zelda game such as LBW do what the older 2D games did so well, or is that from an old time gone?"
truezelda,2vdcp9,Noob_tuba23,4,Tue Feb 10 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the addition of a z-axis completely revolutionized combat in my opinion. So yes, I think the change in fighting style was a natural evolution in that regard. It was no longer just run forward, dodge projectiles and stab something. Take the very first boss fight in OoT for instance. Any other times in older games when you fought gohma or something like her, you just run forward and stab her eye and try not to get hit. Now you have to do the same thing, but then track her up to the ceiling, aim, and hit her in the eye again with a projectile. Much more complicated.  But really, I'm not sure if the newer games should try and capture the same level of thinking required for 2d games because, honestly, its not needed in 3d gaming. 3d games do so many things well and expanded so eloquently on the framework laid by the 2d platforms, so what would be the point of attempting to recreate an older style of gaming?   I really, really love what ALBW did when they revisited the idea of a 2d(ish), top-down approach to gaming. The addition of the ability to merge with walls added an entire new dimension (pun intended) to the aspect of problem solving in that game. When I first played the game, I got stuck for a literal hour at one point because I couldn't cross this small chasm. I never even considered to just merge with the wall and walk over because I had erroneously and foolishly adopted a 2d mindset to play that game. The walls, as in other 2d zelda games, were just off-limits to me and I never considered the possibility that I would be able to use them in that manner. So in that way, ALBW managed to break the mold of a 2d, top-down game and give it a new, revitalized feel and I absolutely loved that game and Nintendo for it."
truezelda,2vdcp9,TheJaredactyl,2,Tue Feb 10 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"A Link Between Worlds was truly one of the best entries in the series, and for many reasons. It felt like ALttP in that it's the same world, the same gameplay, but they added in that single extra feature with going into the wall, and that changed everything. You had to think about the puzzles with a 3D mindset now, and it created a beautiful juxtaposition between 2D and 3D."
truezelda,2vdcp9,K10S,2,Wed Feb 11 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"I grew up with the 2D games and seeing how the series and the industry evolved into 3D,  added an extra layer of greatness to the games.  OoT was the first game that ever got 3D Puzzles and sword combat right (especially with the invention of Z-Targeting), hell it was the first game to get any kind of 3rd person view combat right.   Of course thats not something that you can recreate today since we have gotten so used to controlling characters in a 3d world. However you can still see how a game evolved and how it added new things to the series with each game. Whenever I start a new series I prefer to start in a chronological order to get a sense of advancement in gameplay, graphics and just ideas in general that are used in games.  For example I started playing the Metal Gear Series for the first time last year. I had already played Metal Gear Solid for the PS1 back when it came out but I never played any of the other games. I started with the MSX2 games and worked my way up to the PS3 titles. I think that it is a much more rewarding experience overall to see a game series evolve in that way. You would be surprised how many things that make the Metal Gear series unique started out in the 2D games.  So I think that you should definetly start with the 2D games, but only because they came out first. This way you will get a lot more enjoyment out of the series as a whole."
truezelda,2vdcp9,_surligneur,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's personal preference. I started on OoT when it was released, and loved it to death. My next zelda game was Link's Awakening on gameboy, and my young mind struggled to appreciate the nuances that make the 2D games just as strong as their flashier 3D cousins. Returning to some of the older 2D games as an adult, I feel I can appreciate them much more fully than a 10 year old could.   So you could say I was spoiled by starting in 3D, but you might have found I went through the same preference at that age, and with the mind blowing jump to 3D, anyway. On my return to 2D, I found them to be very enjoyable once I realised that graphics weren't everything."
truezelda,2vdcp9,Ginger_Shepherd,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"My first Zelda was A Link to the Past. I wanted it at a young age because I had this fixation on playing and beating the Nintendo Power Top 100 Nintendo games starting at #1.  I enjoyed the game enough but either out of sucking at it or a lack of effort  on my part it fell the way side until a friend shown me Ocarina of Time.    I got ALttP used without a box from a Funcoland,  borrowed Ocarina before buying it, and bought the original LoZ and Zelda II through a yard sale collection. I only found out this year that both the original Legend of Zelda and A Link to the Past had not only the sort of detailed maps I would have loved to read on a car ride or waiting for my pancakes at Bickfords as a kid, but that they included maps that made a huge difference in how reasonable the difficulty is.  I loved manuals when I was a kid especially when they had detailed pictures or lists of enemies for me to have  had imaginary battles with when I had a room to myself.  I'd love to go print out the manual and map for the original Zelda or A Link to the Past, hop into a time machine and say ""Don't tell anyone who gave this to you.... but it's dangerous to go alone.  Take this."" as I hand 6 year old me the stuff.    Maybe I would have sucked at the games a lot less.  ...or I would have spent more time waging imaginary wars with Aquamentus.  who knows?  Edit: I want to make my point much clearer.  I don't think the format would make a difference for me.  I needed a complete experience to give it a fair chance.    The original Legend of Zelda's boxcover art mentions an important map.  It was not only so revolutionary that they had to market it a bit for having one, but that map raised the standard for how much information or polish they give a manual.  The game itself says ""please see manual"" during the intro and frankly some of the game's ports' manuals are subpar at best.... especially the Gamecube port's manual.  A Link to the Past continued that tradition albeit without needing to mention the map.  I would have liked 2D or 3D first just fine.  I don't fair well without the very things Nintendo felt I needed to appreciate the game.  You're supposed to read the instructions when putting together a bicycle or a desk.  Same logic learning a new game.  Double edit:  Who on earth is downvoting posts on here?  It's not for when you disagree with someone.  I'm seeing valid opinions that answer the question getting downvoted.  Hell, this isn't even a topic where floods of responses are happening where someone would be tempted to downvote others to get closer to the top.  So, whomever you are, do yourself a favor and gain a better sense of Reddiquette."
truezelda,2vdcp9,Bruc3w4yn3,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:04:37 2015 UTC,"My first introduction to Zelda was actually the second one. My cousin was playing it and I was so excited I dragged my dad out that day to buy it. I was in for a huge surprise when I picked up the first one thinking they were the same. It took years of playing and collaborating with friends to get through, and it left a big impression on me.   I switched to Sega after the NES, though, so I completely missed out on aLttP the first time, and I wasn't into handheld games so Link's Awakening didn't grab my attention. It wasn't until OoT came out that I played another Zelda game, and it couldn't have been more engrossing. For me the changes were so novel I was thoroughly astonished through the entire game. Even to the point that after beating it I would still just play to wander Hyrule field and pick out its secrets.   I have since played aLttP, and I feel very much the same thrill at that world. I long for that balance between story and immersion those games had that I feel has been absent in the later console games."
truezelda,2vdcp9,Bross93,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"Most of my friends started with the 3d ones, and none of them can get through a 2d one. This just makes me crazy! Cause the 2d ones are spectacular. Actually, I MUCH prefer the 2d ones, and think that playing the 3d ones afterwards makes what they accomplished in the third dimension even more incredible.   I always suggest starting with a 2d one, namely LTTP"
truezelda,2vdcp9,TheJaredactyl,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:19:08 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your generation of gaming. People like myself, and obviously many others here, started with the 2D games, like A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, because that's all there was. I remember when OoT came out, and the 3D environments blew my mind, simply because there had never been anything like it before. Today's gamers will have a hard time appreciating the 2D games when they started with 3D, because they are just so much more accessible. Modern games don't grant players much freedom, and getting used to the 3D Zelda world where everything is more or less handed to you, will make players easily bored when met with some of the puzzles and challenges offered in the arguably more difficult 2D games.  Not to mention the focus on combat that is found in the newer 3D games. Defeat the enemies, get the item. Very rarely is any intuitive thought required to earn your rewards in 3D games. Outside of bosses, the 2D games only rewarded you when you managed to solve a puzzle, or figure out a new way to use an item to progress.  tl;dr People who play 3D games first will have a harder time going back and enjoying the 2D games, while those of us who started with 2D can appreciate both more easily."
truezelda,2vdcp9,solaris1990,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"I started with OOT and MM (Gamecube bundle circa 2002). TMC sort of disappointed me in comparison and I can't remember Link's Awakening well, but the two DS games I really enjoyed dungeon-wise and felt they had some advantages over the 3D games... I think it is a matter of taste."
truezelda,2vdcp9,Noahtheboatguy69,0,Thu May 21 18:24:15 2015 UTC,My first game was phantom hourglass. This game is good but it can't compare to the rest of the series. This made appreciate how awesome all of the other Zelda games that I have played (except skyward sword fuck that game) instead of arguing that one game is better than the rest of the series
truezelda,2vdcp9,edibleroach,0,Tue Feb 10 13:26:48 2015 UTC,"I personally don't care about the game play so long as the story is complimented by it.  I started with Ocarina of Time, to Majora, then backwards to Zelda's 1 and 2 then LTTP, then back to Wind Waker when it was released.  I didn't think the style really mattered to me whichever game I played.  I actually thought that the inability to do more complex motions in the 3D games made the 2D games more challenging and therefore more rewarding.  As for the overworld, each game has it's own way of making Hyrule seem huge, whether it is sections of the map through the 2D games or a view of the world in 3D.  Like I said, story was what was most important to me."
truezelda,2vdcp9,TheJaredactyl,2,Tue Feb 10 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"I agree there with the 2D games being rewarding. I love the 3D games, but most of the love stems from taking in the world and enjoying the immersive adventure. However, the 3D games all have a tendancy to hold your hand and give you plenty of freebies. Playing the 2D games, they really make you think more. Things were much more open and free, and discovering secrets and solving puzzles was much more satisfying when things weren't placed right in front of you."
truezelda,2v9ph0,venom20078,35,Mon Feb 9 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"As a character, Midna is arguably the best. But Fi is my favourite don't hate me pls"
truezelda,2v9ph0,KashK10,21,Mon Feb 9 05:34:02 2015 UTC,"I really like Fi, too.  This is a weird analogy, but I've always really loved games that build up the ""central"" Hyrule mythos and feel like a coherent story.  Many Zelda games, even though they are good games, feel like ""Straight to DVD Sequels"" in terms of story (e.g., most recently ALbW).  One thing that I really appreciated about Skyward Sword is that it broke the ALttP/OoT mold and didn't simply have us run around the same version of Hyrule we're used to.  But it still felt like a very important chapter in the Hyrule mythos, and it felt like it really contributed to and meshed with the overall storyline.  For that reason, I'll always really like Fi."
truezelda,2v9ph0,Aujury,9,Mon Feb 9 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like Fi could have been my favorite. I love the idea of a game exploring the forging of the Master Sword and all that. The problem was that, while conceptually she's super cool, the way they did her (constantly talking about nothing, stopping you every five minutes, etc.) made her unbearable.  If she were as hands-off as, say, Tatl or the King of Red Lions, she'd probably be one of my favorites."
truezelda,2v9ph0,pocketsan,3,Mon Feb 9 17:20:12 2015 UTC,Do was my favorite as well. Although it was her theme that made start to fall for her. After the goodbye scene how could I not.   Btw I drive a dark purple Ford Fiesta and of course named her Fi. She assists it me getting where I need to go and then her navigation and Bluetooth voice is oddly similar.
truezelda,2v9ph0,clicky_pen,28,Mon Feb 9 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"My (totally cliche) answer is Zelda in Spirit Tracks.  By far the most useful sidekick in terms of gameplay, and watching her develop from a naive princess into a caring, hardened warrior is amazing."
truezelda,2v9ph0,WakeUp_SmellTheAshes,7,Mon Feb 9 05:32:19 2015 UTC,"Could not stand her at the beginning of the game, but by the end she had me giggling and tearing up!"
truezelda,2v9ph0,clicky_pen,7,Mon Feb 9 12:19:06 2015 UTC,Zelda and Link are adorable and hilarious in that game.  It's so disappointing that people haven't played ST or don't discuss it very much because it does everything right for a portable Zelda.
truezelda,2v9ph0,IstheLieReallyaCake,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:39:03 2015 UTC,Besides the train. And the touch controls. Etc.
truezelda,2v9ph0,clicky_pen,6,Mon Feb 9 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"The train was fine and the touch controls were perfected after Phantom Hourglass. The biggest issue with ST was the limited amount of sidequests, but there were actually quite a few secret dungeons and locations to explore, and there were a handful of minigames scattered throughout the map.  I understand that people were thrown off by the rail system, but it was essentially a modified version of WW's and PH's sailing - you had a bunch of ""islands"" of temples and cities, with places to explore around them and warp points to help you out, but you could control your speed as well."
truezelda,2v9ph0,rokuthirteen,2,Mon Feb 9 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"That's true that the tracks were just an over world modification to WW's seas, but WW's seas weren't perfect either.  ST is fun outside of the tracks, and that's honestly enough for me. That said, that doesn't make the tracks any better. They aren't just a hang up to get used to. They were consistently a distraction, in my opinion.   I still enjoyed the game overall, but it was due to the other elements and in spite of the overworld."
truezelda,2v9ph0,clicky_pen,3,Tue Feb 10 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Not to nitpick, but I didn't say WW's seas were perfect. My point was mainly that people pigeonhole ST's train as somehow ""limiting"" the overworld when, like you said, it was really a modification of other games' overworlds, namely WW and PH.  Personally, I find the trains to be an enjoyable change to the transportation system. The raiders, demon trains, escort missions, and changeable parts were all entertaining, and they made me think on my feet.  To often in Zelda games I find myself just sort of ""passing through"" the overworld with not much going on, and ST didn't really have that. I can understand why people find them frustrating though. You have to always watch the train."
truezelda,2v9ph0,WakeUp_SmellTheAshes,-2,Tue Feb 10 04:28:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like the train control, it was a lot of down time that wasn't much fun to sit through. And honestly, I don't think it's a great game outside of Zelda."

truezelda,2v9ph0,robotortoise,2,Mon Feb 9 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"My (totally cliche) answer is Zelda in Spirit Tracks.   Actually, most people just say Midna."
truezelda,2v9ph0,Phoxxent,20,Mon Feb 9 14:32:34 2015 UTC,How could you leave out Ezlo? He's the best! He wasn't some trope-y tsundere (is that the right one? Whatever. I mean bitch archetype) and he also didn't interrupt you every 5 minutes telling you how to do your side quests.
truezelda,2v9ph0,robotortoise,11,Mon Feb 9 14:28:44 2015 UTC,He was like an angry army general.  But I love him for it.
truezelda,2v9ph0,Aujury,19,Mon Feb 9 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"Navi always holds a special place in the heart for being first.  But I'd say Midna was by far the best.  She was a true dynamic character, played an extremely important role in the story, and had a well-developed personality (Navi essentially had no personality, and Fi didn't have a personality so much as she talked with a weird ""accent""). But maybe more importantly, for the most part Midna just shut the hell up and didn't constantly harass you unless you used her menu to dialog with her."
truezelda,2v9ph0,clicky_pen,12,Mon Feb 9 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME!! :D  I'm gonna be an obnoxious piece of crap for a second and say that I really don't understand the Midna love. Like, she's definitely at the bottom of my list.  For the entire first part of the game she's, like, actively trying to piss me off??? Being needlessly antagonistic and just generally frustrating; more than once I'd thought ""Midna, you've demonstrated you have the ability to help me so HELP ME INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING THERE AND TAUNTING ME"". She gets better toward the end of the game, I guess, but the damage had already been done for me and I just could not like her by that point.  Sure, she's probably the most well-developed of the side characters, but I'll take a less-developed nice character over a well-developed and unjustifiably annoying one."
truezelda,2v9ph0,Aujury,8,Mon Feb 9 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"Midna is kind of a combination of Tatl and Tetra in personality, except that while Tatl and Tetra were humbled pretty early on in the game, or knew when to reel it in, Midna's ""humbling"" moment came about halfway through the game. I can see why that would have been too late for you"
truezelda,2v9ph0,instantiatedObject,6,Mon Feb 9 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand how that can be frustrating.  But that's also why I like her so much.  She does act like a bitch at first--well, more accurately, a princess.  She embodies all the negative qualities that can be associated with princesses--she's entitled, selfish, and treats everyone else like they're less than her, and she just uses people for her own means.  Moreover, she's a scorned princess and she's excessively bitter toward everyone.  She thinks everyone is her enemy and out to get her.  What's beautiful about her is how she develops over time.  Although people complain about how little Zelda is in TP, her few scenes are extremely important to Midna's development.  Minda learns from Zelda what it means to be selfless and put your kingdom first.  And Midna slowly starts to embody those traits: she slowly begins to become kinder and even helpful.  By the end of the game, she is willing to sacrifice what she wants and her own goal for the greater good.  She transforms from a bitter, selfish, unlikeable shrew into a giving, caring, selfless princess.  She learns what being royalty should mean.  It's a beautiful story and a huge reason I love Midna."
truezelda,2v9ph0,Empha,3,Mon Feb 9 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate that! I think that my main issue is just that it takes too long for her to get to that point, so by the time she does I'm already pretty settled on not liking her. I guess that the overall arc just didn't do it for me, haha. I can see now, though, why you liked her story! :)"
truezelda,2v9ph0,_S0UL_,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:06:53 2015 UTC,"yeah, she's way too ""tsundere""-ish for my tastes."

truezelda,2v9ph0,iNachozi,6,Mon Feb 9 05:26:52 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely on point with your description. However, I imagine the reason she doesn't get brought up is because of how bland she is. Like, she's got no real personality or anything interesting about her; after I finished the game I pretty much forgot she existed 'cause she didn't leave any sort of impression on me."
truezelda,2v9ph0,astewy17,5,Mon Feb 9 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"It's not her fault, Linebeck is just so cool and amazing that he steals all the attention."

truezelda,2v9ph0,astewy17,13,Sat Feb 14 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing any King of Red Lions love!  I thought he was a very well-done, interesting, and tragic character.  The end had me tearing up."
truezelda,2v9ph0,GomaN1717,2,Mon Feb 9 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"I felt he was too confined, and that he didn't make nearly as much of an impression on me as the others due to that.  Almost all of the companions are by your side 24/7. They're with you through the temples, through the boss battles, for the vast majority of the game. I play through the games with these characters at my side, and that's a big part of why I connect/bond with them.  The King of Red Lions doesn't face anything with you. He's confined to his boat, so you're alone in the dungeons, you're alone in the boss battles. The biggest threat he faces with you are some big octoroks which are really easy to kill. Even with Ganondorf- he shows up for a few moments just before you start the final fight, but then he just disappears again until it's all over.  The limitations are understandable, after all he is a boat for the majority of the game, and I really do like the character. It's just that compared to the others he doesn't stand a chance. There's just not nearly as many opportunities/experiences to connect with him."
truezelda,2v9ph0,jesuswig,2,Tue Feb 10 01:09:27 2015 UTC,"While I agree that from a technical standpoint he is a much less useful sidekick, I personally don't think it keeps the player from forming a relationship with him.  Maybe you thought otherwise, and that's cool.  But I really liked him as a character and really felt like he and Link were a fantastic team.  I mean, the game takes place on a huge ocean and the King is Link's boat.  You could get through the game without most of the sidekicks (I think? Haven't played every single Zelda. I know when I first played OoT I hadn't really got the hang of targeting so Navi was worse than useless for me).  The vast majority of the game would have been impossible without that snarky old boat."
truezelda,2v9ph0,TheHynusofTime,39,Tue Feb 10 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"I guess I'd say Tatl, especially because the dynamic between her and Link is pretty interesting. She's not like, ""assigned"" to Link like Navi, The King of Red Lions, or Fi. She genuinely wants nothing to do with Link until Tael's essentially held hostage by Skull Kid. It's really interesting to see her develop as a character alongside Link."
truezelda,2v9ph0,saintjimmy64,4,Mon Feb 9 05:06:54 2015 UTC,In the middle of playing Minish cap for the first time. I'm really liking Ezlo.
truezelda,2v9ph0,Vivo999,3,Mon Feb 9 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"My favorite companion is, and always has been Navi. However, I wouldn't call her the best, not even close honestly. That would probably be Midna, because she gets more development than any other character across every single Zelda game."
truezelda,2v9ph0,TRB1783,0,Mon Feb 9 07:49:08 2015 UTC,The only one with a personality.
truezelda,2v9ph0,henryuuk,4,Mon Feb 9 05:45:51 2015 UTC,"Navi. Yeah I said it! Midna is a favorite but Navi was perfect from both a Gameplay perspective and a character one. For one she never required an animation to talk to you, so if she needed to talk to you it was immediate. The subsequent games? WW Link had to take a stone out of his pocket. Midna and Fi have to materialize from somewhere. It seems like a nitpick, but this has to happen every. Single. Time. This is likely why most people hate Fi. Sure the information wasn't the most useful, but waiting for him to come out and go back in every single time was a huge hastle. Navi is instant though. She flits in and out of Link's hat.   Not only is she just plain convenient, but she's helpful the right amount. She's not like Fi where's she's overly casual friendly. People love to harp on how annoying she is but really...was she? If I remember correctly she would always give a vague general hint to push the player in the right direction. Not only this but you only had to press her prompt once per play-through or if she has something new to say. That's it. She's honestly one of the least intrusive companions and for that she's wonderful  But honestly the ultimate reason, and the reason why she's by far my favorite, is that she actually fights beside you. She's an active member and part of the reason Link is able to do what he does. Remember the final fight with Ganon? This little tiny fairy thing bravely says that she's going to fight right beside you. Essentially flying into this monstrosities face just so you can better target him. If that doesn't warrant best companion I don't know what does.  Also, she's the only companion Link actually cares to chase down and find and really grows a bond with from what we see in the game. TP Link, WW Link, and SS Link all let there companions go without really a second thought."
truezelda,2v9ph0,GoldBananas,6,Mon Feb 9 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"I'll go with Navi. She holds a special place in my heart for being first, and she also left. You never forget the one that got away.  I also think she was more informative than Tatl. Navi's blurbs on the enemies did a lot to flesh out the world of OoT."
truezelda,2v9ph0,henryuuk,7,Mon Feb 9 08:41:46 2015 UTC,"Fi, I miss my little dancer AI.  And I always liked Linebeck up to the point of shedding a single tear when seeing Linebeck III ALthough he isn't really a sidekick"

Navi is high up because of NoStAlGiA. Fi is higher than most would place her because although she was intrusive I found her constant use of percentages quite funny. For me, King of the Red Lions was by far the most uninteresting sidekick, a king of personality-less charisma-vacuum whom I felt no attachment to."

truezelda,2v9ph0,stryker101,2,Mon Feb 9 14:33:48 2015 UTC,"I think Midna was the best because she had more depth to her character than Navi, Tatl, and Fi, but also did badass stuff, like when you attack Hyrule Castle."
truezelda,2v9ph0,TheJaredactyl,2,Mon Feb 9 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Midna, Ezlo, Tatl. In that order. Best sidekicks ever."
truezelda,2v9ph0,Noahtheboatguy69,2,Mon Feb 9 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"Midna is easily my favorite. She's also one of my absolute favorite characters from the series. I liked the growth she went through, and her story added a great, and much needed, new dynamic to the standard Link/Zelda/Ganondorf stories in the series.   Navi is a relatively close second. One of the biggest reasons I love Navi is that she provided little tidbits of information and background about all the enemies I was facing, and told me what they were called. That's a big part of why I always found her more useful than annoying. I enjoyed exploring Hyrule with her hovering around me, and when I was younger I definitely appreciated that she stuck around in the creepier places like the Well and the Shadow Temple. I also found her presence pretty comforting as well. You come out of the Temple of Time for the first time as Adult Link, and the whole world has fallen apart, but she's still right there with you- from the beginning to the very end. I really enjoyed her."
truezelda,2v9ph0,KBewts,3,Mon Feb 9 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"Midna is also my favourite character in the series. She was the first character to really undergo serious development, and really get you emotionally invested in her.

truezelda,2v9ph0,UnoriginalAnonn,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:15:05 2015 UTC,Midna is absolutely the best character. She has the most personality and plot-relevancy of all of them. Unfortunately tells you nothing about enemies. Messing around with Fi is actually quite fun. The little details about characters and so on you learn is pretty cool.
truezelda,2v9ph0,UnoriginalAnonn,0,Tue Feb 10 13:07:19 2015 UTC,"Sooooo..... I know it's not canon, but would Proxi basically count as Navi? She was annoying as shit too.  My vote is for the King of Red Lions, but that's probably because Windwaker is my favorite Zelda game."
truezelda,2v9ph0,Vivo999,-2,Wed Feb 11 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"Let me just talk about Navi for a second. Navi was kind of a little shit.  I honestly feel like before everything happened she was probably the rudest and laziest fairy and was annoying the hell out of the Great Deku Tree all day long just talking and complaining about nonsense. I also feel like when a fairy is assigned to a Kokiri that it's a great honor and all the forest fairies  wonder who they will get and it's like a coming-of-age sort of thing. But not to Navi. Navi could care less and just wants to sit in a tree all day and do whatever. She had no interest in something like that.  She didn't want to feel like she had any obligation and the Deku Tree was so tired of it that the first chance he had to get rid of it he took it. I feel like The Great Deku Tree could have given him a fairy with a better attitude just as easily, but he knew he was dying anyway and he just wanted some peace and quiet before he actually passed on. He probably had to do some serious convincing to get her off her bum to go help Link, like even saying something like she was the only one who could do it. Which probably inflated her ego and made her feel like she was super important so she said alright and went around the village saying hey to everyone feeling like she's somebody, then saw Link and realized how much work it was going to be.  The first thing Navi does when she meets Link is complain and call him lazy. She seemed rather annoyed to be given this task to watch over him and feels like when he's done saving the world like the Deku Tree probably briefed her on then she could just go back to her business.   The wiki says ""Although she is initially a little frustrated with this duty and does not believe Link capable of acts of heroism, she soon becomes much fonder of him, and they become an inseparable team."" but I can't actually recall any dialog exchanged between the two that suggests her becoming fond of Link.  The entire game was her complaining and trying to get Link to finish his main duty. Telling him to Listen up and yelling at him and telling him they need to go do his duty. Always kept reminding him of his job and where they need to go. While you're doing side quests and playing the bombchu game she's probably so annoyed and just wants to take a nap, that's why she kept trying to get you to do what you have to do and she's telling you where to shoot and will light stuff up and hold Link's hand through everything just so she can get it over with.  Even at the end of the game, you think there would be some heartfelt goodbye, like damn they just saved the world together. But no, she literally flies off without saying a word.  She might've been sort of useful with targeting and useful when it comes to the mechanics, but I feel like she just didn't want to be there.  And I think Fi is the best. Just because she's always there with Link even though he doesn't know it. Just makes me happy knowing she's destined to be his companion forever and how much history they have.  TL;DR Navi was lazy and annoying, I think Fi was pretty cool."

truezelda,2vd6qs,Arathgo,6,Tue Feb 10 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"I don't personally see why so many people are opposed to a series being made. Sure video game adaptations usual aren't very good, but that doesn't mean it won't be. In sure Nintendo won't green light a something that is destine to be horrible either. I mean if something comes out and it is bad, I won't watch it, it's not like it would tarnish the rest of the series. I personally think a good series could be made around supporting characters,  I would personally like to see a series about Ganondorf, I think that could be entertaining. But I guess I'm willing to take a chance, I mean, you never know right? Something could be made that's good."
truezelda,2vd6qs,Songofstorms89,2,Tue Feb 10 03:18:50 2015 UTC,"I can see it being alright but only if it's done in a very special way. I happened to elaborate on /r/zelda about how I think it should be handled, and I'll post that below. It doesn't quite fit in context of our discussion but just fill in the blanks    Write it about the Hyrulian Civil War, before Ocarina of time. Have Links father as the main character. That way you're expanding on lore barely touched. And since you don't have to use any characters we are really familiar with, you won't piss of fans (myself included) who know you can't capture the spirit of the games in a live action format. Also the Princess Zelda can be OoT's princesses mother.  Thinking about it, personally I think it's one of the only ways I could enjoy a live action LoZ series. I think it's perfect for what they are trying to set up, and doing it this way you wouldn't bother people like myself, who just believe they will never be able to capture the spirit of the games. This way they can expand on lore that I would love to see expanded on, they don't have to touch upon controversial stuff like giving Link a voice, we can see how Ganon manipulated himself to gain favor of the King of Hyrule (which I'm sure involved a lot of despicable stuff). We can expand for once of on Link's family, a civil war leaves a lot of room for battle scenes and political manipulation and posturing. And I can see a scene near the end of the series where Link's father fights off a huge attack to allow his wife to run away with Link so that see can leave him with the Great Deku Tree, where in an inner monologue he can say he just knows that his son will grow to be a hero someday.   So I do think a Live action Zelda series can work, but I want it to have little to do with the characters we actually know. I'm sure others have a different opinion, but I'm extremely worried about this putting a dent in the series I love.  Edit: Fixed my bad grammar in the first paragraph."
truezelda,2vd6qs,Arathgo,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, with exception of it making a dent in the series. Since the news broke a few days ago I have been trying to not allow myself to be overly excited, mainly because I want my expectations to be realistic. Realistically, a series won't happen, if it does chances are it won't be what I want it to be, or it won't be good. But, there is a slim chance something great can be made, and I would rather a chance get taken than not at all. For me personally, even if it's bad, it's not going to change the way I look at the rest of the series, and I don't understand why it would for some people. (Not that I'm saying anything negative about anyone who feels like the series would be negatively impacted by a bad series, I just don't understand it)  I like the idea of it being centered around characters that we don't know, or even new characters that haven't been fleshed out at all in the games. I think it could even include characters that are main parts of the games, Zelda, Ganondorf, Darunia, ect. Look at Gotham for example, it's taking Batman characters and building a show around them, without Batman being an intergral part. I think that would be the only way the show would have any success. I just don't see a way to include Link, at least as a main character, I think he could appear at points, but only briefly, and silently."

The problem was that the dungeon was so huge and you first had to collect 4 tablets to proceed and in the middle of the it I took a break from the game and when I came back I had no idea where to find the last tablet. Finally I gave away and looked at a walkthrough to make it.

The trick is to remember things like that locked door you walked past, so you know where to go when you get a key. That, on top of the fact that I've been through it once before made the navigation pretty straightforward for me. I by no means knew the entire dungeon by heart, but I did remember a few key parts of the run, such as going to to the room where Makar got captured once you free him."

truezelda,2v5vcs,IThoughtThisWasDigg,4,Sun Feb 8 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, the Tingle issue.  To be honest, I think the highest probability is that the Fairy Legend and the masks in WW are simply easter eggs - you can't find them unless you really search for them.  A recent example is Majora's Mask in ALBW - people took it to mean that Termina was somehow connected to the game, when, really, it was just a teaser for MM 3D.  That said, there are lots of inconsistencies within WW that imply the game may have come sequentially after Majora's Mask.  One of the biggest issues within the timelines is that Link's time-traveling in OOT is treated as sort of loop of time within OOT, rather than branching versions of time (time travel is also treated as a loop in MM).  It is only much, much later - possibly during WW's development - that the Zelda team changed their understanding of OOT from ""as a loop"" to ""branching timelines.""  I would say that WW's legends (on the Hero of Time, on the Fairy, and on the Triforce) is generally built off the team not fully grasping how big the ""branching timelines"" would become.  They're dabbling in the idea, but it is not fully realized.  It isn't until TP that it becomes very apparent that they're really committed to the ""branching timelines"" idea.  The inclusion of the Hero's Shade really solidifies the split timelines, but it doesn't fix all the little inconsistencies in OOT, MM, and WW (obviously because these games came out when the idea was still being worked on).  But, if you want to try to make all these issues work in-canon, you could argue that people could've left Termina and gone into the Adult Timeline version of Hyrule.  Skull Kid left OOT in the Adult Timeline and somehow ended up in the Child Timeline of MM (which, really, points more to the fact that they were still building on the ""loop"" idea and not on the ""branching"" idea)."
truezelda,2v5vcs,clicky_pen,3,Sun Feb 8 08:54:52 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear at the end of OoT that Link is forcibly broken out of the loop, though - he ends up meeting Zelda again before they obtained the Spiritual Stones.  The variable part at that point is whether the adult timeline existed in the minds of the developers at that point.  And since the legend in Wind Waker discusses the Hero smiting Ganon with the Master Sword, I think it is a safe bet to say that the devs had already decided the adult and child timelines were separate.  Unless they also thought that Link slayed Ganon in the child timeline using the Master Sword somehow."
truezelda,2v5vcs,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Feb 8 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"The variable part at that point is whether the adult timeline existed in the minds of the developers at that point.   Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear (I wrote my response at like 2am), but yes, that is what I was trying to get at. There are small inconsistencies in WW that make it questionable whether or not the devs had really thought of the branching timelines, mainly the adult one. By the time WW comes out, they had indeed decided on an adult timeline, but it is not very solid.   My argument would be that at the end of OOT - when Link is broken out of the loop - throughout MM, and for the majority of WW, they had an idea of two separate timelines, but again, they weren't clear on it and were more just experimenting with the idea."
truezelda,2v5vcs,clicky_pen,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:08:08 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely.  This is a series built on retcons and that's why I always take the most-recent bits of lore as precedent over the rest.

This wouldn't have to be the case if they decided against going with a split though. In a single timeline, this would actually make a lot of sense. Future Link could very well be the reason that Zelda and Impa knew to escape Hyrule Castle before Ganondorf's attack. Future Link spending those few months with Zelda before he leaves for Termina could easily explain why Sheik knows who all of the sages are and where adult Link is at virtually all times.  After all, Zelda sending Link back in time didn't rewind time unless the adult timeline is a what-if timeline as well, and if Zelda didn't send Link back in time, she would have had to have sent him to a time when Link's past self was already around during that era. So past Link should be off trying to collect the Spiritual Stones while future Link is having his chat with Zelda. Future Link and Zelda would have to actively get in past Link's way to keep the future from coming to pass, especially since past Link and Navi watched the Deku Tree die for the cause, which means they're not going to be able to be talked out of their mission."

truezelda,2v5vcs,Grantus89,3,Sun Feb 8 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"The answer is that Nintendo just make games and then try and slot them in somewhere. It's as simple as that the timeline doesn't make sense because it's an afterthought, and trying to make sense of it is pointless. The only thing Nintendo can do to actually make sense of the Zelda universe is to retcon the whole thing and start again with a bit of planning."
truezelda,2v5vcs,TheUncleBob,2,Sun Feb 8 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"Are you my twin?  When BigN started talking about the split timeline in the first place, I stated then that it was a horrible idea and if you allow for ""two"" timelines, what's stopping three?  four?  why not just say each game is its own timeline?  The Majora's Mask references in Wind Waker were the first thing I objected to when the ""Official"" timeline was released.  This either disproves the ""official"" timeline or you have to ignore inconsistencies that make this theory invalid.  And if you're allowed to just ignore the inconsistencies that conflict with your headcannon, why stop at the Majora's Mask references in Wind Waker?  Why not just ignore any inconsistencies that are inconvenient?  I think that there is only one Link/Zelda ever.  What, Skyward Sword mentions reincarnation?  What, Zelda in Z2 was asleep through the events of Z1 (where we met another Zelda)?  Naw.  That's just an easter egg. or something.  One Link/Zelda. ;)"

I'm sure we will see the green tunic at some point and I hope it'll be a bit closer to the new, blue outfit than the traditional design, just to change things up a bit, but in my opinion the whole open-world idea would probably profit a lot from having actual gear besides the usual item arsenal (bow, bumerang, hookshot etc), if some of it was required to enter or travel more efficiently through certain areas (warm clothes for a snowy area, if there is one, a ""Zora tunic"" for the region in and around lake hylia and so on) or help you a little bit in combat/change the combat up (again with the idea of having different outfits for different fighting styles. Kinda like having different classes. I guess I just want to see a Link in actual armor again)"

Include other clothes as items you can get throughout the game to enhance certain abilities.

Personally, I think the silent protagonist trope works well for video games, not so much for other visual media.  BUT. How about this. I know it sounds strange. If Netflix goes through with this, Link should not be a character. That's right, no Link! Now, you bypass the debate completely.  Click here for reasons. It's basically a proposal that suggests a Zelda adaption based around the Great Flood. It would not be a story about Link. It would be a story about the perils of Hyrule under Ganon just prior to the Great Flood. It would allow us to see Hyrule differently- no longer bootstrapped to whatever Link is doing  Also, video game adaptations tend to suck (WARNING: TV Tropes). The above proposal would make the whatever an adaptation of a video game universe, and I suppose an adaptation of Wind Waker's prologue, but would not make it an adaptation of an actual game that exists.

If Demise's Curse is the only one that exists, he is the only person who will reincarnate in the entire Zelda universe.

It never says anything they both need to be present, it just says that his hatred will haunt their 'kind' (being the holders of the spirit of the hero and the blood of the goddess) forever  .  They never had a reason to reincarnate before we even knew there were reincarnation curses, we just assumed it was something that happened. there is no reason why that assumption is no longer valid, ESPECIALLY since there are several other characters that have nothing to do with the initial 'curse' that also still reincarnate."

If it's the latter, do they hail from the Dark Realm (whatever the place is that Malladus comes from)?  I imagine they must have some way of entering the human worlds, or they always live there, as they are usually drawn to the evil power of Ganondorf in the games in order to serve him, and I don't think we've ever actually seen Ganondorf himself summoning any 'blins.  My personal theory is that they were created by Demise as his chosen species, much like Hylia became the guardian of her humans.  Only Demise's goal was to use them for warfare.  After his... demise... they scattered and come back now and then in surges depending on the state of the world.

Or did they just make the world, and Hylia made the species?  And where does Demise fit in to all this? He seems to be Hylia's counterpart. Is he from Lorule, like most of the clues seem to point to? If he is, what does that tell us about the origins of his army? Are the Blinfolk descendants of Demise's followers from another dimension?"
truezelda,2uot8r,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Feb 9 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"That's assuming that the legend of the three golden goddesses is correct, which is only as airtight as a talking tree and 10-year-old princess telling us.  And Demise being from Lorule isn't anywhere close to confirmed."
truezelda,2uot8r,TRB1783,1 point,Mon Feb 9 12:03:22 2015 UTC,"I know the Demise thing is pure guessing, but we've been told repeatedly about the Golden Goddess, including, I think, from Hylia, who would rather be in a position to know. Is there any reason to doubt their existence?"
truezelda,2uot8r,Serbaayuu,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Hylia mentions ""Old Gods"" - she does not say whether there were 3 of them, whether they were female, whether they were golden, or what their names were.  Which makes me awfully suspicious of the old legend, because it doesn't seem like Hylia would neglect to mention all of those things if they were true."
truezelda,2uot8r,Unwholy_Wholf,5,Mon Feb 9 14:29:48 2015 UTC,Octoroks are in every game except Twilight Princess.  You should do this for Lizalfos next

truezelda,2uot8r,Phoxxent,3,Wed Feb 4 04:05:18 2015 UTC,"I... don't know if I can do much for Keese. Lizalfos and Dinalfos I can do, maybe even Stal-kind, but I don't know if I can work up much for the Keese, but maybe."
truezelda,2uot8r,Haboo65,2,Wed Feb 4 06:23:37 2015 UTC,I don't  think they were in Skyward Sword either.
truezelda,2uot8r,sambev89,3,Wed Feb 4 14:15:58 2015 UTC,"They were, but they behaved like Deku Scrubs"
truezelda,2uot8r,sambev89,3,Wed Feb 4 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"I would enjoy seeing more Blin-lore. Their responsiveness and emotional awareness really added a lot to Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. I always felt terrible about killing (temporarily) the Gerudo guards in OOT and avoided it whenever possible. It would be interesting to see more moral choice in the games even if it is ultimately without consequence.  I keep reflecting on how much I enjoyed fighting the monster hordes in Skyward Sword and wondering if my moral gaming-compass is not pointed north."
truezelda,2uh9wt,fishandchips20,44,Mon Feb 2 03:55:06 2015 UTC,"I love the forest temple in OoT. I loved how it looked, the ambiance, you get the bow, which is ultimately my favorite item in the game and even phantom Ganon is a fun boss."
truezelda,2uh9wt,lilmonkey99,22,Mon Feb 2 04:39:11 2015 UTC,"Plus it had the whole haunted mansion thing going.  The ambient music mad it creepy and mysterious. Freaked me out as a kid, too."
truezelda,2uh9wt,androsphere,11,Mon Feb 2 09:20:40 2015 UTC,"I popped my video game NOPE cherry with that dungeon. I remember thinking, ""Huh, why is my shadow getting bigger? And what's that noi- Ahhhh!""  -snap N64 off-"
truezelda,2uh9wt,Nicktendo1988,3,Mon Feb 2 14:50:27 2015 UTC,That entire dungeon was a big can of nope for 10 year old me.
truezelda,2uh9wt,MisterWoodhouse,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:06:09 2015 UTC,It's a little creepy.... Awesomely creepy. Now I wanna play but I've mentally committed to playing all the Zelda's in order of release date. I already know Zelda I and II will be the most difficult.
truezelda,2uh9wt,lilmonkey99,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"I want to go back and play Zelda II again.  It's the only one that I've never been able to beat (well, among the games I've played anyway--there are some I've never played yet.  Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks, mainly, although my daughter got those last two for Christmas, so they're on my to-do list now."
truezelda,2uh9wt,twcsata,26,Tue Feb 3 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"Stone Tower Temple by far, the puzzles that relied on the changed perspective after flipping upside down, the creepy possessed Link statues, and not to mention that haunting theme music all made for the perfect Zelda temple IMO."
truezelda,2uh9wt,BearFromPhilly,5,Mon Feb 2 05:17:27 2015 UTC,I loved everything about that dungeon.
truezelda,2uh9wt,TTBrandyThief,15,Mon Feb 2 10:08:59 2015 UTC,"Someone already said Stone Tower, so I'll go with my second favorite, the Spirit Temple in Ocarina of Time. I loved the look and the feel of the dungeon, and the music in there is one of my favorite themes in the series. The Silver Gauntlets were alright, and while the Mirror Shield wasn't all that great of an item, they still managed to give it a good use against the boss. I would say it's a great finale to collecting the medallions, but I do a slightly different order for the temples now, making the Spirit Temple the second to last dungeon as opposed to the last dungeon."
truezelda,2uh9wt,The_Shrimp52,2,Mon Feb 2 10:29:39 2015 UTC,I've usually done Shadow last. Never really saw Spirit as the last one
truezelda,2uh9wt,NorwegianDerp,3,Wed Feb 4 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it seems like that's been an ongoing debate for quite some time, whether Spirit or Shadow was meant to be the last one."
truezelda,2uh9wt,The_Shrimp52,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:11:02 2015 UTC,Yep. I remember my first playthrough I got the Lens of Truth before I went to the Spirit Temple. But holy hell Shadow Temple creeped me out
truezelda,2uh9wt,NorwegianDerp,3,Wed Feb 4 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"I always liked the Spirit Temple being last because that's where Ganondorf is from, so it's like everything you're doing is leading up to you having to go to your enemy's old stomping grounds before finally facing him now. It's kind of like a, ""going to see who this Ganondorf guy is and where he comes from"" perspective before finally going to face off with him."
truezelda,2uh9wt,noopenusernames,22,Sun Feb 15 10:07:35 2015 UTC,"Ancient Cistern from Skyward Sword. I really liked all the Buddhist/Hindu imagery that was in that place, like giant Buddha in the middle (that would grab you if you tried to get the rupees), all the lily pads, having an underworld and heaven (with a boss being a mechanical version of a god), etc."
truezelda,2uh9wt,SpahsgonnaSpah,5,Mon Feb 2 04:48:43 2015 UTC,This one really stands out in my mind as one of the coolest.
truezelda,2uh9wt,rebo2,8,Mon Feb 2 06:01:19 2015 UTC,Climbing the rope the first time.... holy shit...
truezelda,2uh9wt,henryuuk,11,Mon Feb 2 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you've heard this before, but the dungeon is based on a Buddhist story. I can't exactly remember how it goes, this is just paraphrasing from memory. So Buddha is walking along when he finds a pond that you can see through to the underworld. He sees a guy down in the underworld and he lowers a spider's thread for him to climb up out of hell, and as he's climbing all the other people try to leave, too, and the thread breaks, casting them all back into the underworld. That should sound pretty familiar if you've played through this temple :)"
truezelda,2uh9wt,BarlesCzarkley,2,Mon Feb 2 13:12:00 2015 UTC,That was such a fun dungeon
truezelda,2uh9wt,Kaffei4Lunch,11,Mon Feb 2 07:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can pick a single favorite. IMO, TP has the best dungeons of any game in the series (followed closely by SS).  I absolutely love all of the first 5 temples in TP (forest, Goron mines, lakebed, arbitor's grounds, Snowpeak)."
truezelda,2uh9wt,twcsata,3,Mon Feb 2 04:42:59 2015 UTC,"Arbiter's Grounds.  Not my favorite from the whole series, but definitely my favorite in that game.  Really cool concept."
truezelda,2uh9wt,henryuuk,11,Tue Feb 3 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"All around favorite including Boss : Ancient Cistern. That dungeon was just really fun and epic.    Only counting the dungeon itself : Probably the Sand Ship. The dungeon was really fun, and the Boss was the only bad thing about it."
truezelda,2uh9wt,God_Megusta,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:45:30 2015 UTC,I liked the boss.
truezelda,2uh9wt,henryuuk,2,Mon Feb 2 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"To each his own, to me (and most people I heard talking about it) the boss was just another ""hit the eye with bow and arrow"" monster with little creativity in it."
truezelda,2uh9wt,Phoxxent,9,Tue Feb 3 04:20:39 2015 UTC,"TP's Ice Dungeon (whatever it was called) was brilliant. The atmosphere was lovely and the navigation was challenging yet fun. The only bad part was that it was a bit short, and the snow wolves. Then, Sky Keep from SS. It's a great dungeon and I love that it has puzzles withing puzzles. It was great how it focused more on puzzles than combat and I got to fight scrap-beard (or whatever his name was) again. Also fun is the Wind Temple (the real one) from Minish Cap. The outdoor atmosphere, the sense of freedom, and the sense that this is the final challenge before Vaati is great. The item is fun, and the boss is interesting."
truezelda,2uh9wt,pivotguyDC1,14,Mon Feb 2 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"Even though TP's Snowpeak Ruins and MM's Stone Tower / Temple are solid entries, I've got to stick with the Sandship from SS. You started on the deck, ventured below deck, the captain's quarters, and then a miniboss (Captain Hook) fight on the bow. You can zipline up the mast and fight Bokoblins (getting huge Peter Pan flashbacks now), jumping between sails. There's a treasure chest out on the stern and riding the lifeboat jumped you between floors. Plus the time-travel stone that you could snipe from different rooms below deck added to the awesome dynamic feel. Let's not forget Kraken Wazowski!"
truezelda,2uh9wt,Ruairi101,10,Mon Feb 2 07:42:30 2015 UTC,"Hated the boss. Felt like such a cop out. The boss wasn't protecting the flame or imprisoning the robots, it just happened to turn up when Link reached the engine room.  A better boss, imo, would have been Scervo again. You already fought him in the future, why not fight him in the past? He could escape right before the end and swear to defeat you next time (and of course, you'll have already finished the job).  It's way better storywise as well, he's captain of the pirate crew that seized the Sandship so he's the logical choice for a final boss. Obviously this is all just my opinion. I just hate Tentalus or whatever it was called."
truezelda,2uh9wt,SpahsgonnaSpah,4,Mon Feb 2 10:51:32 2015 UTC,I think it would have been nice if the boss looked like the Kraken instead of something from Monster's Inc.
truezelda,2uh9wt,Epicfaillord,1 point,Mon Feb 2 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"I liked tentalus over scervo personally. Even though tentalus looks like shit, he still is a very fun boss that tests alot of you abilities and really makes you think the first time around."

truezelda,2uh9wt,twcsata,2,Wed Feb 4 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, Kraken Wazowski.  Even my kids were like ""Hey, wasn't that boss on Monsters Inc.?"""
truezelda,2uh9wt,Fuck_ur_opinion,2,Tue Feb 3 21:51:06 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the Shadow temple in OoT. Using the Eye of Truth to get through the hidden walls and walking across the gaps in the floor with the Hoover boots... awesome. Plus the boss fight with Bongo Bongo is one of my favorite memories of video games in general not just the LoZ serious.
truezelda,2uh9wt,jdman5000,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:57:24 2015 UTC,Yes! Though I don't think it's my favorite it's certainly up there. I love how creey everything feels and the Lens of Truth is so cool!!

truezelda,2uh9wt,dplatto,3,Tue Feb 3 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"for me, i think it has to be the forest temple from OOT. Not only for the reasons that others have brought up, but also for its placement within the game. It's the first temple you play as adult link and also presents a significant increase in difficulty. It sets the tone for the rest of the game in which no temple has done (at least for me) in any other entry."
truezelda,2uh9wt,PhilosopherKingSigma,3,Mon Feb 2 21:41:51 2015 UTC,Either the Temple of Time or Twilight Palace from TP. Not crazy about the bosses though.
truezelda,2uh9wt,warriorsatthedisco,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"wilight Palace was really cool, although I think it had more potential. Temple of Time was great, I'm stuck between that or the sand temple(I don't remember the name) for my favorite from TP"
truezelda,2uh9wt,recursion8,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:42:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're a fan of escort dungeons :d  I loved the re-imagined use of the wallmaster in Twilight Palace, and of course getting a suped-up glowy  Master Sword was awesome."
truezelda,2uh9wt,jamessrsly,3,Sat Feb 7 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"Have to say the Sky Keep from SS. It had such an unusual concept compared to any other dungeon we've had so far, plus, you collect the Triforce!   Only downside is that there isn't any boss..."
truezelda,2uh9wt,NorwegianDerp,3,Tue Feb 3 18:15:57 2015 UTC,Stone Tower Temple! Holy mother that was awesome
truezelda,2uh9wt,MisterWoodhouse,2,Wed Feb 4 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"For the whole package, probably the Temple of Droplets from Minish Cap. The central mechanic of opening the doors to let the sun in really impressed me."
truezelda,2uh9wt,twcsata,2,Tue Feb 3 01:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with the Spirit Temple from Ocarina of Time.  It's not that it was particularly innovative (although, unless I'm forgetting something, it was, with regard to the child and adult sections).  It just made an impression on me.  Love the theme and the music and the gameplay, especially as it incorporates most of the items you've acquired at that point."
truezelda,2uh9wt,TheJaredactyl,2,Tue Feb 3 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"Twilight Princess' Arbiter's Grounds. That dungeon was brilliant, and was really the only dungeon in the game that I feel made excellent use of the Wolf form. Chasing the Big Poe's through the catacombs using Wolf senses was so awesome, not to mention the super cool miniboss."
truezelda,2uh9wt,Killrez,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:03:00 2015 UTC,Sky Temple and Snowpeak Ruins from TP. Definitely had the most fun and difficulty with both when I was younger. Easily the most memorable for me and the most fun I've ever had with a temple.
truezelda,2uh9wt,poltergoose420,-3,Tue Feb 3 00:18:11 2015 UTC,Ok I hate the forest temple from TP... but my favorite one is probably... idk... honestly have no clue
truezelda,2udjwi,Marbla,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:10:25 2015 UTC,"With the Triforce of Courage, I believe Link could channel the mask's destructive power inward upon itself, destroying the evil within."

He needs a specific sword to kill Ganon and he's pretty useless without it with the exception of his courage. I think Ganon has a better chance of overcoming it than link does simply because of his power. But then again skull kid just wanted to fit in so maybe he let it control him without a fight"
truezelda,2udjwi,Samanthakatrice,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:17:06 2015 UTC,"He needs a specific sword to kill Ganon   Link beats Ganon in Zelda 1 with a sword that isn't the Master Sword and a silver arrow.

truezelda,2udjwi,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Feb 1 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"I think there's a very good chance that any of the Heroes would quickly fall prey to the Mask, especially if they weren't aware of its power when they put it on.  However I don't think Majora would be able to so completely override the Hero's own will.  I think we might see the Hero fight back over time until he eventually manages to take it off and free himself from its influence, or paralyze Majora's control over his body long enough for someone else to rescue him."

truezelda,2u41rw,OneOfTheOnly,10,Thu Jan 29 21:58:43 2015 UTC,Everything about that intro is perfect. Wind Waker has the best overall soundtrack.
truezelda,2u41rw,fatn00b,2,Fri Jan 30 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, Wind Waker's style has yet to be matched. I would say Ocarina of Time is a close second, and I can't say too much about Skyward Sword, since I haven't played it too much."

Going with things that haven't been said yet:  -First off, this franchise has some pretty amazing title screen tracks. Ocarina of Time opening  Wind Waker opening  Twilight Princess opening   -The Deku Palace Theme from Majora's Mask. It's so catchy - and as someone who's quite into Renaissance music, this is a great track for a royal court.  -Queen Rutela's Theme, the version of Serenade of Water from Twilight Princess, never fails to give me chills.  -Fi's Theme from Skyward Sword is absolutely beautiful. All of the music in that game makes me want to live in that universe...Silent Realms, Song of the Hero, Faron Woods...it's all incredible.  -The Hidden Village in Twilight Princess is spot on with the spaghetti Western shoot-out feel.   -The Giant's Song - oh, the feels.  -Finally, I don't know how this sub feels about Hyrule Warriors, but Eclipse of the World is a pretty epic remix of the series' main theme."
truezelda,2u41rw,antibenz,5,Fri Jan 30 03:55:28 2015 UTC,Off the top of my head...   Song of Healing Ballad of the Goddess The Wind Waker main theme Castor Wilds Faron Woods from Twilight Princess
truezelda,2u41rw,flanger001,6,Thu Jan 29 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"I'm coming in with the weird ones here, but the song that elicits the strongest emotional reaction from me is Last Day from Majora's Mask. It is not a happy or uplifting song, but I find it to be intensely emotional. I'm also a big fan of Ganon's fight theme from Ocarina Of Time because it gets me fucking pumped as fuck."
truezelda,2u41rw,thunderling,2,Fri Jan 30 02:32:00 2015 UTC,"Those last few hours in MM are so great. That music makes me feel terrified, desperate, hopeless, and like clawing for one last chance before the world ends. Super cool."

truezelda,2u41rw,sclark89,3,Fri Jan 30 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"Wind Waker's Great Sea Theme is definitely my favorite.

The music is so great that it even sounds good backwards.  These are in no particular order. I love all zelda games in some way. The music always makes me feel nostalgia. I dont really have a top 5. I could probably make a list of just 20 songs that i like.
truezelda,2u41rw,cis-lunar,3,Sat Jan 31 08:27:21 2015 UTC,"While the 20th anniversary cover for Ballad of the Godess is my favorite piece of music, in terms of favorite piece of Zelda music,Makar's prayer, and even more so Medli's Prayer - the soft and short string/harp only covers of the main Windwaker theme - stand out as really special moments in the franchise for me.  In the depths of a dark and unforgiving dungeon, the quiet melody contrasts sharply against the evil that surrounds you, and through music you feel a connection to Makar and Medli.  The final version once you beat the boss passes the loneliness of the first verse, and once the second instrument comes in and the chanting in the background intensifies, the song becomes a triumphant reward for victory, and celebration of heritage, generations, and companionship.   Then it quickly dies out - reminding you that you must go alone once more and face evil by yourself.  That is why beating the earth temple is my favorite single moment across all Zelda games."
truezelda,2u41rw,brilliance,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"The OoT Forest Temple theme is fantastic, and perfectly complements (IMO, of course) the best dungeon in the series.  It's eerie and surreal.  If there's a more successful pairing of music and location in the series, I can't think of it.  Then again, the dungeon music in OoT in general is excellent at creating distinct atmospheres in each one.  Tal Tal Heights from LA is truly epic.  Weaving your way around the peaks at the top of the world on that bizarre island to this track is sublime.  It's a stand-out track in a game full of some of the best music in the series, and it's all MIDI file level stuff."

So awesome.  --Gerudo Valley (especially Smash 4's remix). The Spanish influence, cool chords, and upbeat tempo are always good reasons to look forward to this region.  --The Final Hours, MM. Evokes such anxiety yet such peace in the face of inevitable death. I recommend the version with the Clock bells.   --Main Theme. Righteousness, adventure, and excitement since 1986.  --Romance (is in the Air), SS. For all this game is worth otherwise, its presentation was magnificent. And this song compliments an unusual but perfectly fitting tone for the intro scenes, and this got me so hyped for the rest.  --The Great Sea, WW. One of my first Zelda games, and it honestly never gets old. Embodies the dream of open swashbuckling adventure.  --Courage, TP. Possibly THE most touching scene in the game, being a hero to not only Hyrule but these kids as well, and using the main theme to tie it all together? sniff"

Ballad of the goddess is incredibly clever and memorable so it's also a favorite. Clock town was awesome just to feel the tension as the days ticked by and the music changed.
truezelda,2txgp0,CaptianZaco,13,Wed Jan 28 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"I love this idea - a rotating column on the bad guys of Zelda.  I wonder if the Bublins are the descendants of the Bokoblins that fought for Demise? We've seen Hylians become Humans and Zora become Rito, so there is precedent for (rapid?) evolution. Or maybe they are the same creatures, but the name ""Bokoblin"" was just corrupted over time.  I think the Bublins were definitely organized into some manner of society, akin to nomadic warbands gathered under a king. I don't think that they were conjured out of thin air, as Girahim seemed able to do - we never see Ganon use this ability, despite how useful it might be. Personally, I wonder if Girahim just teleported those guys from somewhere else.  As a nomadic warrior society, it is only natural that the biggest, strongest guy is made king. Still, they seem to have no central village beyond the camp at the Arbiter's ground, and I suspect King Bublin's throne is his saddle.  I had some thoughts on this here awhile back, but I got distracted away from what was supposed to be a much bigger project."
truezelda,2txgp0,TRB1783,5,Wed Jan 28 07:23:47 2015 UTC,"There are Bokoblin in TP, those ugly, blue or pink things with the triangular heads, but now that you mention it, Bulblin do look a lot like Demise's Bokos... Maybe over time the species evolved into two? this could also have resulted in the Miniblins from Windwaker.   As for that post... I like it. Also, the points raised in the Zoras in that discussion... I'll probably make a post on them if this series lasts."
truezelda,2txgp0,blazzerftw,9,Wed Jan 28 08:10:29 2015 UTC,they also seem to understand livestock a little bit because they tame and ride the the boars.  or are those created by ganon as well? the boars dont look like any other of ganon badies though.
truezelda,2txgp0,thesk8rguitarist,9,Wed Jan 28 05:28:36 2015 UTC,"Not only do they ride the boars... they cook and eat them as well. In their camp outside Arbiter's Grounds you can find a few boars roasting on spits over large fires... And the boars cannot be killed, (well, except for riding them off the edge of Hyrule Field...) so I don't think the boars are ""Monsters"" either.   That is a good point, thanks."

truezelda,2txgp0,henryuuk,8,Wed Jan 28 04:52:27 2015 UTC,"That could be, but I was thinking about what he says. ""I follow the strongest side. It is all I have ever known."" It makes me wonder, did Ganon actually make them, or was he simply the strongest being they'd met? Ganon was sealed away prior to the start of TP, and had been since OoT if I remember correctly, so maybe they evolved from different Blin-kind in his absence? We know the first Blin seem to have been created by Demise, but have they persisted in his absence since then, or are they recreated every time Ganon needs them?  hm... If this post does well, I might make one for Blin in general."

All the monsters linked to him have showed extreme dedication and submission to him and his goals.    It could be the bulblins are in some way descended from the demons Demise lead into the world, but there is nothing in the entire game that assumes they are created by ganondorf.    King Bulbins line of : ""I serve the strongest, that is all i ever have known"" also implies his servitude was ""conquered"" by ganondorf/zant at some point, as otherwise it would have been more logical for him to think : ""I serve ganondorf, for it is all I have ever known"" (also, he sorta created me)    I think they are just another race, and personally I hope they return as a neutral race in a future game (maybe even Zelda U, as their mounted battle and camp-based culture would fit with the giant overworld) Or maybe even an enemy race you can ""convince"" to join your side, sorta like the end of TP, but then with them actually swapping side...."

Lorule also had counterparts to Hyrule but when their Triforce was destroyed it had no effect in Hyrule. In fact it only became a problem when Hilda and Yuga started to involve Hyrule, otherwise the fate of that world would have no impact on the lives of Hylians. Now I'm kinda just speculating at this point but I think Lorule and Termina could be in the same realm, just in different timelines.

truezelda,2two5v,souffle-etc,2,Wed Jan 28 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so the moon was pretty big. Not huge, but pretty big. However, if you think it would only destroy Clock Town and nothing beyond, I'd recommend you revisit the game."

If a bomb with a lit fuse falls down into a sand castle, and then explodes afterwards, then the damage done by the bomb falling is the sandcastle, but the damage of the bomb exploding reaches farther.    the bomb falling however, did not cause the explosion."

truezelda,2two5v,Wampasully,2,Thu Jan 29 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"The Happy Mask Salesman was indeed the same one from Hyrule. He was in the Lost Woods (looking for masks) when Skull Kid stole Majora's Mask from him, and he most likely found the same portal to Termina in pursuit. Also, regarding the Hyrule/Termina counterparts, I don't really agree with this theory because there's such a small percentage of identical characters. I see Romani and Cremia, the Gorman brothers, the blue collar workers in town, and only a handful of others, but they only make up a small fraction of the vast array of characters in MM. Overall, most characters are original, and even those who have physical counterparts don't seem to have any reason for existing other than the fact that it was cheaper and/or easier for Nintendo and the software they developed. Sorry, post-drunken ramble."
truezelda,2two5v,jesuswig,2,Thu Jan 29 02:51:56 2015 UTC,Is this said somewhere? Because I saw no indication in Majora's Mask that they were the same person. Not like Majora's Mask intro makes any sense in the first place...
truezelda,2two5v,Wampasully,0,Thu Jan 29 07:04:59 2015 UTC,"It's not said, but it's heavily implied. Else how would the HMS lurking in the clock tower have the same memory of the HMS getting his mask stolen in the Lost Woods on the Hyrule side? Of all the counterparts, none of them retain any discernible memory of their selves on the other side of the portal. Link, Skull Kid, and the Salesman were all in the same place at the same time, involved in the same situation that eventually led to their crossing to another world."
truezelda,2two5v,jesuswig,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:10:37 2015 UTC,"But that all makes no sense. As it's clear from the game that Majora's Mask comes from Termina and not Hyrule. This would have to imply that he traveled to Termina got the mask, went back to Hyrule only for it to get stolen. But in all probability it was Majora's Mask that opened the path between the two worlds as it's the only thing that would have the power to.

truezelda,2tu9xq,souffle-etc,3,Tue Jan 27 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"It was just swimming through hoops, but it was timed. If you had perfect accuracy you could keep up with the beaver nose-to-nose. The new system looks like it might be a slower swim, mostly because we don't see the jetstream/wake when you're swimming as Mikau in the remake.  If it's true that you can't go as fast as the original game unless you're expending magic power, the Beaver Races would be more challenging."
truezelda,2tu9xq,souffle-etc,5,Tue Jan 27 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"According to the demo video, you can't jump out of the water without using magic, and jumping out was necessary for at least one ring. So, they're going to have to alter the mini-game, if they're keeping it. Your suggestion of magic pots, or the suggestion of the rings themselves restoring magic, would both work well."
truezelda,2tu9xq,Phoxxent,7,Tue Jan 27 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"Ugh gross haha. Yeah, if you can't even leap out of the water without a little magic that's not something I'm looking forward to. By the time we got the Zora mask, I was so excited with the mobility in water that I would be fine if Termina was totally flooded so you could swim everywhere! I'm also pretty disappointed by this new data."
truezelda,2tu9xq,The_Ponnitor,4,Tue Jan 27 16:40:16 2015 UTC,Every game should have dolphin jumps.
truezelda,2tu9xq,souffle-etc,2,Tue Jan 27 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think there were any rings in the beaver races that required actually jumping out of the water. There was at least one that was halfway out of the water, but all you had to do was swim near the surface to swim through it."
truezelda,2tu9xq,souffle-etc,2,Wed Jan 28 13:27:58 2015 UTC,They might add some green jars like in the Goht battle?
truezelda,2tu9xq,thunderling,2,Tue Jan 27 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"Like the goron races too? I could see that, although it'd make the minigame a lot harder (Goron rolling is barely 2 axes of motion, while swimming is in 3 axes)"
truezelda,2tu9xq,aknight99,2,Tue Jan 27 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, like those races too.  The difference in axes would be easily managed on the New 3DS thanks to the C-Stick, but for the regular 3DS/2DS maybe swimming would use the Gyroscope similar to the bow/arrow modification?"
truezelda,2tu9xq,aknight99,2,Tue Jan 27 16:41:54 2015 UTC,Magic pots!
truezelda,2tu9xq,SpahsgonnaSpah,5,Tue Jan 27 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats a massive change... I can kinda see why they might have done that. The old swimming was extremly fast and sometimes hard to control, but you could easily adapt. It's a qol change but I think they might have went a bit overboard with it."
truezelda,2tu9xq,thunderling,5,Tue Jan 27 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"I know that they changed the swimming mechanics from the Japanese release of MM to the American/International releases. So, it's possible that the team wasn't happy with swimming even back in the 90s. But, the swimming looks too reminiscent of the system from TP/SS.  It's also possible that they were trying to fix the swimming in air glitch, but I agree that this change is going way too overboard for that."
truezelda,2tu9xq,Tsurii897,4,Tue Jan 27 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting, you certainly did some research. Good find OP."
truezelda,2tu9xq,souffle-etc,3,Tue Jan 27 15:17:47 2015 UTC,Doesn't really seem like it is that much of a problem
truezelda,2tu9xq,IronPandemonium,4,Tue Jan 27 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's much better than I was expecting. I thought from the video that you couldn't swim at the faster rate at all. Sucks when the player runs out of magic though."
truezelda,2tu9xq,IronPandemonium,11,Tue Jan 27 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"The feeling of speed and momentum was amazing. It made playing water levels fun   What? You had one speed. And that one speed was so fast that you'd constantly bump into walls all over the place. The swimming in Majora's Mask is/was the main reason why I absolutely hated the Great Bay temple. It was simply a pain to navigate if you weren't walking through it, in my opinion.   I guess I can kind of understand the whole thing with the swimming in the ocean at Great Bay, even thought I'm not the kind of player who goes out of his way to screw around with random mechanics like this, but the people who're already saying this is a change for the worse should try to really think about this: When did you actually need to swim through an area that isn't Great Bay? How easy was it to navigate these other areas? And how is it a bad thing that you can now move more easily without losing that much speed/momentum in said areas?   I'm currently playing Majora's Mask for the third time and literally just reached Great Bay Temple the other day and now that I know about this change to the underwater mechanics, I'm just more frustrated with it, because I'm stuck with the relatively clunky, unresponsive controls, that have me bumping into walls all over the place for the entire time, I'm actually not swimming and trying to navigate through the temple like you did in the Water Temple, walking around on the different levels and just raising or dropping as I want to get to another part of it.   And one thing you can easily do, if you really feel like playing dolphin, is getting Chateau Romani. It's not like you have a hard time getting those 200 rupees in Majora's Mask and that would be a great use for an item I rarely need(ed) in the original."
truezelda,2tu9xq,IronPandemonium,4,Tue Jan 27 16:23:51 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but in the video we also see a total control over camera angles that was lacking in the original. Personally, I had no problem with the speed itself, I just had to be pretty crafty to manually adjust the camera accordingly.  I think if they kept the jetstream/wake lines around your fins, people might not notice the difference in speed. More than anything, the original swimming just looked cooler IMO."
truezelda,2tu9xq,KingKolder,11,Tue Jan 27 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I never had a problem; I main thing I remember from GBT (and stone tower temple too) is jumping out of the water to land on things, because that was really cool. They did remove a necessary jump from NTSC-J to NTSC-U, though.  Your points about having a slower, more precise way to swim are very valid, and it's a really good idea in general. The reason way this change is bad is how they implemented it. Why not have a hold a  button for fast swim (or hold a button for slow swim, since this is a nominal remake).   I understand that they're running out of buttons, but while you're in the swim state, you can't use your ""c-buttons."" Replace one of those with the magic attack, put fast swim on a shoulder, slow swim with the ""A""/action button, for instance. This is definitely a hard design decision, but changing the default swimming mechanics is a huge change.  The Chateau Romani is great, but the timing will be weird. (iirc) The ""earliest"" you can get the Chateau Romani is the second night, where as you can get the Zora Mask on the first day. This could leave a day and a half lag time between getting the two items. And presumably, you'd be spending that day and a half swimming around Great Bay, which even by your admission, is where the old swim mechanics work best. (And look at how awkwardly he swims around in the video once he runs out of magic.)"
truezelda,2tu9xq,Serbaayuu,5,Tue Jan 27 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand what the big deal is.  Think of it this way: To utilize Goron Link's rolling to its maximum potential, you need to use MP, even in the original release of the game; they're essentially making Zora more in line with that design philosophy, all the while making the swimming controls much more convenient overall.  Besides, if you're really that big of a fan of the ""traditional"" Zora swimming, you can always just go ahead and drink Chateau Romani; tahdah, everything is as it was, and everyone's happy."

That one was a restart."
truezelda,2toyoc,CaptianZaco,6,Mon Jan 26 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"Onox's quote states that he is one of the Dark Dragons, so there's definitely more than just him. We just don't know if any of the others have ever escaped the Dark Realm and come to the Light World before, especially since Onox had to have Twinrova's help to do it.  If any of the bosses we've seen in the past are Dark Dragons, Stallord is actually a really good candidate. He also seems to have some connection to dark magic since he was able to summon a bunch of corpses to aid him in battle (i.e., the Staltroops).  So there's no way to know for certain, but it's definitely possible."
truezelda,2toyoc,Petrichor02,3,Mon Jan 26 05:48:12 2015 UTC,This is brilliant!  Thank you!  I've wanted to see some development on Onox and Veran as demons for a very long time.  Where they come from & what their world is like.
truezelda,2toyoc,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Jan 26 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations!  I love the OoX games with every fiber of my tunic haha. Hopefully you've been having a blast!    This is a great theory, and I think it can be improved a bit when considering some other possible theories.  If you plan on playing Oracle of Ages to complete the linked game and get the full ending, don't read the following link yet.  This Theory presents the possibility that events in the OoX games resolve the Downfall timeline and create the Adult/Child timelines. I really love the theory and it makes a lot of sense to me.    Going on that theory and the fact that Onox mentions he is but one of the Dark Dragons, I don't think it's far-fetched at all to believe Stallord is another Dark Dragon. In fact, if you subscribe to the aforementioned timeline theory, it might even be possible that Stallord is actually Onox's remains. Even though TP and OoX take place in different timelines, there would be some wiggle room if time was rewritten a bit after the events of OoA."
truezelda,2toyoc,souffle-etc,2,Mon Jan 26 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing more differences than similarities. Stallord has five-fingered hands, four horns, non-coiled horns, fangs instead of tusks, arms protruding sideways instead of forward, it has no wings or wing-supporting bone structures, and it only has ribs on the upper chest instead of the whole length of the spine (which Onox's snake-like shape would most likely have).  They don't look any more similar to each other than they do any other vaguely dragon-like monster. I would actually guess that Stallord's got two legs under the sand because everything other than its head looks like a human skeleton and the presence of what appears to be hair means it was probably mammalian instead of reptilian like Onox so it's unlikely to be as snake-shaped.  You could write these all off as changes in art style but then why single out Stallord and not all the other dragon bosses in the series? Or are all hostile dragon monsters Dark Dragons?"
truezelda,2to7po,fishandchips20,22,Mon Jan 26 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the fight against Ganon in TP. It has a befitting sense of finality about it. Especially since the Hyrule Historia came out confirming the timelines it just feels like an appropriate conclusion to the events that ""began"" in OoT. That aside the fight is just fun, getting to outclass Ganon in every arena. Big monster? No biggie. Fight me on horseback? Bring it on. Duel to the death? Bitch, please I am THE master swordsman of Hyrule."
truezelda,2to7po,Joust149,3,Mon Jan 26 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"I like all the other phases, but I hate the horseback stage.

Gorgeous visual design and animations, visceral method of fighting, hilarious giant swords to hit him back with. Most of Skyward Sword's boss fights had way stronger spectacle than any other Zelda game but none of the others held a candle to Koloktos.  Gameplay-wise, I wanna say Goht with Stallord as a close runner-up. Going fast is exciting, fighting giant monsters is exciting, fighting giant monsters by going fast is double exciting.

The motion controls were the most impressive part of that game to me, and these bosses were impressive challenges compared to the traditional boss fight conventions.  (I know the motion controls are controversial, but I loved them.)    Gleeok always terrified me on the NES, and the OoS re-imagining brought in a whole 'nother element of creepiness!  Definitely a favorite challenging boss.  While we're on the subject of OoX games, Possessed Nayru/Onox w/Din had extremely clever mechanics, and the way to fight Digdogger blew my freakin mind.  Another handheld boss I love is Master Stalfos from LA. It was one of the first characters that really had character, and the limited resources in the fight made it a suspenseful battle!    I also gotta give props to the Iron Knuckle bosses from OoT/MM/TP.  With their wide attack range and crazy damage rate, they were one of the first enemies to provide a real challenge that made your palms sweat when you see one.    Most everybody hates on Gyorg from MM, but I loved the variety of methods available to dispose of this beast.  If you wanted to take it easy, you could rock some Bow action and play it safe; if you wanted to challenge yourself you could stay as Mikau the whole time and do some cool moves like leaping out of the water.  Very stylish!    Stallord and Ganon from TP were also fantastic. Multi-part bosses? Yes please. Depending on how skillfully you fought, these fights could be over quickly or take a long, long time.    Vaati never gets enough love, but he was the best part of FS/FSA/MC, hands down. The range of weapons necessary to defeat him, and the teamwork needed on the Four Swords games brought a refreshing amount of challenge.    Sorry this is getting so long :/  Bellum from PH brought another innovative mechanic, making this fight a memorable experience. I only wish it wasn't so short!  Further into the DS heritage comes LBW, which brought Stallblind and Knucklemaster--both of which were intense and used the new 2D mechanic in some really clever ways.  Knucklemaster was a lot more difficult than Stallblind, but they were both incredible fights.    Finally, there's never been a boss as insanely difficult to defeat as Link's Shadow, and I will fight you over that if you try to tell me otherwise. Yes, it was just a narrow corridor with nothing but the very fundamentals of the game. BUT there was no room for error, and certainly no room for jumping to dodge out of the way. The AI for Link's Shadow was the fastest and most vicious out of any in the game, and you probably didn't have much magic or life left over after the fight with Thunderbird."

Here's why the original is my favorite boss fight of all time:   Epic music - As you enter his arena, the music is very subtle, building on the whole frozen silence motif of the Snowhead Temple while also ramping up to the adrenaline rush that is the actual fight. This is punctuated by the stillness as your Fire Arrow melts Goht's icy prison and unleashes the Masked Mechanical Monster within. After the big guy bellows and runs you over, BOOM! You're in the heat of it. Goron up and roll, baby! The incorporation of the Temple's signature Link form - This was one of MM's biggest strengths and a nice tweak of the traditional series formula for boss fights at the end of dungeons. Unlike how other entries in the series feature dungeon bosses whose fights highlight use of the item acquired in that temple, MM boss fights highlighted use of the Link form most closely associated with that boss' Temple. For Goht, that meant turning into Goron Link and fighting the big mechanized baddie at high speed in a race to the death. Easily one of the most unique boss fights in the series. Replay! - Another awesome MM feature was being able to replay the boss fights, which made sense, given how defeating the boss of a region's Temple would change the region and being able to access the post-boss regions on Day One made certain parts of the main quest and side-quests doable. I wish every Zelda game would include the replayable bosses feature, if only just to experience some of the most enjoyable encounters more than once without having to replay the entire game again."

truezelda,2to7po,nephros,2,Mon Jan 26 20:40:27 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed Argorak(? the dragon fight in the ooccoo area) from twilight princess. I thought it was really epic and the dragon was bad ass!
truezelda,2to7po,UtahStateAgnostics,2,Mon Jan 26 07:59:30 2015 UTC,"Although it gets old at times, I always liked the ping-pong matches with Ganon(dorf) in OoT and TP (and ALBW - is it in WW too? I forget), especially with the required strengthening of the master sword that must always be completed in order to repel the evil magic. That gives some feel of determination and purpose to the last couple of dungeon crawls before the final fight, something that is sometimes lacking in the earlier dungeons.  The original Ganon fight in LoZ is also fun, a bit easy if you know how, but that is offset by the final dungeon before which is a bitch."

When you clang swords, he almost always gets a hit out of your hitstun. He attacks when most traditional bosses are in ""stunned mode"". He fights like a Punch-Out boxer: If you know him well enough, you can get in multiple precise hits in a row without being blocked, but on your first run he's intimidating. And the second stage is impressively epic.   Lightning?? AW YEAH.   Demise is exactly what SS needed so much of from the beginning: nontraditional pacing and high challenge (not from lots-o-damage or w/e, but swordplay style). Makes you feel so much more like a hero in the end."

truezelda,2tj51o,Jo_Onis,5,Sat Jan 24 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"So what about Ordonas piece? Well, I actually assume that Ordona let the Hylians keep the last piece of the Fused Shadow...   Issue with your logic here, Midna already has the Fused Shadow before she meets Princess Zelda. This is from her flashback, and just after Zant curses her, but before she leaves the Twilight Realm and therefore before she could have met Zelda.  I can't remember exactly whether this is stated/implied in-game or whether I just assumed it (I think the latter), but I believe the Godesses must have left the fourth piece with the Interlopers/Twili, and that piece was passed down throughout the Twili royal line. So when Midna became the Twilight Princess, she inherited it.  Also, this is said by Lanayru - ""It was then that the goddesses ordered us three light spirits to intervene. We sealed away the great magic those individuals had mastered"". If there were only three light spirits present, it implies (although there could be other explanations) that Ordona wasn't present for the Interloper's defeat and therefore he couldn't have received a fragment of the Fused Shadow."
truezelda,2tj51o,IaiLwM,3,Sat Jan 24 18:30:31 2015 UTC,Oh i see! I really got that part wrong although it doesn't neccessarily impact the other parts of the theory. It actually makes it more logical because the fact that Ordona wasn't from Hyrule kept bugging me.  Somehow it suddenly feels like there must be Light Spirits all over the world.  The only thing I don't understand is why they'd actually let the Interlopers keep a piece of the Fused Shadow at all. Maybe they were unable to take it? Or perhaps it serves as a kind of reminder for them?  Actually now that I think about it that would be the safest thing to do. Having the last piece of the fused shadow in a completely other realm means that no one could snatch the pieces and put them together unless they could travel between the realms.  It makes much more sense now. I should edit the main post
truezelda,2tj51o,IaiLwM,3,Sat Jan 24 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"Actually now that I think about it that would be the safest thing to do. Having the last piece of the fused shadow in a completely other realm means that no one could snatch the pieces and put them together unless they could travel between the realms.   That's one of the prevailing theories about why it was left behind. There's also another one I rather like, which this page briefly explains.  Basically, Zelda believes that it was destiny that she, Link and Midna should meet. If we go with the ""destiny"" idea, it seems probable that one of the reasons the Fused Shadow part was left to the Twili was so that when the time came, it would already be in Midna's possession - ready for her to utilise to help Link."

truezelda,2tj51o,henryuuk,4,Sat Jan 24 18:39:15 2015 UTC,"But the twilight realm was already populated before ganondorf was sent there. And the tiwli lived inside of it for GENERATIONS on end, long enough to actually be altered by it.      No matter how you look at it, it is way more likely that the interloper war happened during, or before the civil war IMO."
truezelda,2tj51o,henryuuk,1 point,Sat Jan 24 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"You've got a solid point, they probably sent in the Interlopers before they sent in Ganondorf. But is it really so unlikely they were banished around the same time? Maybe even just a few years apart? Ganondorf probably had to wait a long time until he regained enough power to break out.  Also, if Ganondorf's crusade indeed did give seed to the Interloper war it's not unlikely it occured soon after. Maybe the Gerudo even was a part of the war.  Let's say the wars took about 50 years after Ocarina of Time ended. Given there's about a thousand years between the game it still leaves enough time for them to change. And thats the amount of time it took for Ganondorf to regain strength.  Actually everything changes instantly when it's mixed with twilight in the Game."

Apparently it's a common misconception that there'd just be 100 years between the games which is kind of a short period of time if you think about it. It might have been a miss in the translation.  I'll see if i can find some kind of source"
truezelda,2tj51o,autowikibot,2,Sun Jan 25 00:30:01 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, there has never been an exact statement of how long is in between, but I doubt it is 1000 years.    There is also no mention of ganondorf needing to build up his powers before approaching Zant, in fact, considering he needed the link with Zant to grow stronger again, it is probably more likely that he approached Zant as soon as possible.    If he wanted a hate filled powerhungry underling, and the twili's were banished AFTER him, then a much more logical underling would have been the twili's that were only sealed away recently, and still filled with hate for the light world."
truezelda,2tj51o,SonoShindou,2,Sun Jan 25 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"I tried to google around about it and i found both people stating it's a thousand years and people stating that it was a hundred years. I even tried searching in japanese and most people seemed to say that it was between 100-200 years. (百数十年後) And that's was the majority at least.  I can't comprehend how the world could have changed so much in that amount of time. But i guess they don't put that much weight in it when they design the game. It would make things different.  I'm not sure about Ganondorfs abilities in the Twilight Realm though, he doesnt even seem to possess a physical shape in the game right? he appears before Zant as some kind of cloud if i dont remember it wrongly."

There is also no reason for ""gramps"" to be the previous Link. The only reason people assume he is is cause he is a secret boss that is super though and can do 1 fingered handstands and schtuff. And the fact he uses a master sword copy, which is already a stupid thing to use as a ""fact"", since it is a clearly non-canon (as there is only 1 master sword)    It is one of those theories somebody came up with without thinking about it, and people want it to be true so much that they start believing it without thinking about all the things that wouldn't line up Sorta like the stupid : ""Link is dead in MM"" theory that people latched onto like starving hyena's to a piece of meat."

truezelda,2t9j0b,henryuuk,3,Thu Jan 22 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"""hero chosen by the goddesses"" is almost never used, and vastly incorrect either way. It is more something people believe Link to be, in the same way a savior IRL would be ""send by god""    Link was chosen by hylia, the singular goddess, after the three goddesses had already left the mortal plane, and since then his spirit has become the spirit of the hero, which is reborn whenever needed.    Gramps is a side boss, which only uses a master sword because he is a modelswap over Link. If we follow the logic that the streetpass minigame is canon, then there would be 2 master swords, and Gramps would have had a copy of each of Links weapons, despite several of the weapons never having appeared during his 4 adventures we saw    There is literally nothing in the entire game to assume Gramps is a previous Link except the Master Sword, which is already a canonical fallacy as there is only 1 Master Sword, and should be treated as gameplay and coding trumping canon logic."

Like when the people wanted Washington to have a third term, but Jefferson took office instead. Part of the game is stepping out of the shadow of the hero of time. The spirits ask ""is this the hero of time?"" ""No, I wake the winds."" ""is this the hero of time?"" ""NO! I wake the winds!"" ""is this the hero of time?"" ""NO! I WAKE THE WINDS!"" The point is to tell you and the world that you are not the hero of time, nor are you his blood. You are the waker of winds.

truezelda,2t9j0b,CatHatGuy,3,Fri Jan 23 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"This, of course, assumes he actually does get home.   Based on the official timeline, the Oracle games come before Link's Awakening. This is substantiated by the fact that at the end of Oracle of Seasons, Link is seen leaving the country on a raft, that is later seen in the opening of LA.  At the ending of LA, we see him floating on a piece of the raft, and then it ends. He's going to be floating around on that raft for weeks, eventually to die of thirst or hunger, be capsized by a wave, or maybe eaten by a shark. This is probably where this incarnation of Link dies.  However, it is possible that Link may be somewhat near land due to the presence of the seagull. So perhaps he did just float or swim his way home from there. But as this is never explicitly shown in game canon, it's really all up to speculation as to what happened from there."
truezelda,2t9j0b,Tsurii897,2,Thu Jan 22 18:07:53 2015 UTC,"We don't know if he does or doesn't make it home (I think), the ALBW Link is a different person (I know)."

truezelda,2t9j0b,malaroo,6,Thu Jan 22 09:27:08 2015 UTC,"The real issue with that theory is the fact that the Links are reincarnations of each other, which should mean they have to be dead in order for the next one to appear.

ALBW does make a point to say that Gramps is very old, but still somehow perfectly fit and spry.  Look at Ganondorf.  He found a way to live for probably somewhere close to a thousand years between OoT and Wind Waker."

truezelda,2t9j0b,Kafke,2,Thu Jan 22 15:18:25 2015 UTC,I like to believe that he drifted to a nearby island and began a new quest very much like the Odyssey with him traveling from island to island like Odysseus in an attempt to get home.

truezelda,2t1dgf,henryuuk,3,Tue Jan 20 12:53:31 2015 UTC,"This would be supported by the fact that the denizens of the sky are called humans.  They presumably adopted the name ""Hylian"" after learning about Hylia herself, but all that would mean is they are a different race of humans, separate from those that perhaps had survived on the surface in different regions, if there were any.  If not, they diverged at some point far later."
truezelda,2t1dgf,Serbaayuu,7,Tue Jan 20 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"Good question! Hyrule is not the only kingdom in this world, and in TP most people with round ears are Ordonians. Ordon is treated like it's outside of Hyrule proper. Also recall that the function of their pointed ears is to be able to ""hear the gods."" Hylians are the chosen people of the Goddess Hylia. Putting all of this together, I assume that ""normal"" humans live all over that world, while Hylians live in Hyrule with added magical abilities. Hylians sporting rounded ears in games set later in the timeline are then due to increased migration and mixing of ethnic groups after OoT. Perhaps this is what causes a decline in magic/being able to hear the gods instead of the other way around.   It is interesting that the Gerudo seem absent in TP but pop back up again in FSA and are no longer seen as sketchy thieves. Although Thelma in TP seems to be a Gerudo hybrid, I actually think that instead of mixing into the general population,  Ganon's arrest and the revelation of his plans to betray Hyrule resulted in racist attitudes  towards the Gerudo, so they left and became nomadic for a time.   Edit: I also have a theory that the way Gerudo reproduction works is this: Gerudo female + Hylian male = Gerudo female every time, except every once 100 years or so, when a male Gerudo is born. Hylian female + Gerudo male = mixed race child. Following this, Thelma is Ganondorf's descendant."
truezelda,2t1dgf,MisogynistLesbian,3,Tue Jan 20 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah both Holodrum and Labrynna are mainly populated by ordinary humans it seems. Hm, I get the impression that Hyrule is pretty small, but anyway it's probable they came from abroad. There's supposedly about a thousand years at least between OoT and TP/WW/Lttp. Given that's correct there would be well enough time in each timeline for it to happen.  The thing you mention about the Gerudos has occured to me as well. But do you really think it's likely Thelma's in Ganondorfs bloodline? In the Child timeline he's supposed to be with the Gerudo's the whole time, and on top of that he hates Hylians. Not to mention that they lose the war."
truezelda,2t1dgf,CaptianZaco,3,Tue Jan 20 19:04:22 2015 UTC,"Well, given there is ""A Gerudo male"" born every 100 years, rather than just Ganondorf every 100 years (and we don't really see Ganondorf reincarnated ever, do we? the one in Windwaker, Twilight Princess, etc, are the same man form Ocarina of Time! I just realized that a little bit ago myself.) Thelma could be descended from any Gerudo male. The only reason we only know about Ganondorf is because he's been a major problem, other Gerudo males haven't caused any problems for Hyrule, so they go unmentioned."

Also i wonder if he retains his memories of being a Gerudo at all in the original Legend of Zelda or if he has succumbed so deep into evil he only knows destruction. In Wind Waker he's still pretty human and has a reasoning to his actions. (although at that point it's mostly just revenge)   Imagine being Ganondorf getting defeated by Link, getting sealed, and then break free after a really long time. He goes like ""Well at least that kid is gone now"" only to realise another one is running around messing up everything he's trying to achieve"

At the end of OoT Link seems to be sent back to the moment when he and Zelda first met as children.  At that point, I believe Ganondorf has already poisoned the Great Deku Tree, sealed Dodongo's cavern, infested Jabu-Jabu with parasites, and is now in the castle town.  So he's been all over.  Kinda uncomfortable to talk about since there isn't any direct evidence... but I could see those attitudes we assume Ganon to have towards Hylians making it more likely that he would rape one of them (being more of a control thing than sexual thing)."
truezelda,2t1dgf,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Hm, yeah there aren't really many things that would disprove the possibility.

Yup, in MC is the earliest we see them, but their history stretches back before SS.   They don't seem to be in either Minish Cap or Skyward Sword at least.   Lots of humans in MC.   Can they be the result of Gerudo and Hylians merging; kind of explaining the absence of Gerudos in latter games?    No? If anything it's the opposite: Gerudo being the split off.   Immigration?   To Hyrule? Sure. I think Hyrule Was founded by Hylians, and then other humans came over. It's important to note that Hylians are still technically human as are Gerudo.   Can they be a result of Hylians loosing their magic abilities and their connection to the godessess over time perhaps?   Definitely.

Are the Skyloftians perhaps not really Hylians yet? ... or maybe it's just that they don't start calling themselves Hylians until they settle on the ground?   I think it's more of a matter of not needing to distinguish themselves. They are ""skyloftian"" because there's non-skyloftians also in the sky. There's no need be called ""Hylian"" because there's no non-hylians to compare to. Similarly, how we don't say we are ""human"". We are, but there's no need to mention the fact to someone who's also human.  Naturally, once they settle on the ground, anyone who might have been lurking come out (Gorons, other Humans, etc) and then the Hylians need to distinguish themselves.  Note that Sheikah, like Impa, aren't necessarily Hylian. They are the protectors of Hylians. So there's one human (sheikah) right in SS."
truezelda,2t1dgf,CaptianZaco,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"Right, I think your version of the story seems to make most sense, although Hylia have supposedly been around long before Skyloft was a thing. Do we assume they were still around just not called Hylians back then? Either way it doesn't make that much of a difference though.  I was having this conversation a bit further down with Petrichor03 who mentioned the Ooccas are supposed to have some kind of connection with the Hylians. If it's an evolutionary thing they'd probably be related to all kinds of human. Do you think it's plausible that humans evolved from Oocca or perhaps share a common ancestor? I'm not sure what to make of the subject."
truezelda,2t1dgf,CaptianZaco,1 point,Thu Jan 22 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"Do we assume they were still around just not called Hylians back then?    Correct. They only became Hylians when they were chosen by Hylia and sent to skyloft. That's why they are Hylian. They are her chosen people (who she saved).  So before then, they weren't chosen, and were regular humans like everyone else.   who mentioned the Ooccas are supposed to have some kind of connection with the Hylians   I don't quite remember TP, but I think he's picking up on the city in the sky, cloud top MC thing, and skylight connection. Which is certainly a theory floating around. But nothing confirmed AFAIK.   If it's an evolutionary thing they'd probably be related to all kinds of human.   Correct. It's also important to note that we observe the Hylian bloodlines thinning as the series progresses. See Spirit Tracks, where it's nearly gone. But yes, if they are related to Hylians, that means they are necessarily related to humans (as Hylians are simply a subsection of humans).   Do you think it's plausible that humans evolved from Oocca or perhaps share a common ancestor?   Humans have been around longer than Hylians, and definitely longer than Oocca. So they wouldn't have evolved from Oocca. But perhaps the other way around."
truezelda,2t1dgf,CaptianZaco,3,Thu Jan 22 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"Could I get an example of these round-eared people? Because, if you'll remember back to skyward sword, Zelda was the one with the typical extremely pointed ears, while Link's were more subdued, more rounded, similar to Spock. So, it could be possible that that trait is just a recessive trait found in the hylian genome, and such is possible to not appear at all during a given generation. This especially makes sense if it's the kind of gene that will change expression if both dominant and recessive are present."
truezelda,2t1dgf,KingKolder,2,Tue Jan 20 15:25:44 2015 UTC,A lot of the characters in Twilight Princess like Ilia for expample. You'll notice the same if you look at different Wind Waker and Lttp characters

truezelda,2t1dgf,Petrichor03,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:39:40 2015 UTC,In J.R.R. Tolkien's world (Middle Earth) Orcs were made from corrupted Elves. Maybe Ghirahim was made by a similar process? Take a human (or several) and shovel dark magic down his throat until he transformed into a magic sword?
truezelda,2t1dgf,Petrichor03,2,Wed Jan 21 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"Would Fi have been created in a similar manner?  Although i guess not since Ghirahim is literarily exploding with emotions while Fi posseses almost none in the beginning.  Fi seems to be a completely magical being / spirit, formed for the sole purpose of serving the wielder of the Sword and Ghirahim, while having strong emotions, seems just as determined to serve Demise only to be treated badly in return. I wonder, does he have any free will?  I guess his overly strong emotion could come from tormented souls, but he is extremely arrogant which kinda goes against it. I'm not sure what could have created such over-confidence."
truezelda,2t1dgf,Petrichor03,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:31:28 2015 UTC,"what could have created such over-confidence   He was created to be the Perfect Weapon, and I believe those exact words were used in SS? I haven't played in a while so I'm not certain but I think that's what was included. Ghirahim, to live up to his master's expectations, to be worthy of having been created, has to be perfect. Arrogance and confidence to that extreme is only natural, given his (theoretical) condition.   Also, no. Fi was stated to be created by the goddess, Hylia, and so would be more of a fairy-like being.  Also, was Ghirahim treated particularly badly by Demise? aside from being turned into a sword (which seems to be his natural form) I don't remember anything particularly harsh about Demise's interactions with (Ghira)him.   Actually, I don't remember the exact exchange (as I said, haven't played in quite a while) but I think I recall Demise casting his sword aside during his defeat cutscene. If that's so, it seems to indicate that he threw Ghirahim out of the realm Demise created for his battle, possibly sending him back into the normal world. I always thought of it was Ghirahim being rewarded for his loyalty with the one thing he didn't want... being set free to do his own thing, cut off from his master in Demise's imprisonment.   Of course, I could also be making the entire thing up, not entirely sure. Maybe I'll have time to replay sometime soon and double-check (or I'll just use Youtube). If I do, I'll add another reply."

It appears as if Demise sees Ghirahim as a mere tool not valuing his feelings. No words of thankfulness or similar, and Ghirahim gives that chocked expression (although he also laughs). It makes me wonder if Demise would really set his sword free though."

truezelda,2szv1a,shadowdsfire,7,Tue Jan 20 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"twitch.tv is a site where you can watch thousands of streams of people playing video games. Experiments like twitch plays Pokemon are very rare. This user tends to stream either OoT speedrun practice or, once a week, a few hours of live blindfolded gameplay. Now, from watching the hours-long blindfolded sessions (also available at www.youtube.com/user/Runnerguy2489) I would guess that the player genuinely plays the game blindfolded. But there will always be people who don't think that can be true, even though he, for example, also completed all child dungeons in front of a live audience. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPA_TpkzkA . After watching him for such a long time, I personally have no doubt that it's real."
truezelda,2t11dp,thebronyknight,2,Tue Jan 20 07:03:52 2015 UTC,"When you finish the Seasons, you get a password to enter when you start Ages. Also, the Red Snake gives you a password to transfer all your rings over. So while you are playing a linked game of Ages, you will get codes that you will tell to whomever the right person is in Seasons. Sometimes you have to complete a mini-game. After you tell the code to the person in Seasons, you get a code to tell Farore in Ages to bring that item back with you.  I know you asked for helpful links.  http://zeldawiki.org/Linked_Game/Secrets tells you which people you need to talk to in both games and if there is a mini-game involved."
truezelda,2t11dp,jesuswig,1 point,Tue Jan 20 09:46:52 2015 UTC,"I so far have the Seasons completion code and the ring code, so I can only get more codes as I progress through ages and then go back to seasons? I can't get all the codes in seasons first and just power through ages?"
truezelda,2t11dp,jesuswig,1 point,Tue Jan 20 09:53:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Zelda dungeon does have a password generator, but I'm not sure how it works.  Edit: http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda07Password.php if you want to check it out."
truezelda,2t11dp,souffle-etc,1 point,Tue Jan 20 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"The passwords are session-specific, so let's say you get RANDOM CODE A and use that to start your linked game. Every secret password you get in that game is totally unique to RANDOM CODE A. That's why it's pretty tricky to try and get passwords by cheating.    Just play the game, OP, you'll be fine!  There's nothing that's gonna prove more of a challenge than you can handle before the end game, so it's OK if you don't have every secret unlocked yet."
truezelda,2sym1g,GoldBananas,27,Mon Jan 19 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"I would like to see Link's Awakening remade, I honestly doubt it would happen but I feel it deserves its due. I want it remade in a similar style to A Link Between Worlds; I want the overworld to be bright and cheerful, but the dungeons to get darker and creepier as you go along (just imagine the Shadow Nightmares inside the Wind Fish's egg)."
truezelda,2sym1g,PM_ME_WARRIOR_WOMEN,43,Mon Jan 19 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"I think tp, since its visual style was so demanding. It's a great opportunity to fix the repeating textures and polygon counts that hurt the game visually.  Additionally, ss was too recent to remake."
truezelda,2sym1g,androsphere,2,Mon Jan 19 19:18:08 2015 UTC,I think Twilight Princess dserves a remake also because of some of the issues the original had. Like how Morpheel just wouldn't even attack you in the second stage of the fight.
truezelda,2sym1g,SandSlinky,3,Tue Jan 20 16:01:30 2015 UTC,It was already available on the original wii. It's still too soon for a remake too
truezelda,2sym1g,jaguilar94,2,Tue Jan 20 04:54:24 2015 UTC,What game do you think should be remade?
truezelda,2sym1g,androsphere,1 point,Tue Jan 20 05:11:06 2015 UTC,"I really hope so. I think the reason why a lot of people shy away from it is because the colors are too drab and not appealing. Once you get past that, it's really an excellent game. And HD version on the Wii U would be amazing."
truezelda,2sym1g,axtenzik,11,Wed Jan 21 19:28:45 2015 UTC,Four Sword Adventures should be the next game remade in my opinion. The gamepad would be perfect for it and they could add online features so you could play with your friends. Also it is the only Zelda that can't be played on Wii U or 3DS.
truezelda,2sym1g,Serbaayuu,3,Mon Jan 19 22:50:57 2015 UTC,Can we please get a new Four Swords instead of just re-releasing an old one?
truezelda,2sym1g,mrNiSTeR,2,Mon Jan 26 00:48:24 2015 UTC,This is the best argument I have heard for a remake so far.
truezelda,2sym1g,AngryBarista,25,Wed Jan 21 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"So your reasoning is that the next console may not have motion controls, so they remake a game with motion controls?  I think it's more likely to be TP. Already built for standard controllers. GamePad use would be easy to integrate.  Don't expect a SS remake, ever."
truezelda,2sym1g,The_First_Mimzy,10,Mon Jan 19 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"I think OP meant the next console won't have motion controls, so they will remake SS for the WiiU during this console generation. However, I am more inclined to agree with you, that TP is more likely to receive a remake. I would love to see an HD version of TP, as it is my favorite Zelda."
truezelda,2sym1g,AngryBarista,5,Mon Jan 19 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"I understood what he meant.   Guaranteed the next console is backwards compatible, so the motion control thing isn't even an issue. But, A remake at the end of a consoles life, before a new one comes out that can't play it just makes zero sense.  I honestly don't think there will be another Zelda remake for some long time.  WWHD was practice for Nintendo in how to develop in HD. It was a game that reached a very small install base. TP and SS on the other hand had an enormous install base in the Wii.  Zelda U will likely be the only Zelda game on the WiiU. It's coming at a point, halfway through the consoles lifespan. It's possible well see a remake if another Zelda isn't developed for the New WiiU 2 Mii U XL launch."
truezelda,2sym1g,sgallan89,2,Mon Jan 19 19:25:13 2015 UTC,This is what I meant. I can see TP being more likely as it is the older game.
truezelda,2sym1g,AngryBarista,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:24:39 2015 UTC,i'd be okay with tp as long as they fix the stupidly long and handholdy first half.
truezelda,2sym1g,sgallan89,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:55:33 2015 UTC,well rumour has it that when they were choosing the majoras mask remake SS was up for discussion about a remake so i don't think you'll never see one. Only thing that would hold it back i guess if the fan base for that game isnt as large as others.
truezelda,2sym1g,AngryBarista,5,Mon Jan 19 19:43:14 2015 UTC,I can't see any reason to remake SS. It already looks great and plays fine.   TP would just rock my world as a remake. It has such a unique tone and look that would be such a great compliment to the bright fluffy games we have on WiiU.
truezelda,2sym1g,I-am-so_S-M-R-T,2,Mon Jan 19 19:46:46 2015 UTC,oh don't get me wrong id love a tp remake. I have it for the gamecube and even with the component cable i still find it a bit blurry but that might just be my eyesight lol. The wiiu's engine would make tp look amazing. in fact the wiiu makes all nintendo games look amazing. I just hope if they do decide to do a remake they put it on the wiiu or at least a home console i like these remakes but not to keen that there only appearing on the handhelds.
truezelda,2sym1g,sgallan89,2,Mon Jan 19 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"Mobile remakes make a lot of sense. As a 27 year old Nintendo fan, it's getting harder and harder to not buy a 3DS."

There could be new trading sequences and a few extra items, but I think the biggest draw would be seeing the overworld, towns, and castles in HD glory.  My second choice would be The Legend of Zelda (NES), but because so many of the zelda games have a similar top-down view I think it would be more refreshing to see zelda II redone.  As an aside, apparently OOT came to be after a failed attempt to remake Zelda II."

truezelda,2sym1g,henryuuk,8,Sun Jan 25 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see OoA and OoS remade for the 3DS...they're the only ones without a version playable on a modern system, so it would make sense that they follow suit, and the 3DS allows for a lot more gameplay than the GameBoy Color did. Unfortunately, I can see people feeling a little limited by the constraints of top-down gameplay, though depending on what Nintendo were to do, they could either get around that through gameplay itself or by almost completely redoing the games."
truezelda,2sym1g,paul521,15,Mon Jan 19 20:37:53 2015 UTC,"they're the only ones without a version playable on a modern system,   Actually, they're on 3DS VC."

truezelda,2sym1g,oscarmtz88,6,Mon Jan 19 23:14:04 2015 UTC,"I also vote for TP as it deserves an HD upgrade. SS already looks good enough on it's own and and HD upgrade really wouldn't add much to it all. Will we actually get a TP HD? Unlikely, but it'd be a nice way to send off the Wii U in a few years. Let's be more excited for the new Zelda game though, right?"
truezelda,2sym1g,ChronicTheOne,5,Mon Jan 19 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"Link to the Past gets a 3DS port.. I hope, please.   Also, TP came out on the same console as WW, so it's a likely candidate"
truezelda,2sym1g,SvenHudson,3,Mon Jan 19 21:40:46 2015 UTC,"They should just upscale TP to HD (maybe texture upgrades), add gamepad controls and a hero/master quest mode and ship it for 40-50 bucks"
truezelda,2sym1g,souffle-etc,4,Mon Jan 19 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"TP for sure. It's the original order of 3d zeldas. Lot, mm and ww are all done now. I reckon even the Ds will be able to run tp soon."
truezelda,2sym1g,afiefh,6,Mon Jan 19 21:04:37 2015 UTC,I feel we're due to get a 2D game remade after all these remakes of the 3D ones.  Probably the first or second since they've aged the least gracefully.
truezelda,2sym1g,KingKolder,5,Mon Jan 19 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"I doubt there's ever gonna be a remake for a game younger than 10 - 12 years old.  (Going on release date, not development date.)    My money is on a handheld game for the next remake, like LA or OoX.  They've seen an increased popularity, they both boast some great game mechanics and interesting stories, and they'd both be easy to remaster or translate into a full blown remake.  I don't think we can expect any TP remake until at least 2017."
truezelda,2sym1g,nhof31,3,Mon Jan 19 21:59:32 2015 UTC,A Link To The Past. Because it is my favorite and because I'm an optimist. Also because it should be very simple with the Link Between Worlds engine.
truezelda,2sym1g,Brananorama,3,Tue Jan 20 07:05:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a remake for the Oracle games.  tp is my next vote although there's something about its design that makes it seem unneeded
truezelda,2sym1g,TheDetective13,3,Tue Jan 20 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"How about the Oracle games on the 3DS, with ALBW-like graphics? They could probably remake the whole game-linking reward system by implementing some Streetpass stuff."
truezelda,2sym1g,keltond95,6,Tue Jan 20 16:33:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a different stance here and say Minish Cap, a smaller remake for the 3DS and maybe, just maybe, the Wii U eShop. With Nintendo introducing Wii U/3DS crossbuy and Smash Bros. being released on two separate consoles, I don't think this is an outlandish idea.  Nintendo remade ALLTP and LA for the Game Boy; they've done remakes of their 2D games before. I think if they wanted to remake it in the art style of ALBW, they could. Add a little bit of new content, throw in the Master Quest version, and ship it out.  I don't know, it's just that the last Zelda remakes have been of the two N64 games and the GameCube game -- I think it's time for a change of pace. Minish Cap is also slightly older (11 years old as opposed to TP's 9.)"
truezelda,2sym1g,TheDetective13,3,Mon Jan 19 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Rather than a remake, I would love to see a Minish Cap II sort of game. A nice sequel!"
truezelda,2sym1g,amuller72,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:44:50 2015 UTC,I absolutely love Minish Cap and I think it definitely deserves a 3DS sequel. Something with more exploration and less kinstone everything. But I would love to connect kinstones with a friend
truezelda,2sym1g,androsphere,3,Tue Jan 20 00:02:17 2015 UTC,It would probably Kinstones you need streetpass for XD
truezelda,2sym1g,Phoxxent,2,Tue Jan 20 01:41:34 2015 UTC,I would be down with a Link To The Past remake.

truezelda,2sym1g,skippiedolittle,6,Mon Jan 19 23:05:54 2015 UTC,3 remade games in 4 years? Not so bad..
truezelda,2sym1g,shadowdsfire,4,Tue Jan 20 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they focus on making new games for a while. Besides, other non-Zelda games deserve a remake way more."
truezelda,2sym1g,Phoxxent,5,Tue Jan 20 07:32:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth noting that OoT 3D and MM 3D were handled by Grezzo, which leaves the Mainline Zelda teams to continue work on the new titles."
truezelda,2sym1g,Voreni,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:33:19 2015 UTC,You're right on both of your points. I agree.
truezelda,2sym1g,Phoxxent,0,Tue Jan 20 09:48:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, but I'm kind of tired of all the remakes in my favorite franchises lately, it's like for every new game they have completely redo the entire series, it's getting rediculous. Heck, with Zelda I almost wonder if well reach a point where it's just the same handful of games remade for each system and only that. Probably OoT, WW, and ALttP."
truezelda,2sym1g,I-am-so_S-M-R-T,2,Tue Jan 20 04:21:42 2015 UTC,"Then don't play them? I mean I get if you're not interested in the remakes, but why does it bother you if they get made or not? Looking past the obvious point of them making money off of it, it's also a way for new fans to join the series and experience games that they might have missed. It's also a way for people who ARE interested in experiencing one of their favorite games in a new way. But if you're not interested I don't see how it cheapens it for you?"
truezelda,2sym1g,TronVin,2,Tue Jan 20 06:24:59 2015 UTC,"Well, besides it adding to that old ""Nintendo just rehashes the same thing over and over"" that I hate hearing, the teams making the remakes could be making new games. They dot even have to be Zelda. I'd love to see what Grezzo could do with their own unique game. There are some times when a remake is used to help development of the current game, like with WWHD, and I'm okay with that because that experience comes faster making the remake than just playing around. But I don't really see the point of putting resources on a remake when they have already gotten that information. Making a TP remake for WiiU right now would take resources from other games, and making an OoT HD or MM HD would be obnoxious. I think remakes should be a once in a while type thing, not to be used as padding between releases."
truezelda,2sym1g,keltond95,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well, newgames take a long time to make, at least to be up to nintendo standards. Probably a lot longer than they uses to"
truezelda,2sym1g,henryuuk,2,Sun Jan 25 02:50:42 2015 UTC,Probably Twilight Princess. But I would love to see Zelda 1 done with Link Between Worlds textures.
truezelda,2sym1g,ArcAngelofJustice,2,Mon Jan 19 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"I want a remake or a sequel for Link's Awakening or the Oracle games. Even better, make the third Oracle game for 3DS. Bonus points if you can use codes from the original two"
truezelda,2sym1g,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Jan 19 23:57:44 2015 UTC,None for as long time I think. Probably twilight Princess next.

SS would obviously require Wiimote-Nunchuk and although they should be rather common among WiiU users, they're still not the default control option and could be an added cost for LoZ fans like me who either skipped Wii, or sold it at one point.  Anyway, I don't know if they can squeeze in another remake until ZeldaU comes. We'll see."
truezelda,2sym1g,Jakesta7,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"SS won't ever be remade because it wasn't a critical success, and the controls are very unique to the Wii, so much that the story even revolves around it, so they can't be altered easily without basically making a new game.  As for potential remakes:  -I can see the Oracle games (maybe LA too) possibly getting a 3DS overhaul, maybe with ALBW graphics.  -TP remake will happen eventually, question is just a matter of ""when."" Back when Nintendo announced the WW remake, they hinted that they actually internally remade WW as well as TP on the Wii U."
truezelda,2sym1g,ghost_mcl,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised if SS was the next to receive a remake anytime soon, for a number of reasons. The biggest one though is that it's far too new. Why remake a game that can already be played on WiiU in Wii mode? What can WiiU add to the game other than 1080p?   I'd be much more interested in a LoZ remake. A remake with top down graphics, hand drawn visuals and reworked story mode so that it fits more along the lines of ALttP'a story depth? Maybe an extra dungeon and item? That's much more interesting to me than a TP or SS remake.   My honest hunch though? No more remakes for a while. They're running out of 3D games to remake or update and the 2D games stand on their own. Besides, retro graphics are coming back in a big way in the last couple years."
truezelda,2sz23z,Haizenberg,3,Mon Jan 19 20:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest A Link to the Past, followed by Link's Awakening if all you have access to is GBA and GBC. If you're playing it on your phone, definitely get a controller. Playing one of these games with a virtual keypad is an exercise in frustration."
truezelda,2sz23z,BlueHg,2,Tue Jan 20 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'd hesitate to recommend Minish Cap because it wasn't made by Nintendo directly. It is very good and perhaps a little more accessible/modernized than the GB/GBC games though.  A Link to the Past is really your best bet but the Super NES version is better. SNES emulation is even easier than GBA emulation, just grab Snex9x and you're good to go."

People consider A Link to the Past to be one of the best games in the series though, so I'd say check that one out as well."

As for a proper recommendation, I'd say try them all, in no particular order. Some games need to be played in order, but this particular set is not part of that. A Link to the Past comes before A Link Between Worlds but otherwise none of them are super essential to the main story."
truezelda,2sz23z,ArtistCook,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"If you have a laptop/desktop you can get Project64 (emulator for the N64) and Dolphin emulator (emulator for Gamecube and Wii).    From there you can get Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask for Project64.  For Dolphin you can get Wind Waker, Four Swords Adventures, and Twilight Princess.  I don't think Skyward Sword is emulated yet.  For those you can buy an xbox controller and convert the controls to those that are for the system.  You can find instructions online.  My suggestions to start from those emulators are Ocarina of Time because it gets you a sense of the land of Hyrule and the races in them as well as the controls.  Wind Waker is also a good place to start if you find that appealing."
truezelda,2sz23z,dalastboss,0,Sat Jan 24 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"If you can emulate GBC, Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker are good introductions to the series. One of the beginning sequences in wind waker called the forsaken fortress can be frustrating for new players to the series, but beyond that wind waker is a soft entry to what zelda is about. I would also recommend checking out Link's Awakening to see what some of the more retro stuff is like and if you're into the idea of a game that doesn't hold your hand too much and rewards just exploring and messing around."

By the time we got Twilight Princess, I was too excited to explore the bigger world that I barely spent any time fishing. With the announcement that it was back for MM3D I only thought ""oh that's cool, two fishing areas too? Awesome"" but with THIS news.. I'm pretty fucking hyped."

truezelda,2stcws,IThoughtThisWasDigg,5,Fri Jan 23 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately Nintendo never implemented beta elements into OoT3D, and they don't go the extra mile for these things. There's no way they're gonna do this for MM3D.  Before OoT3D was released they stated ""we're gonna implement things into OOT3D that weren't in the original game"" and it turned out to just be the mediocre boss rush mode or ""technically-it-wasnt-in-the-original-but-was-released-on-the-GC"" Master Quest mode."

We already know for a fact that fishing holes are in MM3D, even though they were cut from the original.  I'm just speculating as to what might be contained within the fishing holes.  It's unreasonable to expect that there will be a Jabu-Jabu that stops the flow of time in the fishing hole, but we definitely know that there's something big out there, as evidenced by Aonuma's recent comments.

truezelda,2ssmxf,Matt2142,2,Sun Jan 18 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"The canon, main storyline games (and the systems they were originally made for) in chronological release order are:  The Legend of Zelda (NES), Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (NES), A Link to the Past (SNES), Link's Awakening (GB), Ocarina of Time (N64), Majora's Mask (N64), Oracle of Seasons (GBC), Oracle of Ages (GBC), Four Swords (GBA), The Wind Waker (GCN), Four Swords Adventures (GCN), The Minish Cap (GBA), Twilight Princess (GCN), Phantom Hourglass (DS), Spirit Tracks (DS), Skyward Sword (Wii), and A Link Between Worlds (3DS).  The non-canon Zelda games/spinoff games/crossover games are:  Zelda Game & Watch (Game & Watch), BS Zelda (Satellaview), BS Triforce of the Gods (Satellaview), Ancient Stone Tablets (Satellaview), the Zelda game watch (watch), Link: The Faces of Evil (CD-i), Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon (CD-i), Zelda's Adventure (CD-i), Navi Trackers (GCN), Soul Caliber II (GCN), Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland (DS), Tingle's Balloon Fight (DS), Too Much Tingle Pack (DSiWare), Captain Rainbow (Wii), Link's Crossbow Training (Wii), Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love (DS), and Hyrule Warriors (Wii U).  You can pretty much ignore all of the non-canon/spinoff/crossover games, though a few of them are fun. The main 17 are what you seem to be concerned with though.  The best order to play them is entirely subjective. All 17 games take place in the same universe, but many of them take place hundreds or thousands of years apart from one another, so the order you play them in doesn't matter too much. (Plus the creator of the series has said that he wants players to try to figure out the timeline of the games for themselves, so there's nothing that you absolutely have to follow along there.) A few of the games are direct sequels to one another, so it might be better to play those games in order, but it's up to you.  The games that act as fairly close sequels to one another are Legend of Zelda -> Adventure of Link | A Link to the Past -> Link's Awakening | Ocarina of Time -> Majora's Mask | Ocarina of Time -> The Wind Waker -> Phantom Hourglass -> Spirit Tracks | Oracle of Seasons -> Oracle of Ages (or vice-versa; you can play either Oracle game first and then the other operates as its sequel) | Four Swords -> Four Swords Adventures.  Playing the games in chronological release order is a good idea if you don't mind how difficult and technologically simple the earlier games are. But if you want more than that, and you want more story to grab onto as you play, I personally think the ideal order is:  Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, The Wind Waker, A Link to the Past, Link's Awakening, Legend of Zelda, Adventure of Link, Oracle of Seasons (or Ages), Oracle of Ages (or Seasons), Four Swords, Four Swords Adventures, The Minish Cap, Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Skyward Sword, and A Link Between Worlds."
truezelda,2ssmxf,Petrichor02,1 point,Sun Jan 18 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"Basically, every single game released for Nintendo hardware with the exception of Link's Crossbow Training is a main storyline game. This means the (extremely shirty) games released for the CDi are not part of Zelda canon and aren't worth playing.  If you're looking to follow a storyline through multiple games, stop right now. Very few of the Zelda games are direct sequels and going into the overarching storyline is an arduous process without researching it outside of the games themselves. I also suggest you DO NOT go looking for all the story bits until you have played a fair number of the games (mostly the 3d ones) because you will likely get spoiled.  On the 3ds, you can play the following Zelda titles   Oracle of Seasons/Oracle of Ages (game boy Color)  Link's Awakening DX (Game Boy, the same as Link's Awakening but it has an extra dungeon and is in color)  Ocarina of Time 3D (a remake of Ocarina of Time for n64, the only difference is visuals and one temple is slightly easier to navigate in OOT3D. OOT3D also includes the Master Quest version of OOT, which is essentially a Nintendo-made Romhack)  A Link Between Worlds   Majora's Mask 3D (feb 13th release date, a remake of Majora's Mask for n64, it has been updated to be more accessible.)  Phantom hourglass (ds)  Spirit Tracks (ds)  On the wii U, you can play   The Legend of Zelda (nes)  Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (nes)  Ocarina of Time (n64)  Majora's Mask (n64)  The Minish Cap (Game boy advance)  A link to the Past (snes)  Twilight Princess (wii, Game cube, the wii version is mirrored from the game cube one, but they are otherwise the same. The wii version is compatible with wii u, GC is not.)  Skyward sword (wii, requires a wiimote with Motion Plus)  Wind Waker HD (remake of Wind Waker for Game cube. This game is mostly unchanged, pacing issues in the second half were somewhat alleviated, a new Sail item was added to make sailing much faster)  All of these games are ""canon"" and important to the storyline."

truezelda,2ssmxf,Jammintk,2,Sun Jan 18 04:59:04 2015 UTC,Not really. The order doesn't necessarily matter too much. Play them in whatever order you want
truezelda,2ssmxf,Bnoob,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:54:51 2015 UTC,"Here are the various arcs if you're interested in story   Zelda  Zelda II ~~~~~~~~~~ Link to the Past Link's Awakening Link Between Worlds ~~~~~~~~~~ Ocarina of Time Majora's Mask Wind Waker Phantom Hourglass Spirit Tracks ~~~~~~~~~~ Minish Cap Four Swords Four Swords Adventures ~~~~~~~~~~ Oracle of Ages Oracle of Seasons ~~~~~~~~~~ Twilight Princess ~~~~~~~~~ Skyward Sword   The overarching plot is very limited though so if you play a game's direct sequel without playing its predecessor, I wouldn't be too concerned. Also, the two Oracle games are designed to be played in either order, so it doesn't matter which of the two you start with in that case."
truezelda,2ssmxf,JFM2796,1 point,Sun Jan 18 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"Zelda games aren't too focused on story, so the order they are played is not terribly important. There are some noticeable overarching plotlines between the games, such as with Ocarina of Time to Wind Waker, but if you choose to play WW first you won't be terribly confused.  If you aren't too picky about playing older games such as those on the NES/SNES, I'd recommend starting with the Zelda 1 on NES then A Link to the Past on SNES. Otherwise I would just go right to Ocarina of Time. OoT was the first 3D Zelda and establishes most of the main mechanics that the other 3D Zelda's are based on. It's pretty much the core 3D Zelda experience and it's really easy to get a hold of. If you have a 3DS you can play the remake which is the same game with nicer graphics. You can play one of the ports on Wii, Gamecube, and (maybe) Wii U, you can play it on N64 if you have it, or you can emulate it if you have a computer made after 2002."
truezelda,2sqnkp,benoxxxx,14,Sat Jan 17 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Creative use of the tablet.  Going into first person mode means the tablet shows link's pov. This is used to observe the environment in depth, so we don't just have navi fluttering over every single point of interest. This can also be used to perform quick item configurations on the fly. Maybe you have a boomerang whose flight characteristics change based off  its angle, or the presence of additional parts. The tablet could show the item and you can manually adjust its components.  I don't even feel these ideas are creative enough, I feel like the game can feel really fluid with good use of the tablet though."

truezelda,2sqnkp,Mutericator,23,Sat Jan 17 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"Epona as Link's inventory.  Link will always carry his sword, shield, bow, and quiver (with a variety of arrows).  He is allowed 2-3 extra items, plus a couple of bottles, when he leaves Epona.  Dungeons could be designed to require certain sets of items, but multiple sets could fulfill this criteria.  Let's say a dungeon requires the hookshot as well as either bombs or the power gauntlets.  The path to the dungeon, starting from where you're forced to leave Epona behind, would have a section very early on where you require the hookshot to progress and a little bit later could progress using either bombs or the power gauntlets.  Apply this logic to the rest of the game (maybe even increase the total number of items you can choose to add more variety).  I think this could end up really interesting.  It would give players some agency over the type of arsenal they enjoy using while still encouraging experimentation, and it would make puzzles less obvious by allowing several options for solving them."

I don't believe that limited inventory will add to the game play.  Perhaps if its implemented similar to earthbound where there is enough space for certain 'key' items and you can't store them and then there is additional space for optional items which could allow you to reach shortcuts or hidden/hard to reach rooms with special items....  ....hmm maybe it could work without endless frustration"
truezelda,2sqnkp,TheOtherSomeOtherGuy,10,Sun Jan 18 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd have to agree with the other commenter, this'd probably just drive me crazy. This is probably a fairly personal preference, but artificial restrictions with no true benefit has never been fun to me, and has actually broken for me what otherwise were enjoyable games. I feel like encouraging experimentation is a great goal but could be achieved in some way that isn't ""you're gonna have to just guess at what you might need and hope you're not wrong"".  In Megaman Legends you can only hold one special weapon (out of something like 15 weapons) at a time, presumably to encourage strategization or something. But then you get deep into one dungeon partway through the game, and if you chose anything other than the two or so weapons that will break down the wall you need to get past, then you've gotta backtrack all the way out and switch weapons (and then backtrack again if you want to go back to what you had). I love that game but holy crap why can't I switch these out on the fly? There's no benefit to the way it's set up in the game.  I'm curious if you've ever seen a game implement a sort of system like this that worked out well? Maybe I've just missed an actually good implementation of this."
truezelda,2sqnkp,Aujury,4,Sat Jan 17 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"Zelda kind of already does this (in a limited way) with bottles. Infinite bottles would make the game too easy, as Link could have a million fairies. There are also objects which must be carried in bottles, that occasionally require backtracking to retrieve.  Similarly, Skyrim has a wight carry limit to add a sense of realism, and to prevent the player from carrying thousands of healing potions.  I realize removing hammerspace isn't always convenient, but some games would be very easy without it."
truezelda,2sqnkp,androsphere,2,Sat Jan 17 18:53:42 2015 UTC,"Zelda kind of already does this (in a limited way) with bottles   It does, and I remember backtracking to get a bunch of Blue Flames to be one of the most annoying things I've ever experienced in Zelda."
truezelda,2sqnkp,malaroo,2,Sun Jan 18 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"Zelda kind of already does this (in a limited way) with bottles.   An interesting point! That being said, I do think the bottle limit and item restriction scenarios are slightly different. Limited bottles just means that you have to perform at a certain level of ability to ensure that you don't need more than however many bottles you have (e.g. if you have [x] fairies and it's not enough to get you through a certain area, then you have to improve such that you don't need fairies as frequently). This issue can be rendered meaningless through improved skill.  Whereas forcing you to whittle your inventory down to a few things (all chosen by you, regardless of whether or not you know what's up ahead) means that you could just straight up be without something you might require in order to progress, and no amount of skill can overcome that. That's more the limitation I have a problem with. Telling me I can only have [x] amount of some particular item? Alright, I can live with it. But telling me that I can only that [x] items at the expense of other items? Ehhh, not so into that.  edit: and i totally modded out the weight restriction in skyrim super early on because i just couldn't handle it, haha. i can't say it made the game particularly easy for me but that's really just because i'm just kinda bad at skyrim"
truezelda,2sqnkp,Aujury,4,Sat Jan 17 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound very fun, and sorta like the type of thing people are only now dreaming about cause some people theorized about it cause epona was loaded with gear in the trailer...    Really don't see the reason to remove hammerspace from Link's inventory all of a sudden for no good reason."
truezelda,2sqnkp,henryuuk,5,Sat Jan 17 18:25:49 2015 UTC,I really like this idea. but I also agree with u/theothersomeotherguy I feel like all required items to beat the game should be on link once he acquires them. but Epona could hold onto a stockpile of arrows potions extra bombs maybe shields and thing like the medals in skyward sword. that would be my personal preference.

Now by that I don't mean take out all of the fantasy and fun, I just mean that I want it to feel like people actually live there. People shouldn't just stand in one place for the entierty of the game, and people shouldn't be contained to two small towns with 10 people in them each. Also dungeons shouldn't just be dungeons, they should have a reason to exist in the world, for example the Goron mines, once that dungeon was completed the gorons should have moved back in and started using it."

The Only downside I found with the old save system was the fact that the 4 dungeons are very progressive in that if you leave you need to pretty much retraverse most of the rooms to get to your old spot.  Like snow head is a tower,  stone tower had flips and reflipping,greatbay gave an apparent grief with the tunnels it had  Most of the time it  wasn't a big deal but when it happens it sucks.  I guess :/ but I am relatively impartial"
truezelda,2smd5f,Jo_Onis,15,Fri Jan 16 11:56:05 2015 UTC,and that there's only 1 Triforce.      We already KNOW this isn't true. Lorule had a triforce too.
truezelda,2smd5f,henryuuk,6,Fri Jan 16 12:32:42 2015 UTC,"Oh i already forgot about that, I've played the game.  And it works in the exact same way, right? Furthermore the triforces can interact inbetween the worlds... But it's a completely mirrored world, so, different from dark world or termina.  Do we know if Lorule has it's own set of gods/godesses?"
truezelda,2smd5f,henryuuk,5,Fri Jan 16 13:49:03 2015 UTC,"No we don't, but it is implied that the Lorulean triforce embodies different virtues then the Hyrulean."
truezelda,2smd5f,Holyrapid,2,Fri Jan 16 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that it's the opposites of Hyrule's virtues, Courage > Cowardice, Wisdom > Foolishness, Power > Weak spirit. Not sure if it was /r/fantheories or what where i read it..."
truezelda,2smd5f,henryuuk,7,Fri Jan 16 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"It was a fan theory. We don't even know if the Lorulean triforce pieces would have  belonged to Ravio, Hilda and Yuga if the triforce was still full.    People assume that the triforce pieces were ""opposites"" but it is never canonically stated, nor alluded too."
truezelda,2smd5f,instantiatedObject,10,Fri Jan 16 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"it wouldn't even really make sense, either. before the Lorulean triforce was destroyed, it was considered a powerful and sought after artifact. why would a Triforce of Cowardice or Weakness be sought after?"
truezelda,2smd5f,fourfivenine,1 point,Fri Jan 16 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"Well the idea of the Triforce is that the full thing gives a wish, that's where its power comes from. After that, people try and embody its aspects to try and gain their wishes. Just because its aspects aren't brilliant things doesn't mean its powers are less strong.  On an alternative note, the people who were supposed to embody the aspects (courage, wisdom, power) just simply didn't. Maybe the goddesses didn't do their job right, maybe the people who inherited it were just useless losers. Either way, even if the second triforce had the same powers as the main one, we just didn't have people who could take this power and use it."
truezelda,2smd5f,henryuuk,1 point,Sat Jan 17 04:32:09 2015 UTC,"Well the Triforce goes towards who possesses it's quality's/ who deserves it most. the Triforce pieces itself aren't ONLY tied to their thing though. the Triforce of wisdom and courage still gives you strength/protection.    So a triforce of cowardice would still be sought after if it allowed you to maybe overcome your cowardice, not to mention the wish it would grant if you have all 3 pieces."
truezelda,2smd5f,PKThoron,1 point,Fri Jan 16 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"One of the great subtleties of ALBW is that Ravio lacks courage, Hilda lacks wisdom and Yuga lacks power. Combine that with the fact that the Triforce is missing from their world, and it makes a great deal more sense that it represents the same virtues as Hyrule's Triforce. Or, put another way, it's the lack of the Triforce that represents cowardice etc."
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,8,Mon Jan 19 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"The oracles are just named after the goddesses; they aren't incarnations of the goddesses (at least according to Hyrule Historia - this could be changed later).  However, despite that it is very likely that Nayru is the goddess of time. Then again, just because she created time doesn't mean she's necessarily the goddess of time herself. For example, Nayru is most likely responsible for the creation of wind, but Zephos is the wind god, not Nayru. So other deities can be assigned to elements that the golden goddesses created.  I personally like the theory that Hylia is the goddess of time since SS talks about Hylia looking into the future and manipulating those events with her goddess powers, which would be well within the reach of the goddess of time."
truezelda,2smd5f,1upIRL,5,Fri Jan 16 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"I also agree/support/like the theory that Hylia is the Goddess of Time, mostly because Hylia incarnate, Zelda, seems to have some time-control powers. In the end of OoT, she sends Link back in time to before he pulled the Master Sword. In MM, Tatl cries out for help from the Goddess of Time, and you in turn play the Ocarina that Zelda gave you to help you on your journey. While this isn't strong evidence, I don't think it is any weaker than the Nayru argument."
truezelda,2smd5f,JFM2796,3,Fri Jan 16 16:26:07 2015 UTC,That and it seems kind of strange to have to play a song to open the Door of Time that corresponds to only one of the three goddesses. It also helps to make Hylia feel more connected to previous games in the series.
truezelda,2smd5f,PKThoron,1 point,Fri Jan 16 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"As the bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom, Zelda is quite strongly associated with Nayru, though."
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,4,Mon Jan 19 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"That's a very solid point, I think Hylia and Nayru are very strongly connected with Zelda being Hylia, and holder of the Triforce of Wisdom. To make a comparision, if Nayru is ""God"" it feels like Hylia would be ""Jesus"". So it might be Nayru's way of acting on a lesser plane.  However i always saw Wind as Farore thing? Well for one you have quite literarily ""Farore's Wind"", then you also have the colour green which symbolises Wind and also is the colour of Link, holder of The triforce of Courage. The forest temple was originally supposed to be the Wind Temple, and the past sage of WW's wind temple is a Kokiri."
truezelda,2smd5f,Phoxxent,2,Fri Jan 16 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"Farore was said to have created life. So unless wind is a living thing in the Zelda universe, I think wind would fall more under Nayru's purview.  But of course there are plenty of things where the fan theory doesn't really match up with the games. For example, lots of people attribute the Gerudo and/or the Gorons to Din, but Din just created the earth; Farore created all living things, so the Gerudo and Gorons should come from her (even though the Gerudo and Gorons are related to the reds/browns/more earthy tones that Din is associated with).  As far as Farore's Wind goes, none of the spells really line up properly with the goddess they belong to. Fire, for example, is a property of nature, and should therefore be something that Nayru probably created. Love isn't an elemental force in the Zelda series, as far as we know, which means it is something that is created by the living, which means it should descend from Farore.  But I think you could align yourself with one goddess while still using things that another goddess made. (Given everything that Nayru created, it would be hard to not use something that came from Nayru.)"
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:01:20 2015 UTC,"But Din created the land, and it could be argued that wind is part of the land, and thus a creation of din. After all, wind isn't really a law like gravity."
truezelda,2smd5f,AliveProbably,1 point,Fri Jan 16 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"Right, but it's due to forces of nature like heat, atmosphere, and planetoid rotation, all of which seem to fall under science (""the law""), which is really what Nayru is responsible for.  It could probably be revealed later on that Din or Farore are responsible for the wind, and an argument could be made to explain why that is, but given no evidence except what's immediately in front of us, it seems more likely to me that Nayru is the goddess who probably created the wind."
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:59:34 2015 UTC,"Well, WW makes the wind out to be a sort of life-giving force, so..."
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:32:17 2015 UTC,"That's true. But wind was also made out as a life-taking force in TWW as well. So does that make it more a law of nature or product of science (Nayru), or a living entity (Farore)?"
truezelda,2smd5f,creative_sparky,1 point,Sat Jan 17 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"I see wind more as part of nature, and in japanese philosophy it can stand for growth, or change, something that is more alive.  Is there any evidence that ties Nayru to the element of wind? Otherwise i must say it seems a lot more connected to Farore."
truezelda,2smd5f,AtrophyXIX,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"Is there any evidence that ties Nayru to the element of wind?   Just that Nayru created the ""spirit of the law"" in the world, which includes things like the sky, atmosphere, and things of that nature. ALttP's back story once said that she was responsible for creating science and magic too. And since wind is produced primarily by science (heat, atmosphere/atmospheric pressure, planetoid rotation), that seems to point us towards Nayru.  Of course that's assuming wind in the Zelda universe is due to the same factors that it is in our universe, which may not be true."
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:02:40 2015 UTC,"When i asked my japanese friend about the symbolic meaning behind wind it seems to stand for hope or freedom In some aspects being courageous and overcoming your fears means being free.  But as you say, everything abides by the laws of Nayru, including wind. I guess when it comes down to it, it depends on if you see it symbolically or scientifically."
truezelda,2smd5f,AtrophyXIX,1 point,Sat Jan 17 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"Well the golden goddesses are the creators but they left. They left behind their creation and the triforce. Hylia is the goddess in charge of watching over Hyrule and possibly the world (but i have my doubts on this idea). Since I don't think she is the worlds overseer, it would be safe to assume that she doesn't have control of the universal flow of time. I think the power of time may actually be it's own thing not controlled or created by the goddesses. It exists across dimensions and universes as one ""thing"". Its power is given to whomever needs it (ocarina of time, song of time, etc) thus explaining why time was able to be controlled in a parallel universe (Termina) using the same exact method playing the same exact song even."
truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,1 point,Fri Jan 16 20:42:47 2015 UTC,It would make more sense for Farore to be the good that created wind. At least based on the OOT cut scene.

truezelda,2smd5f,Petrichor03,1 point,Sat Jan 17 23:08:35 2015 UTC,""" Nayru... Poured her wisdom onto the earth and gave the spirit of law             to the world.          Farore... With her rich soul, produced all life forms who would         uphold the law.""   In the scene itself it shows a breeze start when farores part happens, as well."
truezelda,2smd5f,ItsMikka,1 point,Sat Jan 17 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that wind is a life form in the Zelda universe? It could be since certain things in the Zelda universe don't match our own universe, but if it does match our universe in that respect, it wouldn't really match up with the intro.  And we can't really give any weight to the breeze ""starting"" in the Farore scene. After all, the breeze could have started back in Nayru's scene, and there was simply nothing for it to blow around until Farore threw in life forms that the breeze could then move around."
truezelda,2smd5f,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"The way the text is worded I just always thought Nayru was the physics of the world.

truezelda,2smd5f,TheMovieMaverick,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly how I've interpreted it too. Since there are deities that control the wind in the Zelda universe, I could see the wind just being wind spirits or something like that, but I think if it is just physics like in our world, that would point more towards Nayru."

Since you seem pretty confident that there isn't a Master Quest mode, I suppose you finished the game already or you saw some stream..?  So is there a Hero mode?

truezelda,2skejy,shadowdsfire,1 point,Sat Feb 14 11:02:53 2015 UTC,"Nah there's nothing after beat the original game, sadly."
truezelda,2skejy,NotEthosLab,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:34:49 2015 UTC,Oh well :/ probably because of the huge amount of side-quest.
truezelda,2skejy,shadowdsfire,2,Sat Feb 14 18:43:17 2015 UTC,Why would they have a master quest mode? Oot had master quest because it was a directors cut version of Oot back on the N64. It was released on a limited edition disc with both versions of Oot in america on the GameCube. Master quest's dungeons had already been designed and only needed the upgrade along side the original for the 3ds version. Why would they want to create different levels designs for Majora's Mask for a remaster?
truezelda,2skejy,creative_sparky,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:05:03 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they? It would add a lot more replayability. If there isn't a master quest I'm certain there will at least be a hero mode where everything deals double damage.
truezelda,2skejy,muzog,0,Fri Jan 16 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"Well for one, the team that made ura Zelda (Master Quest) was the same team that made Oot. If they made a Majora's Mask Master Quest it would be a different team designing the dungeons. I understand that you're being hopeful but Master Quest was made a long time ago. They didn't make one for Majora's Mask so why would they make one on top of the significant changes that they have already made to the remake? Besides you can't expect them to do the same thing they did with an entirely different game."
truezelda,2skejy,creative_sparky,5,Fri Jan 16 03:38:33 2015 UTC,I don't understand why you think Nintendo adding Master Quest is so outlandish. It's not crazy for a developer to add something like Master Quest to a remake of an old game so that gamers have something new rather than just a prettier version of something they've played before.  You also didn't address what I said about Hero Mode. And in all honesty I think a Hero Mode is more likely than a Master Quest. But I don't think Master Quest would be unreasonable.
truezelda,2skejy,muzog,0,Fri Jan 16 03:49:48 2015 UTC,I didn't address hero mode because it actually makes sense to me that it would be in this game. My point is that they have already done a bunch of new things with MM3DS. Trust me I hope that I'm wrong. But master quest for MM just doesnt make sense.
truezelda,2skejy,creative_sparky,2,Fri Jan 16 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"Even if they do have a master quest mode (master mask mode?) there are only 4 dungeons to work with, plus a few mini dungeons. I don't think that's enough to make it worth while as majora's mask is mainly about the side quests."
truezelda,2skejy,njozzy,0,Fri Jan 16 04:40:01 2015 UTC,"So what if there are only 4 dungeons? That would simply make making master quest easier. Look at it this way: Grezzo has been making this game for almost 4 years now, don't you think it would be a little odd if there wasn't a master quest? It's not like completely new dungeons are unheard of for Zelda remakes either, see: color dungeon. I think that having a whole second quest would always be worth while, especially on something as short as MM. If there were more dungeons, you'd be saying that it would be too much work."
truezelda,2skejy,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri Jan 16 20:02:37 2015 UTC,Did I say Master Quest? I meant hero mode. My mistake!
truezelda,2skejy,shadowdsfire,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:07:11 2015 UTC,It's not like Master Quest was some massive overhaul that shook the game to it's core. All it did was throw a few more Song of Time blocks and silver rupees in each dungeon. Seeing as this game has been in development longer than the original it isn't unreasonable at all to assume there will be a Master Quest.
truezelda,2skejy,JFM2796,2,Sat Jan 17 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"The dungeons were completed differently with new puzzles. I don't think you understand what that means. The game's core is literally the dungeons. That is exactly where the team is important. Take away the dungeons from the game and you don't really have much of a game. A horse race and some story. The part of the game that made it a game was recreated while maintaining the same map shake and area.   Again MM3DS has plenty of things that are new and different. All the bosses got new designs and some bosses got changed. New statues were added and we may see more masks. Bomber notebook interaction has been overhauled. They've already done so much for this game. there is no reason for me to expect a new Master Quest and in fact I believe it would be wrong of me to expect so much.   Clearly you don't want to change your mind on this so nothing I say to you will change your opinion. I hope that I am wrong but I've learned that not expecting Nintendo to do all the above and beyond stuff, usually results in me being pleasantly surprised by something new that they do that was unexpected period."

truezelda,2skejy,robotortoise,1 point,Fri Jan 16 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"Even if there is a master quest,  they'd only be rehashing 4 dungeons :/ unless they go the distance and make the desks palace complex,  the lens of truth getting more difficult,  the pirate fortress more difficult and the well and ikana castle more difficult too. Let's throw in the bonus rooms at majora too if they ramp up the difficulty for those heart pieces too sheesh that'll be fun"
truezelda,2shtdz,Stevenjgamble,6,Thu Jan 15 07:16:25 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that's just the general key items page. Sword/Shield, Songs, Boss Masks, etc."

truezelda,2shtdz,horridpineapple,0,Thu Jan 15 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the feather statue is something you can place at will and carry with you. When you're load the save you can ""collect"" it and pick it up. Or maybe you have to find them and collect them so it's a limited amount of ""free"" saves."
truezelda,2sgw9q,kingkaikai,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:46:33 2015 UTC,"Looking like it's going to shape up well. Swamp looks especially beautiful. And it looks like they retained quitting the game upon saving, which I appreciate."
truezelda,2se9yv,Yenaro,13,Wed Jan 14 13:00:05 2015 UTC,"This might be a good idea, but I think it would be better just in a few areas throughout the game. Link is too much of a figurehead for the series to not use him as the main character."
truezelda,2se9yv,EthicsBuster,4,Wed Jan 14 13:22:19 2015 UTC,"Zelda is portrayed as a badass often enough (Sheik, Tetra) that I really think she ought to be a playable character in conjunction with Link at some point. It would be great if she had her own set of unique tools as well."
truezelda,2se9yv,GoogleMeTimbers,2,Wed Jan 14 18:54:58 2015 UTC,she ought to be a playable character in conjunction with Link at some point.   You mean like Spirit Tracks?
truezelda,2se9yv,HylianHal,2,Sat Jan 17 21:17:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't played ever Zelda title, particularly handhelds. Didn't know there was one like this. Very cool. I'll need to check it out sometime soon."
truezelda,2se9yv,GoogleMeTimbers,5,Sun Jan 18 02:21:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind seeing a female Link at some point, especially if it was optional. Link as is doesn't have much impact on the story other than stabbing things so it's not like changing his gender would make much of a difference other than the way he interacts with Zelda. Could provide the game with some interesting replay value as well."
truezelda,2se9yv,JFM2796,9,Fri Jan 16 23:48:29 2015 UTC,Middle aged Link with an awesome beard would be awesome.  He could go rescue he and Zelda's child.  It could be like Taken with swords.
truezelda,2se9yv,sasquatch606,10,Wed Jan 14 14:39:19 2015 UTC,"Except he won't have a great speech on the phone, feel just say HYAH! And hang up."
truezelda,2se9yv,easycure,3,Wed Jan 14 15:30:00 2015 UTC,I would play the ever-loving heck out of that game.
truezelda,2se9yv,astewy17,3,Thu Jan 15 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe a game in which you play as a young Hyrulean adventurer, and you learn swordplay from a retired Link? It would be cool to see some of Hyrule in the interim between big, bad, world-ending events, with Link trying to live a normal life."

truezelda,2se9yv,HylianHal,6,Sat Jan 17 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"I think you'll always have to play as Link, but I also don't think Link has to always be the same.  For example, Link could be a girl, or a gerudo, or old and bearded."
truezelda,2se9yv,joshuran,3,Wed Jan 14 13:47:24 2015 UTC,I would love something like that.  I've been dying for Nintendo to switch up the formula a little.
truezelda,2se9yv,astewy17,2,Thu Jan 15 00:04:12 2015 UTC,"But would they name a female Link Link?  I guess they don't have to mention the name though, since we just know it's Link in the games even if they don't always say the name. The character would still be Link, but would it be ""Link""? If that makes any sense"
truezelda,2se9yv,Jo_Onis,3,Wed Jan 14 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"Linkle actually, source"
truezelda,2se9yv,aknight99,2,Wed Jan 14 17:22:16 2015 UTC,Linkle actually looks badass.  Wished they would of added her.
truezelda,2se9yv,aknight99,1 point,Wed Jan 14 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always thought that a female link just wouldn't work, at all. Just seeing the images makes me change my mind, I think it would be nice to play as male or female. Worked pretty well in Fire Emblem Awakening and eventually into Smash Bros."
truezelda,2se9yv,Arathgo,4,Wed Jan 14 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"I actually hate the idea of Link becoming a girl. Why can't he just stay a he? It seems ludicrous to me that people want it to change for whatever their reason. You don't see people clamouring that Samus should be a guy, or Lara Croft. But maybe that's just me..."
truezelda,2se9yv,astewy17,2,Wed Jan 14 20:53:21 2015 UTC,They've been doing the same dang formula for nearly thirty years.  I would love it if they changed it up a little.  Having Link be a young male Hylian every single time is getting a little old to me and to plenty of my friends who are Zelda fans.
truezelda,2se9yv,ButItWasMeDio,4,Thu Jan 15 00:06:11 2015 UTC,It's not a new Samus or Lara Croft in every game though.
truezelda,2se9yv,JFM2796,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"Well those characters are all the same person in all games in their franchise if I'm not mistaken, where as Link has been shown to be a different person in almost every game just reincarnated. As long as they keep it optional I don't really see any reason why there couldn't be a female Link."
truezelda,2se9yv,progdrummer,1 point,Fri Jan 16 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"I have no objection with Link being male, however there's nothing wrong with Link having a sister or female companion helping out either."

truezelda,2se9yv,liquidDinner,1 point,Fri Jan 16 06:55:46 2015 UTC,"I'd rather play as an actual female character, instead of a male character who happens to have a vagina in this game."
truezelda,2se9yv,DudeWynaut,5,Fri Jan 16 03:37:01 2015 UTC,"I liked the Clockwork concept that went around a few years ago. They had some interesting ideas with switching Zelda and Link's roles.  I'm not sure I'd want to fully give up playing as Link, though. He's become iconic for being the only character present in every game. If there was another playable character, it might work best to have the player switch between Link and the other. The couple mask quest in MM did this slightly, and I thought it was an interesting puzzle. They could do something similar, but more in depth."
truezelda,2se9yv,Frogandtoad18,2,Wed Jan 14 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"In a way, yes. I would like it if they let me customize Link. Let me give him brown hair and green eyes, a chance to equip all sorts of different armors and garbs, and to pick up the weapons of my enemies."
truezelda,2se9yv,dozersmash,2,Thu Jan 15 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"I prefer playing as just Link- I like that a ""non-canon"" game like Hyrule Warriors lets you take control of many of the other characters, but as for the main series I like having Ljnk as the only character you can play as."
truezelda,2se9yv,CaptianZaco,1 point,Thu Jan 15 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"Well the CD-I games did that awesomely bad.  I sometimes wish there were more mainline Zelda games.  I know they take a long time to make, but I feel that Nintendo has the resources to do so.  I think if they only come out ever three or four years they aren't going to put all that time and money on a non-Link character."
truezelda,2se9yv,ZippityZoppity,-2,Wed Jan 14 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe they could have another team make a game set in Hyrule, that isn't technically a LoZ title. It would be similar style and share characters, maybe even having Link or others as supporting characters, but would follow along with a more skyrim-Esq gameplay of adventuring around Hyrule and having fun, rather than saving the world from some all-consuming evil."
truezelda,2se9yv,TinyEnemyShrimp,1 point,Thu Jan 15 05:38:43 2015 UTC,"I would like to at least see different versions of Link, like an older one as mentioned.  I also wouldn't mind playing as Zelda or Sheik as well. I kind of envision doing a dungeon where you have to split up and do separate parts of it using specific characters. This could be doable with one or two-players, as the one-player could just park one of the characters in a spot while they progress further with another one, kind of like the thief's hideout you do with Kafei in MM."
truezelda,2se9yv,CaptianZaco,1 point,Wed Jan 14 15:50:33 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy if Link had company in dungeons more often, it worked pretty well in Wind Waker although I do wish they got involved in combat as well. Not that either of them seemed particularly adept at fighting. I don't need to control them directly, and I don't think that should be an option since the point of Link is to represent us the player. On the other hand, having more allies around and being able to direct them seems like the best way to go for Zelda."
truezelda,2se9yv,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"I remember in Oracle of Ages there was a guy that ran around, Ralph, was it? I think if there was another game set in Labrynnia or something he should accompany Link for part of the game, and actually do something other than running in and out of screen every so often.   A while back I started on an idea for a LoZ-spinoff game where you played as a Darknut outcast who tried to find his place in the world. it was open-ended and you could try and become mercenary for various factions (Hyrule, Gerudo, Bulblins, etc) or just wander around and do quests and such until you have enough money and friends in one area to settle down, thusly ""winning""."
truezelda,2se9yv,Serbaayuu,1 point,Thu Jan 15 05:41:38 2015 UTC,"You could have an interesting lead if you had a companion like Midna who could probably fight for themselves and on occasion you split up.  Technically don't you control Kafei briefly in MM?  Also, we've seen some pretty badass stuff in Hyrule Warriors. I would not mind controlling ANY of those characters in an actual game, if only temporarily.  Perhaps it could also be a new item that you receive. So like you are adult link and thus too small to go into some areas so you use an item to summon up young link or something."
truezelda,2se9yv,jmoney777,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:40:43 2015 UTC,I'd like to see something done in the style of Dream Drop Distance or Birth By Sleep where you can switch between two or three characters going through the story together on their own paths.  It'd be easy to make both Link and Zelda playable in that format.
truezelda,2se9yv,artboiz,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"How about ""The Legend of Link"" where we play as Zelda."

Anyways: I'd really like a middle-aged Link with family etc. I sometimes just miss real bonds to other characters in game. Real emotional value.   I don't think it will happen though, because Legend of Zelda always had an innocent vibe and playing as a full grown man, will probably take that away. Not that I would be against a Zelda for adults, but I'm pretty sure this wont happen. And there's still Dark Souls."
truezelda,2se9yv,KingKolder,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"You play as Darmani , Mikau and the butlers son and a deity in majoras mask,  u play as so many ppl in hyrule warriors,  you play as Zelda in spirit tracks,  you play as linebeck iirc I'm phantom hourglass for a few sequences and you play as Kafei in majoras mask for a sequence   Want more characters go play those games"
truezelda,2sezq7,Stevenjgamble,3,Wed Jan 14 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Well there was fishing in both trailers, and seeing as this was posted 20 mins ago, you could have easily checked this yourself."
truezelda,2sezq7,OH_ITS_MEGACRUNCH,3,Wed Jan 14 17:21:56 2015 UTC,It's been known for quite some time that we'd have two fishing locations in MM3D.  The only thing we learned today from gameplay footage is where those would be: one in the swamp and one at Great Bay.
truezelda,2sezq7,zeldahq,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:21:11 2015 UTC,2 fishing holes were already confirmed. The Swamp and Great bay are the two locations. Fishing works like in OoT.

truezelda,2sbbi7,Robthomson39,20,Mon Jan 19 21:02:33 2015 UTC,Any zelda game is a magical experience. I've found that even a subpar zelda game is better than most games out there. Don't listen to the critics. Your experience is your own and makes it unique.
truezelda,2sbbi7,TacosAndFishsticks,6,Tue Jan 13 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"I really liked spirit tracks. The pipe flute has some difficulty playing sometimes, but other than that, was a great game. The ending is probably one of my favorite endings of any Zelda game."
truezelda,2sbbi7,iNachozi,2,Tue Jan 13 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"This was my problem with it. The pipe flute was incredibly frustrating to use, and really didn't get enough practice when you first received it. I find myself getting stuck every time I play it at the flute scenes. It was a cool idea, but I hope that mechanic dies.   Other than that I think it was a wonderful addition to the franchise. It's by no means the best, but it's definitely a unique game, and really doesn't deserve the hate."
truezelda,2sbbi7,seanm826,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"TBH, the mechanic would work better on the consoles now, since the 3DS mic and WiiU mic are better at registering you blowing into them (WiiU especially)    The mechanic should definitely come back BUT they should give you the OPTION to instead use a button to blow. (like the shoulder buttons)"
truezelda,2sbbi7,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Jan 14 00:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be interesting to have option so that hardware defects or other problems don't ruin the game.   To be honest they could have implemented it this way in oot 3d with the ocarina. I have a feeling they did scrap it, just like they probably scrapped the motion controls in Zelda 2015."
truezelda,2sbbi7,seanm826,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:26:21 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the Phantom Hourglass and was excited to play Spirit Tracks but unfortunately I was never able to figure out how to play the flute. I googled how to do it when it came out and there wasn't much information about except that other people were having trouble figuring out how to play the flute. Unfortunately I never made it to the end. Maybe I should pick it up again since you say the ending is worth it!
truezelda,2sbbi7,theheat219,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:00:14 2015 UTC,"Also at the end you play a duet with Zelda... With the flute.. It took me about 4 or 5 tries  ._. It was so worth it though, after you do it successfully the full song plays and it's absolutely beautiful and heart wrenching. Gave me a lot of chills."
truezelda,2sbbi7,iNachozi,7,Wed Jan 14 07:04:26 2015 UTC,"Dude, don't. you'll only get to hear good things from people that love the game, ignoring all the flaws. and bad things from the people that hate the game, exaggerating all the things they disliked and so forth.    Just play the game, and make your own opinion on the matter. Then post it on the internet and get insulted for having a different opinion. it's the way it should be."

truezelda,2sbbi7,Epicfaillord,2,Wed Jan 14 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the newness of it.  It doesn't feel much like any other Zelda title.  It's one of my least favorite Zelda games, and I often forget about it, but it's by no means a ""bad game.""  I would say some parts get a bit repetitive which was my biggest issue with it.  But again, I'm glad I played it.  I'd say just go into it with an open mind.  It was a fun game."
truezelda,2sbbi7,Indosay,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, I didn't like Spirit Tracks because I don't like the concept of controlling both Link and having to manoeuvre another person through dungeons. It's one of the main reasons why I don't like two of the dungeons in Wind Waker and the whole concept of the Dominion Rod from Twilight Princess. But that's just my preference."
truezelda,2sbbi7,ConvertiblePenguin,1 point,Tue Jan 13 23:12:48 2015 UTC,"Imagine stopping the train at any moment and being able to depart. Imagine how expansive New Hyrule is, how tall the mountains are, how deep the forests go. Damn.. Imagine all that unexplored, uncoded territory."
truezelda,2sbbi7,kpujj1,1 point,Wed Jan 14 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"I just beat it and loved it. I've played every Zelda and think it's fine. Definitely not the best one out there, but still a respectable part of the series. The key is to not get dragged down by the train tracks (use them as little as possible and combine trips with side quests—such as looking for rabbits—and you'll be fine). Get absorbed in the story ASAP, which I found somewhat hard because it doesn't have as majestic a story as other Zeldas and has some more comedic elements to it. For me, the ending and the developments just before the last dungeon is just when things really pick up well and turn into a more glorious experience.  Have fun!"
truezelda,2sbbi7,MiyamotoFn,1 point,Wed Jan 14 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"I actually played ST recently and came to find that it was one of my favorite mobile Zeldas.   The first thing to note is that compared to EVERY other Zelda game, the controls SUCK. But once you get over that you can start enjoying it. I think it really made excellent use of the DS at the time between the microphone gyroscope and touchscreen.   In case you're interested here is my review. Just keep in mind that there are spoilers."

truezelda,2sbeud,Jo_Onis,6,Tue Jan 13 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"Many people theorize that the dark mask-using tribe who created the Fused Shadows and were banished to the Twilight Realm to eventually become the Twili also had a faction escape into Termina and bring with them/create Majora.  I am one of those people.  Aside from that tribe, whose evidence consists of using mask-based magic, I don't think any other group of people we know of in Zelda matches the creators of Majora's Mask well enough to make any solid theories."
truezelda,2sbeud,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jan 14 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"The mask of truth has the sheikah emblem on it and is used to talk to stones with the sheikah emblem. Could be evidence they use masks.  Also, as the shadow temple is supposed to be something to do with the sheikah its possible that the group who eventually became the twili were actually sheikah. After all, perhaps the fused shadows were originally made in the shadow temple by sacrificing and killing people and thus they were balanced. Perhaps that is why it is called the shadow temple."
truezelda,2sbeud,Crim_drakenya,2,Wed Jan 14 08:57:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I always liked the theory that the ""Dark interlopers"" were more like a ""clan"" of different races, working together to obtain the triforce through their dark forbidden magic.    The way that Link is shown as Dark Links, and even humans turning evil, as well as the Twili's being such a vast range of different heights/sizes/forms also could point at that."
truezelda,2sbeud,henryuuk,2,Wed Jan 14 12:02:47 2015 UTC,Its definitely a possibility. Or perhaps their race has evolved in such a way that depending on their status within the 'tribe' their bodies change. Or perhaps their bodies are altered magically to suit certain tasks.
truezelda,2sbeud,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:42:49 2015 UTC,"Could be, offcourse we also don't see any twili's that weren't altered by Zant's magic except Midna and Zant. Since we don't know how much the sol's counteract the corruption magic."
truezelda,2sbeud,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:48:25 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty interesting connection with the Mask of Truth. It would be really awesome if it was just one big connection between the Ancient Tribe, the Sheikah and the Twili and they all were the same.  I guess we could assume Happy Mask Salesman is a part of this tribe, or at least he seems to possess very special magic abilities. Although his eyes are not red so perhaps that excludes him from being a possible Sheikah."
truezelda,2sbeud,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Thu Jan 15 03:59:26 2015 UTC,Don't his eyes go red when he does his whole angry bit? So perhaps he is some sort of half-breed? Either that or he is part of the Kurta clan from Hunter X Hunter
truezelda,2sbeud,JFM2796,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:42:01 2015 UTC,"Haha, that would have been something. But, I got the impression they're just bloodshot at most when he's angry"
truezelda,2sbeud,CaptianZaco,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"I think that they probably already worshipped Majora and created the Fused Shadow in it's image, given the similarities in design of the two."
truezelda,2s8xon,jscoutabout,16,Tue Jan 13 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Wind Waker Link has any connection to the Hero of Time. Rather than being the Hero reincarnated, Wind Waker Link had no link to Hylia's/Demise' reincarnation cycle. Since the Hero of Time was sent back to his own timeline, the adult timeline no longer had a person containing the spirit of Hylia's chosen hero. Instead of being a reincarnation of the chosen hero, Wind Waker Link was a new hero entirely, which is why he had to prove himself by collecting the Triforce of Courage. At least that's how I've always understood it. Could be way off."
truezelda,2s8xon,TheHynusofTime,3,Tue Jan 13 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since I played WW , but isn't there a point in Wind Waker when Ganondorf explicitly tells you that your are the Hero of Time's reincarnation?"
truezelda,2s8xon,Darklugia,12,Tue Jan 13 12:38:43 2015 UTC,He says that but Deku tree and the boat say you have no connection. I think Ganondorf's information probably came from him seeing a green guy showing up to fight him again and just connecting the dots
truezelda,2s8xon,Ontopoly,5,Tue Jan 13 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"weren't they saying that you weren't descended from him? As in, didn't carry his blood. I think WW was still the goddess's chosen hero, and he needed to collect the triforce not to prove himself, but to gain the power he needed to open the way forward, as have various other heroes throughout time and accross worlds. WW is the first of a new line of knights, but the cycle of chosen heroes never broke. After all, is Hylia not still there to choose her hero?"

And you believe them?"
truezelda,2s8xon,potentialPizza,3,Wed Jan 14 02:47:19 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the Spirit of the Hero is something that one can be born with, or earn."
truezelda,2s8xon,Serbaayuu,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"Since the Hero of Time was sent back to his own timeline, the adult timeline no longer had a person containing the spirit of Hylia's chosen hero.   This is disproved by the Hero's Shade and Gramps [ALBW].  The Hero's Shade is the Hero of Time's ghost.  That is, he is literally the ""Spirit of the Hero"".  But the Hero of Twilight also, presumably, has the Spirit of the Hero.  Which means there can be more than one person with the Spirit of the Hero in existence at once.  It's also heavily implied in A Link Between Worlds that Gramps is a Hero, and he's still ALIVE.  Which means there can be multiple Heroes alive at once.  This means that there is no ""transfer"" of a soul, spirit, essence, or anything between two mortal Heroes.  Since there is no transfer, the Hero of Time leaving the universe would do exactly nothing.  The Hero of Winds is yet another incarnation of the Spirit of the Hero, because the Spirit of the Hero is not a ghost, it's a universal law.  When Hyrule is in danger, someone courageous and with the willingness to do good at all costs will appear.  Also, I find the ""Hero of Time left the timeline"" reasoning ridiculous for several reasons, but this in particular: the reincarnation cycle is pretty clearly back after Wind Waker and Spirit Tracks - do you think the reincarnation cycle just needed some time to RECHARGE, or something, if it had been broken?  How does that make any sense?  The Hero of Winds did not start a new reincarnation cycle, because nothing he did even remotely implies it.  Also, before anybody brings up Daphnes or the Tree saying ""You have no relation to the Hero"" - yeah.  They're talking from the perspective of people who were alive after the Hero of Time had gone away.  They are mortals.  They have no idea that the reincarnation cycle even exists.  Nobody in Hyrule does.  How could they possibly be a reliable authority on that?"
truezelda,2s8xon,Drinkmydespair,0,Wed Jan 14 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"Link is always from the same bloodline. Hyrule was flooded but the descendents of the Hylians occupy the islands of the sea.  You can extrapolate that someone had to carry this bloodline down in order for the hero to be reincarnated.    EDIT: In the original LoZ Link had to collect the Triforce of courage in order to down Ganon, so this is not the first iteration where collecting triforce pieces was something our Hero had to do."
truezelda,2s8xon,TheHynusofTime,11,Tue Jan 13 06:49:40 2015 UTC,"In the original Legend of Zelda, Link was hunting for the Triforce of Wisdom, not courage, and it was split by Zelda herself. In Wind Waker, the Triforce was split when the Hero of Time was sent back in time by Zelda.  And the different Links aren't linked by bloodlines, with a few exceptions. For the most part, it works as a sort of reincarnation."

I think this one is coincidental.  The art style of Skyward Sword is very diamond-heavy."

truezelda,2s7x0m,Andrzej_Jay,2,Tue Jan 13 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"Right, but the story pretty much kicks off with ""where's zelda????"", which would be entirely negated if Fi apparently knew where she was and went to her to get that diamond."

Fi is supposed to leads the chosen hero on a quest to strengthen himself and the sword so that he'll be able to retrieve the triforce and worthy to wield it."
truezelda,2s7x0m,Crim_drakenya,0,Thu Jan 15 01:03:20 2015 UTC,Zelda goes to the ground after being kidnapped. She then begins awakening as Hylia and has her new clothing. What if using her magic she sent the gem back in order to wake up the goddess sword? Or perhaps the gem's own magic does this? Fi would not be aware of zelda's location whilst in gem form as she had not 'woken up'  and so couldn't direct Link to Zelda.

I would, however, welcome any new additions to gameplay or extra sidequests.  Selfie mode would be fun, like in WWHD, as well as the streamlining that that game implemented. Doing this with the Elegy of Emptiness would be especially wonderful.

I really love the Bremen Mask for example, for being able to get the Skeletons to follow you in Ikana Valley Boss fight.

Streamlining animations is a good thing.  My hopes:   Some reference that can act as a hint that Lorule and Termina exist in the same world.  Have Kafei refer to himself as a cousin of the Lorulean Royal Family or something offhanded. I hope nothing gets oversimplified.  Everything should be as tricky for a first-timer as it was on the N64. With that said, a slight improvement to the goron and swimming controls would be welcome.  Don't make them too easy but they were a little unforgiving in the original.

I agree with you about not oversimplifying anything, I think OOT3D kept the difficulty pretty well on par with the 64 version. The only way I can think of it being a little easier is that it runs smoother and the camera/z targeting doesn't feel as clunky on the 3DS. Hopefully that ease of control carries over to the transformations, and I would add that maybe a slightly more obvious shadow for Deku Link while flying would be an improvement too."

Though the details of how deep this disguise goes are vague, and there is a lot of controversy about it. Nintendo (specifically Bill Trinen) has recently given their official stance on the subject:  ""The definitive answer is that Sheik is a woman—simply Zelda in a different outfit.""  So, given this piece of information, it is clear that Sheik is not a separate male entity, and that Zelda doesn't magically conjure up a penis as part of the costume.  Though the character/alter ego of Sheik is still distinctly male, despite the costume-wearer beneath the clothes and altered appearance being a female. Ruto refers to Sheik with male pronouns in Ocarina of Time, and it is clearly obvious that others are supposed to assume that this is a Sheikah boy. Despite the definitive answer that there is still a physical female beneath the costume, the character is male.  For example: look at these two cosplayers. Cosplayer A and Cosplayer B. Both are in costumes of our favorite hero, Link (well, one is Dark Link, but... same thing). Link is a male character. Link is still a male character despite the fact that Cosplayer B is actually a woman.  That being said, the answer to your question is that yes, Sheik is just Zelda in a magical disguise, and Sheik himself is only a made-up character even in the games."

In ST it's just a stupid multi-part dungeon that I'd rather finish all in one go. In PH, it's interesting because you have to trek back down (or was it up?), and you could find faster ways of getting through when you progress through the game.   The traveling becomes quite tedious after a while   Again, ST was worse in this regard. PH mostly kept WW sailing, but added enough things (and reduced map size) to keep it interesting. ST just had a linear on rails (literally) thing, where you had to keep back tracking every time the AI got in your way.   But yeah mostly people seem to dislike the traveling.   I disagree.

truezelda,2rzyeb,CobaltCab,19,Sun Jan 11 06:16:25 2015 UTC,"It's easily my least favorite Zelda game. It's still alright for a game in general, but it lacks a lot of the Zelda charm and quality.  Mostly it boils down to bland dungeons, and a distinct lack of an overworld (replacing it with a train minigame).  On top of that, the flute controls sucked, the train theme was overdone, the geography was weird, the train game was boring, and as a whole the game was pretty mediocre.  All of the ""good parts"" were simply rehashed and borrowed from Phantom Hourglass (a much better game, but still not one of the better Zeldas). Such as the map drawing, planned vehicle routes, central dungeon, etc.  The best part of Spirit Tracks was the end. And I don't mean it in a sarcastic way. I liked that special map where you had to navigate carefully. I liked the train boss and the final link/zelda boss. And I liked the open-ended choose-what-happens ending.  Overall though, pretty much every other Zelda game far surpasses it."
truezelda,2rzyeb,Kafke,6,Sat Jan 10 23:13:31 2015 UTC,"I actually gave up at the final part, kinda want to try again as I've beaten every other Zelda gamr"

The flute would commonly not work if you didn't input the notes fast enough, sometimes overshot into nearby notes wrecking the song you were playing (making you have to restart). On the special cutscenes, you had to get the tempo/timing right as well.  It's a huge pain in the ass. Just for general playing of songs you learned, it's a bit easier though.

I never experienced a ""Yes! I did it!"" moment. Dungeons: Way too short and again too easy. Lack of exploration. This is a big one. On rails on ST and even the boat in PH was very limiting. Story: Both villains were awful and underdeveloped. I never felt like they posed any real danger. Having to return to the same place over and over: Granted, this was much worse in PH, but ST still had it and it was boring. Touch controls: Never felt intuitive.

truezelda,2rzyeb,Thexare,2,Sat Jan 10 22:15:44 2015 UTC,"I never played Spirit Tracks, but I heard it controlled very similarly to Phantom Hourglass. This in fact is why never played it, because I absolutely hated PH's reliance on touchscreen controls. Whether the nonstandard controls work well or not doesn't really matter to me (and yes, I did give PH and SS a chance) - I do not like them."
truezelda,2rzyeb,Thexare,0,Sat Jan 10 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"Funny, I heavily prefer nonstandard controls over traditional. I have never had any issues controlling Link in either of the two games.

I had a bit more trouble with Skyward Sword's motion controls, but slingshot (I think? been so long I forgot) aside they were still functional.  I wouldn't object to nonstandard controls being used again in the future, but only if there's also an option for traditional controls.

truezelda,2rzyeb,Epicfaillord,2,Sat Jan 10 22:54:00 2015 UTC,"Train/overworld were annoying, and led directly to... A lot of sidequests ended up being escort quests, where the person you're escorting asks you to follow arbitrary instructions They changed the way you roll from PH, where you drew little circles to tapping, which feels wrong (it interrupts you walking by making you take the stylus off the screen) The pipes were fiddly, didn't enjoy them. I liked the TotOK, finding shortcuts was cool (I even went on to do some sub-thirty second runs, that is, playing through it multiple times for fun). The tower in ST was less fun, it had the drawback of the same aesthetic multiple times (boring), without being able to get familiar with and master the area.   Just overall, it felt like a step back from Phantom Hourglass as a whole, and I'm not sure I could ever say that any other Zelda game has ever disappointed me like that. Sure there may have been a change I didn't like, but nothing has ever felt so much like regression, every other game felt like it was bright and new in some way."

truezelda,2rzyeb,Creative_Deficiency,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to poop on a game you love so my apologies. In short: everything is wrong.  I made it all the way through phantom hourglass through sheer force of will, and made it to the shadowy part of the tower of spirit tracks. Anyway, I'll try to sum up my opinions succinctly.  The games mcguffin (spellcheck?)   I find that both the sailing and the trains in both games are super boring and make exploration neither fun nor rewarding. I felt no motivation to ever sail or locomote to any location other than where the story led me to.  Because of this, and the way that travel was set up, the world never felt fully actualized or alive. Even barren towns in Zelda (see kakariko village in twilight princess) still have character, which those games severely lack. Also, reinforcing the pointlessness of exploration.   General game feel  I hate the way they control. They tried to ""innovate"" with the touch controls, and I hate that I have to take points off for it, but they didn't innovate, they just made it hard to play. Tapping things doesn't feel impactful or intuitive.  Also, only using one weapon at a time felt really shitty, even when other games that forced you to only have one useable item felt fine (see a link to the past or ever link between worlds).   Wind waker's legacy and other oddities.   The art style looks terrible on the ds. Everyone looks blocky and what used to be a really expressive link just looks blocky and terrible.  Also, the conceit of tetra being Zelda is gone and spirit tracks ruins it too with Zelda, although being mildly playable is still a 2 dimensional character.  Last in my nitpicks, none of the puzzles are good. None of the dungeons are notable. I could not tell you anything that was thematically involved in either one of those games except when I stopped in spirit tracks. Every other game I can give an overview of any dungeon, but these are so bland and unmemorable.   I leave you by saying once again, I am sorry to poop on one of your favorites, but they are sincerely not good. :( I wanted to enjoy them, but I honestly couldn't."

truezelda,2rzyeb,BillyWay,1 point,Sun Jan 11 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"The problems that I had personally with the game seem to be different than most people's, but IMO the thing that ruins the game is the weapons and when you get them. For example, you don't get the bow until the second to last dungeon, a fact the game throws in your face up to that point, then they immediately give you upgraded arrows in the dungeon following. You don't really notice the upgraded arrows difference because you barely got to use the normal ones, and they're situation specific.  Also, you're running around with a bullshit sword, literally, until right before the final boss. Right before you go back to the locomo temple for the last time, the old lady is just like, ""Hey. Take this sword that I could've given you at any point before now and would've been really helpful right before the game is over.""  Last but not least, why couldn't I just get out of the train? I'm catching rabbits and whatnot; let me just run around in the field a little. It felt so restricting and cumbersome, that it made me dislike playing."

truezelda,2rzdp0,zeldahq,13,Sat Jan 10 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Obviously this is translated from German, so the naming should be taken with a pinch of salt, but 'Feather statues' sound like minor/smaller versions of Owl statues (feather is a hyponym of owl [might not be using that word correctly]). Maybe a few are added to each major dungeon, one or two in minor dungeons (e.g. Pirate's Fortress), and a few dotted about elsewhere.  There's one comment on this page at the time of writing this:   If you’ll remember from Majora’s Mask, the owl statues are also used as warp points, so I’d imagine the owl statues will still provide that function, while the feather statues will not.   I think that's a good theory, both in terms of whether it would work in game and whether it's a mechanic Nintendo are likely to use. Save at owl and feather statues, but only warp to owl statues."
truezelda,2rzdp0,Ruairi101,9,Sat Jan 10 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"This. I'm guessing that feather statues are literally just owl statues without the warp.  This makes it easier to find a place to save/quit, with the gameplay still being in tact and mostly unchanged.  I'm also guessing temp saves at the statues still, otherwise save scumming can occur (which would wreck the game)."
truezelda,2rzdp0,Kafke,3,Sat Jan 10 23:09:27 2015 UTC,"(which would wreck the game)   I would strongly disagree with this. If anything, allowing save scumming would greatly reduce how tedious the game is and make deep exploration of a given quest line much more feasible. I know purists would hate this, but I don't see much point in forcing the player to repeat so much when they don't achieve their goal,especially when there are more substantial ways of adding difficulty to the game."
truezelda,2rzdp0,chromeless,5,Sun Jan 11 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"IMO, it adds to the stress and caution of getting it right the first time. It also makes you in a rush. Since if you could simply save scum, there's no rush and no stress on quickly hurrying somewhere, since you can simply restart if you mess up.  I wouldn't mind something like: permanent saves each time it's dawn of a new day.  But permanent saves whenever and wherever would really wreck it. Which is why the original owl statues didn't save at all (forcing song of time to save), and in the US version the owl statues only did a temp save, so no scumming could happen."
truezelda,2rzdp0,Kafke,2,Sun Jan 11 02:22:10 2015 UTC,permanent saves each time it's dawn of a new day.   This I would be very happy with.

truezelda,2rzdp0,Serbaayuu,2,Sun Jan 11 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"They were to us, back in the day when save points were a sacred part of games, but today I feel like game design has shifted towards being able to save everywhere, not having to wait 30 minutes to find a save point.  The biggest influence on this is the kind of gamers playing today- those who grew up gaming are living busy adult lives that don't allow epic 5-hour gaming sessions, while younger audiences seem to have less of an attention span for long sessions."

truezelda,2rzdp0,Serbaayuu,3,Sun Jan 11 23:28:00 2015 UTC,"I can see it basically being like the statues in Skyward Sword. ""Big"" ones on the outside for warping and saving, ""small"" ones on the inside for saving. It'd be nice if they added a ""warp to entrance"" option on the small ones too, sometimes you want out but don't want to fully warp to an owl. I'm less sure about the permanence of the various save options though, and I've never really considered the save scumming issue."

truezelda,2rzdp0,Serbaayuu,-2,Sun Jan 11 05:54:38 2015 UTC,"OoT3D had better menus but they simplified the water temple and other things.  WWHD had better menus (this is a trend), but made the Swift Sail and neutered the Triforce Quest, both of which are terrible.  MM3D looks like it'll have extra save points, which is stupid."
truezelda,2rhkyr,ZeldaTechie,6,Tue Jan 6 06:00:09 2015 UTC,My first game was wind waker so it kinda set up the idea of exploration and adventure. The idea that i can just pick a direction and go and there would most likely be somewhere to explore and stuff to find blew my young mind.
truezelda,2rhkyr,double_super,7,Tue Jan 6 07:52:38 2015 UTC,The hat.
truezelda,2rhkyr,henryuuk,3,Tue Jan 6 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"what truly makes a Zelda game, in my opinion, is their holistic design centered around the core mythos. this may sound like an unnecessarily abstract answer, but i feel that what makes them special is their overall design rather than specific elements (all of which have been done better by other games at different times).  by holistic design, i mean that Zelda games are better analyzed and appreciated as a whole, rather than by breaking apart their specific systems and critiquing them piecemeal.  by core mythos, i not only mean common entities, tropes, items, or places (for those are really only surface elements), but also common themes. i think the ""Zelda formula"" goes deeper than these, and it is in these deeper elements that more recent Zelda's have gone astray, imo. i've spent an inordinate amount of time considering what these themes are, and it's still a ""work in progress"", but what i consider so far:   ""Link as Outsider""   this theme deals with the foundation of Link's character. we never learn a whole lot about Link despite how much time we spend with him, but what we do know is that he is a child of destiny, a paragon of courage and tenacity. Link's traditional background as a loner and outsider helps to reinforce his place as a protagonist and as a unique character, and helps us as players identify with him for we, too, are outsiders to Hyrule.   ""The Fairytale of Zelda*   another core theme of the series is the simple, straightforward ""Good versus Evil"" nature of the narrative. one of the series' major successes in game design, even early on, was how seamlessly the game play integrated with the plot: rather than having a story told in between sections of game, the story was made to be simple so that it could be told using a little exposition and mostly through imagery and characterization. these simple, reliable tales of courage triumphing in the face of formidable power resonate with our inherent understanding of ""Hero"", and are able to provide a reliable vessel in which the rest of the experience can be delivered.   ""The Setting is the Story""   what exists in place of a complex narrative is the world and characters that you interact with. many players will likely identify strongly with this theme, as it evokes the desire for adventure and exploration. geographically diverse worlds populated with wide casts of strange characters give the setting (and the simple narrative it is delivered through) much needed flavor and volume. it is even better (or perhaps, crucial) that many of these characters have no specific relation to the main narrative, but are purely supplementary in order to help provide context and give the setting a life beyond the specific story being told.  overall, i would say that was really impressed me about Zelda games is how every element (theme, game play mechanic, character) feels not like it belongs but like it contributes to whole meaningfully, to the extent that removing specific aspects would make the rest of the game irreparably worse. if taken a piece at a time, there is nothing Zelda games offer that has not already been done better; it's the combination of all of these elements that makes them unique, and i find that awesome."
truezelda,2rhkyr,instantiatedObject,2,Tue Jan 6 15:59:02 2015 UTC,That was really well-said.
truezelda,2rhkyr,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Jan 7 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"Since /u/instantiatedObject took the game critic's look, I'll just have to go for the emotional one.  The music.  The terrifying juxtaposed with the colorful.  The interactions with the characters around you.  ""Link, I'm so sorry for putting you through this."" ""... :D wave!""  The Hero leaping off his loftwing into a tornado.  The Hero willingly entering the Twilight.  The Hero getting out of bed one night, and then never resting until he's killed Ganon twice, and even then going on more adventure.  The Hero saving Impa from a gang of moblins with his bare hands before he even gets a wooden sword.  Have I mentioned how badass the Hero is?  And always to help somebody else."
truezelda,2rhkyr,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Jan 7 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"Discovery and independence in an open world, onslaughts of monsters, increasing difficulty. It's the feeling that I did it with my sword and shield, my bombs and arrows, my candle flame and wits. I didn't get tips. I made my own map. I was rewarded for exploring. I learned the rules of the world and I can be victorious if I try. There are no cheats. The challenge is different every time. I have to play smart. Being able to say I messed up because it was my fault and that's fair.  When you reach the final boss, it's no longer about the final boss. It's about you. You are a survivor in a world with many variables. You're not proving to the game that you deserve the triforce. You're proving it to yourself because you survived and mastered you.  It's not the game's story. It's my story and I will end it how I want.  That is the first Zelda."
truezelda,2rhkyr,DudeWynaut,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:36:24 2015 UTC,Argorok from TP was one of the best moments in the Zelda franchise. Don't forget Koloktos. Huge epic bosses like this are what make the franchise for me.
truezelda,2rhkyr,Epicfaillord,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:16:27 2015 UTC,"After playing most the games, the things I enjoy most is the progression. It's extremely obvious in the first game. You go from struggling to move around to the first dungeon in the overworld to slaying everything with ease. It makes me feel like Link has come a long way"
truezelda,2rhkyr,keltond95,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:52:14 2015 UTC,"For me its just an innate attachment to the characters and the stories. Even games I haven't played but have read up on I can appreciate and cherish. OOT came at a crucial time in my life when my family was going through rough situations, and seeing Link, a child, standing up to these nightmarish creatures really helped me. In the back of my head I dont think about having ""played"" these games, I think about having almost lived them. Something so important to me is rooted in the series, even if I cant put my finger on it.   Besides that, I think its a well crafted (if sometimes disjointed) fantasy world that is fun to run around in and take a break from the brisk pace of life outside. I mean, who doesnt dream of open fields, lakes, mountains, and beating on skeletons until you are red in the face."
truezelda,2rhkyr,grntplmr,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"The music, the puzzles, and the general vibe of the game."
truezelda,2rhkyr,shadowdsfire,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"My favorite us skyward sword so it's almost impossible to not stay story- if a Zelda game story isn't enthralling enough I'm less likely to enjoy it as much, ex. OoT."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Phoxxent,38,Sat Jan 3 22:18:02 2015 UTC,Both.  I always felt that there should be some smaller dungeons with rewards u would want. Put heart pieces as the end instead of just hiding them.  Story temples should be long. I should need to prepare before entering one and have it take a significant amount of time.
truezelda,2r8pwp,AngryBarista,8,Sat Jan 3 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"There's a sort of ""small dungeons"" in ALttP, ALBW, TP and others."
truezelda,2r8pwp,MarianoAlipi,23,Sat Jan 3 23:44:12 2015 UTC,When I think of a small dungeon I think of the Gerudo Training grounds in OoT.
truezelda,2r8pwp,AngryBarista,7,Sun Jan 4 00:58:00 2015 UTC,Just needs a miniboss at the end though. And a tougher one than the White Wolfos in the Ice Caverns.
truezelda,2r8pwp,recursion8,1 point,Sun Jan 4 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. In that case, I agree. That was a nice dungeon."
truezelda,2r8pwp,MarianoAlipi,7,Mon Jan 5 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"ALBW had amazing mini dungeons. They were usually one screen but some of them took me ages to work out. I loved them so much, I hope they continue them"
truezelda,2r8pwp,keltond95,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they were cool. Rupees were so abundant everywhere, so the treasures were... just fine. Hehe."
truezelda,2r8pwp,MarianoAlipi,2,Mon Jan 5 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/IP73r.gif (This gif expresses how I feel.)  I agree with both. I want to be able to walk in any random direction and find stuff to do. This was my favorite thing about Skyrim. There was so much you could do in that game. There are people finding unknown stuff, years after it has been released. Wind Waker did an okay job on this. There were at least 49 islands that each had something unique, but it gave me reason to explore in the game.   I want a mixture of small and big dungeons. Small dungeons giving small prizes, but are placed randomly. Give me a reason to explore! This was my #1 problem with Skyward sword. They killed exploring because the flying felt like an advance level selector."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Sw0rDz,9,Sun Jan 4 02:39:36 2015 UTC,My god that gif is horrible.
truezelda,2r8pwp,RezicG,24,Sun Jan 4 12:39:11 2015 UTC,"I think Twilight Princess did that the best so far, the story dungeons were pretty extensive most of the time and there were a lot hidden, smaller dungeons and caves with Poes, Heart Pieces and treasure (not that anyone could use those rupees, but hey, chest jingle). Those dark, labyrinth-like caves were actually one of my absolute favorite things in TP, because I always feel like having a lot caves, grottoes and other hidden areas to explore adds a lot to a worlds. You often have those huge open worlds, but it's pretty rare for you to actually enter smaller, closed areas in a lot games (think GTA's world, it's unarguably huge, but if you think about it, where can you actually go other than places, that're outside?)   I hope Zelda Wii U will do something similar, if not the same. The dungeons were always the main aspect of Zelda games and I think if they want to go with such a big world, they have to have a lot of smaller areas to explore, because it'd be a missed opportunity to not cram the game with stuff to do besides the main storyline"
truezelda,2r8pwp,Tsurii897,2,Sat Jan 3 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"I think Twilight Princess did that the best so far, the story dungeons were pretty extensive most of the time and there were a lot hidden, smaller dungeons and caves with Poes, Heart Pieces and treasur   I agree with you that this is one of the coolest things about Zelda in general... but Twilight Princess has literally 3 side caves, depending on what you consider large enough to be a legitimate 'mini-area'.  Every 2D Zelda game blows any 3D Zelda game out of the water in this aspect, which is good to consider at the moment, because Zelda U is said to take the most inspiration from those 2D games."
truezelda,2r8pwp,malaroo,18,Mon Jan 5 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"Lots of dungeons, with the majority being short/unimportant that give little extras, like skullutulas, Heart Pieces/Containers, Bottles, Upgrades, Magic, etc.  With fewer dungeons being absolutely giant, to the point where you need the map, and actually need to prepare before entering. These would be the main story dungeons, where you obtain required equipment (which will be used for multiple dungeons), and require possibly equipment from a different dungeon, but won't let you know like LBW (damn signs wreck the fun).  So when you enter a dungeon, you aren't sure what you are getting, and it's an actual adventure. You venture forth, making sure to stay near the entrance, in case it's a large dungeon you might not be prepared for. You slowly work your way through and either reach the end, or keep going further and further.  Eventually you find some loot, and a chance to use that bow you got in the last dungeon, you solve some puzzles, and a boss monster finally appears. It chases you through the dungeon, as you quickly work your way back, seeing as you are low on health, and don't have any recovery items.  You flee the dungeon and make it out safely, but the boss still looms. You head back to town to stock up on healing items, and to formulate a plan to beat this new mysterious boss. You head off to a smaller dungeon instead, to see if you can find something useful.  You venture through the smaller cave and end up finding fire magic. Perfect! This would certainly work on the boss.  You head back to the large cave and head towards where you last saw the boss. You find it looming in a different room than before. Now you set off on your plan, using your newly acquired fire magic. Success! It's damaging the boss. Not much, but it works. A long battle ensues. Halfway through, you realize you have an opportunity to use those arrows on a certain part of the environment to finish off the boss. You take the opportunity and let one fly. The arrow releases a lodged bolder, which promptly crushes the boss.  Victory.  As a reward, a giant chest appears. You obtain the mole mitts, allowing you to dig through walls to build shortcuts through dungeons. How handy! A heart container also appears.  You begin to head back to town, slowly trekking back through the deep dungeon.    That's the type of experience  I think would be best."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Kafke,3,Sat Jan 3 23:21:23 2015 UTC,I absolutely love how this started as an opinion and then gradually became the story of an epic adventure.
truezelda,2r8pwp,shadowdsfire,3,Thu Jan 8 04:18:49 2015 UTC,I got really into what I was writing :P.
truezelda,2r8pwp,Kafke,2,Thu Jan 8 05:13:42 2015 UTC,I really felt the emotion.
truezelda,2r8pwp,shadowdsfire,4,Thu Jan 8 06:44:00 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... This is actually a difficult one...  I'm personally a like overworld stuff more than dungeons. Huge dungeons that take forever to beat sounds interesting, more dungeons means longer game. Both of them sound good actually. I just hope that if they decide to make large dungeons (which I believe they have) the design them in such a way that going through the dungeon doesn't feel tedious."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Epicfaillord,1 point,Sat Jan 3 22:30:35 2015 UTC,So like skyward sword's overworld except labeled as a dungeon.
truezelda,2r8pwp,Hyruliant,8,Sun Jan 4 19:00:29 2015 UTC,por que no los dos?
truezelda,2r8pwp,iliekgaemz,3,Sat Jan 3 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, the big dungeons start out fun but kinda turn into a forced march for me about halfway through, leaving me hoping to open the treasure chests, beat the boss, and get out so I can get on with exploring the overworld.  When the dungeons are smaller and more dynamic, I'm usually more entertained. I loved the dungeons in ALBW because they were fun to play through and I felt like they were part of the whole world of the game and not a separate thing I had to get through so I could get back to the actual world.  I guess it depends on what you get out of Zelda."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Serbaayuu,4,Sun Jan 4 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"If I had to choose one, bigger.  Gimme a set of four dungeons that take six hours each to complete.  Make them their own entire world & region.  Unf.  (Basically, Skyward Sword.)"
truezelda,2r8pwp,Knoxisawesome,2,Sun Jan 4 06:44:54 2015 UTC,"More, for sure. It leaves more room for variety. I could eventually get tired of one long dungeon, but having many means I can have a different experience once one is over."
truezelda,2r8pwp,recursion8,1 point,Sat Jan 3 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point, especially if they require lots of backtracking through the dungeon. One or two OoT Water Temples-style dungeons between a few shorter dungeons is fine, if all of them are like that then it gets tedious."
truezelda,2r8pwp,stryker101,2,Mon Jan 5 00:14:13 2015 UTC,"I care a whole lot more about quality than quantity, and those two things often clash with each other. Having a ton of dungeons isn't much fun if they're horribly repetitive, backtracking can get old real fast, and there's a big risk of making things tedious rather than fun.  If quality is a guarantee, then I'd say having more is preferable to them being huge. They can do a lot with small dungeons- the Gerudo Training Grounds and the Well were both excellent parts of OoT. I definitely hope they keep having something along the lines of the Cave of Ordeals as well. Heck even the cave in TP with the ice blocks was a lot of fun, though it could hardly be considered a dungeon."
truezelda,2r8pwp,double_super,1 point,Sun Jan 4 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter to me as long as they are really good, quality over quantity"
truezelda,2r8pwp,torro947,1 point,Sun Jan 4 12:41:51 2015 UTC,I would choose both. I would like the main dungeons to be bigger and have mini dungeons scattered about. With Zelda going open world I think this would work out wonderfully.
truezelda,2r8pwp,Trials_and_3rrors,1 point,Sun Jan 4 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer more story dungeons (not caves) that are smaller in size, I don't like spending 4 hours in a dungeon (1-2 at most)."
truezelda,2r8pwp,grntplmr,1 point,Sun Jan 4 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"Regardless of number or size I think a nice change would be avoiding the trope of having the key dungeon item attainable within the dungeon. Basically lean less on linearity and the implementation of items to solve puzzles and beat the boss. But at the same time reward the player for entering dungeons out of order to collect items that may make other dungeons less challenging. I've been playing through ALTTP this way and it is a lot of fun being able to get partially through each dungeon without certain items as a requirement, and beating them out of order."
truezelda,2r8pwp,tcrpgfan,1 point,Mon Jan 5 01:35:15 2015 UTC,Like in ALBW? Where traditional dungeon items are rented instead of found?
truezelda,2r8pwp,grntplmr,1 point,Tue Jan 6 10:05:46 2015 UTC,"yeah but maybe without the rental items. I can almost picture being able to buy certain items from a store for lots of cash, or being able to find them out in the wild in smaller ""item dungeons"". I mean its not like there's only one bow in the whole kingdom right? Being able to buy bombs from the get go would let you get yourself into certain areas earlier than you ""should"" but you still will hit road blocks when you don't have hookshot/bow/etc. which makes you want to find those items to go deeper."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Tue Jan 6 10:22:17 2015 UTC,"If they did that, unfortunately they would have to add some kind of feature where a Navi/Fi character says ""Hey, you don't have the item necessary to do this thing!  Better leave!  HINT HINT!"" whenever you come across something that's impossible.  Otherwise people might get stumped on a simple puzzle and think they don't have the right items for it, and end up exploring the entire world aimlessly until they eventually just give up."
truezelda,2r8pwp,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:42:43 2015 UTC,I'd rather have more dungeons than larger ones. I always enjoy overworld stuff more than doing dungeons. If a dungeon were too long or too difficult I'd have a tendency to get bored. Doing multiple dungeons back to back with different themes and new items keeps me interested. That's probably just a result of my personality though.
truezelda,2r8pwp,heymrk,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"Why not both?  I mean, some of the best dungeons in zelda have been the big ones where you have to alter the structure of the temple to progress or do some other tricky thing.  However, if we look at MM then it had four really good dungeons. Decent length, decent difficulty, but that's it...only four. Imagine if there had been eight? The four major dungeons and four sub dungeons (thinking like SW/SE/NW/NE). Those four sub dungeons could contain upgrades, new items or even be required to progress e.g.  You start in the west at woodfall and your next dungeon is in the north at snowhead. What if to get the item you need to progress you have to do the dungeon at the north west.  And yes I realise that woodfall is south and snowhead is north. I was just using this as an example.   If I had to pick one i'd be inclined for more dungeons. That way I get a greater variety of challenges rather than one big challenge."
truezelda,2r8pwp,raevpet,1 point,Tue Jan 6 11:11:42 2015 UTC,"Technically there were 8 dungeons in MM.  Exactly like you describe.  There were the Four Main ones, the Two Skulltula Dungeons, Pirate's Fortress, and Ikana Castle.  Thieve's Hideout kind of counts as a mini-dungeon too."
truezelda,2r8pwp,heymrk,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:47:56 2015 UTC,I suppose you are right in a way. Though i'm not sure i'd count the skulltula ones. They are more optional side quests rather than things you need to do to proceed.     Still it would be interesting in games to have them encorporate 'power up' dungeons e.g. you have the fire arrows but feel they aren't doing enough damage. You complete the 'dungeon of the sacred flame' and get super fire arrows
truezelda,2r8pwp,raevpet,-2,Wed Jan 14 08:52:48 2015 UTC,"Neither. A single, continuous dungeon. Like God of War."
truezelda,2r8pwp,heymrk,2,Sun Jan 4 02:52:18 2015 UTC,So you want a linear Zelda game? I think you're pretty alone with that one.
truezelda,2r8pwp,raevpet,0,Sun Jan 4 21:02:03 2015 UTC,You mean like every Zelda game except for the original?
truezelda,2r8pwp,heymrk,1 point,Sun Jan 4 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call them linear. They all (well mostly) have overworlds that you can explore freely. Sure it's more linear than Skyrim, but it's a lot less linear than God of War."
truezelda,2r8pwp,raevpet,1 point,Mon Jan 5 05:57:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know what linear means. You could have a world map a billion times bigger than all of  Tamriel and still be linear.  It has to do with goals and the way plot is presented. If you have one objective next up, then no matter what you do in the meantime,  you're on a crash course with said objective. You can kill all the tekkites or collect all the heart pieces you want, but you still have to do the Water Temple next. That is linearity."
truezelda,2r43ec,xeynx,15,Fri Jan 2 16:57:07 2015 UTC,I think Yuga is supposed to be the lorule version of Agahnim from ALttP
truezelda,2r43ec,MexicanGuyHere,5,Fri Jan 2 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"It's really unclear whether Agahnim was actually a person or not.  He is called ""Ganons alter ego"" so he might not even have been real."
truezelda,2r43ec,Serbaayuu,2,Fri Jan 2 23:45:26 2015 UTC,I just wished the concept art matched the damn game sprite!
truezelda,2r43ec,Fox436,11,Fri Jan 9 04:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think Yuga may have been Impa's counterpart, actually.  He acted as an advisor to Hilda.  There really aren't a lot of exact pairings in Lorule, though.  As far as we can tell, the Sages don't have counterparts, most regular villagers don't have counterparts - there's maybe 10 or so people in Lorule who match somebody in Hyrule.  So it's not outright required that Yuga does."
truezelda,2r43ec,Serbaayuu,4,Fri Jan 2 17:13:57 2015 UTC,That's probably cause Lorule is in ruins though.
truezelda,2r43ec,henryuuk,3,Fri Jan 2 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"I found Ravio's and Hilda's opposite personalities very obvious, but I never thought about Yuga being the opposite of Ganon. Good thinking.  Just, how would Yuga's obsession with perfect beauty come into play? I never really saw anything about him being weak, but he rambles on about beauty."
truezelda,2r43ec,BarlesCzarkley,3,Fri Jan 2 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"Ganon doesn't give a crap about beauty or aesthetics, he just wants to rule and destroy everything"
truezelda,2r43ec,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri Jan 2 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"okay, and Link doesn't care about cooking, only eating, but Ravio isn't a chef."
truezelda,2r43ec,BarlesCzarkley,2,Sat Jan 3 22:20:17 2015 UTC,I don't know man I'm sorry ;-;
truezelda,2r43ec,Ontopoly,5,Sat Jan 3 22:24:41 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they're like that because Lorule doesn't have their triforce. Link lacks courage because there is no courage triforce.
truezelda,2r43ec,Serbaayuu,7,Sat Jan 3 01:44:34 2015 UTC,"The Hero isn't courageous because he has the Triforce of Courage.  He gets the Triforce of Courage because he is courageous.  Link has never started a game holding the Triforce of Courage, and he has earned all 3 of them a few times.  In Zelda 1, he built the Triforce of Wisdom.  And the Triforce doesn't imbue the world with its elements.  People could still be courageous in a world without the Triforce."
truezelda,2r43ec,CaptianZaco,6,Sat Jan 3 03:56:23 2015 UTC,Link has never started a game holding the Triforce of Courage   Doesn't he in Twilight Princess? but it never really comes into play so it's not important in that one.
truezelda,2r43ec,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sat Jan 3 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm unaware of some clarification somewhere, that is debatable and it's never actually specified in the game."
truezelda,2r43ec,tcrpgfan,3,Sat Jan 3 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's the thing that prevents link from turning into another spirit inn the twilight realm, so yeah it does have a role in TP. It's just never mentioned by name."
truezelda,2r43ec,CaptianZaco,2,Sat Jan 3 12:18:50 2015 UTC,"never actually specified in the game.   agreed. I just thought I saw it a few times, or maybe I read something about it. I haven't played that game in ages."
truezelda,2r43ec,tcrpgfan,6,Sat Jan 3 04:41:06 2015 UTC,"Again, the Triforce of courage is what prevents Link from being turned into another spirit. Now how the Triforce split up in this timeline is a whole other confusing mess. But it can be proven that it was split up in the flashback scene involving the sages and Ganondorf. So yeah, Link does have the Triforce of Courage in this game, it's just never mentioned by name."
truezelda,2r43ec,CaptianZaco,2,Sat Jan 3 12:23:24 2015 UTC,riiight. That's why I was thinking he had it- it IS important. :P
truezelda,2r43ec,tcrpgfan,3,Sat Jan 3 12:28:39 2015 UTC,It's one of my two 'play at least once yearly' games. Missing out on a detail like that would make me feel really stupid.
truezelda,2r43ec,avola-productions,2,Sat Jan 3 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think he just has it tatooed? It's visible, although I don't think it ever really comes into play. I always just assumed TP was born with it."
truezelda,2r43ec,tcrpgfan,3,Sat Jan 3 05:38:35 2015 UTC,"Again, the Triforce of courage is what prevents Link from being turned into another spirit. Now how the Triforce split up in this timeline is a whole other confusing mess. But it can be proven that it was split up in the flashback scene involving the sages and Ganondorf. So yeah, Link does have the Triforce of Courage in this game, it's just never mentioned by name."
truezelda,2r43ec,Epicfaillord,-3,Sat Jan 3 12:23:43 2015 UTC,"In OoT he has the triforce from birth, just nobody notices until ganondorf wants it."
truezelda,2r43ec,Serbaayuu,2,Sat Jan 3 05:44:41 2015 UTC,"No.  The core of the plot of Ocarina of Time is that Ganondorf causes the Triforce to split when he reaches it after the first act of Ocarina of Time.  Link only receives the Triforce of Courage after the childhood segment, and only because Ganondorf split the thing."
truezelda,2r43ec,tcrpgfan,3,Sat Jan 3 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"No... just no. In TP he had it from birth, in OoT the triforce was still in the sacred realm in it's completed form until ganondorf showed his pukish looking face."
truezelda,2r43ec,MILANOVIC,0,Sat Jan 3 12:25:33 2015 UTC,Wow. Weird. Me and my friend were literally talking about this 2 days ago.
truezelda,2r37zr,double_super,46,Fri Jan 2 09:53:46 2015 UTC,"Fi tends to tell you to solution to problems (often by the time you already solved them)    The game constantly reminds you of what the ""loot"" is you pick up, even if you already have 40+ of it.    Very Linear World doesn't feel connected Nothing to do in the ""skyworld"" except on the main island.    .  Those tend to be the common complaints.    One thing I disliked personally is that your Loftwing is apparently this very personal companion, one you have spend your life with and who is in-tuned with you on a deep emotional and personal level. But honestly it didn't feel like that, probably cause you were only able to even use your loftwing for very short moments within the game. I think they could have really made the loftwing feel like a companion if they tried, as opposed to felling like a transportation vehicle like it did now."
truezelda,2r37zr,henryuuk,14,Fri Jan 2 10:11:07 2015 UTC,"I can see the first points. The Loftwing point is interesting though, i never really put much thought into them and now that i think about it there should have been more story about them."
truezelda,2r37zr,henryuuk,13,Fri Jan 2 10:16:27 2015 UTC,"It's especially a shame if you consider the SS manga and the lore behind them. the loftwings were important enough (especially Link's red one) to become a staple on the hylian shield for GENERATIONS UPON GENERATIONS later.    FYI : I really liked the game, and several of the issues I noted in my comment are the ""common"" issues people have, not the ones I had."
truezelda,2r37zr,xeynx,3,Fri Jan 2 10:27:01 2015 UTC,This is the thing. If you really enjoyed a game don't let other people's opinions influence your own.  Personally I didn't enjoy the tutorial aspect of the game although Fi herself didn't bug me.  I don't care that they started adding the Sheikah Stones in the games and I avoid those like the plague.
truezelda,2r37zr,henryuuk,4,Fri Jan 2 18:25:57 2015 UTC,I think the sheikah stones are a great way of adding in help for less experienced players without it being in the way of experienced players.
truezelda,2r37zr,Fox436,0,Fri Jan 2 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"You should never add in an easier method to solve things in Zelda titles. Ocarina of Time has plenty of hints going on with Navi, Saria and Sheik giving you clues every 5 minutes."
truezelda,2r37zr,henryuuk,5,Sun Jan 4 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"Except they only give you 1 clue for every predicament. If you didn't understand it, or got stuck, etc... You would have to look online how to solve it.    The Sheikah stones do not make solving anything easier. they give you a hint, but you have to go all the way back to the stone to use them, and even then you still need to actually DO the thing. They are just a more fun in-game alternative to being forced to use online guides.    It's easy for people that can beat any game to say : ""Lol, people should just 'git gud' if they want to complete the game"" but that doesn't change that it makes the game less fun for those people. Adding the sheikah stone does not detract from yuor game in any way, shape or form."

Even for all my complaints, I still beat the game and still wanted to see the end. It's a well made but flawed game, and the desert is really one of the best areas in a Zelda game."
truezelda,2r37zr,Fullbody,4,Fri Jan 2 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"I, too, would like to encourage the OP to watch Matthewmatosis' video. He puts a lot of thought and hard work into his videos."

truezelda,2r37zr,saintjimmy64,3,Fri Jan 2 21:41:08 2015 UTC,Finally watched this. Fantastic review. I've debated Skyward Sword more than anything else on Reddit and it's nice to finally hear a well thought out and thorough review.
truezelda,2r37zr,The_First_Mimzy,9,Tue Jan 6 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it, but it is probably my least favorite 3d zelda. My main complaints were that the world felt very sterile (it only had one populated town and the sky was pretty empty) and the exploration was limited and linear progression was given priority. It felt like a step backward from Twilight Princess to me, given how real and alive Hyrule felt in that game. That being said, the timeshift stone elements of SS were IMO one of the coolest ideas in any zelda game."
truezelda,2r37zr,avola-productions,3,Fri Jan 2 18:35:45 2015 UTC,I LOVED the timeshift stones!!
truezelda,2r37zr,NUMBERS2357,2,Sat Jan 3 05:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sterile is a good word for it.  i remember feeling like the Hyrule of Ocarina of Time especially had all sorts of weird little things going on.  Like the back alley in the market town, the dogs running around, that couple that is in the market late at night, that weird room with the pots, that guy in the desert selling bombchus that's the only place with a non-exhausting supply of them, the marathon guy, some random weird rooms in the lost woods...it all hints at a world with a lot more going on than whatever Link happens to be doing at this moment.  It made Hyrule feel worth saving.  OTOH, the Hyurle of SS, it seemed like it only existed for the purpose of having a quest for Link to fulfill.  I remember thinking, who cares if bad shit happens to the surface?  To save the Kikwis?  They told you in some of the plot-exposition-dialogue that bad things would happen, but it's not the same to me."
truezelda,2r37zr,darkplumb90,17,Sat Jan 3 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"My personal complaints:  -Fuck everything about hours-long tutorials, and fuck everything about Fi  -The Imprisoned is the worst boss battle I've ever had to stomach through in nearly any video game I've ever played. And you revisit it twice. What the fuck.  -Motion controls constantly failed on me, including the motionplus addon constantly uncalibrating and even somehow ""disconnecting"" despite it always being fully plugged in.  -I found the story to be just weak. I know this is a controversial point, but for an origin story to the entire series, this was incredibly disappointing and sours quite a few things in my opinion.  -A completely barren hub world, no true connected overworld, and only 3 areas to visit (backtracking, ugh). Unacceptable for a Zelda game.  -Music was....strangely forgettable, despite being orchestrated. Can't remember a single track aside from the main sky theme.  Matthewmattosis's review basically mirrors my remaining complaints: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qAjK7wd5QE"
truezelda,2r37zr,xeynx,2,Fri Jan 2 18:17:44 2015 UTC,I used a motionplus remote (the gold one that came packaged) and that worked fine.  The addons I have for my other wiimotes started to fail recently so I know what you mean there.
truezelda,2r37zr,DangTaylor,4,Fri Jan 2 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that Nintendo always creates the game first, then tries to write the story around it. That's likely the main reason for the plot holes.  I enjoyed the game, but I still agree with all of your points. It could have been SO much better.  One thing I did appreciate was that they made a LITTLE bit more of an effort with cutscenes and storytelling than they usually do. The relationship between Link and Zelda was better than it has ever been, but the rest of the story (particularly regarding the villain) fell short.   I still think the trepidation over making Link a fully voiced character with a fleshed out personality is more cowardly and lazy than anything else. The argument about Link being ""an avatar for the player"" is just kind of a weak excuse if you ask me. If you are going to put so much effort into building a world with a detailed story, you have to grow out of this silent protagonist shit. It's a pointless continuation of design principles that only existed in the first place due to hardware restrictions (restrictions which no longer exist.) If everyone else in Hyrule can talk, Link can talk. Countless other games have shown that having a talking protagonist feels perfectly normal. The longer they wait to make Link speak, the weirder it's going to get down the line.  My advice for the next game? Just fucking do it. Put some effort in, get some good writers and voice actors involved, and make it a story that's epic enough to be a part of the franchise. Then include an option to turn all the voice-acting off for the purists. Everyone wins."
truezelda,2r37zr,darkplumb90,6,Fri Jan 2 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that Nintendo always creates the game first, then tries to write the story around it. That's likely the main reason for the plot holes.   This is one of my biggest frustrations with Nintendo as well. They clearly want to tell a story, yet put almost no effort into making one that makes any sense."
truezelda,2r37zr,Epicfaillord,1 point,Fri Jan 2 22:42:31 2015 UTC,They focus on gameplay for the most part.
truezelda,2r37zr,avola-productions,3,Wed Jan 7 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think the up and coming generation of devs is more into story, which I hope create improvements on that front in the future. In general, most Zelda games have always gave me the impression that some of the creators really care about story. I really don't think I'm imagining the subtext I see in a lot of places.  I'm personally never going to be comfortable with voice acting in a Zelda game going any farther than Midna's garble or the ""oi"" or ""sank you."" However , I respect that opinion and know many people agree with you very passionately."
truezelda,2r37zr,recursion8,3,Sat Jan 3 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, Nintendo has always been about gameplay > story (or graphics for those Sony/MS fanboys). Maybe it's a symptom of them being around since the 8bit days when you can only cram so much data on a little cartridge. If you want story go play the Elder Scrolls series or something."
truezelda,2r37zr,tcrpgfan,1 point,Mon Jan 5 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"Story is Metal Gear's department, Elder Scrolls is more about gameplay."
truezelda,2r37zr,tcrpgfan,1 point,Tue Jan 6 10:22:17 2015 UTC,"Here's the question, though. Who do you get to voice such long-standing characters? Will they sound like how you imagined them to sound like when you first played a Zelda game? Even if you decide to recast with almost every new entry you run the risk of having a newer cast being worse than an older one. Then there's also the risk that comes with giving Link (Second only to mario in terms of iconic silent video game protagonists) a voice. Is it too cheesy? Too talky? Too quiet? Seriously, when you think about why they don't include voice acting in zelda titles it becomes obvious that the  familiar text bubbles are a far safer option than the massive fan wars and potential for long time fans to leave the franchise altogether is just not worth shelling out money for voice actors."
truezelda,2r37zr,IaiLwM,10,Tue Jan 6 10:19:26 2015 UTC,"Here's a few comments I have saved outlining the good/bad, which I do agree with quite a lot of: 1, 2, 3  To share my opinion, which I know is probably a rather rare one:  I'm not a particularly big fan of Skyward Sword - I didn't hate it, but it's my least favourite of the 3D home console Zeldas. I think the major issue was that it just kind of failed to draw me in at all - I don't know why, I'm guessing there were a lot of contributing factors including some of the complaints linked above, but I really couldn't get into the game. I also seemingly have a natural disdain for motion controls, and a medical reason for being slightly annoyed with having to use them, so I suspect that also contributed.  There were several elements of the game that I really quite liked, but overall my reaction was ""eh.."". The closest I came to feeling involved was at Lanayru Mining Facility, where I went ""oh, so this is what people meant when they said it doesn't get good until a few dungeons in"" - but unfortunately, I then went back to my relatively impassive feelings for the rest of the game.  I can see why people like it so much, and I understand why, but unfortunately for me personally SS wasn't much of an experience compared to the other 3D home console Zeldas. I really wanted to like it, but I just... didn't. I kind of want to retry it to see if I end up liking it more, but I don't really have much desire to replay it, which is rather unfortunate."
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,6,Fri Jan 2 10:27:23 2015 UTC,"I just started this game the other day, and I'm still pretty much at the beginning of the game (just went down to the surface for the first time), but I'm already sucked in.  Can't wait to play some more and see how I feel later down the road."
truezelda,2r37zr,Sw0rDz,4,Fri Jan 2 13:57:06 2015 UTC,The lack of exploration drove me crazy! The flying felt like a enhanced level selector. There were barely any floating islands. I like to explore the land with stuff to see and things to do.
truezelda,2r37zr,Octro,17,Fri Jan 2 22:35:35 2015 UTC,The imprisoned was a retarded monster design and it made you fight him three fucking times.  That alone bothered me the most.  Having to repetitively fight the same retarded monster three times in the same place with similar methods was an all time low.  It didn't even seem important to the story.  You could have fought him once and he broke the seal at the end.    The sky world was a huge disappointment too.   That was supposed to be their entire world and it seemed more like an afterthought.
truezelda,2r37zr,liquidDinner,21,Fri Jan 2 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"The Imprisoned was a huge wasted opportunity. The game did a lot to talk about the dangers of the monster, but it never actually showed us.  You know what was great about OoT? We got to see firsthand how bad the world is under the bad guy's control. The Imprisoned could have escaped at one point, and Link finally fights him in the forest, but only after The Imprisoned obliterated a huge section of the map. Cause permanent damage to an area or character we're familiar with and we can understand the damage posed by the threat.  This leads to my problem with Demise. The puppet master nature of the final two boss battles takes away from how serious Demise really is. Again, we only hear about how dangerous he is. In the very end he finally shows up, invites Link to fight in his magical world, and that's the end of it. We gained more depth from the puppet than from the master. This is just like in TP, but with Ganondorf as the boss he didn't require as much of a build-up. Demise is brand new, he doesn't have history with the franchise preceding him. He was just a big mean dude with a sword."
truezelda,2r37zr,henryuuk,5,Fri Jan 2 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"TBH, Demise was never meant to be more then the origin of Ganondorf's reincarnation, and the reason they are in an eternal cycle. Ghirahim was the villain for all intent and purposes."
truezelda,2r37zr,JFM2796,3,Fri Jan 2 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"Similarly the other main Zelda games do anywhere from an existent to a pretty good job of showing us why the villains are a threat:   ALttP we see Ganon's corruption of the Sacred Realm, the brainwashing of the Knights of Hyrule MM Don't think I need to elaborate much on this one, we get a cutscene of the apocalypse when time runs out, the deaths of Deku Butler's Son, Darmani, and Mikau, and all the other NPC's problems WW Ganondorf rule made the world so corrupted that the freakin Gods gave up on it and decided to flood the world. Game could have done a little better with how his return effects the Great Sea, but oh well TP Probably the weakest one other than SS, but at least we see the Twili army storming Zelda's throne room, even if the civilians were oblivious to everything. The desolation of Kakariko with the kids hiding in the sanctuary showed the threat the shroud of Twilight posed to the land. SS Not much at all really. The game banks really hard on you caring about Zelda in the intro, because that is all Demise's forces do the entire game is go after her, while the residents of SKyloft sit pretty much safe"
truezelda,2r37zr,Epicfaillord,2,Sun Jan 4 17:41:28 2015 UTC,At the end demise tells you flat out that when you die to him he will murder your entire family. And every other living thing in skyloft.
truezelda,2r37zr,JFM2796,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"I forgot about that, but the last ten minutes of the game seem a little late to be giving us our motivation. Better late than never I guess."
truezelda,2r37zr,Epicfaillord,2,Wed Jan 7 12:14:54 2015 UTC,"So did the intro and repeated warnings from impa, Zelda, and even ghirahim about the exact same thing go over your head? You must be missing something here, because the game tells you every other minute HEY HURRY UP BECAUSE DEMISE WILL LIEK MURDER EVERYONE BUT ALSO ZELDA."
truezelda,2r37zr,avola-productions,3,Wed Jan 7 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"Right?? That:s definitely a huge part of OoT's greatness. Even after seeing what Bongo Bongo in all his goofiness, he remains 1000% more intimidating than the Imprisoned (that's not really accurate for me as Imprisoned has 0 intimidation in my book, but I like the sound of it). That scene in Kakariko is probably my favorite part of any Zelda game, even compared to all the emotions of the Anju/Kafei side quest. In OoT Ganondorf kills, utterly destroys happy locations, and all the threats he make seem totally legitimate."
truezelda,2r37zr,gamerpenguin,4,Sat Jan 3 05:09:05 2015 UTC,"One complaint I've hear is that the swordfighting is too obvious, like your opponent is holding his weapon diagonally? Slash diagonally.  I think it can be an improvement over just slashing however you want until they run out of health, but I'm not very far into the game, and it might get better or worse later on!"
truezelda,2r37zr,avola-productions,4,Fri Jan 2 10:21:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even if the motion controls had worked well for me, the fighting was very forced over time. How many times do we have to do lame fights with Bobokins?"
truezelda,2r37zr,JoseyGunner,4,Sat Jan 3 05:12:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree with many of the complaints in this thread, it truly made me feel like a kid for a while. A new colorful world to ""explore"" with lots of history about Hyrule.   My main complaint is that it hurts my wrist to play. Honestly, after about 20 minutes my wrist is sore and aching because it relies too heavily on the motion controls.  I don't have wrist issues any other time but playing Skyward sword really bothers it.   In short, Skyward Sword is fun the first time around. After that, Fi, the treasures, and the motion controls drive you crazy."
truezelda,2r37zr,eats7,2,Fri Jan 2 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing about Zelda, a new game come's out, and you expect a new world to explore, and it's fun when you're doing it. I totally agree with you about feeling like a kid again and playing it my first time around. I had the same feellings for SS. But, it's been almost two years now since i've beaten it, and i find it all too easy to agree with most people here in the comments... Although it was an  enjoyable experience while playing it, it doesn't seem to live up the other games, or what we expect from Zelda games.   Tl;Dr While a Great fun game; Doesn't hold up to other game's in the series as a game that creates unforgettable memories of a new world to experience."
truezelda,2r37zr,cronos844,2,Sat Jan 3 10:41:45 2015 UTC,Too many damn cut scenes.
truezelda,2r37zr,squeezyphresh,2,Tue Jan 6 08:43:54 2015 UTC,What I really disliked about the game wasn't even the game itself. It was burning through batteries like there's no tomorrow.
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,5,Tue Jan 13 07:15:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like most complaints aren't very well grounded from an objective standpoint. Other than some motion control issues (which I never had), the game played well and was very fun. I couldn't put it down. Most complaints are mostly subjective and lore related. Although I like the lore and story parts if Zelda, it's not why I play the game, so to me, its just as good as any other Zelda."
truezelda,2r37zr,buriedinthenude,2,Fri Jan 2 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not done with the game yet, but I can say thus far, the controls really aren't that bad.  I haven't actually had to recalibrate during gameplay at all.  Re-center?  Sure., but that's easy enough."
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,2,Mon Jan 5 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"The game is so fucking linear in the laziest way possible. The whole sky is even worse than WW's ocean, so pathetic. So yes there are like 4 areas, what a boring simple universe. Bland characters as well."
truezelda,2r37zr,saintjimmy64,2,Fri Jan 2 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"This is a common complaint I've come across, but I personally don't see it this way.    Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, and even Wind Waker used 'the world' as a hub, with a bunch of areas that were actually segregated from 'the world'... the only difference is that with each game moving forward, they were able to effectively mask the whole 'Hyrule as a hub' thing.  In OoT and TP, they used land.  In WW, they used water... but it's still the same basic principle.    I don't think Skyward Sword actually does anything different... it's just this time, the hub mechanic is you flying around in the sky.  Does this make everything feel more segregated than in previous Zeldas?  Yes, it does, but at the same time I feel a lot of hyperbole has been spun about this sky/portal mechanic in regards to this game.  It's not the best thing ever, nor is it the worst... or even different from the norm, for that matter."
truezelda,2r37zr,Epicfaillord,3,Mon Jan 5 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"The difference is that instead of a world that feels connected, alive, and explorable you're basically getting a tedious level select screen."
truezelda,2r37zr,Petrichor03,0,Tue Jan 6 02:23:25 2015 UTC,bland characters   Troll confirmed.
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the game overall, but I do have my fair share of complaints. My biggest complaint is all the plot holes and failed continuity retcons/lore discrepancies. Next is the game's lack of exploration and everything that comes with that. Then, it's the game's pacing issues (I nearly decided to take an extended break from the game when I was between the third and fourth dungeons; there were just too many precursor quests back-to-back before the game would let you progress). Then it's Fi's character (i.e., providing lots of monotone, useless information while trying to hold my hand). Then it's the lack of new items. Then it's the swimming and flying controls. And finally it's the lack of memorable music and new characters.  But I really loved the sword controls and the item upgrade system. I liked Ghirahim, Skyloft, and most of the dungeons. The game was just really inconsistent overall."
truezelda,2r37zr,Petrichor03,2,Fri Jan 2 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the entire franchise is loaded with plot holes, failed cotinuities, retcons, discrepancies, etc.  This isn't exclusive to Skyward Sword by any stretch of the imagination."

truezelda,2r37zr,jellystones,3,Mon Jan 12 23:13:27 2015 UTC,"OoA is the easiest one to explain. In OoA, we're shown that traveling to the past and changing the events of the past directly influences/changes the present. It operates on ""Back to the Future"" time travel logic. But at one point in the game you receive the Goron Vase from a Goron who says it has been in his family for generations. In order to beat the game, you have to take the vase back in time and give it to his ancestor in the past, thus fulfilling a stable loop, which is a completely different type of time travel. It's a plot hole for the game to feature two different types of time travel, especially since the main one says that time traveling erases the past/present rather than fulfilling it.  As for SS... the list is a little bit longer. There are several plot holes if we assume certain things (for example, if we assume that the SS Master Sword is the same blade as the OoT/TP/TWW Master Sword, then that gives us a plot hole), but those are able to be explained away (following the Master Sword example, if we just say that the SS Master Sword isn't the same sword, the plot hole goes away, and this one in particular works because PH implies that there have been multiple Phantom Swords and OoA shows the Master Sword being recovered from a broken state 400 years in the past and being repaired, which doesn't fit with ALttP's Master Sword, which all seems to follow the idea that there could have been more than one Master Sword throughout history). So these plot holes are just the ones that can't be explained away.  The big one is a major part of the game's story. We're told that Hylia made herself human because she wanted to wish on the Triforce, and she couldn't do that as a goddess. But as soon as she becomes a human and recovers her memories, she decides she's not going to use the Triforce after all, she's just going to have Link do it, thus negating the very reason she gave up her divinity in the first place. Whoever wrote the game's story just completely ignores this lack of logic in the narrative's progression.  The other big one comes towards the end of the game. After Link wishes on the Triforce for Demise to be destroyed, the statue of the goddess and the Triforce descend from the sky and reunite with the surface. Everyone for miles around can see this, and it even draws Ghirahim to the Sealed Grounds. But rather than even attempting to steal the Triforce and just wishing Demise back to life, Ghirahim ignores the unguarded Triforce and hatches an overly-complicated plan which involves kidnapping Zelda right in front of the guy who has beaten him twice already, taking her back in time, and then trying to change time even though time travel in SS is incapable of changing time. Maybe we can say that Ghirahim didn't realize that time travel in SS can't change time, but that still doesn't explain why he didn't even try to steal or use the Triforce, why he chose to kidnap Zelda at the absolute worst time possible, or why he didn't destroy the Gate of Time when he got to the past so that Link couldn't follow him.  I mean, I guess we can technically explain away these two plot holes with ""Hylia and Ghirahim are stupid"", but that seems like a very poor way to explain away these plot holes. I'd rather just call them plot holes than insinuate that those two characters are stupid well beyond what intelligence their characters have displayed throughout the game up to that point. It just wouldn't make sense for the two characters to be that stupid. That explanation would pretty much be a plot hole in itself since the characters don't support that explanation anywhere else in the game."
truezelda,2r37zr,Serbaayuu,3,Tue Jan 13 15:20:43 2015 UTC,I'm not done the game yet (currently looking for second sacred flame) but so far the game has been fantastic. I checked wikipedia and was surprised how many publications gave this game a 10/10. From the circle jerk here on reddit I was lead to believe everyone else hated it too.
truezelda,2r37zr,GoldBananas,1 point,Fri Jan 2 16:27:47 2015 UTC,Eh.  Objectively?  Skyward Sword is my favorite in the series.  Don't fall into that circlejerk of hating on it if you don't have to.
truezelda,2r37zr,Serbaayuu,3,Fri Jan 2 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. Almost every complaint is exactly the same, complaining about linearity, or Fi, or the treasures or something, ignoring that past Zelda games were very linear, had annoying, interrupting companions and even TP had the recurring text boxes with the rupees. Ugh, just had to get that out of my system."
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,7,Sun Jan 4 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"Also, anybody who complains about the lack of an ""exploratory open world"" is missing two things:   Miyamoto said very early that Skyward Sword was basically going to have an overworld that was like dungeons, and it succeeded there The open world Hyrule Fields have generally been extremely boring and empty."
truezelda,2r37zr,GoldBananas,5,Sun Jan 4 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"This... oh my lord, THIS.  The other games have been mostly empty.  The 'world' was always essentially a hub with portals into the dungeon area... Skyward Sword really isn't any different in this regard."

truezelda,2r37zr,grntplmr,2,Sun Jan 4 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people thought SS had a good story.  It had a long story in the sense of a lot of things happening, and there was a lot of plot exposition in cut scenes and such.  But to me there oughta be more than that.  The whole game felt like everything was contrived just to have a quest for you to do.    Taking Ocarina of Time, I don't remember everything they tell you when you first get the Master Sword, but I remember leaving the Temple of Time and seeing the destroyed Market, and being like, oh shit.  The adult part of the game, my motivation wasn't even advancing the story, it was just fixing all the stuff that got fucked up.  To me that's more of a story than Skyward Sword, which is a lot of ""the Goddess preordained that after doing X, you now must do Y, go do Y.""  There's all this plot stuff that happens, but mostly doesn't seem to affect the rest of the world."
truezelda,2r37zr,Logic_Nuke,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hated the skydiving ""fast travel"" mechanics. It broke the flow of gameplay for me so much when I would be diving through the clouds and then be immediately met with a map to choose where I wanted to land. I can't think of a perfect alternative, but maybe giving each sub area its own smaller cloud beam so you could go directly to those areas. If Fi is going to be my fast travel option then at least make it streamlined and give me the map straight from Skyloft, otherwise the Loftwing just seems like a shuttle to the portals.   My biggest issue is that I too felt the magic that they put into this world. It has some of my least favorite gameplay but some of my favorite characterization and atmosphere. I love Link and Zelda maybe the most out of the whole series in SS, but sometimes I feel like these characters I cherish are stuck inside a game I dislike re-playing because of the motion controls and overworld. If Zelda wii U is a direct sequel with these characters I would be pretty happy to get to revisit them."
truezelda,2r37zr,ArtistCook,1 point,Sun Jan 4 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"The motion controls don't work well enough to justify making them the only way to control the game. Fi was annoying. The helper should be somewhat helpful when asked for, and generally unobtrusive otherwise. The Imprisoned was dumb. Particularly fighting him three times. I don't like the four parts where you have to run around and evade the phantom guard things (forget actual name for them). The first time it was fine, but I would have preferred a mix. First one is the same, because it requires courage, another is a fighting section because it requires power, the last is puzzles because it requires wisdom. The last one could be a mix of the three. Making them all the same felt like a waste. The Skyworld has the opposite problem from Wind Waker's ocean. Where the ocean allowed for some exploration, but annoyingly long travel times as a result, the sky is too small, making exploration not really worthwhile. Generally too easy. But this has been sort of an issue for a while."
truezelda,2r37zr,pivotguyDC1,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:04:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest complaint is how much Fi talks.  I personally didn't mind her that much when I first played it and didn't know what everyone was talking about.  But in subsequent playthroughs I started to understand a lot more.  If you ever do a hero mode playthrough, you will wish you could turn Fi off."

Especially coming from TP on GCN, which had the most fleshed out combat system in a Zelda game to date and a good variety of enemy types, it was really disappointing to me. While the art direction for the different areas was really good, the enemies and characters in them were pretty underwhelming."
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,1 point,Fri Jan 2 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint was the amount of required fetchquests there were. Yeah I get it, fetchquests are a staple of the series but I don't think they've ever been so blatant before. It was often times a huge cockblock too because you finally made your way to the dungeon and then Fi pops out, slaps you across the face, and says ""Dowsing mechanic, bitch."" It just felt like padding and forced exploration, which I am not a fan of."
truezelda,2r37zr,Mutericator,0,Sun Jan 4 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Too much talking and handholding and it takes way too long to get to the first dungeon. I finished the game, but have yet to replay it because the tedium at the beginning bores me to tears. It's bad enough that Eiji Aonuma apologized for it: http://nintendoeverything.com/aonuma-reflects-on-zelda-skyward-swords-tutorials-will-be-careful-with-them-going-forward/  Combine that with the most annoying and character-less companion in recent memory (Fi can die in a fire), the overall painful linearity, and a more or less completely empty overworld, and you have my least favorite 3D Zelda, surpassing even Twilight Princess, which is impressive considering how uninspired that game was."
truezelda,2r37zr,mzupeman,2,Fri Jan 2 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"To each their own, but I think Fi was an infinitely better companion than Navi."

At least Fi, as far as the story is concerned, has something of a purpose.  The 'voice' is also far more appealing than ""HEY!  LISTEN!!!!11!!!!!1!"""
truezelda,2r37zr,backwardinduction1,2,Mon Jan 5 16:05:19 2015 UTC,Fi also had a personality. When navi spoke it felt more like I was reading a guidebook.

truezelda,2r37zr,heymrk,0,Wed Jan 7 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"All the things that I expected to be great in Skyeard Sword weren't really. I loved the idea of motion controls, but they just didn't work right. I had to recalibrate constantly for the game to be playable. The soundtrack had a few great tracks and the I was excited for real orchestration, but it wasnt my favorite. Its concept art was the greatest, but the art style in game fell flat and started to grate on my nerves somehow (to the point of occasionally pulling me out of the experience). I expected the game to break the pattern of Zelda games and surprise me, but it ended up feeling broken up, forced, and very linear.  On top of that, a lot of things that were great at the start of the game fell flat over time. I was initially completely engaged in the story to start. It's a pretty great story, but there are large periods where nothing happens that drive it forward at all. It didn't do the best job of making me care. At first, it seemed like the side quests would be really cool and engaging, but they didn't end up impressing me all that much.   The game definitely held such magic for me in a lot of places, but it was one of the only games where I would completely break from the magic. I'm generally the kind of person who can critique something and enjoy it at the same time, but this game's failure to live up to my expectations really interupted my enjoyment in a huge way. It's partially my own fault for hyping it so much (I hope I'm not doing the same for Zelda U...)  There were a lot of things I really loved. I loved Batreaux and Pipit and some of the other side characters. I loved the implied ZeLink (don't anyone start an argument please). Despite the hand holding, I enjoyed the beginning of the gsme in a lot of ways: the cut scenes, the tropiness, the mysterious tone of the bit where you have to follow Fi, etc. I loved every part of the game that dealt with time. It's a great game, BUT to me it just really doesn't compare to many other Zelda games. It's pretty low on my list, but it's still a Zelda game. There's only one I don't like."
truezelda,2r37zr,tcrpgfan,-2,Sat Jan 3 04:52:33 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel like most of the people just weren't holding it like a sword. Or playing it with too bright lights.

truezelda,2qo90w,souasify,34,Mon Dec 29 02:43:49 2014 UTC,"my take was Midna was one of the Twili, and hated and despised by the people of the light world, breaking the rules or whatever, which is why she hid in Link's shadow every time he had an encounter with people or the great spirits. I feel like he was protecting her, keeping her secret, by not discussing it all.  Yes. I know that it falls apart under any scrutiny whatsoever."
truezelda,2qo90w,Gene_P00le,7,Mon Dec 29 03:23:16 2014 UTC,I like this take on it!
truezelda,2qo90w,pillowbird,15,Mon Dec 29 03:46:44 2014 UTC,"I think I read a lot into Twilight Princess that wasn't there. At first I thought it had so much depth, but later I realized it was all in my own head.  Like the beginning, when Ilia is taken by the Moblins (not king bulbins, fuck that). They look at Ilia's hand. Now maybe it was me and too much LotR, but my thoughts were that Ganondorf was searching for the hero, a la Wind Waker, checking hands for the Triforce. And then, when they booked it, before they had time to look at Link's hand, I thought (later, after I saw them) that the Spirit of the spring could sense their evil and they were getting out before they were killed. This is further reinforced in the way Midna hides back in your shadow every time Link talks to a Spirit, and in how Nayru attacks Zant, an evil presence in his sacred ground.   It's not referenced in the gameplay in any way, but given what Ganondorf was doing in Wind Waker (the same Ganondorf from OoT, by the way, only in an alternate timeline) and given what happened with Zant, it stands to reason. It might just be limitations of the game environment at the time, but damn it, it makes sense."
truezelda,2qo90w,Gene_P00le,10,Mon Dec 29 04:43:05 2014 UTC,Good catch. It's probably standard procedure for Ganon and his armies to check blond people's hands. I know I would.

I mean, yes, you do get to buy magic potions, but grandma's soup has the same effect. I suspect that each time Link appears, magic is common enough to him, as he's discovering fairies and spells and whatnot, but extremely uncommon to the rest of the world. Like every magical aspect of Hyrule just goes into hibernation or turns into legend and mythology, like the Spirits of the springs. Notice that the only one with any real knowledge or experience of the supernatural was the native medicine man.  I mean, they consider the slingshot and bow to be magical, when they're just basically a bow and a slingshot.  Anyway, unrelated I suppose, but I suppose the end result is that anything remotely magical is something to be shunned and burned at the stake. Unless it's skewering the monster that just carried your son on a stake around the countryside, maybe then it's okay."
truezelda,2qo90w,henryuuk,5,Mon Dec 29 03:46:15 2014 UTC,"True, Magic in general seems to be very limited, in fact, the only Link who actually learns genuine magic is AoL Link, all the others just force their magic power through magical artifacts.

Having the power to turn into a scary wolf is like that, but without the obvious positives of being chosen by the gods and bearing the triforce of courage. Would you really to tell all the kids that look up to you that you are the big monster that saw, so don't be afraid of it? It's a risky move.

truezelda,2qo90w,recursion8,16,Mon Dec 29 03:22:31 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna show you in 2 ways.    First of all, people react to what Links says in several ways, often going :""What's that ?!? this or that happened ?!?"" THis is in reaction to Link explaining something, this is especially clear in Skyward Sword, were you can see Link explain stuff while also making hand gestures. And the best scene to proof this is This one    For one thing : A mute would not be able to scream, neither Link's ""Hiyaah!'s"" nor his normal screaming would come out.    Secondly, at [1:24] : after groose is done shaking Link and making monkey noises, Link calms him, and then explains everthing to him, afterwards groose does the whole : ""Repeat and summarize what person just said to have the audience know what was said"" (this also happens in twilight princess, with Link explaining to everyone that the childeren are at kakariko village for example, and IIRC there is also scene were Link makes explaining gestures while the camera pans out, but I don't remember which scene it was)  .  And then, since you want an actual quote : ""Come one!"" -Hero of Winds-     Link has already been confirmed to be capable of speech since forever, he is a ""mute hero"" from the players perspective, but he isn't actually mute in any conceivable way."
truezelda,2qo90w,Jlove1982,4,Mon Dec 29 03:31:32 2014 UTC,"There's multiple scenes of Link's mouth moving and him making hand gestures/nodding during cutscenes in TP, mainly with the other inhabitants of Ordon Village (Ilia, Rusl, the Mayor) early on in the game."

truezelda,2qoyz1,angry_pandas,8,Mon Dec 29 07:29:38 2014 UTC,The Wii version isn't BAD but it isn't quite as good as the GCN version. Is it worth the difference in price to get the GCN version though? Not really.
truezelda,2qoyz1,Jammintk,4,Mon Dec 29 11:36:46 2014 UTC,Don't forget that the wii version looks and performs much better due to being on a more powerful console. You can also equip four items at a time and aim from third person instead of being forced to aim for first and having only two item slots.

truezelda,2qoyz1,grntplmr,2,Thu Jan 8 03:58:18 2015 UTC,Yeah it was mirrored for the Wii release so Links movements would more closely match the handedness of the majority of players when using a Wii remote.

truezelda,2qoyz1,IaiLwM,1 point,Tue Dec 30 05:26:49 2014 UTC,yeah i have a gamecube already
truezelda,2qoyz1,IaiLwM,7,Tue Dec 30 06:05:34 2014 UTC,"To offer an alternative idea, unless you think you'll rather like motion controls, I'd suggest emulating the GameCube version if you can (you'll probably need a... relatively beefy computer to play it seamlessly). It's what I did - I purchased the Wii version, but emulated the GCN version on PC out of personal preference.  While it's not too hard, setting up Dolphin is still a fair bit more difficult than just inserting a disc into a console - and TP itself needs a few tweaks. Plus, you'll probably want a PC-connected controller to play it as trying to play it with keyboard and mouse is... not quite the same, to say the least.  However, I'd say the advantages are worth it. 1080p, AA & AF make the game look even nicer imo, and you can make it widescreen if you want to (see link above).  There's a few useful hacks too, for example - that annoying bug/feature where you're notified what rupee you pick up every time you restart the game? That can be disabled with a single tick in the game properties.  So if you're open to emulation, it might be worth considering it. Some say it doesn't quite feel the same, and that may be true, but eh, I still rather like it."
truezelda,2qoyz1,Ebotchl,3,Mon Dec 29 10:49:36 2014 UTC,I would but my pc isn't powerful enough
truezelda,2qoyz1,IaiLwM,5,Mon Dec 29 15:00:27 2014 UTC,"Ah alright. In that case, I would base it primarily on your opinion of motion controls.  The game being mirrored is a little annoying but overall not that important and it's not blatantly obvious it's mirrored, and the Wii widescreen is nice but doesn't affect the experience that much. So for me, it would come down to motion controls.  I'm not a fan of motion controls at all, so if I was in your situation I would pay extra for the GameCube version. However, if you think you'll like the motion controls, go for the cheaper Wii version. If you're indifferent or unsure about the motion controls, it really comes down to: save money and go with a still perfectly good (albeit slightly inferior in my opinion) version of the game, or spend extra to get the ""originally intended experience""?"
truezelda,2qoyz1,tcrpgfan,3,Mon Dec 29 15:13:59 2014 UTC,I've honestly been wondering OP's question in the back of my head for a while now and you answered it quite well. Thank you.
truezelda,2qoyz1,recursion8,3,Mon Dec 29 22:26:50 2014 UTC,"No problem. Good luck with getting it, and have fun. It's not for everyone, but it's my favourite game (in general, not just Zelda) and I had a rather amazing time with it, so I do recommend it heavily and hope you have a similarly good experience."
truezelda,2qoyz1,Rubular,5,Mon Dec 29 22:33:33 2014 UTC,"Wii, more item buttons, better aiming, waggling to swing your sword, 16:9 aspect ratio, more involved controls."
truezelda,2qoyz1,IThoughtThisWasDigg,4,Mon Dec 29 10:24:25 2014 UTC,"Plus I thought the sound fx from the Wiimote (things like drawing your sword, Midna's laugh when she wants your attention, etc) was a really nice little addition that adds to the immersion."
truezelda,2qoyz1,Kinomi,1 point,Tue Dec 30 05:30:16 2014 UTC,"I personally would go with the GameCube one. You have full control over the camera, which is really useful especially while exploring or on horseback, and you can use two items immediately rather than one, which is an advantage in combat. Pressing a button is more immediate and responsive than shaking your hands to swing the sword, especially with some of the elaborate combos the game has (some of the stalfos's techniques feel very sloppy or laggy with the wiimote, I find). That said the differences aren't huge and if the price difference is really $30 in the US I'd go with the cheaper one.  The GameCube one can be set to 16:9 as well."
truezelda,2qoyz1,mzupeman,1 point,Mon Jan 12 16:41:41 2015 UTC,GCN version has better controls (especially with the camera seeing there's the C-Stick). Only get the Wii version if you want widescreen.
truezelda,2qoyz1,Fox436,2,Sun Jan 11 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"I only played Wii, didn't have any problems with it.  TP's ""motion controls"" were mostly just flicking your wrist for sword attacks, not nearly as annoying as Skyward Sword's over the top system.  I'd have loved SS if it had TP's controls"
truezelda,2qoyz1,backwardinduction1,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:08:06 2014 UTC,"Twilight Princess on the Wii was a fine experience.  The 'flicking' for sword swinging worked quite well.  I never had any complaints, and in some respects thought it 'felt' better to me than using a Gamecube controller."

If you can't upscale it, then I'd say  its debatable on getting the Wii version simply because the Gamecube shows its age with picture quality.  The Wii version is not without some major faults though:  Random fairy following Link, acting as a cursor (instead of an inanimate object which would have made more sense.)  Free camera movement in the GCN, and the lack of camera control on the Wii.   The gamecube only allowing two items to be equipped at once, but the Wii required all items to be set to B. You could set four to the D pad but the one set to B was the only one that could be used at the time. Bad design.  The game just plays better on the Gamecube overall."
truezelda,2qih62,MisogynistLesbian,34,Sat Dec 27 06:26:21 2014 UTC,I assumed this was the case when I played the game? I thought that was the implication of his character.
truezelda,2qih62,AliveProbably,7,Sat Dec 27 07:02:35 2014 UTC,Glad to know so many others are in agreement!  It is a great addition to Wind Waker's story.

truezelda,2qih62,grntplmr,11,Sat Dec 27 08:17:30 2014 UTC,"It sounds more plausible to me than him just having an insanely long lifespan. I think it also adds an extra element of tragedy to his character, he has lingered for many years in the hope of righting the wrong, only to be denied the chance to see the fruits of his effort. In the end his wish catches up with him and he shares the fate of his kingdom and subjects while knowing, that at least for now, all is right in the world."
truezelda,2qih62,Zubat_Breeder,9,Sat Dec 27 06:55:55 2014 UTC,"I never thought of it that way! And I've been playing for 12 years lol. I love it! You're theory makes sense, but I do have to say one thing:   Why would he willingly let himself drown?  In the ending of WW, the King reaches towards Link because he wishes that he could help him and his descendant Tetra find and build a new kingdom.  But he can't.  He's dead. He had almost forgotten for a moment. He lowers his arm, remembering that his fate was tied to his kingdom's, just as Ganon's.  Yin and yang.  He will experience the eternal slumber now, finally at peace.  It is a bittersweet end.   You're right, he and Ganon were yin and yang. Collectively, they're biggest internal conflict throughout the game as well as in unmentioned events leading up to the game is the inability to move on. Ganondorf really misses his desert, and he will do anything to bring back Hyrule and raise it from the depths. And Daphnes kinda wants this too, but he knows better. I think that rather than being there to guide the new hero, or maybe even aside from it, the king's spirit lingers in a state of unrest because he can't move on. And after going through a text dump, I see where you're right that he has to stay behind because he can't move on from Hyrule, but I disagree that it is because he's dead. And I have nothing to support that, I just disagree with your point. That said, though, I like your theory and it makes sense.  Sorry if any of this was redundant, it's late, I'm not wearing my glasses, and I'm on mobile."
truezelda,2qih62,Vivo999,8,Sat Dec 27 09:20:34 2014 UTC,"Honestly I would 100% agree with this, but I have a problem believing that the Triforce is able to grant a wish to a ghost. He touched the Triforce so he had to be there in a very physical sense, as a ghost's hand would simply phase through the Triforce."
truezelda,2qih62,Serbaayuu,6,Sat Dec 27 23:26:30 2014 UTC,He did teleport around the basement of Hyrule Castle instead of walking. Maybe he can make himself tangible for short periods of time while under the waves.
truezelda,2qih62,Vivo999,1 point,Sat Dec 27 23:37:39 2014 UTC,Skyward Sword proved pretty clearly that you don't actually need to touch the Triforce to make a wish on it.
truezelda,2qih62,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Dec 29 00:18:42 2014 UTC,"Well that could be debatable since Link had to gather all three pieces himself. In the case of Windwaker Ganondorf gathered the pieces from three different people. So because the Triforce's original owner came from three different people, it cannot make a wish until someone touches it (likely one of the three). In the case of Ocarina of Time, the Triforce is already complete and belongs to nobody, so anyone to touch it will cause the wish to be formed. In Skyward Sword, the Triforce has not been put together yet and Link has to gather them all up himself. He actually achieves this and gets the full Triforce. It is only after this he makes a wish. There's no question of who is the Triforce's rightful owner of the wish at this point. Link went through all the trials to qualify him for the task, and he had all three pieces with him."
truezelda,2qih62,BlueJoshi,2,Tue Dec 30 08:42:58 2014 UTC,I suppose that's a reasonable interpretation.  I can't think of any other game that debunks it.
truezelda,2qih62,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Jan 1 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"he major one is that Wind Waker happens hundreds of years after[1] the Great Flood. He's so old, he knows the ancient OoT-era Hylian tongue. Even if the guy was able to find sustenance in a world empty of people to grow and cook food for him, there's no reason to think he's anything but mortal or has an abnormally long lifespan or anything like that.   Well, keep in mind, time was frozen down there.  So it's not so much that he has a long life, as time didn't pass so he didn't age or die.  This would also be the ""slumber"" that the goddess woke him up from, as per Historia.   Why would he willingly let himself drown?   Because he was a relic of the past, a past that the present (and its future) doesn't need.  He chose to go down with his kingdom, like a captain with his ship.  I do enjoy your interpretation, but I think it's more likely the creators intended him to be alive."
truezelda,2qih62,MarianoAlipi,2,Sun Dec 28 16:29:48 2014 UTC,"Fascinating, this is almost exactly what somebody over at /r/zeldaconspiracies said.  I'll tell you what I told them.   The monsters aren't frozen in time because everything in the bubble is preserved. They're frozen because the goddesses put a seal on Ganon's magic using the Master Sword. That's why they come back to life after Link withdraws it. King Daphnes isn't affected.  ""Foolish child. While that sword is indeed the blade of evil's bane, at the same time, it has long played another role...You see, it is also a sort of key...a most wretched little key that has kept the seal on me and my magic intact!"" — Ganon (The Wind Waker)  And yeah, your last paragraph outlines perfectly why it doesn't make sense according to the story for King Daphnes to join them, but it's not an in-universe explanation, which is what I'm looking for."
truezelda,2qih62,Throwawaylikeits1992,2,Sun Dec 28 20:12:01 2014 UTC,"This is more reasonable to me than him just arbitrarily having an extremely long lifespan.  I've always assumed he was long-dead, or at least preserved along with Hyrule as a sort of spiritual entity."

They were  appointed as tutors to the young Princess Zelda. It was from them that I first heard tales of the accursed mirror in the  Arbiter's Grounds.

So I mean, why would they not take up their duties as tutor for the royal family for generations and all of a sudden decide to do so for TP Zelda? Just going by the dilipadation of the Temple of Time, it has to be centuries in between the two time periods."

At the end of OoT there's nothing to suggest that the ""new"" sages are ever awakened as sages. TP's flashback occurs shortly after OoT ends. In that flashback we see that the sages look exactly the same as they do in the present in TP. I'd say it's a far bigger leap to suggest that the ""new"" OoT sages were awakened after OoT ends and somehow transformed to look like that than it is to say that there were six ""original"" sages that got killed in the adult timeline of OoT."

truezelda,2qf3z0,TheMovieMaverick,3,Fri Dec 26 22:15:49 2014 UTC,"As Wind Waker suggests, Sagehood is passed down by a combination of spirituality and bloodline.  Medli was descended from Laruto, who was presumably descended from Ruto.  This is also supported by the Sage lore in the Fallen timeline, where blood relations play an important role in their magic and prominence.  I have always assumed that the Sages in Twilight Princess are the same people from Ocarina of Time, only at the end of their natural lifespans they ascended into an ethereal state of existence.  It's also commonly-assumed that the Hero of Time awoke all the Sages in the Childhood timeline since he knew who they were, where to find them, and how to do it - and since that would be a good idea for him to do, anyway, so they didn't get killed off by some big bad later.  But really there is absolutely no way for us to know who exactly the Twilight Princess Sages were.  They could have been brand new ones.  There's nothing in the game that tells us."
truezelda,2qf3z0,Serbaayuu,7,Fri Dec 26 04:45:32 2014 UTC,"Nah, the Sages from TP are OoT child Zelda's tutors. In the OoT game we as players experience, they are presumably killed when Link is locked in the Sacred Realm for 7 years and Ganondorf overthrows Hyrule. Therefore adult OoT Link has to go each temple and awaken the new Sages to take their place. In the Child timeline however, since Ganondorf is stopped and imprisoned before he ever pulls off his coup, the Sages are alive and sentence him, with only the Sage of Water being killed (TP spoiler)."

Instead of basically guarding the Sacred Realm, they're in charge of praying at their respective temples to maintain the Master Sword's power to repel evil.

truezelda,2q9hva,Petrichor02,1 point,Wed Dec 24 09:07:45 2014 UTC,"So, I have another question. Is the Timeline that Nintendo released accurate? I heard it's not because of something to do with the Shade"
truezelda,2q9hva,liquidDinner,6,Wed Dec 24 17:08:05 2014 UTC,"The book that Nintendo released does have a number of errors and omissions within it. Whether the timeline within the book is accurate depends on whether we are to treat the games or the book as a higher form of canon since the two contradict one another in several places.  If the book overrules the games, then that timeline is accurate regardless of the contradictions. If the games overrule the book, then that timeline is only accurate as far as it agrees with the games or comments on things that the games leave ambiguous. And since the book says that it is just what is currently believed to be true, and Aonuma says in his section of the book that he hopes readers will continue to try to figure out the timeline for themselves, that sounds like the games are of a higher level of canon than the book."
truezelda,2q9hva,Phoxxent,6,Wed Dec 24 18:38:30 2014 UTC,I like that even Nintendo isn't prepared to stick to a set timeline. They get a lot more creativity for future games if they aren't limited to placing it in a certain spot in the timeline.
truezelda,2q9hva,stern93,2,Wed Dec 24 20:18:33 2014 UTC,"Well, it's a bit hard, since they abandoned it for a couple games, and didn't keep the details in line for others. As an overall concept, the timeline they presented works."
truezelda,2q9hva,Serbaayuu,5,Thu Dec 25 02:18:03 2014 UTC,"Nintendo released it, its canon. Simple as that. The shade is simply MM Link grow up and filled with regret and sorrow because he saved 2 civilizations and no one knows of him, and he never passed on his wisdom."
truezelda,2q9hva,henryuuk,3,Wed Dec 24 18:05:56 2014 UTC,"Ocarina of Time -> A & B & C  A. Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle.  Zelda and the Sages seal Ganon.  B. Link is removed from the timeline.  Hyrule is later flooded.  C. Link returns to his childhood, prevents the events of Ocarina of Time from happening, and then grows up and dies naturally but becomes a Shade due to his regrets about this version of his life.  I do not see where the confusion comes from?  Could you be more specific?"
truezelda,2q9hva,Phoxxent,3,Wed Dec 24 21:34:00 2014 UTC,"You already got your main answer from others, but to answer the ""is the timeline correct"" question : there is only one really big issue with the timeline, and that is the fallen hero timeline, not THAT it exists, but WHERE it starts. mostly they decided to go with ""Epicness value"" by placing its start during the final battle instead of taking the more logical placement they had readily available."
truezelda,2q9hva,henryuuk,3,Thu Dec 25 00:19:43 2014 UTC,"But it would have to be in the final battle in order for Ganon to be Ganon and not ganondorf. It has little to do with ""epicness"" and everything to do with Ganon being a beastly pig monster in every game in that timeline."
truezelda,2q9hva,recursion8,3,Thu Dec 25 02:20:19 2014 UTC,"Except Ganondorf has transformed into a pig in other instances too. There is no reason why he couldn't have transformed into his pig demon form after getting the full triforce (don't forget the entire ""dark world"" was kinda wonky, and turned people into animals (Bunny link for example))    But that is a SMALL ""mistake"" there would have been otherwise, which could have been explained in HUNDREDS of ways.    Now let me list thievery that is wrong with placing it in the final battle.     In the Alttp ""background story"", there is no mention of a hero, only off the sages, yet Adult Link was already seen as a hero by the final battle. GanonDORF entered the sacred Realm, not GANON He did so with his ""band of thieves"", yet the gerudo (or any other thieves) were not actually helping him anymore at that time) he entered the sacred realm ('entered' implies he did so voluntarily to get the triforce, not ""got sealed into the sacred Realm"") He entered to get the triforce, but if the event happens during the final battle, then all 3 pieces were in hyrule, at his castle, so he never had a reason to enter the Sacred Realm In OoT, The sages can not seal Ganondorf without : the hero and specifically the mastersword being wielded by the Hero and the ""leader of the sages"" (Zelda), yet Ganon having the full triforce would imply he killed or otherwise incapacitated both of them, meaning the mastersword had no one to wield it, and the sages didn't have someone to channel their combined power through. The sages sealed the sacred Realm away while Ganondorf was inside, not ""sealed ganondorf into  the sacred realm""   -etc...   .  They went for nothing but epicness value, the much more logical time would be Child Link being zapped by Ganondorf and dieing (this would then be prevented in the child and adult timeline because of Link getting the dream at the beginning, which made him ""brace"" himself during the attack, surviving it) The way the screen flashes white, with Link's scream during the vision/dream also implies Link is supposed to die there (often in scenes like that : white flash = death, black flash = knocked out) This would then explain why GanonDORF had to gather his thieves and forcefully enter the sacred realm with his thieves, it would explain why the remaining royal guards were following the sages (King dead, Zelda and Impa fled), it would explain why no mention of ""A hero"" is in the ALttP backstory, and why the entire triforce was still in the sacred realm, as well as why ganondorf didn't get to it without a fight (like he does in OoT because of the amazing tactic that is : ""neutral Jing"")    The minor things that are not explained would also be a lot easier to be given simple lore, without working against what was already canon, like they did now. for example : Link getting the premonition dream could easily be put into something like someone using time magic to give him a warning in the form of the dream at the start."

truezelda,2q9hva,liquidDinner,-3,Thu Dec 25 21:13:57 2014 UTC,"From what I know, the shade in TP is the link from mm and ot. After the events of ot link gets lost in the forest and according to one theory actually dies. Meaning that mm was actually a form of purgatory where he goes through the five stages of grief. And due to legend passed down in ot, children that become lost in the forest never return and become stalfos. So the shade link In tp heavily resembles a stalfos."

truezelda,2q9hva,blazzerftw,6,Wed Dec 24 22:49:37 2014 UTC,"Because 1) children who get lost in the Lost Woods most likely don't turn into Stalfos; Navi believes they turn into Skull Kids, and even if Navi is wrong, it's more likely that children would turn into Stalchildren than Stalfos, 2) the Hero's Shade isn't a Stalfos, he's a ghost; Stalfos are skeletons that have been brought back to life, but the Hero's Shade is a ghost with a skeletal face, 3) if TP Link really is the descendant of OoT/MM Link, as Hyrule Historia says, then that means OoT/MM Link couldn't have died until he became an adult, got the Hero's Shade armor, and learned those sword skills that the Hero's Shade knows that the Hero of Time doesn't currently know (assuming OoT/MM Link and the Hero's Shade are the same person, of course), 4) the end of MM shows Link in more or less the same position as he was in at the beginning of the game, so if he was dead at the end of the game, he would have had to have been dead at the beginning of the game before the game ever started, and 5) MM and TWW both tell  us that lots of people are able to travel between Hyrule and Termina without much effort, which wouldn't be possible if Termina was just some sort of afterlife or hallucination."

Although I still like the idea that link at some point got lost in the woods and became that ""stalfos like"" creature.

truezelda,2q9hva,Metalboka,2,Thu Dec 25 16:28:07 2014 UTC,"No problem. And Link could still end up getting lost in the woods and become a Stalfos-like creature if he does so after MM if the Hero's Shade isn't the same guy as OoT/MM Link. Otherwise it would probably take some sort of explanation like: ""OoT/MM Link became a Stalfos in the woods after the events of MM, but then his human soul was restored despite him still having a Stalfos body, and because of his human soul, he was able to return as a ghost when he died despite his ghost still maintaining a sort of Stalfos-look to it""."

truezelda,2q9hva,grntplmr,1 point,Thu Dec 25 01:35:27 2014 UTC,"[Citation needed]  Also, becoming a stalfos in the Lost Woods is probably nothing more than a legend to keep people out of a dangerous mazelike forest, supported by the fact that stalfos appear ALL OVER the world, not just in the woods."
truezelda,2q3jdd,089786,26,Mon Dec 22 19:47:42 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how much of the side quests did you explore? I could see not being impressed with the ocean exploration if you just stuck to the main quest (like I did my first time) but once I started doing the optional stuff the world really opened up.   I agree it's not the most difficult Zelda game, but I keep coming back to it because of the open world and the charming style. Personally I can't get into a lot of video games because they take themselves too seriously to the point of being comical. But WW has a timeless look and feel, and while it still sticks to the Zelda save the world sort of story, it never gets too far up its own ass. There are enough comedic elements and the story is pretty simple for the most part, enough so that it doesn't get in the way of the game play."
truezelda,2q3jdd,LongerNeckBiggerHead,14,Mon Dec 22 20:17:32 2014 UTC,"i disagree with you on some points, specifically the art style which i personally consider gorgeous, but i do tend to agree that The Wind Waker suffers from a lack of exploratory content and challenge. WW really just breaks my heart because it had so much potential that it really failed to reach.  as you mentioned, dungeons are probably the biggest culprit here. WW only contains 5 main dungeons, compared to the standard 8 given in most titles. if it weren't for the Triforce piece collection quest, WW would easily be the shortest entry in the series by a noticeable margin. collecting the Triforce isn't too bad, honestly, but it's pretty clear that it was only introduced as an easy way to pad out the last quarter of the game. we might compare this to Twilight Princess's Sky Kingdom Statues in that they both occur towards the end of the game and give the player an excuse to travel the world and use all of their items again. the major difference, though, is that the statues were simply a fun change of pace between dungeons whereas Triforce shards were in place of actual dungeons. this low dungeon count for WW really hurt the ""epic scope"" feel of the game for me, which i feel is a staple of the series. even Majora's Mask with only four dungeons made me feel like i had gone farther and accomplished more. add in just how easy the 5 dungeons were (mostly as regards enemy difficulty, the puzzles were alright), and they just felt merely passable. the only aspect that made the dungeons memorable were the visual and sound design, which i really can only say nice things about. in short, i felt like i was only about halfway through the game when i got dumped at Ganon's Tower and thought, ""wow, that was it? i'd only be halfway through the Dark World in ALttP right now"".  another example is with side quests. most of the islands out on the Great Sea don't have any meaningful content (Matthew Matosis has a good segment on that in his video review of WW here, and the game was also missing some fun side items that we saw in other games like different tunics, weapons, and shields. there was only one magick spell, compared to 3 in ALttP or OoT, and even the item upgrades (big quiver and big bomb bag) were just given to you by Great Fairies. even the fountains themselves weren't as much fun to find because their easily distinguishable island type meant you knew exactly what you were looking at when you found one and it was just a question of whether you had the right item on you to open them; they never really felt ""hidden away"" like the Fairy Fountains located in other games. the decoration quest was fun, but it was pretty shallow, and just resulted in Magic Armor item, which just felt silly given the game's difficulty. the picto box quest was more tedious than anything imo, especially since it didn't yield any in game rewards but was more just for bragging rights.  the number of settlements also felt underwhelming to me. in OoT, there was Kokiri Forest, Hyrule Castle Town, Kakariko Village, Goron City, Zora's Domain, and the Gerudo Fortress, with minor settlements at Lon Lon Ranch and Lake Hylia. in WW, you've got Outset Island, Windfall Island, Dragonroost Island, and Forest Haven, and perhaps the Cabana (though it's deserted save for the door butler so maybe it's not fair to include it here). in OoT, i would say Kokiri Forest, Hyrule Castle Town, Kakariko Village, and Goron City are all on par size-wise with Windfall Island, the largest settlement in WW. Outset Island is close, but still noticeably smaller in scope than Windfall or the other large settlements from OoT. Dragonroost Island is barely above Gerudo Fortress and Zora's Domain from OoT and Forest Haven in WW. Both Lon Lon Ranch and Lake Hylia feel more settled and broader in scope than the mini-game islands from WW. if we break this down, OoT has 4 major settlements versus WW's 1.5 (i'll give Outset a half point, here), both have 2 minor settlements, and OoT also has Lon Lon Ranch and Lake Hylia which help to round out the world. and i'm not even taking into account the more isolated NPCs, such as the carpenter camp in Gerudo Valley or the skull kids you interact with in Lost Woods. all of these places help make OoT feel bigger and more full of life than it technically is. the Great Sea, by comparison, just feels empty even though it's empirically far larger.  it was also one of the first mainline Zelda's that lacked a ""world change"" mechanic of some kind, like Child/Adult Link in OoT or Light/Dark in ALttP. even MM had the three-day cycle which would change the world, as well as each area having its own pre/post dungeon setting. they had an opportunity with the introduction of Hyrule below the sea, but even that would have been underwhelming if you ask me unless they put a spin on it.  anyway, this post is getting way longer than i initially planned for it to be. just to summarize, i agree that WW felt pretty light on content, especially for a Zelda game with an overworld that's so huge."
truezelda,2q3jdd,instantiatedObject,8,Mon Dec 22 22:32:50 2014 UTC,Not disagreeing with you but WW had 7 main dungeons
truezelda,2q3jdd,wx_bombadil,3,Tue Dec 23 05:45:21 2014 UTC,Oh god I love the savage labyrinth!
truezelda,2q3jdd,RezicG,2,Tue Dec 23 13:17:07 2014 UTC,"i actually consulted that wiki page while i was writing up my comment to make sure i wasn't missing anything.  regarding counting the final dungeon as a main dungeon, that's fair enough. i arbitrarily don't count final dungeons as main dungeons when comparing Zelda titles simply because of the aesthetic, thematic, and design differences that i feel separate them into their own category. still, adding it in as another dungeon doesn't really change my point in that dungeon content in WW is pretty light compared to other mainline Zeldas.  regarding the forsaken fortress, it has much more in common with mini-dungeons than with main dungeons, so i do disagree about counting that here for the purposes of this discussion. both times you visit forsaken fortress are comparatively brief, especially the first time through. if we're going to count that first run through as a ""dungeon"", then we should also count the Gerudo Fortress or Hyrule Castle Garden from OoT as a ""dungeon"", which i clearly think is silly. there's a better case for the second iteration to be considered a dungeon as you gain an item (the hammer) and fight a miniboss and a boss. still, though, its short and simple design make it hard for me to consider it more than a mini-dungeon.  if we do decide to consider Forsaken Fortress a dungeon, then i think it muddies the waters of ""dungeon"" enough that we'd have to go through each dungeon of other games to compare length, complexity, etc. which would be really long winded. in the end, i think it's just easier to consider the second visit to Forsaken Fortress a mini-dungeon that uses a few key story events to separate the first half of the game from the second half."
truezelda,2q3jdd,instantiatedObject,2,Tue Dec 23 14:57:53 2014 UTC,Good points. My criteria for whether something is a dungeon has always been whether it has a dungeon map or not. The forsaken fortress is definitely kind of a grey area since you fight a boss at the end but there's no boss key like the other dungeons. It's certainly different than the other dungeons but I always considered it one since you get a dungeon map and fight a boss at the end.
truezelda,2q3jdd,wx_bombadil,3,Tue Dec 23 16:53:14 2014 UTC,"Yes, I agree with everything you said.  You said it better than I did."
truezelda,2q3jdd,souffle-etc,6,Mon Dec 22 22:43:24 2014 UTC,"From a newcomer's perspective, I could definitely see how you got the impressions you did.  The thing about Zelda games (and really any games in general) is that you're going to be disappointed more often than not if you expect any other game in the series to be like the rest.    Wind Waker did not really have much challenging gameplay, it was definitely lacking in full-blown dungeons, and you do see a lot of the same enemies if you're outside of a dungeon.  That being said, it wasn't really supposed to do much of that. While you're mostly gonna get Octoroks and Bokoblins on the islands/sea, there is an incredibly diverse amount of enemies within dungeons.  The gameplay introduced the Quick Time Event to the Zelda series, which led to the Hidden Skills in Twilight Princess.  Wind Waker was also Nintendo’s first forage into an open world concept after a decade or two.    I’m sorry you didn’t like the characters much; personally I felt they were incredibly rich!  They were almost as good as Majora’s Mask characters, in the sense that you can get different reactions and learn more about almost every character depending on the time of day, location, and progress in the game.  Tetra was a character saturated with information, but you did have to infer a lot of it; it’s not handed to you directly or in-your-face.    The music was amazing and instantly classic, the world was immense at the time and offered dozens and dozens of hours of exploration and excitement, and a lot of new items to the series made this game amazing for newcomers. However, I can understand if some of that was lost by a newcomer who’s about 10 years late to the party. That’s no disrespect to you, I’m just saying that I can understand why this game isn’t as phenomenal to you as it is to people who got to it earlier in their gaming experience."
truezelda,2q3jdd,Foyet,18,Mon Dec 22 23:02:30 2014 UTC,"I disagree with your hypothesis of the Great Sea being empty. There is actually quite a bit to do and to explore, and while you can't really get off of the King of Red Lions and swim around very long, there is still more to the ocean than just something that separates you from your next task.  There are many islands to explore, reefs to fight in, big octos to defeat, and countless options for finding sunken treasure--either with treasure maps for a larger prize, or just sailing around until a purple rupee comes around.  If you get bored of all that, there's lots to explore and have fun with on some of the bigger islands (Outset, Windfall, Dragonroost, etc.). And if you're frustrated with the large span of the ocean and the amount of time it takes to traverse it to get from one place to another, there's the cyclones and the Swift Sail (Wii U remake only) to get you to where you need to go much quicker.  Though, I admit, Wind Waker wasn't my favorite Zelda game, either. I enjoyed it, but it was not difficult and I often found myself relatively bored with the storyline. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, after all."
truezelda,2q3jdd,23saround,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:13:43 2014 UTC,"But even the things the ocean was filled with were repetitive and boring. A reef was kind of fun to go through once, but there were like six reefs that were almost exactly the same. Same goes for the octos, and and for the treasure – once you realized all that was in the chests was just more useless rupees, they got really boring to dredge up. And even with the fast sail and the cyclones, it was such a process to map out the entire world."
truezelda,2q3jdd,malaroo,1 point,Wed Dec 24 23:38:44 2014 UTC,"This may be true enough, but I ask you to name a similar game that doesn't suffer from that same problem of 'same-ness'.  I've played pretty much every open-world game with decent reputation that I could find, and every single one suffers from this, and the only remedies are unrealistic.  It would basically take unlimited time and unlimited money to continue developing new, fresh things to do for a single project, and that will never fly in any legitimate business who is trying to make money.  For what Wind Waker did, it did great."
truezelda,2q3jdd,buriedinthenude,3,Thu Dec 25 04:24:29 2014 UTC,Its easily the weakest 3D Zelda but its not THAT bad. Trying exploring every island and completing the map. Theres an island and at least one treasure per square!
truezelda,2q3jdd,TheHynusofTime,5,Tue Dec 23 01:08:43 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty split on a lot of what you said, but since Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda game, I feel like I should defend it a bit. So just a warning, wall of text incoming.  Difficulty: When it comes to the Zelda franchise, I've always felt that the difficulty of the game should match the tone. So sure, Wind Waker is an easy game, but it matches the bright and colorful art style, and the seemingly light hearted tone of the rest of the game. Twilight Princess, on the other hand, is supposed to have a very dark and grim tone, but the difficulty doesn't compliment that at all. Twilight Princess is a ridiculously easy game, even more so than the Wind Waker, and these so called dangerous beasts that take over Hyrule don't seem so threatening when you can kill them with ease.  Art style: Like you said, Wind Waker's artstyle has aged much better than most other Zelda games visually. However, I don't think any of the things you listed were really taken away because of the artstyle. This is pretty opinion based, but I thought the art style complimented the story well, and any other artstyle chosen for this game wouldn't have worked as well. Because of the artstyle, the characters, namely Link, were a lot more expressive than they ever had been before, and it really made Link feel like an actual character, rather than merely a vessel for the player to explore the world, which was how I felt with Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.  Motivation: You've basically covered this one yourself. The only game that I feel did this better was Skyward Sword, but honestly, the setup is pretty much the same, just swap out the sibling with a love interest.  Dungeons: I will admit, the amount of dungeons in this game was disappointing, but I didn't feel like any of them were below the standards of typical Zelda dungeons. Each dungeon had a gimmick or theme that they adhered to, and each felt pretty unique. I especially liked how you didn't tackle the Earth and Wind dungeons alone, instead enlisting the aid of the sages-to-be. This led to some pretty interesting puzzles, like all of the light reflecting in the Earth temple, for example. Interestingly enough, this was the Zelda game where dungeons started getting pretty linear. By that, I mean that in Ocarina or Majora's, a key you get in one room may need to be used on the other side of the dungeon. In Wind Waker, most of the time, a small key you get in one room will like be used in the very same room that you get it in. I personally don't mind this change, but I could see why it would bug some people.  Characters: again, this is pretty opinion based, but I found that Wind Waker had some of the most memorable characters from any Zelda game. I liked Tetra's sassy attitude, I liked the pirate gang, I liked the King of Red Lions, and I loved Ganondorf in this game. He was set up to be a pretty tragic villain in this game, which was a nice change from the completely power hungry villain that he was in Ocarina, and would be again in Twilight Princess. And the NPCs were all pretty memorable as well. I might not always be able to give you a name, but if you gave me a quick, two or three word description, I'd be able to tell you who you were talking about.  Enemies: I must admit, I can't really argue this too much. Each lava area has the same set of enemies, each forest area has the same set of enemies, and by the end of the game, you'll pretty much only be fighting Darknuts, Wizrobes, and Moblins. I like to think of that as the game letting you know that you're reaching the end, and Ganondorf is throwing the best of his army at you.  Final Dungeon: Ganon's Tower in Wind Waker accomplishes exactly what it did in Ocarina of Time, which was to test you on everything you've done leading up to that point. The difference being that Ocarina had a bunch of silver rupee hunts, and Wind Waker had smaller rooms, but you could refight old bosses. And since a lot of people like being able to go back and fight old bosses (which was why the boss trials were added in Skyward Sword), it was pretty cool that you could save at that point, copy your file, and then you would have a file where you could go back and fight bosses whenever you wanted.  Exploration: This is what confuses me. There is plenty to do out on the Great Sea. There are the treasure charts and sunken treasures to find, all of the watch towers, the submarines, and 49 different islands, each with at least something to offer, whether it just be a bit of extra rupees, one of the goron merchants, or maybe a korok with a wilted tree.  In the end, a lot of this is just opinions, and I'm not really trying to force mine upon you, but hopefully I have changed your mind, even if just a bit."
truezelda,2q3jdd,henryuuk,4,Tue Dec 23 01:03:00 2014 UTC,"When I think of oceans and ships and pirates, I think of adventure and exploration     you clearly have no understanding of pirates. Any sea adventures is a lot of sailing for a single island."
truezelda,2q3jdd,supergidds64,3,Mon Dec 22 20:55:32 2014 UTC,"I actually agree with your point about the sea making it so empty, and I am glad to see someone point this out. For all of its criticisms, the one that baffles me the most about skyward sword is how ""empty"" the game feels, and that isn't because it isn't true, but it baffles me because the same people turn and say windwaker is a masterpiece. Windwaker is a good game in my opinion,  but it is a major example at the hypocrisy of the Zelda fanbase."
truezelda,2q3jdd,henryuuk,4,Mon Dec 22 21:22:11 2014 UTC,"Except windwaker had a lot of islands with actually stuff on it across the ocean, every single island has SOMETHING. ""The sky"" in skyword Sword has the main islands, the pumpkin landing, and a couple of minigames, that's about it.     It never bothered me personally, but comparing the ""type"" of emptiness as being the same is wrong."
truezelda,2q3jdd,supergidds64,3,Mon Dec 22 23:16:04 2014 UTC,"I can see that, but the actual lands you went to on the ground were pretty big and expansive. The islands in Windwaker weren't quite like that. Plus, alot of islands in Windwaker are the same, just a couple big islands, while the smaller ones are essentially mini games."
truezelda,2q3jdd,henryuuk,0,Mon Dec 22 23:28:36 2014 UTC,"Like i said, I didn't mind SS's Sky, but you were specifically comparing the SKY from SS, with the Ocean from WW. And the Sky from SS is definitly way more empty then WW's Ocean was."
truezelda,2q3jdd,supergidds64,1 point,Mon Dec 22 23:40:47 2014 UTC,"I meant overall exploration, but if we are doing sky vs ocean for this then of course the ocean has a lot more, that is all the game for windwaker. You would be right in that regard"
truezelda,2q3jdd,henryuuk,0,Mon Dec 22 23:46:31 2014 UTC,"That's all i was saying. Personally I like WW more, but I never considered SS's Sky to be an issue."
truezelda,2q3jdd,Serbaayuu,2,Mon Dec 22 23:56:09 2014 UTC,"The Great Sea is my favorite overworld - it is absolutely the fullest Zelda game world there has ever been.  There is so much you can do in it.  Try 100%ing the game, and you'll see what I mean.  Towers, submarines, islands with hidden caves, treasure charts, all sorts of small things that you will absolutely never notice if you don't seek them out.  Also for the record, I prefer WW-original for the lack of Swift Sail."
truezelda,2q3jdd,ninjatofu1014,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:24:12 2014 UTC,"Could you explain where the other 3d Zeldas are superior? If you were complaining about WW's ease (I'll concede, but try it on hero mode and see) and its lack of exploration (which, IMO, WW does the best job with in the 3d zelda department) I'd think you would be a fan of the original LOZ or ALTTP, but as you stated you're only a fan of the 3d Zeldas, it's hard for me to see where you're coming from. OOT is (IMO) AWFUL with exploration. Your complaints about 90% of the ocean being water and useless for exploration could easily be applied to Hyrule Field in OoT. Sure it's big, but it's still empty! So are TP and SS's overworlds (I have yet to fully beat MM, so I'll refrain from commenting on that). In WW, there are also tons of islands throughout the world for you to explore. To address your complaint about the Red Lion only letting you go from point A to point B, why? What about him means you can't explore? Either you just didn't care or didn't want to take three seconds of your time to use the wind waker to change the winds. There's PLENTY to do on the sea."
truezelda,2q3jdd,missussexbang49,1 point,Tue Dec 23 17:15:57 2014 UTC,"The difficulty level for Wind Waker is great for casual gamers, the puzzles aren't too difficult and the battle mechanics make it relatively simple to defeat enemies easily especially with the special ""A"" button action.   I personally LOVE the art style. I prefer games that don't really take themselves too seriously, they take steps in new directions and aren't afraid to expand their horizons.   I love the story and the drive of Wind Waker. From the very beginning of the game you have a goal to save Aryll, as you progress to save her you learn that way deeper shit is going down. After you actually save Aryll you know that you can't just leave the world to be at the hands of Ganondorf and your motivation intensifies from not just saving your sister but the whole world.   I agree in the dungeon department. I wish there were more or at least longer, but what can you do?  I really enjoyed the characters. I LOVE the Koroks and the Rito tribe and the human characters were enjoyable for me as well.  The enemies ARE weak and lacking in the difficulty level.   Ganon's Tower is just obnoxious and boring, imo. I really dislike Ganon's Tower to the final battle but the credits and music make up for it.   I LOVED sailing on the sea. I love the ocean and wide open water and just the thought of exploring this massive sea enthralls me.   Wind Waker is my second favorite installment in the series (second to Majora's Mask) because in my opinion it's one of the cleanest, finely polished and revolutionary game in the franchise, but that's just me. c:"
truezelda,2q3jdd,Gene_P00le,1 point,Tue Dec 23 17:22:21 2014 UTC,"You know, when I first played wind waker, I had similar complaints, particularly about ocean travel.  With time, WW has grown on me, to the point that it is now my favourite of all the zeldas.   The art style makes it a lot more timeless, even on the Gamecube, it still looks better than most other Zeldas, since it's aiming for an animated style, you don't need to worry about polygons looking dated. The only other game that I would say has kept its charm, visually, would be Link To The Past, and for similar reasons I feel. Mentioned elsewhere, there is a ton of character development. The world might not be as full, but who it is populated with has depth. Ganondorf in this incarnation feels more real as a character than any of his other appearances. I feel this leads to a better story, and a better experience. There is a lot of ocean, but there are so many places to explore. Remember when you were playing Twilight Princess, and you found that rail you could ride up on the Spinner, and you had to repeatedly try to get up there, because you had to know what was there? every square on the map has one of those moments, along with the hidden squids that you have to battle without any preparation. It's that sense of discovery that is the core of Zelda games, and why I yell at people for using a guide the first play through. That exploration and wonder is the whole point of the legend of zelda, and something that is lost in a lot of newer zelda games (cough skywardsword cough). Even OoT only had small holes that could be bombed that weren't on the map that didn't have much in them at all, but Wind Waker is chock full of stuff that you don't have to do, but is sure fun to discover on your own.   And I think that's why some dislike it. If you're rushing through it, trying to stop ganondorf, you're going to miss out on a lot. Zelda isn't meant to be on rails, and it's a shame when people limit it to such a thing themselves, and then complain that there isn't enough to keep them interested."
truezelda,2q3jdd,ScrdMnkyDst,1 point,Sat Dec 27 19:47:26 2014 UTC,"You say there's a lack of dungeons in the game but it has the same amount of main dungeons as Skyward Sword, with 7. It also has 3 more main dungeons than Majora's Mask."
truezelda,2q3jdd,Dittorita,2,Mon Dec 22 22:17:19 2014 UTC,"7? Maybe if you count forsaken fortress and Ganons tower as main dungeons, but to me they just feel like a tutorial and a large final battle."
truezelda,2q3jdd,TheHynusofTime,3,Tue Dec 23 01:24:06 2014 UTC,"I think it's fair to count the Forsaken Fortress as a dungeon. It has a dungeon map, an item needed to progress (the skull hammer), and a boss fight, complete with a heart container at the end."

truezelda,2q3jdd,Epicfaillord,1 point,Tue Dec 23 01:30:16 2014 UTC,"Its think you need to play TP. Many of the things you have issues with (other than an empty world, I have no idea where that came from) are focused on rather than being things there for the sake of being there. Which version are you playing? In WWHD the world feels more filled, mostly due to fast travel. Seriously though. Did you just expect to be able to swim everywhere with islands two feet apart? The fact is oceans are pretty empty. In real ocean there aren't random islands every quarter of a mile (the situation in WW).  About the characters, all of the characters in OoT were OMG YOU SAVED ME or DO THIS FOR ME, with a few exceptions. In wind waker, the exception is the rule. Pretty much every single character has a highly interesting personality and back story, including every single one of the pirates and even a MOBLIN. The amount of love and care Nintendo put into making every character seem like a real person is astounding, and at that time a series first. This continues and is improved in TP and skyward sword, both of which I would play for their stories alone.  Um, ""lack of dungeons""!??! Bullshit. This is a Zelda game dude.  If its too easy try hero mode on the HD version. Pretty hard.  The final dungeon had exceptional storytelling. The atmosphere is perfect for the situation in that game. Just look at ganondorfs personality.  About the art style, miyamoto himself stated that the goal of the art style was to make the world feel like you were an energetic 12 year old. In other words, it was designed to add to the immersion.  Your issue here is that you went in expecting it to be a OoT two. This is Nintendo we are talking about. Literally the biggest collection of hipsters in the world. Nintendo never makes (insert name of Zelda game) twos. Zelda is about innovation while sticking to the same core concepts, and every few games even those core concepts are switched up.  In all I feel some of the dungeons could have been better, and the islands bigger, but otherwise I have no complaints."
truezelda,2q3jdd,mzupeman,1 point,Tue Dec 23 06:04:19 2014 UTC,"I'll disagree.  There is a distinct lack of dungeons.  Honestly, the tower which you're supposed to sneak around in, and more than once at that, doesn't really qualify as a 'dungeon', in my mind.  But, really, most standard Zelda games have about 8 dungeons.  Wind Waker overall had 4.  They were really really impressive and huge and all, but there were 4.  There were supposed to be 2 more, I think, but there wasn't enough time to have them implemented."
truezelda,2q3jdd,Epicfaillord,1 point,Tue Dec 23 13:36:58 2014 UTC,There are seven dungeons. In order:  Dragon roost cavern  Forbidden woods  Tower of the gods  Forsaken fortress  Earth temple(best one by far)  Wind temple  Canon's tower
truezelda,2q3jdd,mzupeman,1 point,Tue Dec 23 14:15:58 2014 UTC,"Technically you're correct.  Still, I'm not really buying 'Forsaken Fortress' as a 'dungeon'... even if it is considered one.  Ganon's Tower was basically getting inside to one large room and then going through each of the doors and beating the bosses you had already tackled before.  Then you have to tackle the shadow Ganon and whatnot.  To me, it just felt like a mish-mash of stuff we've already done, as opposed to a typical 'dungeon'.  For some reason, I was misremember Tower of the Gods, and I would classify that as a 'dungeon', so that ups my personal revision number up to 5.  Of course, Majora's Mask had only had four, for sure... but that game was a different beast entirely."
truezelda,2q3jdd,Epicfaillord,1 point,Tue Dec 23 14:29:48 2014 UTC,Forsaken fortress had an item and a boss which included a heart container. Definitely a dungeon.

Mostly true, but LoZ: A Link Between Worlds is basically a direct sequel to Link to the Past, and the gameplay was largely the same.  A couple new mechanics made the world seem fresh again - but I think calling it ""Link to the Past 2"" is pretty reasonable.  (In comparison, Majora's Mask was a direct sequel to OoT - but calling it ""OoT 2"" ignores the fundamentally different gameplay, so I think your statement holds there as it does for most of the series.)"
truezelda,2q3jdd,TheHynusofTime,-1,Sat Dec 27 01:33:05 2014 UTC,"Nintendo never makes (insert name of Zelda game) twos.   Going off of your first sentence, I think you need to play Twilight Princess.

truezelda,2q3jdd,Epicfaillord,3,Tue Dec 23 15:48:17 2014 UTC,It wasn't ocarina of time two. The two game are so far apart in quality the it isn't fair to do that.  Either way good point.

Miyamoto: One of the main things we wanted to do was go back to the open-world concept of the original ""Zelda"" games and design with that in mind. That's really the direction the team is going in. This time, we've brought back Link's horse, Epona, and his bow and arrow, but what we've decided is really fun is being able to freely walk around in this world and choose what you want to do and how you want to explore. I can't talk much about it, but one of the things we're working on right now is that, as you play, the world will change and be affected by what you choose to do.   Hmm. Just this one vague comment brings lots of interesting ideas to mind. Aonuma said a while back that he would like to one day make a game with a story crafted by the player. And I wonder if more dangerous enemies will appear throughout the world as you finish dungeons, as has been commonly suggested in discussions about difficulty scaling."

For me this would defeat one of the great satisfactions that comes from A-RPG's for me... when you encounter a monster/area where you are totally outmatched, then go fight your way to some upgrades, and then return and kick total ass.  If overworld monsters are constantly recalibrated to your abilities, I feel like that would become pretty rote pretty quickly."

I guess they could have tougher enemies harder to kill and require a stronger sword or something.

Nintendo doesnt really have a track record of allowing the hype train to fly off the rails without a conductor like some other publishers. I imagine if the game wasnt going to be similar in play to TES then we would have more footage to curb the hype a little. Instead they stoke the flames and hype us up even more.  This is going to be Aonuma and Miyamoto's magnum opus.  I cant way for ""The Zelda Scrolls I: Hyrim""  I do think this game is for the most part going to be the original zelda completly overhauled."
truezelda,2pomsj,Charlemagne712,3,Thu Dec 18 14:54:44 2014 UTC,"I have to agree.  Miyamoto and Aonuma aren't the kind of people to go about making appearances on various mediums without there being substance to back up what they say.  And the fact that they're not being flashy about it (showing five minutes of casual gameplay at the Game Awards instead of a two minute action-packed pre-rendered trailer, going on a YouTube celebrity's channel (I have no clue who the hell this girl is), etc.) gives me hope."

They arent profit driven in the least. Theirs is a labor of love and it shines through in everything they do.   This was pointed out to me by a friend: microsoft is a software company, sony is an entertainment conglomerate,  nintendo makes games. Thats all they do. They might not be at the bleeding edge of graphics and technology,  but more than sony or microsoft, nintendo games are always fun, they are always beautifully designed, and always leave me feeling justified in buying their product."
truezelda,2pomsj,WamBamsWorld,6,Thu Dec 18 15:20:13 2014 UTC,I mean. They're profit-driven. They're just old-school in their methods. They're playing the long game - a two minute trailer that features no actual game play but gets people amped will only work to disguise bland gameplay/graphics/plot/etc. for so long. A demo of the game shows much more confidence in the product and builds up audience trust (rather than just hype).
truezelda,2pomsj,Charlemagne712,5,Thu Dec 18 18:42:26 2014 UTC,"They arent profit driven. They are product driven.

truezelda,2pomsj,RashAttack,4,Thu Dec 18 18:57:52 2014 UTC,"I'd say that they're a little of both, with much more focus on product over profit.  It definitely helps that they have a bajillion monies saved up from the success known as the Wii, so it's a lot easier to sit back and play the long game.  With Ubisoft and Activision and Rockstar, they can make some fun and innovative things, but you typically see the same old recycled things from them 90% of the time because males ages 13 to 21 are going to eat up whatever their next game is, regardless of the quality."

I feel as though they got a bit greedy with the success of the Wii and tried emulating that success with the Wii U, but unfortunately for them that didn't happen. Fortunately for us though, that means Nintendo is working extra hard this generation, and we've been getting excellent games. Super Mario 3D World is one of the best Mario games ever. Super Smash Bros Wii U is arguably the best Smash Bros game in terms of the amount of content in the game. Mario Kart 8 is pretty damn fantastic and has some of the best value DLC around. Bayonetta 2 is critically acclaimed. If their track record for Wii U software tells us anything, it's that Zelda U may end up being one of the best Zeldas ever."

I was keeping my expectations low - that map in the teaser looks really big, but it also seems like they took a very roundabout route to get where they were going.  I will stick to my guess that it won't take more than an hour to cross the map from corner-to-corner on horseback - which is still a very healthy-sized map."

truezelda,2po4k8,elricofgrans,23,Thu Dec 18 09:38:04 2014 UTC,"In my opinion the game gets better and better as you progress. The later dungeons become more challenging, as i find tge first three really simple. If i were you i would at least play until after the third dungeon, after that the story really gets going."
truezelda,2po4k8,Darrionn,18,Thu Dec 18 09:48:20 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, OoT gets really good after you pull the Master Sword. I would say at least play through the Forest Temple (fourth dungeon) before deciding to keep playing or not.  EDIT: Also, OoT just might not be your favorite, and that's okay. It's not my favorite, either. Just find what you like, each game is a bit different than the others."
truezelda,2po4k8,Foyet,7,Thu Dec 18 13:58:32 2014 UTC,"/u/Foyet hit this on the head. The depth of the game doesn't start until you pull the master sword. (Which is one of my favorite cinematics in the 3D era of LoZ. Although,  I would say that OOT is not the best game to start with. If you are hell bent on starting with a 3D then I recommend WW or SS. TP is too vague and you wouldn't benefit from the story without a good understanding of the OOT story (not knocking TP, I love the need for the player to draw logical conclusions to piece together the story). WW is has a good story and the game play is ever-engaging. SS is the first game in the timeline so logically it would benefit you to play through it."
truezelda,2po4k8,Tamarocker90,4,Thu Dec 18 14:29:41 2014 UTC,"I agree with you, SS is a good game to start with. It's easier, it has a clear, well developed story, and it's the first in the timeline.  I may be a bit biased, though... Skyward Sword is one of my favorites"

I'm huge on the series as a whole, but I always lacked the motivation to play through all of Ocarina of Time for some reason (I love the first half of the game, but once I get to the Forest Temple/first dungeon of the second half I just stop..caring and put the game away for a while before I repeat this process) I didn't play it until quite a while after its release, like you, and for some reason it always felt like it's the most ""Zelda-y"" game and lacking at the same time to me personally."
truezelda,2po4k8,Tsurii897,4,Thu Dec 18 10:09:09 2014 UTC,"I'd say keep playing. At least clear 3 dungeons and go through the time skip. At that point you should know whether you want to keep playing or not. Ocarina of Time is not reflective of all Zelda games. Just the 3D ones (which are the minority). Try a 2D Zelda game to get the feel for those. Most people would suggest either Link to the Past or Link Between Worlds.   If your problem is with the story, go pick a different game entirely. Ocarina of Time is really just a showcase for the mechanics, which were groundbreaking at the time. The rest of the game is fairly lackluster, regardless of how amazing people make it seem. If you want a 3D title, I'd suggest Twilight Princess. Perhaps Wind Waker if you like sailing :P.  Either way, you might just not like the 3D entries, and would be better off playing the 2D games. I know I certainly like them more."

I would recommend trying A Link Between Worlds or maybe emulating Minish Cap. Maybe 3D Zelda games aren't for you. 2D and 3D are essentially the same, but are different enough.   But then again, you don't even have to play the games to be a Zelda fan. If the ideas and themes of Zelda intrigues you, but you don't enjoy the games, who cares. Read the manga, read the wiki. Maybe watch the show if you can handle it. Just do what you feel like doing."

Maybe you need to get used to it or something. Please try to get the first 3 stones and see what happens.. The story will unvold more and chances are higher you get interested enough to keep playing  The 4th dungeon is completely different than the first 3.. If you still don't like the game after that.. The game might not be for you. You could try a different title like A Link Between Worlds since the gameplay is completely different than OoT

Majora's Mask and Wind Waker are the best in the series imo."
truezelda,2po4k8,missussexbang49,2,Thu Dec 18 18:22:25 2014 UTC,"As most of the commenters here have said, OoT picks up a lot more once you finish the first act of the game. If I had to guess why you're not as captivated right off the bat, it would be because pretty much every game after OoT has drawn some style of gameplay from this, whether it be the targeting system, dialog boxes, inventory systems, etc. SO, OoT might seem a little bland at first. Not bad at all, but just not super flashy or as immediately enticing as current games.    That being said, the immersion of this game will definitely be a lot more real once you become Adult Link. Give it a little more time, and the sudden hugeness of the game should be enough to get you back into it."

I'd recommend pushing through on it as you sound quite similar to me, I had a similar problem with Wind Waker, I started it about 6 months ago and have been doing it for maybe 2 months then stopping for a while before coming back to it, I finished it a few hours ago and now I'd quite happily say it's one of my favourite games. Get to the end then make up your mind, I feel like Zelda games need to be viewed as a whole game, you can't base an opinion of the whole game on just the first two dungeons."

truezelda,2po4k8,ArtistCook,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"Ocarina of Time is easily the worst and least interesting of the 3D Zelda games, in my opinion.  Try some of the others, 2D included.  By best recommendation to hook you into the series and get the best feel for the ""standard"" would be A Link to the Past or Wind Waker.  Twilight Princess is also one of the most classically-styled ones in the series."
truezelda,2po4k8,Serbaayuu,3,Thu Dec 18 23:41:50 2014 UTC,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably correct.  When Ocarina came out, it was one of the best games of all time, and remained high up on those lists... heck, it still kind of does.  But a lot of that factoring is due to nostalgia at this point.    I think every Zelda game though in a 3D world has had its positives and negatives, though.  Wind Waker was rough because of all the sailing and sea exploration... it was fun, but it was overly long to a fault, especially later in the game when you HAVE to go fetch-questing in order to obtain what you need in order to progress.  Fortunately, Wind Waker HD fixed some of that by lessening how much of this item you needed to collect, as well as allowing you to get a super sail so you can get around faster.  Twilight Princess brought the series back to land exploration, sure, and while it was a great game and story, it was just a tad too bleak and dark to be as 'enjoyable' as some of the other games.  At times, Twilight Princess felt REALLY oppressive.  Skyward Sword I can't really comment on just yet, but a lot of people sort of blame it for being a bit too linear.    Things do pick up a bit more after the third dungeon, as someone else said... I would say once a major event happens which 'changes the game', so to speak, keep playing for a little bit, and if you're still not satisfied, then let Zelda 64 go... that's not to say you wouldn't enjoy one of the other titles, though."
truezelda,2po4k8,mzupeman,1 point,Fri Dec 19 16:29:01 2014 UTC,"Every 3D Zelda has done something better than Ocarina of Time did it.  Majora's Mask had better sidequests and a better item system.  It also made a lot of improvements to the same engine.  Wind Waker had better exploration and better sidequests.  Twilight Princess had better dungeon design, better horse mechanics, and better world secrets.  Skyward Sword had better combat, a better story, better characters, and better music & art.  Ocarina of Time did most everything pretty well (which can't be said for most other games in the series) but it is not the best at any one thing compared to any other Zelda game."
truezelda,2po4k8,Serbaayuu,2,Fri Dec 19 23:24:53 2014 UTC,"That's probably the best way to describe it.  I played it a bunch back in the day, played it via emulation some time ago, but recently played it 'for the first time' in 3D on the Nintendo 3DS.  It was quite a fun ride, but a lot of the flaws of the time really do stand out quite a bit.

truezelda,2phxcl,Ginger_Shepherd,16,Tue Dec 16 19:30:37 2014 UTC,"While I agree with your points and think that including a map like that would be awesome, it should be noted that there's a fair difference between giving you a map with potential points of interest vs handholding.  Skyward Sword had its strengths and I enjoyed it overall, but man it held your hand. The game will show you something, and then you're like ""Okay, I'll go do that."" A second later, Fi pops up and says, ""Sir, there's a 95% chance that you need to go do that."" If I remember right, at one point you meet someone, he tells you his name, and Fi shows up a second later saying, ""Sir, there's a 90% chance this is [name]."" Like... okay?  So I don't think that providing an in-game map to the original LoZ would be considered handholding. It would actually be pretty cool. You get a map, and then you say, ""I want to go there, to that dungeon."" The game doesn't provide a Fi that, right after you put down your map, pops up and says ""Sir, there's an 80% chance that the huge 1 is the first place you need to go."" And then again, when you get there, ""Sir, there's a 95% chance that we have arrived. There's the door.""  That's what people generally mean when they talk about handholding in Skyward Sword vs older generations of games. It shows you what to do, then tells you what to do, and then tells you again.  I often find that a map will inspire a sense of exploration in me. I think, ""Oh, I want to go there!"" or ""I wonder what that question mark might be?"""
truezelda,2phxcl,mrdaneeyul,7,Tue Dec 16 21:43:10 2014 UTC,"To make it even worse, the game repeats the same handholding in hero mode. Why? Hero mode isn't a separate mode you select when starting a new save file (such as in A Link Between Worlds), it's directly tied to your already beaten normal mode save file. Hence, the person playing hero mode has (at least as the game's design intends) already beaten the game once. SO why bother them with all the handholding again?  I remember when I played hero mode, I avoided using the heart medal, to make the game a bit tougher for myself. However, at some point, I picked up a heart medal in one of the goddess chests, and was on my way to deposit it at item check. On the way, I accidentally walked into a heart flower in Skyloft... and a text box appeared EXPLAINING what a heart does.  Keep in mind that this was at least halfway through my Hero mode playthrough. I wanted to throw something so badly."
truezelda,2phxcl,xwatchmanx,2,Tue Dec 16 22:37:14 2014 UTC,It's probably just a matter of time/difficulty in coding all of those prompts to not appear during Hero mode. Or just laziness.
truezelda,2phxcl,StormyWaters2021,5,Tue Dec 16 23:32:15 2014 UTC,"I'm not a coder by any means, but I find it hard to imagine that would take any real amount of time. At the very least, they could've added a skip option to every dialogue. Surely that wouldn't take any real effort.  And that's the other thing: Why is it that story-important cut scenes can be skipped, but a lot of Fi's tutorial dialogue can't be? This makes no sense, especially since SOME of it can be skipped, but not all of it."
truezelda,2phxcl,xwatchmanx,7,Wed Dec 17 00:04:54 2014 UTC,"As a developer, it would be extremely easy to implement the ability to skip cut-scenes.  During those scenes all the game has to do is ""listen"" for a button to be pressed, probably A (or I think 2 in SS), and that would kick it out of the PlayThisCutScene() method and on to the next block of code.  As for the comment above from /u/StormyWaters2021, that's just as easy.  For all of the ""this is a rupee"", ""here are how hearts work"", and ""look, your 1,000th piece of amber!  let me tell you about it"" interruptions, all they would need to do is give you the choice to have hints on or off and tie that decision to a variable- i.e. stupidHints = 1 if you want them, and stupidHints = 0 if you don't want them.  Everytime it gets to a point where you'd see that message, the game checks to see what stupidHints is set to and skips the message if it's set to 0."

But you have to do it while the prompt remains on screen for it to skip."
truezelda,2phxcl,xwatchmanx,0,Wed Dec 17 03:18:02 2014 UTC,"This would not be hard.

truezelda,2phxcl,Crim_drakenya,2,Wed Dec 17 08:14:52 2014 UTC,"Well in that case, deep down I'm on the same page. I wasn't sure how people would react and where they draw the line but it is right there in the phrase: hand holding.  Not ""follow me"" or ""go here"" or ""you need to do this""  but instead like early childhood scaffolding where you help a kid put a 4 piece jigsaw puzzle together by literally holding their fucking hands."
truezelda,2phxcl,mrdaneeyul,4,Tue Dec 16 23:06:16 2014 UTC,"That's it exactly. And when people talk about handholding in Zelda, I'm 90% (heh) certain that's what they're actually reacting to.  (That said, yes, I saw that other thread, and it seems like the line is being drawn in varying places... but I personally don't feel that Navi was holding anyone's hand. It's been a while though.)  Good news is that providing that map wouldn't be handholding as per that definition. It would certainly make the game easier, but as I mentioned, a map inspires exploration. As opposed to, if the game is always telling you exactly what to do and how to do it, that's not inspiring... that's just annoying."
truezelda,2phxcl,Serbaayuu,-5,Tue Dec 16 23:12:18 2014 UTC,"""Sir, there's a 90% chance this is [name]."" Like... okay?   Sorry, how is that hand-holding?  That's not hand-holding at all, and it really bothers me when people say it is.  That's pointing out the obvious.  ""Master, we should probably pull that giant red lever which is one of the only interactable things in the room"" is not hand-holding, it's pointing out the obvious.  Fi does this because, as a character, that's her job.  And in my experience, she does it in a way that does not spoil any puzzles or riddles or anything throughout the game."
truezelda,2phxcl,mrdaneeyul,8,Tue Dec 16 22:01:41 2014 UTC,"I would consider pointing out the obvious--something the game just showed you--to be holding your hand.

For example - it would have been excellent if Fi told me I could stab those water-fruits in the Fire Sanctuary to get them on my sword.  And there's a good reason she directs you to the air vent on the Sandship for the main Timeshift Stone (especially since many people might not expect to be able to interact with the outdoors of a dungeon while inside)."

truezelda,2phxcl,23saround,3,Wed Dec 17 01:27:21 2014 UTC,"I'm playing through right now (just getting to the second temple in the Eldin region).  The Fi interruptions are numerous at the start of the game, while you're still in Skyloft and while you are working towards the first temple.  For example, you put a tablet in the room under the goddess statue and a beam of light appears in the sky, which penetrates the clouds.  This all happens after you spend 5 minutes in a cut-scene with Gaepora and Fi explaining the legend passed down through Gaepora's family and Fi's account of what the prophesy really is, all pertaining to traveling to the Surface and saving Zelda.  And after all of that, instead of the game allowing you to go and check out what the green pillar of light is (which there's a 97% chance players could figure out what it means), Fi pops up out of the sword all ""Hey there dumbass, I don't know if you understand how eyesight works, but there's a giant pillar of light in the sky now.  It breaks through the clouds.  Hey, remember that Surface place we talked about?  I bet if you go over to the large pillar of light, which is green, you can get to the Surface.""   (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  However, after you get going on the temples, she's less of a hindrance and the game lets you make some observations yourself.  She's more predominant at the end of the temples when you reach the springs and she dances around reciting some other prophesies or something, which makes more sense for her character."

truezelda,2phxcl,jdaniel5894,2,Wed Dec 17 01:13:57 2014 UTC,"yup, same here. no maps, just word of mouth or trial and error (lots of error). and the same thing with the NES metroid. started both of those games when i was probably 8 or 9 and didnt actually beat either of them until i was in my early teens. i'd have friends over and we'd take turns playing, trying out different ideas of where a boss or dungeon or secret item might be, starting over, getting horribly frustrated, but going back at it because it was all so much fun.   then the moment of actually getting to Ganon, or the Mother Brain, was such a huge high! and of course you'd get destroyed, but then you'd go back with a new strategy and maybe beat the boss after a few tries. it really and truly wasn't just about beating the game; it sounds corny but it really was about the adventure of it all."
truezelda,2phxcl,mrdaneeyul,8,Tue Dec 16 22:18:25 2014 UTC,"I found the original Zelda game, with the exception of finding one of the dungeons, to be relatively easy with the map. I replayed all of the games with some friends in college and even though I had lost the map, none of us had any issues with completing the game because we were patient, searched for dungeons, and created our own map on grid paper as we went. I believe the reason most people nowadays find the original Zelda game to be difficult is because games are too easy now. In new games you are given a detailed map, and NPCs are constantly pointing you in the correct direction. It is almost impossible to get lost in one of the new Zelda games because there is only one logical way to go. This is not to say that younger gamers are necessarily less intelligent than older gamers, but that new games don't require people to think, and so younger gamers don't have the patience and find older games to require too much work. This is all simply my opinion from watching my younger cousins and friends attempt to play games from my generation, and my parents generation I played growing up.      Edit: For example, one of my younger cousins believed the only possible way to beat Myst was with a guide. He thought I was lying when I told him I had to win it completely on my own the first time, and take notes to figure out what to do next."

truezelda,2phxcl,mrdaneeyul,1 point,Tue Dec 16 22:21:32 2014 UTC,"Hey, puzzle adventures are my jam!  That level of puzzling in games was a factor that polarized very early on in gaming history and by the 90s games that contained that kind of gameplay tended to focus solely on that aspect of it and games of other genres seldom dabbled in it at all.  That left us with inventory-based and noninventory-based puzzle adventures as the sole options for this type of gamer and, sadly, both genres kind of stagnated while other genres exploded.  There were a few quality inventory-based titles after the turn of the century that are certainly worth playing but the already small pool of adventure games was largely diluted by a wave of abject crap that certain publishers are guilty of throwing at the world. Noninventory based adventures were almost ubiquitously horrible except for the Myst series which gave a pretty solid showing in a dark time.  These days, we rely on and look to Telltale games for episodic, inventory-based puzzle adventures. The often do a very good job and pay good enough attention to puzzle novelty and story telling.  It's a true shame because the paragons of the genre always reached incredible acclaim but it wasn't matched by commercial success when compared platformers, fighters and, eventually, fpsers.  We were niche and we were ultimately neglected for larger profit as the gaming industry went full-on modern entertainment industry.  It gets more and more depressing as time goes on and it gets harder and harder to play my classic titles on evolving PC technology...But they're still gold! They stand up to the tests of time!

My dad got our copy of the game from a Goodwill, and it didn't include a map or an instruction manual. I pushed every rock from every side, activated every statue. I dropped a bomb on the lines between rock wall tiles and attempted to torch every tree, two at a time.  I found every heart piece, played every gambling game, and paid to repair every broken door.  It took more patience to beat this game and find its secrets than just about anything out there (except maybe Final Fantasy, another game we didn't have a manual for) but every upgrade, from tunic color changes to stronger swords, was ridiculously rewarding. Nothing beats the feeling of getting ghosts out of every grave while you search for the secret, to the point that they slow the game down because there's so many of them on screen.  The feeling has faded more and more as the franchise grows older. I've never been able to recapture the feeling of exploring Hyrule, at least not since LttP and the N64 games. The hand holding certainly played a part in this - figuring out a secret by accident or through diligent searching used to mean something. If you couldn't find someone you'd have to ask your friend's big brother. Now, everything is set out in front of us. Collectibles glow brighter or make a sound as you get close. The treasures aren't in the ocean until you find the map, in which case you're told exactly where to look (but to be fair, nobody would be expected to blindly search the entire ocean for treasures)."
truezelda,2phxcl,pdelponte,2,Wed Dec 17 00:17:19 2014 UTC,"This. (Another old fart here. I played it on the NES when I was 9 or so.)  Even the included map wasn't actually all that useful. It was great to get you started, but what it mainly did was to guide you to the first and second dungeons.  After you beat those you basically had learned all that you needed to get through the rest of game.  And apart from the stuff you discover by bombing all the walls, the secrets aren't actually that devishly hidden. Most places stand out a bit from the surroundings, at least enough to make you certain that it's probably more likely to find something here than in a different, more generic screen.  I pity anyone who played through this using a walkthrough and/or a complete map. It's impossible to experience what this game is about when doing that."

truezelda,2p5fgn,TheHynusofTime,6,Sat Dec 13 12:39:33 2014 UTC,"I always thought of it this way. The reason you have a fallen timeline in ocarina and not necessarily the other games is due to the fact that ocarina marks the first time the three major people selected by the triforce (link, zelda, ganondorf) come together. At the end of this event you are left with three distinct timelines each corresponding to a different member of this trio. The link victorious and sent to the past is links timeline, link victorious and time marches on with him absent is zelda's timeline, and link defeated is ganondorf's timeline. The triforce is very powerful, deals in threes and each one of the trio has been affected by a portion of it. Combine that with all the time bending going on in the game and it would make sense to me that the reason alternate universes result from this game and not the others is because of the very nature of the triforce, that it operates in 3s. Because it has been split between these 3 people it now needs three timelines to resolve itself and become one again.   or something like that"
truezelda,2p5fgn,jimmykimmell,4,Mon Dec 15 00:21:39 2014 UTC,"I think you're onto something with the Triforce causing the split, but I think the trigger is something slightly different from what you suggest.  Demise (the first incarnation of Ganon) met Zelda and Link in SS. Even if it's Ganondorf's first time meeting the other three, I think there's something else rather than just the three meeting. A more significant event I think is Ganondorf touching the Triforce; it was the first time the Triforce had been split. Considering the Triforce binds the world of Hyrule together, it's not a huge leap to imagine that splitting the Triforce would also split the timeline.  I pretty much agree with everything else you said; with each timeline corresponding to a different aspect of the Triforce and such. This is the first theory I've seen that actually feels like a satisfactory, lore-consistent (as far as Zelda lore is ever consistent) explanation for the Downfall timeline."
truezelda,2p5fgn,BlueHg,1 point,Mon Dec 15 01:58:49 2014 UTC,"Demise...met Zelda and Link in SS.   Adding to this, this is also where Demise (or at least part of him) joined with Ganondorf and got the Triforce of Power, so an object of divine might falling into the hands of a being of supreme evil? that's gonna shake a foundation or two as well."
truezelda,2p5fgn,CaptianZaco,2,Sun Dec 21 02:19:59 2014 UTC,"I hadn't thought of it like that before, but it seems like a great theory. Each timeline can also be characterized by its ""owner's"" piece. Link goes off to find Navi, and in doing so finds new courage in himself without the help of Zelda or any of the sages that he had before. Zelda's timeline is a world with peace, but the lack of ""courage"" leads to its downfall and eventual rebirth through the intervention and wisdom of the goddesses. Ganondorf's timeline demonstrates his seemingly unrelenting power, as he returns more times in this branch than any other."
truezelda,2p5fgn,grntplmr,2,Wed Dec 17 10:24:24 2014 UTC,What does Ganon's plan have to do with anything? Didn't Link just fall in battle against him?
truezelda,2p5fgn,AspiringRacecar,0,Sat Dec 13 11:39:58 2014 UTC,"Yes, but this post was pretty much an unneeded, hypothetical justification for the downfall split. It's essentially saying that the Hero of Time was the only one to lose against Ganondorf because Ganon's plan was so detailed and thought out that his chance of success in Ocarina of Time was much higher than in any other game."
truezelda,2p5fgn,TheHynusofTime,1 point,Sat Dec 13 13:52:23 2014 UTC,"Well, he did find the triforce in the sacred realm just seven years prior to the fight, so he could have made a wish or something before the triforce split. Difference from ALttP being twofold, maybe threefold: A. He didn't have the Triforce of Power in the final fight, B. there was a longer period of time to figure out how to defeat him, and C. the battle takes place in the sacred realm, so the triforce could possibly empower both equally."

truezelda,2p5fgn,Serbaayuu,1 point,Wed Dec 17 04:45:13 2014 UTC,"I concur.  Time travel at the timeline split works differently than time travel in the entire rest of the series.  Link goes back and forth in OoT within a single timeline.  He goes back and forth in OoA within a single timeline.  He goes back and forth in Skyward Sword within a single timeline.  Termina resets every time, but as of yet there has been nothing to suggest that any splits were actually created.  The only time it's different are:  A) When Zelda sends him back to a separate timeline  B) When the timeline splits when he dies for an unknown reason  The reason for the first one likely has something to do with Zelda's power.  The reason for the second one is unknown but there are theories for why it happened.  But I can say with assurance that it's not because time travel causes infinite universes to spring up.  Also, the infinite universes theory is ridiculous in my opinion because it means there's a universe where Link runs around in circles on Hyrule Field for 60 hours before dying to a stalchild."
truezelda,2p5fgn,Phoxxent,3,Sat Dec 13 15:14:21 2014 UTC,you mean you haven't run around hyrule field for 60 hours after leaving the forest and died to a stalchild?

truezelda,2ovh71,wood_and_nails,11,Wed Dec 10 20:20:40 2014 UTC,"Doesn't necessarily need to be use the real world clock to calculate in-game time though, a day could be 4 hours of in-game time.

I bet time will be dynamic, but I doubt a 1:1 ratio.  The other shots were probably taken at a fixed period in the day.  Judging by the dynamic lighting, I did not notice time shifting very much during the trailer.  I bet they stopped the clock.  As for some of your other thoughts, having a night period will definitely be in the game and it could be really awesome.  Some good ideas there."
truezelda,2ovh71,DaleLeatherwood,4,Wed Dec 10 16:26:10 2014 UTC,Yeah I doubt it will be 1:1 as that would make some times of the game almost impossible to see for the average gamer. Perhaps something like 3H in game = 1H in real life or something. That would be cool.
truezelda,2ovh71,RezicG,3,Wed Dec 10 16:28:19 2014 UTC,"Well, they could do 1:1 and give Link the power to change time, maybe through a song as in previous games.

truezelda,2ovh71,cereal_bawks,6,Wed Dec 10 16:35:38 2014 UTC,"I hope it won't be more than an hour per 24 hours ingame. I'm pretty sure the timer in the game is just showing the Wii U time so you can keep an eye on how long you've been playing, seeing as there is a battery meter there as well."
truezelda,2ovh71,wood_and_nails,2,Wed Dec 10 16:22:36 2014 UTC,"It could be like Xenoblade's time mechanism. A full day is less than an hour.   Also, 1900 is 7:00 pm, so it fits with the sunset. I think it's more likely that the gamepad clock was showing the ingame time."
truezelda,2ovh71,RezicG,4,Thu Dec 11 02:51:52 2014 UTC,An hour per 24 hours doesn't seem likely considering how little the sun moved. Also it seems like you wouldn't be able to appreciate the day night cycle in such a short period.  Maybe 3h day and 2H night or something.
truezelda,2ovh71,henryuuk,3,Wed Dec 10 16:26:27 2014 UTC,"In MM, one day in game was 18 minutes IRL, and there was plenty of time to appreciate the day/night cycle there.  OoT was even shorter and it worked for the few things you needed to do during day/night specifically."
truezelda,2ovh71,Ruairi101,2,Wed Dec 10 20:23:05 2014 UTC,"It annoyed me in OOT how quickly it changed. It just seemed odd.  MM's wouldn't be too bad providing I can slow down/speed it up as necessary, but i'd prefer longer with the ability to slow down speed up."
truezelda,2ovh71,Ruairi101,2,Thu Dec 11 08:46:43 2014 UTC,"If it's more than an hour there would have to be some way to change the time of day. In TP when looking for ghosts the fact that i couldn't change the time was infuriating when I had to wait for the time to change into nighttime.   I don't know how long TP's 24 hour cycle is though, so I'm going to have to say that if it's longer or the same as that then there has to be a way to change the time of day."
truezelda,2ovh71,Serbaayuu,2,Wed Dec 10 16:37:02 2014 UTC,You say that as if the developers could have easily just paused the time.
truezelda,2ovh71,MajorasAss,2,Wed Dec 10 19:25:56 2014 UTC,The gameplay we saw was likely the result of a lot of demo driven development. They might not have even sorted the day/night cycle yet. I'm sure they just paused the time in game for the demo.
truezelda,2ovh71,ThePhantomJames,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:15:30 2014 UTC,"Its possible, but still. What do you think the time will be like in game?"
truezelda,2ovh71,ThePhantomJames,1 point,Thu Dec 11 08:40:34 2014 UTC,"I like the sound of 4 hour cycles with an in-game mechanic for changing the time (think Sun's Song, Song of Double Time etc.)   Hard to know how it'll work at this point though. Completely depends on gameplay. For example, Majora's Mask had a lot of time dependant content and required a continuous time system with a long cycle. Skyward Sword on the other hand was discrete (day or night, pick one) and only in one location, and very little content required a specific time of day.  I'd say a long, continuous cycle is likely. There's obviously an emphasis on travelling long distances and it would be a bit rubbish if either the sun didn't move when you were traveling or if you couldn't go anywhere without two or three in-game cycles.  TL;DR: long cycles (4 hours or so),  continuous"
truezelda,2ovh71,wood_and_nails,1 point,Thu Dec 11 09:17:12 2014 UTC,Nah should be one day one hour
truezelda,2ovh71,ThePhantomJames,2,Wed Dec 17 03:54:50 2014 UTC,I'd say two hours = one day minimum for me so like half hour = 6 hours. Would work for me.  Though i'd really like a seasonal thing
truezelda,2ovh71,wood_and_nails,1 point,Wed Dec 17 08:11:00 2014 UTC,I hope it is at least 2 hours = full day/night cycle.
truezelda,2ovh71,Phoxxent,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:37:46 2014 UTC,"Ideally, for every hour that passes irl, two should pass in game.  I would love seasons like OOS and dynamic weather like WW"
truezelda,2ovh71,ThePhantomJames,0,Fri Dec 12 16:05:05 2014 UTC,"I would be okay with 24H=24H as long as they don't have certain events or quests that can only happen at a certain time. That would be really bad game design and I doubt they would do that, but you never know.   As for seasons, I really hope not. With the exception of Majora's Mask (and  Twilight Princess to a lesser extent) Zelda games are always ""summer games"" to me. One of my greatest joys is the ability to pop in Wind Waker or Ocarina of Time on a cold winter morning and go off on a summery adventure. I don't want to pop this one in and be greeted with snow on Hyrule field. Especially since it's probably going to get a late Autumn/Early Winter release."
truezelda,2ovh71,Gene_P00le,3,Thu Dec 11 01:34:25 2014 UTC,I don't know. Snow in hyrule to me would be kind of cool. Imagine some of that landscape covered in snow. Would look so beautiful
truezelda,2oslhm,MrDrumline,27,Tue Dec 9 21:16:17 2014 UTC,"Forgot to mention in the title, but this is a cross post of mine from /r/zelda. I thought it would be worth reaching a large audience here as well!  So, many of us have been trying to decipher the scale and locations on the map for Zelda Wii U. NeoGAF user RagnarokX is on an excellent start with his post, which likens an area on the map (identified with a 1 on my image) as lake Hylia from Twilight Princess. /u/malaroo has also drawn the same conclusion, based on the similar shape of the lakes. Inspired, I decided to see how similar the two maps are.  As RagnarokX has posited, we'll put the Great Bridge of Hylia at Point 1. I used the north and south ends as a starting point for my map scale. In-game, Zelda U's map will be much bigger than Twilight Princess' map. It is certainly possible, however, that the size of Twilight Princess was both a hardware limitation and a design choice, and the geography for the purpose of lore is at 1:1 with Zelda U's scale. The geography is all there, just... denser. So I stretched it to fit.  I'm actually very surprised! The maps fit quite nicely, at several key points:   Here we have Twilight Princess' Lake Hylia. The Great Bridge of Hylia stretches nicely from the north to south of the lake, and the actual shape of the lake is extremely similar, as /u/malaroo points out. Up here we have another lake. This isn't in Twilight Princess per se, but the Bridge of Eldin is, and with the scale we set nicely earlier, it stretches almost perfectly from north to south across the river. I think it's safe to say that the scale we have now is good. In the Twilight Princess map, we DO have a river. The lake is never seen in Twilight Princess and is partially river and partially black on the map. Between the two we have the river connecting Lake Hylia and the Bridge of Eldin. It follows the same course as a river on the Wii U map. Not the river north of where Castle Town is, the partial river to the east of it. It may be that these two games are set very far apart from each other temporally. Perhaps enough time for the course of the river to change such that the western river dries up and flows to the east, eventually filling in the river we see in Twilight Princess. With the western river dry, we now have room for Twilight Princess' Castle Town to fit snugly in the map. The river north leading to Zora's Domain matches the Wii U river quite precisely, leading to Zora's Domain. In the Wii U version this is a fork in the river, a crossroads of waterways in the center of the map - a prime location for a Zora kingdom. The river leading around to the Bridge of Eldin is a little wonky, but perhaps its shape changes between Zelda U and Twilight Princess to match what we see here. The enlarged hump on this river in Twilight Princess is also present in Zelda U. Things get wonky here. Nintendo has shown a propensity to change the location of geographical features a little, and I wouldn't put it past them to make the area between Lake Hylia and Gerudo Desert much larger to add to the large game world. We also don't get much sense of scale on the cannon ride to the desert, either. As such, I moved Gerudo Desert and found that the shape is... almost exactly the same. The hole is still unknown. Perhaps a vast desert sinkhole, to serve as a location for a dungeon? Again, I take it that Nintendo has fleshed out the world a little. As RagnarokX points out, this area is likely Death Mountain. I completely agree. The path to what appears to be the peak matches quite nicely with Twilight Princess' Death Mountain Trail after some rotation. Here we have Snowpeak. This one was iffy, as Twilight Princess took a very direct-cut path up a large mountain. The area may be completely different from Zelda U to Twilight Princess as snow drifts change and glaciers move. The appearance of a snowy mountain certainly seems to be present in the Wii U version and it's towards the same direction as Twilight Princess' Snowpeak, but again, fleshed out by Nintendo for a larger travel time in between. I aligned the frozen lake at Snowpeak with the small one on the Wii U map and rotated it accordingly. It appears that the larger lake is completely missing from Twilight Princess due to the blasting snow and rock walls. I feel justified in the rotations I made at Death Mountain, Snowpeak, and Gerudo Desert, as the terrain in these areas would change greatly due to their harsh climates. Lava, glacial drift, and desertification/erosion would all play roles, respectively.   Am I right? Maybe, maybe not. Probably not. But it does look pretty damn close, doesn't it?  If you've made it this far and appreciate the effort I've put in, I ask that you upvote my post so it reaches a larger audience. I don't particularly care about karma!  Ediit, further reading: I also found a fan made map that composites most of the maps from other Zelda games into one megamap, and it also looks quite similar. Could be worth a look.   Edit 2: For clarification, this is the Gamecube version of the map, the one considered to be canon of the two versions."
truezelda,2oslhm,SvenHudson,3,Tue Dec 9 21:16:45 2014 UTC,"Yes.  The entire world is mirrored in the Wii Version, including the map, and even all the signs with Hylian text on them.  The GCN version is the right way around."
truezelda,2oslhm,Dalfamurni,9,Thu Dec 11 16:10:30 2014 UTC,Death Mountain has a little skull-shaped lake right next to it. That's adorable.

truezelda,2osl1l,MartinGlow,9,Tue Dec 9 21:12:58 2014 UTC,"I'd like to point out the difference between ""theme,"" ""mood,"" and ""motif"" or ""element."" A theme is a statement – one might argue the central theme of WW is ""even the most innocent people will fight for what they love"" or ""people often show who they are when exposed to difficult situations."" A mood is an adjective describing the feeling of a story – for WW, it might be ""adventurous,"" ""daunting,"" or ""foreboding."" An element is an aspect or object of a story – in WW, some might be ""adventure,"" ""discovery,"" or ""loss."" A motif is simply a recurring element."
truezelda,2osl1l,23saround,8,Tue Dec 9 23:44:15 2014 UTC,I think it's safe to say that the theme of Wind Waker is adventure.

truezelda,2osl1l,pmatdacat,3,Wed Dec 10 14:50:30 2014 UTC,Maybe because he doesn't back up his statement.
truezelda,2osl1l,SvenHudson,1 point,Wed Dec 10 07:02:30 2014 UTC,"This is late, but I just saw it now. Sorry for any misunderstanding, but I thought it was clear. I didn't add more to my statement, or back it up, because I didn't think it was necessary. Sure there can be more themes, but the point of my comment was that the entire game is based around this theme of adventure, so it didn't seem arguable to me."
truezelda,2osl1l,a_link_to_the_passed,6,Mon Dec 15 14:34:14 2014 UTC,"I disagree. I think the theme of WW is loss   Kingdom lost under water for generations, hero of time lost and unable to save hyrule, link's loss of his sister and grandmother. It's almost completely about mourning a loss of something great. Even ganon pines for the greatness of hyrule that's passed"
truezelda,2osl1l,Gene_P00le,5,Tue Dec 9 22:41:37 2014 UTC,"Not just loss, but inability to move on and being stuck in the past.  Windwaker is ultimately a war between two old men who refuse to let their vision of Hyrule die. At the end, the King realized how futile hanging on to the past and told Link and Zelda not to make Hyrule all over again, but create a NEW world.   I feel like this theme was coincided really well with the artstyle, which may or may not be intentional. A lot of older Zelda fans were afraid of the new approach this game took, but it all turned out to be beautiful and amazing even though it was a total change."
truezelda,2osl1l,watereol,2,Wed Dec 10 04:11:13 2014 UTC,"Just on an unrelated note, I enjoyed WW but thought TP was a lot more fun when it came out. However, WW is proving to be timeless since then, I keep coming back to the gorgeous cel shading and involved storyline. I barely even remember SS , but the opening theme (the combined theme, what is that, hero of the wind?) still rings with me.   It may be ""Celda"", and it may be kiddy, but it's by far my favourite zelda, perhaps because of how timeless it is."
truezelda,2osl1l,Gene_P00le,5,Wed Dec 10 04:32:33 2014 UTC,"Those are some included aspects, but I'd say it's reaching to call to the overall theme. WW isn't a sad game about mourning. The open sea, the atmosphere, the music, demands for adventure."
truezelda,2osl1l,a_link_to_the_passed,3,Tue Dec 9 22:47:52 2014 UTC,"If that's the case, then the theme of every zelda game is adventure.   You need to look beyond the obvious.   Example: The Venture Bros is an animated show about adventure, and comedy, and pop culture references. The theme, however, is about failure. The main characters are all failures in life, the enemies are losers, everyone is in a slow downward spiral of failure.  Though one might state that the theme is adventure, because they go on adventure and fight glorious battles, the theme is failure.   I think loss is a great fit for the reasons provided previously. I think that, though adventure is certainly present in WW, it is present in all zelda games and the overarching theme is much deeper"
truezelda,2osl1l,Gene_P00le,1 point,Wed Dec 10 00:54:39 2014 UTC,"I don't see why you think a theme can't be obvious. I'm not saying your wrong and loss isn't a theme, but there can be multiple can there not? It's possibly I'm misunderstand, so please explain to me if I am, but why are you limiting this to a single ""deep"" theme. I don't see how adventure is not the theme. Yes, it plays a part in most of not all Zelda games, but I think most would agree that it's most prominent in WW. And even if it is in other Zelda games, why would that change the theme of the WW? It's irrelevant, is it not?"
truezelda,2osl1l,a_link_to_the_passed,2,Wed Dec 10 02:59:49 2014 UTC,"A more specific way of putting it would be ""Looking forward, not back"".  Looking out on the horizon and seeing a new island to discover, letting the wind carry you, not dwelling on what's behind you or what's in the past.  Ganon was someone who failed to look forward and could only look back.  In the first cutscene where Link leaves outset and looks back at his Grandma, Tetra gives him a wakeup call.  There's no more looking back, only forward.  Even the catapult scene is brilliantly thought out, as it represents Link being set on his course, with no room for second thoughts or doubts.  But it's not just letting the wind carry you blindly.  It's also about forging your own future, since you can control the wind with the windwaker.  There's a lot of really great narrative symbolism in Windwaker."
truezelda,2osl1l,SvenHudson,12,Fri Dec 12 01:02:57 2014 UTC,"Zelda 1: Wonder. You had a big world, lots of hidden secrets, little to no direction or railroading. You never knew where you'd find the next dungeon or cave and you never knew what would be in it. Being the first of its series, you didn't even have familiar tropes to fall back on, all of it was new.  Adventure of Link: Courage. Whereas Zelda 1 was a game about being delighted by surprises, Zelda 2 was a game about being dismayed by surprises. You get ambushed by monsters in the overworld, random townsfolk turn into monsters, even the little guys can get a cheap shot in and even getting to the next palace, let alone through it, is a long and grueling process. Whereas Zelda 1 would start you off at a level entrance when you died, Zelda 2 had a lives system and once you ran out you were sent to the beginning whether you were in a specific location or not which takes away even the tiny amount of generosity the original gave. But it's your job to stay motivated to finish.  Link to the Past: Purpose. In the first two games your goal was somewhat of an excuse for adventure: you're sent to save a princess and kill a monster and you know nothing about either of them. Link to the Past gave you reasons to move forward, though. First, we finally learn what the Triforce does and why it's imperative to prevent a bad guy from getting it. Second, we learn that we are of a special lineage with the ability and subsequently the duty to save the kingdom. Third, we see that the villain is doing actual harm in the introduction, how he straight up assassinated the king and imprisoned innocents. Fourth, we are given a personal motivation: your uncle was murdered and a bounty was put on your head. You actually meet with the princess and get to know her a little right at the beginning so you feel responsible for her once she gets kidnapped again later in. And, finally, you learn that you're straight up destined to save the world. So in this game, you're not doing it because you want to see what's around the next corner and you're not doing it to rise to the challenge, you're doing it because you HAVE to do it.  Link's Awakening: Sacrifice. In AoL you put yourself at risk and in LttP you experienced loss but in LA you were tasked with destroying everything and everyone you love for the greater good. The game spends its whole length building your affection for the island and its inhabitants, fucking expertly, and then tells you that your success will erase all of this from existence. But you still have to do it, because even though it means so much to you, it's ultimately a fantasy and of no value to anyone other than you and its continued existence means allowing yourself and a local deity to wither away and die in reality.  Ocarina of Time: Empowerment. You start as some friendless loser and right off the bat you lose the source of your social stigma by gaining a fairy companion, get summoned to save the life or your community's leader, and start killing giant monsters. You're the only member of your village who's allowed to leave it because you're that damn important. Suddenly everybody you meet starts wanting to be your friend, all the girls start falling for you. Lots of adults still laugh at you but the important ones immediately and unquestioningly respect you. Then you get the legendary sword and become a powerful adult. Suddenly you learn that you're a hero of prophecy and you're even stronger and now even the adults love and respect you. All the people who like you most turn out to be the most important people in the world, next to yourself, claiming to be adding their power to your own but their power is so inconsequential compared to your own that you don't even really see any difference and it really just seems to be a pretense for celebration of your every victory. (This may sound rather negative but the fact is that it works very effectively and the game is extremely enjoyable because, even though it's kind of pandering, it's really well done. Like Half-Life 2.)  Majora's Mask: Actual fucking heroism. You lost all of the power and respect you used to have, now you're just some stranger. The world's ending and it's so far beyond the scale of your abilities that you just pray for help and seek out the only beings powerful enough to avert it. Nobody sees your face anymore because you don't matter, they just see what you have on you. When you're a deku, they see a helpless child, when you're a human they see that you're carrying a sword, when you're a goron or zora they mistake you for other people. That owl who used to tell you to believe in yourself, now he tells you your quest is futile and you should just stop. You don't fight because you are meant to, you just got mixed up into somebody else's conflict and you're one of the only people in the world who's not in denial about what's at stake and nobody else will even try. The only allies you have are a psychotic merchant who barely lifts a finger to help you and a fairy who barely tolerates you and mostly just hangs around because your goal coincides with her own. But this game has the best narrative device in the entire series: the Fierce Deity's Mask. If you take the time and help everybody, all those people who don't give a shit about you and are caught up in their own problems, you earn their love and respect and having them at your back gives you enough power to make this world-ending abomination that you've spent the whole game under threat by into your bitch.  Oracle of Seasons/Ages: Total fluff. They're fine games, don't get me wrong, but they're utterly meaningless within the context of the rest of the series.  Wind Waker: Progress Letting go. The old world died. They grew obsessed with their magical superman and waited for him to save them and he didn't. But the older generations can't let go of the past; they try to shape you into that hero, dress you up like him and give you his role. Some even mistake you for him. The main villain is trying to bring back the old world but this desire is ultimately selfishness because what he really wants is to run the place, make everything like what he wants. But in the end your side finishes off the last remnants of Hyrule and its last two survivors and accepts a life of the sea, forgoing tradition for tradition's sake and choosing your own future. Which makes Spirit Tracks kind of annoying as a follow-up but whatever.  Minish Cap: Why so serious all the time? This game didn't just lack theming, it rejected it. Everything was simple and good and fresh for the sake of being simple and good and fresh, not to serve some grand artistic vision.  Twilight Princess: Look how cool and mature we are. Just like Ocarina of Time. See these gritty brown graphics? They don't look like a cartoon. See this protagonist? He's no comic relief at all. Look it's Epona, look it's the gorons at Death Mountain, look the Zora's Domain froze over, look there's the Gerudo Desert, look Ganon is at the top of Hyrule Castle with an imprisoned Zelda floating overhead for a climactic showdown. Plus there's like vampires and werewolves and shit, those are cool, right? Don't worry about the new stuff, that's just there because we're obligated to put in new stuff, we won't dwell on it or anything.  Phantom Hourglass: More fluff. Also, this time it's an actual bad game.  Spirit Tracks: What's new is old. Look at this brand new kingdom with forest and water and mountains and desert just like the old kingdom. Also it is named the same thing as the old kingdom. Look at this advanced locomotive technology that really just acts like the boats you've already had.  Look at this new demon king who is a giant blue beast with red hair just like Ganon. Look at this new Lokomo Sword which looks like the Master Sword but with triangles on it. On paper it's all original but it goes out of its way to be familiar in spite of that.  Skyward Sword: This game is super important. Everything has meaning. That iconic bird and Triforce emblem? That's representative of this hero. The cyclical conflicts of Triforce representatives? This is where it started. The green tunic and pointy hat? A uniform designed specifically for heroes. The Master Sword? This hero's the master its name refers to. Every villlain in the history of the series? Tiny shreds of the remains of this god of destruction. Zelda isn't just the representative of Wisdom, she's a goddess made mortal just so she'd be allowed to assist you who set the whole cycle of heroism in motion. The Triforce? This hero is the first person ever to get it. Everything in this game exists to explain where the rest of the series comes from and therefore bears the weight of all of the entire series, past and future. At least until the next prequel comes along and undermines it like it undermines Ocarina of Time.  Link Between Worlds: What's old is new. Whereas Spirit Tracks told us it was original but just made a bunch of near-identical substitutes for familiar elements, Link Between Worlds insists that it's just like the old games while radically overhauling gameplay and character dynamics. Ganon's back but he's just a macguffin, LttP's overworld is back but now there's different stuff in it, the Dark World's back but now it's actually post-apocalyptic setting instead of being magically corrupted and the main villain is entirely justified (if a bit rash) leaving the conflict without the usual good vs evil dynamic. It's a response to the vocal fans' rejection of change in the series, people who decried things like Wind Waker and Spirit Tracks for violating their vision of the series without giving them a fair chance; it tricks them into buying a game that sells itself on tradition but delivers a radical departure to make them realize how good new can be."

Zant only wanted the throne for the power, but not the responsibilities that came with wielding such a position. The triforce itself is used in such a fashion for those who desire power.

truezelda,2ouqb3,RezicG,1 point,Wed Dec 10 13:46:27 2014 UTC,"This comparison seems to be rather accurate, no?  The ledge outlined in black looks like it could easily be the one Link is standing on at the beginning of the demo."
truezelda,2ouqb3,osskid,2,Wed Dec 10 15:09:33 2014 UTC,"There is no way that purple bit is closer/the same distance as the red bit.  If the green is such a far distance away, so should the purple - or at least somewhere in-between.  The red is obviously much, much closer than both.  I'd say the purple outline should be closer to the yellow, near the edge of the map.  Other than that, I'd say it looks pretty accurate."
truezelda,2ouqb3,wood_and_nails,2,Wed Dec 10 15:52:14 2014 UTC,"I agree, and I think that the purple should actually be south of the yellow highlight, closer to the middle of the map on the west side, where it appears another river cuts through a mountain range.  That would seem more accurate."

truezelda,2ouqb3,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:49:46 2014 UTC,"Just like every other video game release in history, things we see while the game is being developed are likely to change before the final product is released."
truezelda,2ouqb3,Crim_drakenya,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:00:18 2014 UTC,"I've seen this comparison image over on /r/zelda lately, and it looks pretty legit.  The ledge outlined in black matches exactly where Link was in the demo, Death Mountain is in the right location, the mountain that looks cut in two pieces is right where the river divides that range.  The only thing I'm trying to figure out from the E3 trailer is that Link turns to the southeast (if that image is correct), and then turns again 90 degrees clockwise when coming around that corner, yet I can't find an easy way to get him to the nearest river, unless they cut out a bit of the chase scene."
truezelda,2oreft,Crim_drakenya,11,Tue Dec 9 15:21:17 2014 UTC,"What if that the WII U Link is actually this same Link and it is during this adventure that he loses his eye and gains these skills.   I don't know, having Link lose his eye during the actual game seem a little gruesome for Nintendo.   We've seen that potentially it could be the TP world as there is a place very similar to Lake Hylia from TP.   Plenty of other Zelda games have had a lake shaped like that- LoZ/AoL, ALttP, TP.  We've also got large lakes in OoT and SS, plus WW probably had one shaped just like that as well... except it's underwater. Ha."

truezelda,2oreft,SvenHudson,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:26:53 2014 UTC,Newbie question... What does canon mean? I'm trying to read through this whole thread but I cannot figure this words meaning out. Help me out?
truezelda,2oreft,horridpineapple,3,Mon Dec 15 23:54:35 2014 UTC,"Canon means that it is considered to be a true part of the story. It's as real as fictional can get.   Some games have more than one possibility, like Twilight Princess having its world mirrored depending on what console you're playing on, and both can't be true. Since the GameCube version is the original one developed and since its map correlates more closely with existing maps than Twilight Princess's, the GameCube one is considered to be true and the Wii one is considered to be false. At least with regards to the ways they differ."
truezelda,2oreft,SvenHudson,1 point,Mon Dec 15 23:59:50 2014 UTC,"Sweet, thanks. All this dialogue makes much more sense."
truezelda,2oreft,horridpineapple,2,Tue Dec 16 00:38:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah.  When dealing with fiction, canon is a very important deal.  This is because, as it's fiction, you could theoretically say something like ""Link is really Ganondorf in disguise!"" and, because it's fiction, no one can really say you aren't telling the truth, because there is no truth in fiction.  Therefore we have canon to basically say ""These things are accepted in the lore, these things aren't""  It gives discussion of the lore something to use as common ground, separating individuals' ""headcanon"" from the established lore."
truezelda,2oreft,cow_co,1 point,Thu Dec 18 07:51:41 2014 UTC,Is that actually confirmed somewhere?
truezelda,2oreft,ewweaver,7,Tue Dec 9 22:30:22 2014 UTC,"The Wii version is flipped.  The Gamecube version (the original) is the set up for Hyrule based on how it's actually been throughout the games.  Hyrule, in the Wii version, is flipped to accommodate most players being right handed.  Hyrule doesn't ""canonically"" flip itself, and then back again.  That would make no sense, which is why TP Wii's world setup/hand usage is not canon."
truezelda,2oreft,malaroo,0,Tue Dec 9 22:55:01 2014 UTC,"This makes sense, obviously. Just curious if Nintendo has actually stated that the gamecube is canon. They did keep Link right handed for example."
truezelda,2oreft,ewweaver,4,Tue Dec 9 23:09:02 2014 UTC,"Alongside what malaroo has explained, is it more likely that:   Hyrule is flipped Everybody except Link is lefty   or:   GC is canon   ?"
truezelda,2oreft,Serbaayuu,3,Wed Dec 10 00:05:12 2014 UTC,"As I said, this makes sense. My question wasn't ""why do you personally believe this?"" or ""what evidence is there?"". I am not doubting this and I am fully aware that it was flipped.   My question was ""Has this been confirmed by Nintendo?""  The answer, apparently, is no."
truezelda,2oreft,ewweaver,2,Wed Dec 10 00:13:37 2014 UTC,"actually, it is. go look at whenever TP is referenced outside of the original game, ill use Midna in Hyrule Warriors as an example.  Midna's design is asymmetrical. The most obvious piece being which eye is covered by her helmet. HW uses the version from the GC edition and not her mirrored appearance from the Wii"
truezelda,2oreft,MastuDenton,1 point,Wed Dec 17 08:46:25 2014 UTC,I like the thinking. But HW isn't canon
truezelda,2oreft,ewweaver,2,Wed Dec 17 09:23:42 2014 UTC,"Well my point is that is has to be.  Not only is it the original version, but it's also the version with the ""right"" set up for Hyrule.  If it wasn't canon, then at some point throughout Hyrule's history, everything mirrored itself for some reason, and then went back to normal by the next game in the timeline.  Nintendo has commented on this, but I honestly can't remember what they said, or where they said it, however I guarantee you that the reason Link is right-handed this time is because motion controls are going to be one of the optional ways of input.  It's the only thing that makes sense."
truezelda,2oreft,malaroo,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:51:59 2014 UTC,"or, hear me out, it's SS link. Another possibility is that it's just a different guy altogether who happens to be right handed, for example, Hylia's champion."

truezelda,2oreft,malaroo,7,Tue Dec 9 22:51:10 2014 UTC,It would be a bit much for the geography of Hyrule to change so drastically in the course of a few years.

truezelda,2oreft,A_KOd_Koala,1 point,Wed Dec 10 11:04:49 2014 UTC,Couldn't remember seeing that in Hyrule Historia.  Perhaps then this could actually be Link's Grandfather. That would fit in the time difference.  The world seems very similar to an expanded TP world as there are several locations that fit. IT is possible that this is how big they wanted TP to be and hardware limitations prevented it.

truezelda,2oreft,Theroonco,1 point,Thu Dec 11 18:19:28 2014 UTC,"My bad! In the next paragraph he said Wii U Link could father TP Link, who lived a few centuries after the Hero of Time, and attached myself to that. Oops."

truezelda,2oreft,olivercomet,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:29:57 2014 UTC,The world of the hero of time has the most plot holes and cliff hangers. It'd be the most gratifying timeline to see a sequel in my opinion.

truezelda,2oreft,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Jan 18 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"I liked finding out about OOT/MM  Link being the Hero's Shade, but in my opinion, unless we got an adult Link in Termina story, his story is nicely and tragically wrapped up. I know it can be the ""cool thing"" to knock OOT but I won't because I love it, but I also DONT want to see it even referenced honestly. I want Zelda Wii U to be the absolute latest game in the timeline and to tell a new story without the Ganon/dorf situation. I have always been the most intrigued by the Hyrule in LoZ 1 and 2, maybe because the games were the most inaccessible to me for a long time, and I want to see a game that comes after those."
truezelda,2oreft,grntplmr,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:06:44 2014 UTC,"An interesting point, but looking at it this is either going to be: Post SS, Pre-TP or Post-TP in my opinion. It just looks that way based on the world.  So i'd expect it to be on the child timeline either pre or post TP. I just hope they populate the world with more stuff to do than TP."
truezelda,2oreft,Phoxxent,0,Wed Dec 17 08:10:11 2014 UTC,"Most of all I am hoping that it isn't pre-SS, I just couldn't handle them saying ""but wait! This is ACTUALLY the earliest now"". If I was guessing I would put it at the far end of the Adult timeline in New Hyrule, but hopefully avoiding any direct Spirit Tracks references because it seems to fit the tech-ish world from that teaser."
truezelda,2oreft,grntplmr,1 point,Wed Dec 17 09:58:09 2014 UTC,"Definitely won't be Pre-SS. Or at least i'm almost certain.  It will either be just after SS when they've gone back to the ground, just before TP so before the bridges and shizzle are ruined or after TP once they are all fixed.  Still, at the end of the adult timeline could work I suppose."
truezelda,2oreft,creative_sparky,1 point,Thu Dec 18 08:30:18 2014 UTC,"What's exactly wrong with them saying ""this is the earliest now""? When SS was being made, Miyamoto had said that he didn't want to say it was first because that would remove the possibility if setting games before it. Canonically, it wouldn't be impossible, as there was a hero who helped Hylia seal away Demise and make Skyloft, who also used a sail cloth according to Zelda. We also didn't see the full of Hyrule in SS, so there could have been more structures that were there. Heck, there were the temples that were built, so there was obviously some society beating the Lanayru robots."
truezelda,2oreft,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:04:26 2014 UTC,"For me it is just general prequel fatigue, the Zelda lore is pretty loose so it isn't a huge deal, but it can make things seem unimportant. Also, I like the paradox theory that SS link actually is the ancient hero through time travel shenanigans. I won't care honestly though, the small glimpses we have seen so far look great, and I'm not a huge stickler for the timeline really."
truezelda,2oreft,creative_sparky,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:12:49 2014 UTC,"He couldn't be the ancient hero because there was no one native to that time period to observe it and pass it as legend down to SS Zelda (Yes, I am skipping a few dozen generations).  EDIT: Also, the battle takes place after Skyloft has already been formed."
truezelda,2oreft,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:19:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah I getcha and I don't doubt you on that, I just like the idea. I'm a bit of a ""literal legender"" at heart so I'm just excited to see where everything falls once the new game comes out, even if its ANOTHER new timeline."
truezelda,2oreft,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Dec 28 05:30:57 2014 UTC,I have to disagree about the father thing. The hero wanted to pass on his knowledge because it was his duty to do so. Link is the reincarnation of the Hero of the Goddess. The old hero had a duty to pass on his knowledge to the new hero as long as he has the ability to do so.
truezelda,2oreft,Donfluffycakes,1 point,Sat Dec 20 01:15:44 2014 UTC,The hero's shade says something about passing it down through the bloodline when you first encounter him.
truezelda,2oreft,Epicfaillord,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:05:48 2014 UTC,"""Those are for only for the one who carries the blood of the hero...the one whose spirit is that of the sublime beast.""  Not necessarily talking about family if you ask me. More along the lines of a person in general. There is a theory that not only is the reincarnation of the hero the main character of the games but that when the hero is reincarnated, he is physically the same as the previous hero. While I don't exactly agree with this, it just shows that blood could mean anything and nothing."
truezelda,2oreft,Serbaayuu,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:55:53 2014 UTC,"Oops, the quote I was thinking of was the mortal blow flavor text. ""This is the first secret skill known only within our bloodline"" or something like that."
truezelda,2oreft,Phoxxent,1 point,Thu Jan 1 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"this Link dies at the end.    Unless he ages a good 50 years, and there's a section of the game where you join the Hylian military and become a captain, this wouldn't make any sense.  Link U looks to be no older than 16, I'd say, probably closer to 14.  Also, if any Hero is going to die at the end, it should be the Hero of the Flood.   consider that he masks himself for a lot of this   During one of two trailers for about half of it, which comes to a grand total of about 10-20% of the game we've seen so far."
truezelda,2oreft,Serbaayuu,5,Wed Dec 10 00:08:00 2014 UTC,"There was no hero during the flood, that is why there was a flood."

truezelda,2oreft,olivercomet,-3,Wed Dec 10 06:36:44 2014 UTC,"No, that's why the denizens of the Great Sea think there was a flood.  You know... those same people who don't even remember Hyrule existed.  Wow, they sure are trustworthy, huh?  The fact is that there had to be a Hero during the Flood because of how Hylia's Curse works.  The Goddess and the Hero will incarnate whenever Hyrule is in danger.  Period.  And Hylia's Curse must be real, because we have always seen it come into action, and there is no other reason for those two to reincarnate."
