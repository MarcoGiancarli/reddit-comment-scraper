DieAntwoord,3dmtir,sobersonder,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:01 2015 UTC,his main verse is atrocious.   why?
DieAntwoord,3dmtir,Jesse402,0,Mon Jul 20 11:20:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't click with me. At all. It has no flow and the way he uses the words makes it sound like some childrens book (in a different language, of course). I've listened to some of Wanga's other stuff (https://youtu.be/vLrc48j-pfQ) and he can do way better than what he did in 'Evil Boy'. It's also completely overshadowed by Ninja's verses, which are some of my favorites from him."
DieAntwoord,3dmtir,Bookworm12k,2,Mon Jul 20 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"And by that you mean ""Not if you've watched the music video."""
DieAntwoord,3dfhsf,GhoostP,6,Wed Jul 15 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"The Ziggurat by the Constructus Corporation is one of the most ambitious hip hop concept albums of all time. Honestly, it's amazing, and not enough people have heard it. The run time is ~3 hours, though, and that's a bit intimidating for most people. It also comes with a little graphic novel (which you can read online; print versions are gone). Listen to A 1000 Miles off of it. It's amazing. You just need to get the album to click with you.  Other than that, Memoirs of a Clone is pretty good. It's Ninja experimenting with different styles, not just Hip Hop (though there is Hip Hop on it).   My favorite Waddy projects are the Ziggurat/Good Morning South Africa/Ten$ion."
DieAntwoord,3dfhsf,theFORESTatNIGHT,2,Thu Jul 16 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely need to look up the graphic novel that goes with the Ziggurat, that sounds cool.  I started the very beginning of Memoirs of a Clone and recognized You Talk Too Loud, so I guess he re-used some material within these projects as well?  I didn't listen much past that, so I need to catch the rest of that album."
DieAntwoord,3dfhsf,theFORESTatNIGHT,2,Thu Jul 16 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, he reuses assets pretty commonly. He re-released the Fantastic Kill in 2007 with a different name. It was entirely the same except for one track. And Beat Boy came from one of his pre-DA projects."

DieAntwoord,3dfhsf,elsiniestro,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Also found this video on youtube of a show they did performing tracks off ""Songs From the Mall"".  Really cool to see and gives you a perspective of where he's come from."
DieAntwoord,3dfhsf,Bookworm12k,3,Wed Jul 15 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Max Normal, MaxNormal.TV, Fantastikill (aka Fucknrad), and I actually don't mind Destructo, the little goth electro project that Ninja never managed to get off the ground. He released a few songs for it on MySpace which have made it to YouTube.    Constructus isn't perfect, but it's definitely ambitious, and has some of their best songs (Jellyfish, Invisible Sentinels, Rick Flare, Metatron One). Original Evergreens is kinda a novelty, definitely riffing on Cypress Hill and House Of Pain, but they have lyrics about stuff like safe sex (?).    I also like the individual songs and guest spots I have found of Waddy/Yolandi, ie ""Homeboys"" by Maga Bo, ""Black Labour"" (the track Waddy and Yolandi made to publicise the court case of Carling Breweries vs Laugh It Off) and the three tracks Waddy did vocals on for the electronic act Interlope."

Ninja: We are just, like, ultimate best-friends-forever type of thing. Going from being little homies to having a kid was like an ‘oh shit’ moment. We were always just making tracks and then the baby came into the mix and made it like, ‘We need to get our shit together.’ We blew up because we had a kid. We just became better. From being so experimental, we were then like, ‘We need to connect.’ Now we have gone through a whole universe of things, we’re not boyfriend and girlfriend, we are separate but we are best friends. We are homies and the kids have a good mama and daddy. We just carry on making tracks. It just makes us better at music. Our main thing has been music, that’s what we are married to.  Source"

No one is going to confuse it with a remastered pressing from the master tapes, but the original recording sounds kind of low-fi to begin with. So I can't complain. It's a bootleg (can't find any information on it at all) so I wasn't expecting much, but it's a solid pressing on heavy vinyl with great bass.  I paid $75 for it, which is probably $25 more than it's worth, but it's a bootleg aimed at fans willing to spend the money, and I don't think you'll find $O$ on vinyl any other way."

His main goal was always for his art to be heard, not for the record label to make money: Corporate giants can't fuck with the link between our art and our clients  It's different with Die Antwoord, since it's his own label.

DieAntwoord,3b6hsm,butteronmybroodjie,2,Fri Jun 26 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"the beats weren't that good   Well there's two new producers working on the next album as well as DJ Hi-Tek: Sibot ('DJ Fuck') and DJ Muggs. So I think Ninja probably felt like they weren't progressing their sound enough. That said, HiTek did show more nuance than I thought he had with songs like Strunk and Donker Mag.  More than anything I think Ninja needs to up his game lyrically. So many Donker Mag songs were low effort"
DieAntwoord,3b6hsm,theFORESTatNIGHT,2,Fri Jun 26 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah that's it exactly, too much filler songs and not enough rapping! Just weird ""singing""/drawn out vocalizations/lazy rhyming.. such a different direction than the last two albums."
DieAntwoord,3b6hsm,ThatSnazzyGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:49:45 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree low effort is a perfect description

DieAntwoord,3b6hsm,elsiniestro,2,Fri Jun 26 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. But in the Dazed interview Yolandi said they have 8 tracks finished, and that was published in February. Interview itself probably took place a few weeks even before that. Let just say there's 15 tracks on it, I'd say it's safe to assume that they're almost there. Ninja's also posted a few snippets on his instagram and teased of a single dropping soon, but that was like 2 months ago. So who knows. I certainly don't. But guestimations can't hurt."

DieAntwoord,3b358c,neverkeen,6,Thu Jun 25 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"Marilyn Manson is a very interesting case. I'd suggest reading his book, The Long, Hard Road Out Of Hell, it really gives insight into how his mind works although it was written in about '98 so it's outdated now.  He created the Marilyn Manson persona as a reaction to all the problems in society he wanted to bring attention to and far too soon it overtook him. It seems like he felt he had to keep on pushing controversy and being wild and nihilistic to the point where it just drove him deeper and deeper into despair. He even says it in his song Man That You Fear:   (I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)  Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed  Someone had to go this far"
DieAntwoord,3b358c,TheDeadManWalks,4,Thu Jun 25 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"I think they know exactly what they're doing.  For reference, watch the making of video for Fatty Boom Boom.  Seeing that makes it very clear that, for all his talk of being gangsta, Waddy is still basically a rapper and an artist.  His favorite things to do are draw and paint and work with talented costume designers, musicians, and photographers, as you can see in the video.  The music is filled with violent themes, but then all of the art in the background is hand painted by him with words like peace and love on them.  He's pretty clearly a huge art nerd."
DieAntwoord,3b358c,thermiter36,2,Thu Jun 25 20:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think most people get it wrong, there are no characters, they are all Watkin Tudor Jones. He is very clear about what he is doing, he explains it in his older songs, he shapes his reality through will power and artistic talent.  Saying that Ninja is a character would be like saying a guy who puts on a business suit and goes to an office job every day is actually just playing a character of a business man. Kind of true in a way, but for all intents and purposes, the guy is a business man."

DieAntwoord,3actzz,fenzil,5,Fri Jun 19 07:56:16 2015 UTC,It's a reference to American Gothic.
DieAntwoord,3actzz,autowikibot,6,Fri Jun 19 08:01:37 2015 UTC,"American Gothic:       American Gothic is a painting by Grant Wood in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood's inspiration came from what is now known as the American Gothic House, and his decision to paint the house along with ""the kind of people I fancied should live in that house.""  The painting shows a farmer standing beside his spinster daughter.  The figures were modeled by the artist's sister and their dentist. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 19th-century Americana, and the couple are in the traditional roles of men and women, the man's pitchfork symbolizing hard labor, and the flowers over the woman's right shoulder suggesting domesticity. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law's tongue and geranium, which are the same plants as in Wood's 1929 portrait of his mother, Woman with Plants.

DieAntwoord,3actzz,FiftySixer,-2,Fri Jun 19 08:26:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, but, they stand for something else entirely.  I wouldn't call the background gothic, but that's just me."
DieAntwoord,3actzz,vanulovesyou,-1,Fri Jun 19 08:33:03 2015 UTC,"Goth, as a subculture, has an aesthetic that's known for dark, even horrific, imagery, and some of Die Antwoord's would foot the bill, IMO  Of course, the interesting thing about Die Antwoord: You can come from different angles and call them x or y.  ."
DieAntwoord,3actzz,FiftySixer,-4,Fri Jun 19 08:47:45 2015 UTC,"As a kid who grew up gothic, I wouldn't consider them even close to the same thing.  They have a much more positive message, are more openminded, and more colorful."
DieAntwoord,3actzz,vanulovesyou,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:40:34 2015 UTC,"As I said in my previous post, we're talking about aesthetic, which, gothic-wise, isn't always negative, nor close-minded, nor purely black oriented. As it is, no one here is saying that Die Antwoord is goth, so you need to read what we're saying here more closely. We're commenting on aspects of their imagery.   I mean, really, you don't think a black-eyed angel holding a bloody heart wouldn't be considered gothic by some people?  As a note, I've been around goths and gothic culture since the 1980s."
DieAntwoord,3actzz,FiftySixer,-3,Fri Jun 19 11:21:05 2015 UTC,"See, I too, I speak from experience.  And it makes me angry when people call DA gothic.  They are something entirely different.  I also read the article about how ¥ was a 'goth kid' but that's eons away from what they are now.  Zef is zef."
DieAntwoord,3actzz,vanulovesyou,2,Fri Jun 19 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Have you read anything I have written? No one is calling them ""goth"" per se, so your anger is pointless.   But, really, do you even know what ""aesthetic"" means? For that matter, do you even know what ""goth"" means? Because you keep making denials when you really haven't made a point.   BTW, it sounds like you have never read any interviews by them, because (1) you'd know that their influences are from the 80s and 90s, and (2) you'd know what ""zef"" is whatever you'd want to make of it. But Yolandi's makeup and black costume/wings in the ""Ugly Boy"" video, or the way that she is dressed here shows they don't like just bright colors and whatever we think ""zef"" represents, and that their influences aren't just from South Africa.   After all, Ninja said of Yolandi when he first met her that ""she was a little goth kid who looked about 13. I was scared of her."" It isn't surprising that she's still a bit of a punk-goth-rocker girl -- that's what makes her Yolandi.  Here is an interview with her where she talks about her youth:  http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/23706/1/yo-landi-visser-dark-star"
DieAntwoord,3actzz,FiftySixer,-5,Fri Jun 19 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"Right.  That's the interview I was talking about.  I tried to figure out why calling them 'gothic' is offensive to me, and it's because I identify as a zefling.  We don't like being called 'goth'.  That is offensive.  Zef is something much greater than you're giving it credit for.  I get that you're just a casual fan, and it doesn't mean to you what it means to me.  It feels like you're looking at a picture of a punk rocker with a mohawk and and calling him an Indian.  While their hair may be aesthetically similar, they are not even close to the same thing."

Some spray paint with high contrast colors (Hot Pink, Yellow, Black, white & gold accents) and some hand drawn figures would be good. Die Antwoord mirrors Roger Ballen a considerable amount, so I recommend looking at some of his work. Maybe placing two objects/ideas that don’t belong together and that could cause controversy might be a good idea? Ie.. Porn + a Cross or kitten, a cute toy w/ penis, kid with a gun,  spitting into someone mouth, etc. Have you seen Chappie? You could get TONS of inspiration from that movie.

DieAntwoord,38bv91,lunar_unit,3,Thu Jun 4 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"Some of his tattoos are as potentially dangerous as any gang tats in the US.  If you aren't a member of that gang, it could get you killed.  From http://www.socialstereotype.com/_/Features/Entries/2010/5/13_DIE_ANTWOORD.html  There is another side to NINJA that has much more serious connotations than merely changing his rap name or his haircut – inked onto his torso are contradicting gang tattoos from each of Cape Town’s ‘numbers’ gangs: the 26s, 27s and 28s. He has one of Richie Rich, which symbolises the 26’s – the money lovers. On his chest he has the 27’s tattoo of a ghostly hand gripping a knife, which symbolize the murderers – they keep the peace between the 26s and the 28s. And on his arm is a tattoo of Casper the friendly ghost with a massive erection, which represents the 28s – a prison rape gang that has ‘legalised’ homosexual prison sex. Tattoos are the outward symbols of rank and status and affiliations, yet NINJA has never belonged to any of them. Isn’t he scared that it’s a step too far?  “It’s like a peace gesture,” he smiles, gold glinting in the sun. “I didn’t even know that the Richie Rich one was a gang signs. A lot of people have said that I’m not allowed it, but I just saw it on the back of a taxi! I’m sorry! I won’t do it again! I don’t know… we’re all in the same gang, we’re not scared of anything. I mustn’t be scared. People don’t understand white people saying those things.”  His friend Isaac says,  They’re dangerous. I don’t know anybody who would have those tats. You need balls to have them. That’s like a sneak preview into this cat’s character. In the Cape Flats it’s seen as an honour to have tats like that. They could save your life but they could also get you killed. The first time my brother saw his tats he didn’t know what to think. You definitely have to have balls to have them. I guess sometimes when you’re young you think you’re immortal.”  Here's another article referencing some of Ninja's self-applied tattoos and their background.  The drug dealer, Anies, in Cookie Thumper represents two of those gangs and has some interesting tattoos.  Backround on Numbers Gangs."

Obviously I can't speak for all South Africans but the general consensus I get from people I've spoken to about them is that think they are embarrassing. The whole zef thing.. if you called someone zef over there it's an insult. There is no zef scene or culture. They don't like the way they portray South Africa to the outside world. It's not all drugs and gangs and guns. Yes it's a relatively dangerous place compared to the US and Europe, but it's also a fantastically beautiful country and the vast majority of people are so nice and friendly. A lot of Afrikaaners are still quite conservative and really don't like swearing (I think Jack Parow did a gig in an Afrikaaner town and got taken off stage after two songs for swearing), so that goes against them too. Also I noticed while I was there last time that basically no music stores I went in to had any of their stuff at all. I do know someone there who doesn't like DA but loves MaxNormal.TV though!  TL:DR the guys I know don't like the way they talk about South Africa, and they know their personas are fake. That's not to say all South Africans do though by any means!"
DieAntwoord,389hzq,beSuru,5,Tue Jun 2 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"From the Dazed interview with Ninja, it seems that all the swearing came from ¥o-Landi."

DieAntwoord,389hzq,beSuru,3,Tue Jun 2 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response, I appreciate it! I've definitely heard that some people there find them embarrassing or think they're rough/scary/trashy- but I guess I've never gotten the impression from DA that they're trying to portray all of South Africa in that way!? It seems more like they're just representing the places that they're from specifically and the people that they hang out with, if that makes sense.  For instance, they were talking in some interview about how zef is an insult in SA but they were turning it around and making it cool. Like they wanted to reclaim the word zef as their own and make it a culture.     But anyway, sorry for the damn wall!  :D  I'm very glad to have so many chunks of info popping into this thread- it's interesting as owt!  Thank you!"
DieAntwoord,389hzq,beSuru,3,Wed Jun 3 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"I think this the problem, that's what makes South Africans so annoyed.. they don't hang out with any of those people, and they definitely are not from the places they claim to be representing. Yo-Landi's family is from Cape Town. If you watch the Picnic short film, you can see her sitting on the lawn of what looks like the Whitehouse, that's her parent's house. And Ninja is from Randburg, which is a pretty normal suburban town outside Johannesburg."

She likes Jack Parow more.  And I asked a South African guy on one of the AMA subreddits a while back. He hated DA.

Heck, one of their main goals at the start was to piss off conservative Afrikaners, so it's not that surprising.  But my opinion isn't really valid here, so I'll link you to some South African blogs and stuff (be sure to check out the comments sections on all,  actually more valuable than the articles themselves at times):  Is Die Antwoord a form of Blackface?  Decapitate a Hater  Richard Poplak on Die Antwoord  15 Minutes With a Ninja  Time for SA to acknowledge Die Antwoord's greatness  And there's plenty more Die Antwoord hate and debate to be found, esp. on africaisacountry and Mahala, if you're interested.  Also, I think it's important to note that all of those articles are old, some even going back to 2010. So their opinions might have changed a bit by now. Earlier on, I think people thought ""oh look, another Waddy Jones character"" and treated Die Antwoord as this exploitative thing that would ultimately peter out into another Waddy project. But five years and lot of succers later, Die Antwoord remain what they've always said they've been."

Top post on google is an article containing this:   Erefaan has ""I hate you, Mum"" and ""Spit on my grave"" tattooed on his face. In marking himself in this way he was signalling in unambiguous - and at the time irreversible - ways that he was choosing the surrogate family of his prison gang over his blood family on the outside.

DieAntwoord,369fwp,lunar_unit,9,Sun May 17 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"You might be on to something... There is a track from MaxNormal.tv called ""Angel Claws"". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al8mfZutbII  He hasn't spoke much about it, but maybe he's a big comic book guy? The name ""MaxNormal"" comes from a Judge Dredd character.  I wouldn't be surprised if Ninja knows that most people do not understand or know the Afrikaans parts. This allows him to throw almost whatever he wants into a track.  I have never heard him really speak about magic and spells except for his ""Fairy Forest"" tattoo (If that even counts) and Tokoloshe lore.  EDIT: Sorry I didn't know what Magik was when seeing/replying to this earlier today. I been reading up on it ever since and am beginning to notice a lot of connections."
DieAntwoord,369fwp,Proxeh_,7,Sun May 17 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"After I googled 'Die Antwoord' and 'occult' there's tons of info that emerges.  Some of it is the typical conspiracy theory Illuminati stuff, but I'm more interested in DAs use of it for manifesting their goals and agendas.  They're more open about the symbology than most pop culture icons.  'Donker Mag' actually means 'Dark Power' in Afrikaans."
DieAntwoord,369fwp,Proxeh_,7,Sun May 17 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"Ninja's instagram would be a treasure trove for a ""Conspiracy Theory Illuminati"" author. I feel like Ninja has a general interest in exploring world views, politically, religiously, etc. etc. and was probably studying occult related topics during the creation of Donker Mag. If not delving into it - I am sure he was definitely exploring the art on top. The instagram pictures seem a bit like satire to me. Shock sells. This is some interesting stuff - thanks for posting this."
DieAntwoord,369fwp,Proxeh_,5,Mon May 18 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"Here's one of the 'Illuminati-watcher' sites that break down some of DAs symbology. (I didn't watch the accompanying video yet)  One of the photos on the page is Ninja wearing a 'Worship Seitan' shirt with a pentagram.  The funny part is 'seitan' is a vegetarian wheat 'meat' (DA are vegetarians).  Hilarious satire IMO, at least in that particular case.  This article mentions his magick-charged tattoos:  ""Tyler B Murphy: Ninja wanted to get a collection of magically charged sigils tattooed on his body before the filming started. He created the symbols using a technique that he learned from Aphex Twin. They are super powerful and the meaning and intention behind each one remains secret until it comes to pass. In Iceland they call them magical staves."""
DieAntwoord,369fwp,PurplethePigeon,4,Mon May 18 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I watched that exact video. I am thinking more and more that this was the intentional theme of the album (duh...) - maybe even the general theme of Die Antwoord? Which obviously stands for The Answer.  That crown of the High Priestess reminds me a lot of the Rat Trap 666 track sigil.  Yo-landi also has a ton of Tarot cards throughout her instagram - I think I remember seeing a Rats Rule Ouija board at some point too.   Maybe I was oblivious because I haven't known much about what any of this means. (Still Kinda don't) I think I might have been missing Ninja's message. I been so out of it. WTJ is the king of satire.  Time to revisit The Ziggurat and go through the albums again."

DieAntwoord,369fwp,CeciliaLisbon,5,Mon May 18 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"There is so much about Ninja and Yo-Landi that we'll never know, but I love to find little glimpses and peeks behind the personas like this,  like the fairy forest tattoo, and the tattoo of the boy and girl hugging on his arm (think he also used that as his logo for FUCKNRAD). You only have to look at their past works to see they are both obviously very intelligent and learned people. The Ziggurat is a great example, stunning work.  PS Speaking of The Ziggurat, Ninja has got a huge scroll tattoo on his lower back of possibly NATALIE, which is also the name of a track on that album. Does anyone know if he's ever discussed that tattoo? I think he's talked about all the others."
DieAntwoord,369fwp,ThatSnazzyGuy,4,Sun May 17 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"The hug tattoo is from the Shel Silverstein ""Hug o War"""
DieAntwoord,369fwp,PurplethePigeon,6,Mon May 18 03:47:05 2015 UTC,"I remember a guy over on /r/occult said he met Ninja and Yolandi, and that they were very well informed on magik. Here's a good article on possible occultist connotations of the Pitbull Terrier vid. I'm not too knowledgeable on the subject, but Ninja and Yolandi clearly have an interest in magik and the occult. To what end? I'm not sure. Maybe just for aesthetic purposes.   I'd look through Ninja's previous works too, if you haven't. There's probably a wealth of references I'm not getting. Like there's a Constructus track called Metatron One. Metatron, YouTube tells me, is the archangel of the Chayot ha Kodesh angels on the Sephira, the top most crown of the Kabbalistic planes of existence. Metatron's aim/job was to lead the people of Israel through the 'wilderness' after their Exodus from Egypt. So in The Ziggurat, Metatron acts as a kind of physical manifestation of God, or prophet at least.  Also, for what it's worth, Ninja and Yolandi are both Buddhist and are deep into their Eastern spiritualism. Lots third eye references throughout their work, for example."
DieAntwoord,369fwp,Proxeh_,5,Sun May 17 15:27:10 2015 UTC,"I noticed that Ninja's Instagram has pictures of a baphomet mask and a picture of him wearing one. I've always wanted a baphomet mask, and he appears to own this super ornate, white one."

A lot of the Aphex Twins harder beats are an obvious influence on Die Antwoord.  ""Happy Go Sucky Fucky"" is based on the song ""Expander"" from the game Streets of Rage 2, scored by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima.  ""Pitbull Terrier"" is based on the song ""Pit Bull"" by Goran Bregović from the Black Cat, White Cat OST  ""Never Le Nkemise 1"" contains an interpolation of ""Unbelievable"" by EMF.  ""Hey Sexy"" is based on ""Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO"" (1968) by Delia Derbyshire. It contains an interpolation of ""America Fuck Yeah"" by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as well as ""Move Bitch"" by Ludacris."

DieAntwoord,35ha71,-De-Koenisch-,32,Sun May 10 10:19:39 2015 UTC,"I think DA started as parody or satire or whatever you'd like to call it. But over time, I believe that Ninja and Yolandi sort of merged with their personas. I think the persona has changed a bit (to me, Ninja especially), and the people changed a bit until they met in the middle. Personally I think what we see in the last few years is that they're Ninja and Yolandi 24/7.  Waddy and Anri are past selves.  As Kurt Vonnegut said, ""We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."""
DieAntwoord,35ha71,WhysEveryoneSoPissed,13,Sun May 10 12:09:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah it seems like in ""Wat Pomp"" Ninja was still just another character like Max Normal, but at some point during the making of ""Enter The Ninja"" he realized that this could really be something if he fully committed to becoming Ninja, he got the tats & never looked back."
DieAntwoord,35ha71,whocareswhatever,16,Sun May 10 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yup. Some $0$ songs, like Beat Boy and Wat Pomp, are late MaxNormal.TV era songs intended for a different Die Antwoord than the one we ended up. Like Ninja was originally called ""Wad:e"" and it really obvious he was playing a character, as evidenced here:  https://youtube.com/watch?v=9_12tKGEdqw  Somewhere along the line he realised that he was going in the wrong direction, that he needed to make something reflective of himself and South African society, something authentic. Exit Wad:e. Enter the Ninja. As you say, that's the real beginning of Die Antwoord.  I doubt the Die Antwoord we see in the above video would've blown up. Part of the attraction to Die Antwoord at the start was the whole question of ""is it real?"". With the trial run version of Die Antwoord, the answer would've clearly been no."
DieAntwoord,35ha71,ThatSnazzyGuy,8,Sun May 10 16:30:46 2015 UTC,"To your point about Beat Boy - https://youtu.be/Sra9vV5FJUw?t=2m33s Darryl - Constructus Corporation era?  The ending of the Constructus Corporation book references picking up a book called ""The Tao Of Health, Sex, and Longevity"". This is where I believe the roots of the Ninja character really started. At least in the aspect of adding these ideas to his life (from what we can see). Some of the ""Semen retention"" stuff is mentioned quite a bit actually - although obviously not as much in Die Antwoord.   ""Sperm vampires have no hold on me I'm buried 2005 BC"" ( Watkin Tudor Jones - you are ok )  ""And all you men that keep losing sperm what's up with that yo? I'm on the track fully stacked like a Thunder Cat! Ho!"" ( Invisible Sentinels - The Constructus Corporation )  As the title says, the book is about Health Sex and Longevity - so there is much to it than just semen retention. Haha... Those lyrics just always stuck out to me after reading the book.  Sorry if anything I have mentioned isn't relevant... I just kinda got carried away after typing - ya know?"

DieAntwoord,35ha71,Poor__Yorick,7,Sat Jul 18 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"You nailed it dude. I think even Ninja said when you take on a persona, you'll start to see yourself in that personality."
DieAntwoord,35ha71,squadcarxmar,4,Sun May 10 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"There is also the whole ""if you can conceive it and you believe it, you can achieve it..."" mentality they both have. Basically Watkin Tudor Jones had a dream that he was Ninja and then he made it come true, he altered his reality in a very trippy way."
DieAntwoord,35ha71,MiguelGusto,21,Mon May 11 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"Read Ninja's Dazed interview. He's very candid about the whole persona thing.  edit: I also wish more people would investigate Die Antwoord's past. Most people see a picture of Max Normal era Ninja and compare him to his current state, and go ""yup, fake"" and never think about it again. Missing out on so much great music and a really interesting artistic evolution."
DieAntwoord,35ha71,ThatSnazzyGuy,8,Sun May 10 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"To your edit I think anyone hear would agree. I just don't get why it matters to those wondering ""is it real?"" I look at it like acting in a strange way. At the end of the day all I worry about is if I liked it or not. I think a lot famous people act. As Ninja once said, you act like one person around your friends, you act like a different one in front of your mom, so when you get on stage, who are you?"
DieAntwoord,35ha71,squadcarxmar,7,Sun May 10 21:07:09 2015 UTC,"I have to say... The story they came out with initially, with Ninja and Yolandi being two poors from the Zef side of the train tracks, and Hi-tech making beats in his bedroom on his PC computer, the early interviews where they act like they don't fully understand  English, etc.  THAT story is what causes people to dismiss them after seeing plenty of evidence that it wasn't ""real"".   I get that it was totally necessary.  That novelty was maybe part of what caused them to get attention in the first place.  The fans keep coming back because of the music, not that backstory.  Kind of like how people drag up pictures of a teenage Eminem in his Alf shirt. His fans don't care if he was into Alf for 5 minutes as a teenager. His haters take it as proof he's a sham."
DieAntwoord,35ha71,WhysEveryoneSoPissed,2,Sun May 10 23:55:01 2015 UTC,Hmm didn't know people thought the Alf shirt made him a sham. Why is that?
DieAntwoord,35ha71,squadcarxmar,1 point,Tue May 12 07:44:49 2015 UTC,"Because he portrays this persona as a poor neglected kid who never had shit because his insane mother abused him and he was always bullied to the point of being put into a coma in school, and his childhood was the most awful thing to ever be imagined yet still he climbed his way out of it and became awesome in spite of it all.  And then there emerges a picture of him as a kid wearing a pink Alf shirt holding a homemade birthday cake and smiling.

As Ninja says ""Ninja was more me... than me"". - https://youtu.be/8W1RmnyBNlI?t=4m52s  I don't think I ever heard how Yo-Landi truly came to be. I think the best explanation out there for her would be in the Dazed interviews. I'd assume it would be the same factor, ""Be everything you want to be. Be your future self""  Honestly, that is really would we should always strive for right? Working every day towards being that future self you want to be. Throw yourself and your doubts away and fall into everything you would ever want to be. They did that, although their satire on the impacts and blind influence of multiple cultures can blur it.  As Ninja's former self said in ""Love is..."" ""Invent the future - then manifest it"". (I wouldn't be surprised if he does a version of this track as Ninja.

DieAntwoord,35ha71,invaderdan,7,Sun May 10 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"If that is true they have to be among the most comitted artists out there. Personally I like this notion that Die Antwoord started as a harmless music project that developed a life of its own. Ninja and Yolandi have become identities instead of mere personas.  I'm German (Afrikaans is a very fascinating language to me) and there are a bunch of German artists that have shown a more or less similarly bewildering lifestyle. The most popular one is probably the actor Klaus Kinski. This guy was described as a madman and genius by anyone who tried to work with him. However, some critics went as far to say that Kinski was only ever playing himself. In the end it's impossible to tell whether he only adopted this character in the public, was an actual choleric or if this persona that made him successful became his new self at some point.  In fact one might suggest that this applies to every individual and maybe Watkin and Anri themselves don't even know what's going on anymore."

Some people have reclaimed terms like ""fag"" and ""cunt"", like DJ Hi Tek say he has, others have not, and that is fine.   However, getting mad at them for things like is like beating a dead horse (or lion). They aren't going to change their behavior because it offends people.

As many as 13,000 minstrels take to the streets garbed in bright colours, either carrying colourful umbrellas or playing an array of musical instruments. The minstrels are self organised into klopse (""clubs"" in Kaapse Afrikaans, but more accurately translated as troupes in English). Participants are typically from Afrikaans-speaking working class Cape coloured families who have preserved the custom since the mid-19th century.

I feel like her lyrics have gotten much more feminine (not necessarily a bad thing), but when you listen to MaxNormal.TV and their first album you can hear that Yolandi seriously rivals Ninja in complicated, hardcore, powerful rhymes.   Also, I'd love to see the revival of Ninja's different character voices, he's seriously talented! I doubt we will get that though because this album will be so dark, I associate his character voices with their more comedic songs."

DieAntwoord,31mevz,JonY82,5,Tue Apr 7 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"For me, as far as darkness goes, Tension is the most gritty hardcore and dark (Fok Julie Naaiers/Fink You). Donker Mag came off as way more light and lovey dovey themed.  Strunk- whistful, dreamy, chill love song. Sex- high energy, trippy love song. Even Ugly Boy is a love song. Don't get me wrong, overall it's got a nice balance of dark, gritty hardcore gangsta shit also.  SOS - 9/10  Tension - 10/10  Donker Mag- 11/10  Ratz Rule-?-?-?-12/10"
DieAntwoord,31mevz,elsiniestro,5,Tue Apr 7 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"I think SOS and Tension are slightly (but only slightly) better than Donker Mag.    This is mainly because the satire and comedy is more apparent in the lyrics and design of SOS. With Tension they began to focus on the hypeness of their characters as opposed to the clear tongue-in-cheekness of the lyrics, but that's fine because the songs were pretty much ALL top-tier. Donker Mag is great too, but sometimes feels more disjointed than their other albums, and has too many unecessary skits (as did Tension, but the skits there were funnier and less random).    I wish they'd do more amusing raps that tell a story (ie Laf Nag, Tik Tik, She Makes Me A Killer, So What, Raging Zef Boner) and less grimy-but-hollow bragga stuff like Rat Trap 666."
DieAntwoord,31mevz,fresh_futuristik,4,Wed Apr 8 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, Ten$ion is my favorite, followed by $O$. Donker Mag was good but I could feel them moving away from what makes them unique. I enjoy delving into the lyrics and the South African culture they represent because it is so different than what I experience in my life. Donker Mag felt very American and superficial. Except for Cookie Thumper which I think is the best track on that album."

I'd be listening to a Die Antwoord song - at one point I'm impressed at how it's so original, and the very next stanza they use a cliché element from older pop songs.

I was in college (art school) at the time and everything they were doing was completely with the times as far as trends go. The whole everyone has a faux-corporate identity thing (obey/shepard fairy) and putting out kitsch art-products ala Kid Robot. The not-graffiti street art style + the slick graphic design.    It's awesome to see how Die Antwoord is the exact opposite, a complete 180 that is completely authentic without any pretense."
DieAntwoord,308wgi,fillollol,3,Wed Mar 25 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"a complete 180 that is completely authentic without any pretense.   A lot of people don't see this, unfortunately. They get caught up with the whole ""is it real?"" thing and refuse to actually see Die Antwoord on their own terms. As much as I like MaxNormal.TV, it's conceptual to an almost comical degree. And that's the point, I know, but it's also kind of soulless. Die Antwoord are Ninja's attempt to rectify that and make something eminently real and authentic.   Just saw /u/frozenpandaman's post which includes Wad:e and Yolandi videos, basically the prototype of Die Antwoord. At that stage, it was a lot more mocking and cartoonish. The Die Antwoord we have now are entirely different, and all the better for it I think."

Charlie Goussin?  Men who are rich and famous tend to do risky and outrageous things. That's why they got famous in the first place. It's why politicians have mistresses and gay lovers and get bjs in the Oval Office. That same quality makes them push the envelope and do shit we've never seen before. It makes them famous. Its often their downfall.   Not that this will be Ninja's. He made a song where he gives his IG handle, says if a girl sends him a pic of her boobs he'll send a pic of his dick back.

I thought the ""Markus Wormstorm Is Not Gay"" and ""Emmanuel Rothchild - My Favourite Songs"" EPs were under a different name than Destructo though? Definitely would like to get those.    Also wondering if he ever ended up recording anything under the band name Fantastikill, as he talked about doing at the time of The Ziggurat."

DieAntwoord,2zz1kc,FiftySixer,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wish I could find better quality of them. You can download the few listed on his Myspace site, but it seems to be ~128 kbps VBR (so, like V5 or so) quality, so not great.   What name would those two EPs be under, then? I can't find much about them anywhere – not even a tracklist, as I said in the OP. One YouTube video of Touch The Sky says they're on that album as well, but who knows.  In other words, there was a (presumably good quality) version of Touch The Sky, along with a song named ""Power Point Presentation""(?) on the maxnormal.tv site, but archive.org doesn't seem to have saved versions of them…  He did the album entitled ""The Fantastic Kill"" under his real name, but I'm not sure about under any other work using that name or  any variations of it."

I also saw them a few months ago and the set was mostly the same as now but didn't include this.

For some reason I was a little worried when I clicked this link but you really nailed some things on the head about why I enjoy them so much.  None of my friends really understand why I love them SO much because they just see the surface level of what they put out, which is understandable I suppose- but it kills me! There's so much more to them than the gangsta lifestyle/attitude that they put out there- so much underneath the surface and aaaaall of that intelligent/inspired/artistic passion that they have- that's what I love. Well, that and the awesome fucking music of course- it's just one big happy package but so many people don't know how to see it. Anyway, sorry for the wall but I enjoyed your article!"

You know how they say you should never meet your heroes because they usually turn out to be assholes when you get to know them? Ninja tries hard to be an asshole, but I don't think he really has it in him, haha.

The style of the lyrics are definitely in high contrast compared to Ninja/DA songs but still so well put together- I love it.  I've been digging around in a ton of his old stuff, so much of it is really good imo. I came across those documentaries that you linked to in your article a few weeks ago and have watched them each a few times since then and pausing to go look up the songs/bands that are referenced.   I totally agree that Ninja definitely doesn't have what it takes to be an asshole- but I guess I don't (okay, other than some of the lyrics! haha) really see him actively trying to be an asshole!? I follow him and Yolandi on Instagram (they're actually the only two people I use instagram for!) and he's always posting fan art and saying how good it is, as well as posting sweet things about his daughter or pics of Y with a caption of ""pretty"" or something of the like! Heh, but I know he definitely has a ""hard"" image in a lot of circumstances and especially when he's on stage- so I see what you mean I think!

But when someone just hates on something I like, they will be phased out of my life. If I'm so dumb for liking ""talentless"" Die Antwoord, why waste your time trying to guilt trip me into not liking them or feeling bad for liking them?   I sort of used Die Antwoord as a pass/fail test for determining who's probably cool when I was dating.

DieAntwoord,2zez6g,thiswaythat2,2,Mon Mar 23 03:15:52 2015 UTC,"I have this arguement all the time on facebook. Man, are they missing out. I do NOT listen to bad music. No gimmicks, just skill and wisdom. That's what they'd get if they actually took the time to learn. If only I got the same reaction when I posted jazz or opera, but I dont, people just accept it because they know better. I only wish they knew better when it came to this."
DieAntwoord,2zez6g,unscanable,7,Wed Mar 18 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"I think there are definitely gimmicks (in a way) but I think the why and how said gimmicks are in place makes DA fucking amazing!  I used to be one of the people that thought they were just attention seeking try-hards, for lack of a better way to say it. But then I ran across Ugly Boy on /r/music and loved it so much that I had to go back and look at some of their older stuff.  Now, however many months later I can honestly say that I respect them as performers/musicians/artists to no end.  I own everything they've put out, and am working my way through some of Ninja's older stuff now.  I think to like or even just not dislike DA you have to either really dig their music (which is amazing on it's own imo) or know enough about them to be able to see that they're not just in it for attention- not at all. They have a sincere love of what they do and what they put out there- most people (seems like) just don't want to spend the time to look into them any more than at surface level, which I suppose I can't completely blame them for. (Their loss!) But the above list is an awesome example!   Okay, sorry for the wall. I just know what you mean about anyone's reaction to DA- but the above thinking kind of helps me just shrug and not mind having them 'to myself'.  :)"

DieAntwoord,2zez6g,FiftySixer,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"It's because I don't listen to bad music, and they're trying to tell me that max normal/DA is BAD. Like, yeah right, I play a dozen instruments and I have perfect pitch, these cats are arguing with the wrong person. Who are they to tell me that what I listen to is bad? I only listen to good music. That's where the arguement lies. I'm not trying to convert them or force them into anything they don't want to listen to, I can respect that, but when they have to audacity to tell me that what I listen to is BAD, well, they're just wrong. Feel me? It's never people that are musically talented either, it's always people who don't play an instrument telling me that I'm wrong. Well, heads up, I'm not, haha."

DieAntwoord,2z9y6r,RaymondLuxuryYacht,10,Tue Mar 17 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"DJ HiTek is Justin deNobrega, and they definitely haven't broken up.   Supposedly Justin's just very fame shy, and that's why there's stand ins in their videos like Leon Brotha (Enter the Ninja) and Vuilgeboost (Zef Side). And also why he wears the mask. But it's hard to not recognise him at the live shows; he's the big hulking bald guy.  Muggsy and Sibot are co producing Rats Rule, but HiTek is pretty much indispensable to Die Antwoord and their sound.  This was written by Ninja about what he wanted for MaxNormal.TV, but I feel like it applies even better to Die Antwoord:  What kind of music should I rap over? Base the music on the rapping. You're a very musical guy. You should work closely with someone to create really original music that raps itself around your stories, like one would compose the music to a film. Make sure the beats bump hard, like all-up-in-da- club hard, something for the taxis.  My friend Justin Denobrega makes the loudest beats I've ever heard in my life. His production is world-class.  Then work closely with him. But none of that sampling nonsense. Compose fresh music, based around your rapping. It would be a cool idea to mix rave music with hip-hop, like high-energy hip-hop. Like the energy of high-energy, rave music, mixed with the bump of gangster rap. That will create a real live charge for you to send your raps through. That's brilliant, people are going to start copying that! Don't worry, you thought of it first."

DieAntwoord,2z9y6r,WhysEveryoneSoPissed,14,Tue Mar 17 10:57:31 2015 UTC,"Whether Hi-Tek exists is a matter of debate.  Some say he's Justin DeNobrega. Some say Ninja is Hi-Tek. Neither or both might be true. Either way, whoever it is, Hi-Tek has never showed up in pictures with Ninja and Yo-landi (who instagram most aspects of their lives), has never toured with them, is played by someone different in every video, etc.  I wouldn't expect any change in Hi-Tek's ""presence"" in the group. It's obviously been a long distance collab for years if it's been a collab at all.  Btw, De Nobrega has a really nice solo act, Seven Ark ... Check him out."
DieAntwoord,2z9y6r,DarkoPolo,4,Tue Mar 17 16:39:02 2015 UTC,In their first video they claimed that hi tek was the fat kid.  Also in earlier interviews from 2010 one called 'what's in the bag with die antwoord' they were showing off stuff they bought and hi tek was with them

I always took it as DJ Hi-Tek can be anybody at anytime and that the voice you will hear on the albums doesn't mean that THAT is DJ Hi-Tek.  I am not sure if that makes any sense at all.

DieAntwoord,2z9y6r,Bookworm12k,3,Tue Mar 17 10:53:07 2015 UTC,They've said in interviews before that DJ HiTek doesn't live traveling so they tour with his cousin. Maybe he'll be a distant member.
DieAntwoord,2z9y6r,kingxanadu,5,Tue Mar 17 02:40:35 2015 UTC,I've always heard that they've often used different people because DJHiTek was masked so maybe they've dropped him as a character?

Lots of things.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_enigma  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_(number)  Most likely:  The 23, in South Africa, refers to the 23 conscientious objectors who publicly refused to do military service in the Apartheid army in 1987. The following years the number increased to 143 (in 1988) and 771 (in 1989), with Apartheid being dismantled from 1990 onwards...  ...After much debate, by the late 1980s the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa.[93] A disinvestment from South Africa movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid"

DieAntwoord,2yqhy2,LethL,10,Wed Mar 11 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he got the idea for the tattoo in 2009... but EVIL BOY was from 2010 wasn't it?    And Waddy has been calling himself ""evil"", ""super evil"" and ""evil boy"" for years. Like, since the early 2000s. It's a pretty long-running lyrical theme, so I honestly doubt a farm boy like Wanga would have thought it up.    Not saying Waddy didn't get the imagery of the tattoo from elsewhere, but Wanga seems to me to have been a dumb kid who tried to extend his five seconds of fame further than he could justify."
DieAntwoord,2yqhy2,elsiniestro,6,Thu Mar 12 00:02:07 2015 UTC,You can clearly see the Evil Boy tattoo stencil there in one of the pics. This was mid 2009. Evil Boy came out in October 2010. So Ninja's story checks out. He had the tattoo before Wanga kicked that verse on Evil Boy.

DieAntwoord,2yivks,xJ_Dx,19,Tue Mar 10 04:11:40 2015 UTC,I've only recently gotten into them as well. They're positively intoxicating and incredibly addictive.
DieAntwoord,2yivks,Bookworm12k,8,Tue Mar 10 04:52:08 2015 UTC,I've been following them for 3 months.  I was introduced to them through a trailer of chappie.  I can't get enough of them.  Also the movie for me was 10/10.  Great flick and the whole soundtrack was die antwoord... win win.  Edit:autocorrect.
DieAntwoord,2yivks,bKzor,13,Tue Mar 10 11:03:06 2015 UTC,"be forewarned once you start digging though their past work ( max normal/ maxnormalTV, The Man Who Never Came Back, Constructus Corporation, The Original Evergreen, Watkin Tudor Jones....) you will see this incredible intellectual side ( that personally i prefer over this over produced commercialized hype act they portray)... it almost becomes sort of a sad commentary on the world as w whole that these intellectual acts did not get the recognition they deserved until they assumed these ludacris roles and this zeff act ( yes its an act)"
DieAntwoord,2yivks,cannabiscrusader710,10,Tue Mar 10 12:45:55 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean about it almost being sad that such intellectual people doing their thing for so long and not getting recognized- but at the same time Watkin has always (ever since Max Normal and even before that when he was just Watkin Tudor Jones) been all about taking on new personas and using them to explore new sides of himself, you know? So I kind of look at Die Antwoord as one that finally clicked in- but I don't think they're destined to stay there forever. I read in an interview recently (it might have been the Dazed interview!?) that they're only going to ""be"" DA for five albums and then they're on to something else. I'm SUPER excited about that idea- to see where they're going to go and how they'll change. They're still intellectual beings under all of the awesome zef, I wouldn't change a thing! (Not saying that you would, I just had to shout that all of a sudden.)  :D"
DieAntwoord,2yivks,thiswaythat2,6,Tue Mar 10 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"I've been into them for going on 4 years now (quite rabidly for the first two) and personally prefer their Die Antwoord stuff to all their other projects.  They were necessary pieces to the puzzle and helped them become what they are now, but the low production quality (intentionally so at times) of a lot of the older stuff just makes it hard for my ears to stay interested in.    Sure that probably makes me a bit shallow as a music consumer, but Ten$ion is hands down more pleasing to my ears than The Ziggaraut."

I can appreciate the masterpiece of the characters they've been building up to for years. Really, everyone puts up their own kind of act. Die Antwoord wears it well.  EDIT: I probably wouldn't be a fan of any pre-Die Antwoord albums. It's rare I like more than one album from an artist, let alone three."

DieAntwoord,2yivks,Judge_Dreads,2,Tue Mar 10 19:41:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out MaxNormal.TV's ""Good Morning South Africa"". Unlike their other projects, this one REALLY DOES feel like a Die Antwoord album. It's got Waddy and Yolandi doing pretty much the same thing as in DA, although they have a third guy (Neon Don) who does the more gangster lyrics. It also has a LOT of beats and lyrics that they refer back to in DA tracks (especially on $O$).    Hell, ""Beat Boy"" and ""Super Evil"" are on Good Morning South Africa under different names, and ""Moon Love"" from Donker Mag was originally on Good Morning South Africa verbatim."

Didn't care how good/bad the movie was, I was just STOKED to see them up on the big screen doing their thing and being in a movie for Blomkamp. Like happy for them and happy to watch them. But the movie itself I thought was 'okay'. I wouldn't exactly recommend it to anyone that wasn't a DA fan- but I think I'm in the minority (at least as far as reddit might be concerned!?) because a lot of people seemed to think it was a really good movie.

Edit: Because she sounds like someone who is not really interested but is faking the interest. Fake laughs and just kind of talks to him like hes a child. I mean she really is probably interested in him as her original story kind of launched them but just her tone and exaggerations just were annoying to me."

I think she probably does like him, she's spent enough time with him in the past that she knows what she's getting into, but the way she laughs almost seems fake, or like he makes her a little nervous or something!?  The entire interview I kept thinkin' ""this interview would be 100% better if ANYone other than this woman was talking to him""!"
DieAntwoord,2y55rh,adunn13,3,Fri Mar 6 19:55:34 2015 UTC,She shoulda reigned it in more too. She had too few chime ins and they all were dumb. It shoulda been more of a conversation but there weren't  enough good questions. Ninja just kept going sometimes.

IT'S FUCKING NEXT LEVEL GANGSTA SHIT"
DieAntwoord,2y3frq,flynngravy69,20,Sat Mar 7 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"It is INCREDIBLE!  It is The Story Of Zef.  The movie basically teaches the principles of Zef to the audience.

And they killed it.  edit:  I love how they preserved their dynamic in the movie, as well.  They are a couple and clearly love each other but you never see them kiss or anything."
DieAntwoord,2y3frq,FiftySixer,5,Fri Mar 6 12:34:34 2015 UTC,I don't want to spoil anything but there are some fucking tear jerker moments in this movie and one of the big ones was because of what was going on with Ninja and Yolandi. Ninja can ACT.

Edit: Neil preserves the essence of Die Antwoord the same way Harmony Korine did. These are all great artists, they click. People are cutting Blomkamp down like there's no tomorrow. He makes some of the most personal, visionary blockbusters out there and people's response is ""stop writing, you're shit!"". I can understand these complaints somewhat, but I can't stand for the watering down of an artists vision. The hate is so strong that people are retroactively disliking District 9. I dunno man... I know Blomkamp and his films aren't flawless (even quite flawed at times), but they're still some of the most interesting and original shit we're seeing in mainstream cinema. I thought Chappie was excellent and Die Antwoord were great in it. Shame how things have panned out."

Also, they told Blomkamp the only way they would be in any film would be if they could play themselves. Theres no way to make a movie with them as subplots or secondary characters.

Just putting it out there that in interviews they've often referred to themselves as a 'futuristic' rap crew. ""Futuristic"" because they feel that some day words like that (along with any other taboo words) won't hold any weight because everyone will be equal. They've said a hundred times that DJ Hi Tek is gay, which I assume is their way of saying that they don't have any prejudice against gay people. Yolandi explained herself on instagram a few hours after posting the Drake thing- saying that to her that words just implies you're not a fresh rapper. That you are 'kak', ie: shit.

While they'll definitely change directions before they get there, it would be cool to see what direction they are heading beforehand."

DieAntwoord,2xew2p,ihavenospacebar420,5,Sat Feb 28 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"Sibot and Ninja were on bad terms, but they've buried the hatchet. Sibot is now co producing the Rats Rule album, along with Hi Tek and Muggs.   As far as other collaborators go, I think he's still hostile with Markus Wormstorm and Spoek Mathambo."
DieAntwoord,2xew2p,ThatSnazzyGuy,3,Sat Feb 28 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didn't know Sibot had any involvement in DA. I have so many questions about Max Normal and Constructus Corperation and Waddy's stuff before DA, although I  don't know how appropriate it would be to ask."

I have never heard him talk much about any other members directly besides maybe Sibot.  Ninja & Sibot (DJ Fuck) working on a RR23 Track? https://instagram.com/p/uee_RiJMzd/?modal=true  Right after seeing this, Sibot recently posted a picture of himself and Ninja around 2003 on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/sibotlive/photos/a.10152664237754904.1073741826.318505414903/10153127455034904/?type=1&theater  Check it. :)"
DieAntwoord,2xew2p,MenuBar,3,Sun Mar 1 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"I feel that to fully appreciate Die Antwoord, one needs to see it in the context of their entire catalog of music. Their complete history makes them truly one of the most interesting bands of our time."

She prefers to remain an enigma; an elfin rave avatar whose life story remains relatively undiscussed. “I got irritated with people asking us the same questions,” she says. “Like, ‘Are you a real band?’ Journalists wanted to slay us, tried to cut us down, and I just started caring less and less about doing interviews. With Facebook and Instagram, you kind of don’t need to anyway. But now and again we’ll do something when there’s new information to share.

DieAntwoord,2rq82e,MyPusyTasteLikePepsi,2,Thu Jan 8 09:07:00 2015 UTC,"The festivals cost more because of the acts. Last year Bonnaroo had to pay Elton John 2 mil, with around 500,000 for the other headliners if I'm not mistaken. In conjunction with all the other costs of running a massive festival it's not going to be cheap.   Whereas smaller festivals like iiipoints, bear creek etc are more reasonably priced. Iiipoints cost me 80. Bear creek is around that too. I mean think of how much a good artists costs just to see. Die Antwoord cost me 30$ when I saw them 3 years ago. Now compare that to a concert that's got 15 other artists it's going to be around 60-100.

There's a lot of symbolism in their work that I think is still waiting to be unpacked.   The illuminati stuff doesn't hold much water, and while I think Ninja would agree that he's into some pretty occult shit, the illuminati is not part of his identity. He and Yolandi are outsiders, though and though."

But saying they're part of the illuminati? Off the mark. According to YouTube, every single popular musician is part of the illuminati. There's hundreds of videos of idiots finding triangles in Rihanna or Jay Z's music videos and thinking they're geniuses for it.  A video talking about the occult references in Die Antwoord without the tinfoil would be nice though. I mean, I still don't know what's going on with those Donker Mag symbols."

DieAntwoord,2omfiv,CeciliaLisbon,20,Mon Dec 8 06:03:53 2014 UTC,"Firstly, it's worth noting that Beat Boy was written before Die Antwoord existed.  It appeared on Good Morning South Africa, the MaxNormal.tv album, as ""Rap-Rave Megamix"".  MaxNormal.tv was a very different act from Die Antwoord, despite having the same members.  It was all about satirical, narrative raps based around the device of being sort of ""corporate"".  This actually makes the song even more out of place.  The physical and sexual violence depicted in the lyrics are not that abnormal by Die Antwoord standards, but for MaxNormal.tv, it was really unexpected.  You can see this a number of different ways depending on how you view the work of Waddy and Yolandi in general.  Within the context of Good Morning South Africa, the song is a dark, twisted fantasy, possibly induced by the sketchy drugs Max was coerced to take during Laf Nag.  Within the context of $O$, it's a hyperbolic expression of a quasi-futuristic dystopia a bit more consistent with the established tone of the group.  Your interpretation, though, could be entirely different.  What's most relevant to your question is the fact that Beat Boy is widely regarded as one of the best tracks produced by this group.  The fantastical imagery and vividly twisted lyricism make it one of the prime examples of a sort of chiaroscuro in rap music, similar to horrorcore, but with a more refined sense of urban poetry.  I hope that helps you understand it a bit better on future listenings."
DieAntwoord,2omfiv,thermiter36,7,Mon Dec 8 08:49:28 2014 UTC,"I understand completely... anyone else's interpretation is equally important but I, too, feel that to understand Die Antwoord, ""the answer"", is to understand maxnormal. Otherwise you miss out in the development of an individual idea.  Till this day, when I try to get someone into Die Antwoord, I first show them Songs From the Mall. It's important to ME, if anything."
DieAntwoord,2omfiv,ihavenospacebar420,4,Mon Dec 8 13:20:29 2014 UTC,Die Antwoord are best appreciated within the context of all Waddy's work.
DieAntwoord,2omfiv,ThatSnazzyGuy,1 point,Mon Dec 8 17:55:32 2014 UTC,"He makes many references to later starting the Die Antwoord project on the album ex: ""Max Normal TV is Die Fucking Antwoord"", ""Maybe I should get in with the new rave scene... sport tight little white shorts etc."".  Clearly the album is a transitional piece as Waddy explored new avenues, which included his all-out blitz on a dance-rave track called ""Beat Boy"". Your interpretation, while interesting, is mostly put together with the sort of over-the-top eagle stare that only a true fanboy can submit. I'm not criticizing you by saying this, I'm a huge fan as well, but don't read too much into this stuff. It's good music, but there's a much more practical element to the track appearing on Good Morning South Africa; namely, to see how it'd play with audiences/gather feedback. He was about to try something radically different, and this was one way to test the waters, so to speak. Also, I highly doubt Beat Boy is ""widely regarded as one of the best tracks produced by this group"" as I've never seen it as such, and I find the snippets from the initial video they put out combined with the ""Sail Away"" version do a much better job of playing into their style, while the song itself is nowhere near the level of music that they now put out regularly."
DieAntwoord,2omfiv,im_the_fart_man,3,Fri Dec 19 02:57:14 2014 UTC,"I think it is a tour through the spank bank, the wild thoughts and situations that one person is having as they wank.  Now that I think of it he even says ""I think about you when I masturbate"" and the rest of it is the variety of situations."
DieAntwoord,2omfiv,forest_princess,1 point,Mon Dec 8 14:33:10 2014 UTC,"Beat Boy was the first song Die Antwoord song I ever listened to four years ago. I fell in love with twisted, sexy lyrics and the electronic beat. All I have to say is that if they were to have ever made a music video for the song, it would be in the BDSM section of Pornhub.  P.S. I think everyone should check out Tik Tik Tik by MaxNormal.tv(their project before Die Antwoord was formed), it's pretty fucking great."

DieAntwoord,2omfiv,forest_princess,1 point,Sat Jan 3 13:21:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Zef Side the music video for Beat Boy, it's more of an introduction to who they are, and they just had a bit of fun in front of the camera to one of their songs."
DieAntwoord,2omfiv,Cattoo,0,Sun Jan 4 21:09:28 2015 UTC,Ugh Beat Boy is so funny.   I think at the end he has turned the girl into a demon because she starts speaking Latin at the end.  When I listened to it I thought a lot about German fetishism I think these scenarios are pretty normal in German fetishism.

But the resolution of the image is 1698x1698, and since 1280x720 is considered high definition and 1698 > 1280, I believe my album art is high enough of a resolution to be considered high definition."
DieAntwoord,2l1rvf,selusa,1 point,Sun Nov 2 20:26:05 2014 UTC,"When you can see the pixelation of the font, or artwork in general, it's not true high definition.  You need to use vector artwork or a different font to fix that.  I can take any image and increase the resolution but that doesn't make it high def.  Clarity also helps determines the definition. If the clarity is there, at the resolution, it's high def.  You can't just take a DVD recording, increase resolution, and then label it as a HD DVD.  The clarity has to scale with it."

Very cool, very cute. Ninja looked really touched by the whole thing, like he kind of stopped and said he had never had celebrated his birthday on stage before, and he seemed to chill for a moment and take it all in. Very cool I have video of the happy birthday part, I was right up front. I will post later."
DieAntwoord,2homij,frozenpandaman,1 point,Mon Sep 29 18:20:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I was wondering who that was! Couldn't tell who was on the other side of Yolandi—likely just a friend.

Then when Ninja got close enough to me, I basically ripped off the necklace and handed him the Dassie.  He took it out of my hand and kissed it, then put it on the DJ booth.  A little while later he came back and grabbed my hand and winked at me.  Photo:  http://i.imgur.com/by3qv0o.jpg"

DieAntwoord,2h6og7,ShadowPhotographer,7,Tue Sep 23 01:20:52 2014 UTC,"The beat is sampled from a video game song called Streets of Rage 2.   Of course you can't forget the reference to the Bobby Brown - My Prerogative song (Britney Spears did a cover as well) (""Do what I want to do sweetheart that's my prerogative"")."
DieAntwoord,2h6og7,JiminyPiminy,11,Tue Sep 23 05:28:35 2014 UTC,"""Okay! Bitch! Get the fuck off me! I freak you the fuck out cuz I choose to be free! Fuck your rules! Who are you to tell me! What I can and can't do fuck you bitch you just want to be me!""  Obviously, they're speaking up for their individuality and speaking against conformity. They're saying that people's insecurities evoke them to judge Die Antwoord, when in reality they're just jealous of their uniqueness and ability to not give any fucks. It's scary to be different. But they're honest with themselves, and they don't hide any parts of themselves from anybody; they're raw, open, brutally honest artists... and that scares people. People don't want to be seen as weird, perverse, disturbed, etc. They want to be seen as normal. But we're all crazy on the inside.  I think the thing about love is just thrown in there for a bridge musically. At the same time I think love is important here, because it can be seen that love is important when you're loving yourself for who you are, but also for loving each other no matter who you both or all of you really are. ""Love is strange, love is dark... love is weird, love ain't smart"". Love is what it is: full acceptance, appreciation, and respect. Even if things are weird, stupid, scary, dark, and strange, you can still find a way to love them.  There's a million other things I feel that are in this song, I could go on forever :P"

The meaning of the song is the same regardless.  Edit: I'm curious to know if you can appreciate and experience art as it is. To challenge art is to dismantle it, which destroys the art and the meaning. You could say Shakespeare was just some crazy guy who loved writing shocking plays, but that's not the point. The point is to experience it and take it for the beauty and the experience that it is. Not to think you know better."

She (!!) kept on raising her arms up in the air, and wouldn’t budge when we tried to make her leave... Oh, I can still remember the rancid smell of rotten celery emanating from her underarms. We had to move back. Which sucks, considering how we had waited for a while to get a good spot.  Glad you enjoyed it more than I did!!"

DieAntwoord,2gjqyk,TheDarkKrystal,1 point,Sun Sep 28 08:16:52 2014 UTC,I started off in the fucking pit and made it about halfway through the show there. I kept gettin knocked over and I got claustrophobic and got out of there and enjoyed the show from the outer rim. I'm all bruised! I even have claw-marks from some chola-bitch's manicure cause she thought me bumping into her was directly meant to piss her off. My friend I went with stuck it out in second row and got to touch the Ninja! I had a great time. You?
DieAntwoord,2gjqyk,TheDarkKrystal,2,Sun Sep 28 18:56:31 2014 UTC,"I was about four or five away from the stage, near the center.  Several women left past me half way through.  One might have been you.  When Ninja dove into the audience at the end it was right toward me.  I pushed him up and then the whole crowd pushed back and a bunch of us fell.    We had a great time.  But the opening DJ was kinda tame, and I wish they had played longer."

DieAntwoord,2fxxyb,Xenuphobic,1 point,Tue Sep 9 20:55:38 2014 UTC,"Went to the show in Philly last Fri. night.  Show itself was awesome, although I took a direct stage dive to the forehead, literally the one moment where I was looking away, and was a little woozy/scared I may have gotten a mild concussion, but I digress…    FF to after the show ends. I have this “rule” that I always hang out for a little after (any small-ish show) b/c you never know what might happen.   So I’m waiting around til eventually I got the attention of one of the roadies, and he proceeded to give me the set list for the show.  I was super pumped. It was going right on my wall.    If that wasn’t enough, I start to walk out and I run right in to Sixteen Jones and (who I presume is) her au pair, heading towards backstage.  I didn’t really know what to say (b/c what do you say to a random 9 year old?), so I just said hi.  Not having anything else to say, the only thing I could think of was to ask, if there was any way she could ask them to sign this (with low expectations) .  To my surprise, she seemed agreeable to it and took the set list back w/ her and disappeared.    After waiting a few min, the security guys started to telling everyone that they had to leave…and I started getting worried (having flashbacks to my childhood when I had someone offer to get something of mine signed & I never saw it again).  They tell me to wait by the entrance doors.  I nervously wait, for a good 5-10 minutes, when finally I see her walking out (w/ Sixteen in tow), get her attention and she hands me back the (now augmented) set list.  I thank her profusely and practically skip with joy out of the place, thinking-  Fok….this is like the coolest thing I ever had happened in my whole life :x.    So my question to anyone who might have some expertise (or just an opinion)…who do you think signed it? One  of them?  Both of them?  Sixteen w/ some Crayola crayons?  (And yes I realize some total random could have signed it for them, but I prefer to have faith in humanity)    Thanks for reading my rambling story and go to the damn concert if it even comes close to your city!    TL; DR:     Here is the set-list (for presumably) their current tour (and some cruddy pictures from my camera phone) http://imgur.com/a/mMcIK#0   (Rambling story)   Whodun-signed-it?"

Ninja running around in Pink Floyd boxer shorts, mooning the crowed and stage diving every 5 minutes. Yolandi was doing her cute little prance around the stage in tiny pink shorts and tank top, and then she was all decked out in gold for Rich Bitch. She spend some time wearing a I Love NY hoodie too.  I've been to a lot of shows, and anytime a band has been touring for a few years they start to hate their songs, and they start to hate their fans, and they will go out of their way to avoid playing the songs the fans want to hear, but DA didn't disappoint.

He is a pretty down to earth guy. it seems like if you act like an asshole to him or your just an asshole in general he'll treat you the same.
DieAntwoord,2dg3z7,bcalderon32,16,Wed Aug 13 19:17:32 2014 UTC,This piece in Rolling Stone quotes directly from Die Antwoord's FB page where Ninja replies to the claims made in the City Press piece.
DieAntwoord,2dg3z7,akagugs,-3,Wed Aug 13 19:13:10 2014 UTC,"Still seems like kind of a dick though:  ""Ninja taught the boys a lesson after the show, when he paid them for dancing with them. Ninja told the boys that money is nrg. He said that the more time and nrg u put in2 something you love, the more money you will get from it, and that magic doors will start opening for you in life if you do this. But if you dont give lots of time and energy to something you love, you obviously wont get that much money for it, and all the magic doors in life will stay closed to you.""  The imposition of authority is weird."
DieAntwoord,2dg3z7,opoipo,6,Thu Aug 14 10:42:40 2014 UTC,"I don't really see any kind of imposition of authority other than the fact that they worked for him and he was their boss.. which isn't weird. Otherwise the fact that he is explaining how the world works, in his own way, and that the money he just gave them is more than a means for consumable stuff. Money is also a valuable tool to make more money and to pursue what you love in life. That is what he has learned, that is what he wants to teach younger people. It's actually nice of him to share the wisdom. I can see how you may think though that anyone giving away wisdom is authoritarian, especially when we are associating said wisdom with ideas about money. Money sucks and is a huge problem for almost every person. But that also explains why he is trying to explain to them how it works."

DieAntwoord,2bka9t,buttholemuffin,2,Mon Jul 28 18:53:04 2014 UTC,I think that story was leaked in order to find a leaker of information.  Like tell different people different details and find which one is leaked to find who was leaking the info.

For that type of money the artist could have hired live models, now technically the sources should be paid.  *EDIT, people downvoting me would be interested to see what happens if the photographer who owns that pic of Yolandi were to find out about this artist."

You have no idea what you're talking about.   Edit: Furthermore, to bring this full circle, Yolandi (or someone they work with) used Magic The Gathering art all throughout the little preview snippet video for ""I Don't Dwank"" that they posted earlier this year: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=270552649775964"

The way ninja flows over the beats only works out (IMO) to two possibilities. 1. They have been life long friends who have been making music together since they were kids or 2. Waddy = hi tek.

DieAntwoord,29p4hi,apple_bomb,8,Thu Jul 3 14:18:40 2014 UTC,"the way ninja has repeatedly stated ""dj hitek is gay"" in interviews without  having been asked about his sexual orientation also makes me believe ninja is hi-tek. sure some tracks are made by others but i'd agree that its an ongoing joke.   the reason the gay thing was a clue, for me, was that it seems fitting for ninja to challenge his audience and the media, as he does in many ways. its just one more ""fuck you"" to the world.   i guess i could be wrong, and he could actually be a separate person, and be gay. whateva man."

DieAntwoord,29p4hi,KeredYojepop,8,Fri Jul 4 16:24:10 2014 UTC,It's an ongoing joke. DJ Hi-Tek is someone different in every clip. The actual music is produced by Ninja.

DieAntwoord,29p4hi,whocareswhatever,2,Thu Jul 3 20:58:47 2014 UTC,"Justin absolutely produces all the music since Max Normal. I'm sure Ninja knows enough about music to guide the productions & probably program rudimentary beats or melodies, but the finished music is Justin's work."

DieAntwoord,29p4hi,whocareswhatever,2,Fri Jul 4 15:37:13 2014 UTC,"It's in Russia recently from Ninja's instagram. The thing about not flying is a joke. They did use another DJ for some dates early on, probably because Justin was busy. He runs a studio & produces a LOT of other music."
DieAntwoord,29p4hi,whocareswhatever,1 point,Fri Jul 4 15:46:15 2014 UTC,Okay. What about the whole DJ Hi-Tek being gay thing? Is Justin gay or is the fake character gay just so he has a pass to say faggot?

DieAntwoord,27wc9b,DiederikMrAwesome,7,Wed Jun 11 18:45:29 2014 UTC,You may wanna do some more research before publishing that.
DieAntwoord,27wc9b,whocareswhatever,3,Wed Jun 11 19:48:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I realise that they had a long evolution towards becoming Die Antwoord.  (I saw Ninja in a small pub in Stellenbosch, when he was just known as Max Normal. Distinctly remember him rapping ""You look stupid"" It was great.)  This article was obviously not meant to be exhaustive. I wanted to emphasise the art collaborations as Die Antwoord, as they are now.  I agree, there is lots to write about their musical maturing.  Perhaps someone has written something about that allready?"
DieAntwoord,27wc9b,whocareswhatever,3,Thu Jun 12 18:05:29 2014 UTC,"The specific fact checking & other things to think about...  If you want to start from the beginning you should mention Sean Metelerkamp who took their first photos & filmed Zef Side, basically making a career for himself overnight thanks to Die Antwoord hype.  Leon Botha, whose appearance in Enter The Ninja was a big part of the visual impact of the video, although they didn't use any of his paintings.  Roger Ballen had nothing to do with Enter The Ninja (or Wat Pomp) Ninja just enlarged the style of graffiti art Ballen uses in his photos.  The use of images similar to Jane Alexander's Butcher Boys was completely unauthorized & from what I read almost lead to a lawsuit.  You might also mention Alexander Wang designed some costumes in Fatty Boom Boom & Pitbull Terrier.  The M/C club style logo on Ninjas vest in Pitbull Terrier is based on the character Lobo drawn by Simon Bisley for DC Comics.  I know I'm missing some shit, but I'm not trying to write an article."

DieAntwoord,27wc9b,elsiniestro,-1,Thu Jun 12 03:44:07 2014 UTC,"Dude. You are basically just talking about the last quarter of a long and extremely diverse artistic career. Also you're glossing over the point that Die Antwoord is in itself an art project by a pair of university graduates.    I would suggest writing about who Die Antwoord actually are behind the ""characters"" of Ninja and Yo-Landi -- their personal history and Tudor-Jones' previous projects such as The Original Evergreens, Max Normal, MaxNormal.TV, and The Constructus Corporation."

I was intrigued by their music/videos and all that, but seeing them live is just an experience.  If you have any health problems, stay the f*ck to the back.

Actually Hey Sexy might sample Delia Derbyshire's song... not sure on that one.

DieAntwoord,27haod,spaceparachute,1 point,Sat Jun 7 00:56:43 2014 UTC,"True, samples are different from borrowing melodies. Most of what they do is borrow heavily from other songs rather than sample. Hey Sexy is a combination of a sample as well as a reinterpretation of the song, as is Ugly Boy. I gotta say they must have an excellent lawyer, because unlike an audio sample, recreating someones song should require a co-writer credit = % of publishing."

Listening to their pre Die Antwoord stuff it sounds like they're bringing their new fans back around to their old sound. Moon Love is actually a repeat from an earlier album (so is Beat Boy, but it had a different name- rap rave mega mix ), Good Morning South Afrika, released as maxnormal.tv On that album, Ninja refers to himself as Waddy. (Actually, to prove what a total fanatic I am, that album also has a couple lyrics that made it into the track Evil Boy). My point anyway is that a track like Moon Love would sound totally out of place if it were on SOS, but three albums later it's back. I don't know if it fits, but it's not new."

I was last in SA two months ago and do you know how many music stores actually had Die Antwoord albums? None. I wanted to get Ten$ion for my friend back here and I couldn't find a single copy anywhere. The people I know there who know of them, they like their music but they know it's all an act."

Ten$ion:  Avg rating per track 3.92308.  Donker Mag:  Avg rating per track 3.3125.  So overall I like Donker Mag on average slightly less.

DieAntwoord,27c9yf,MenuBar,2,Thu Jun 5 06:40:09 2014 UTC,"If you included Pompie in your analysis, you might want to recalculate. Nobody really listens to that track more than once or twice. If you reduce it to just the ""burnable"" tracks, I think it might get upwards of a 4."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,spaceparachute,7,Thu Jun 5 11:17:35 2014 UTC,I will say that the songs have a slow and more hip-hop feel as opposed to some of their more techo-rave stuff. But for me the beats just sound amazing and the lyrics are classic Die Antwoord weird. Everyone is entitled to their opinion though. And I'm glad you're still a zef-head
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,selusa,3,Thu Jun 5 03:33:52 2014 UTC,"I disagree about it being less techno-rave. I felt that the new album was heavier on the techno/house influences where they were present (Pitbull Terrier, Sex, Happy Go Sucky Fucky -- This album sounds fucking excellent with a pumping subwoofer), but I was really happy to see the wider range of influences. I didn't expect to see something like Strunk on Donker Mag. It also has a lot more humor which reminds me of Max Normal/Constructus."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,spaceparachute,1 point,Thu Jun 5 14:37:15 2014 UTC,"Completely agree.  Worst album yet.  The album seems rushed on all fronts.    I have a theory... here it goes.    WTJ(Ninja) has had a ton of material that he's kept in his 'bag of tricks' for the past decade or more.  That is obvious because certain songs have appeared consecutively, slightly improved, from project to project.  He's had some mild success but with Die Antwoord, they've BLOWN UP.  With that said-  The material he's been polishing and perfecting over the past X amount of years has run dry.  They're now producing new material in a fraction of the time they spent working on the old material... and it shows.  With that said.... This album is a hot mess.  It follows their theme and fits their personas perfectly though.  It just seems too rushed and rough.   Much heavier on the techno-rave.  Much heavier.  I dig some electronica and edm, but this is just... no.  I rather have had them spend an extra 6 months perfecting this album instead of capitalizing on their sudden fame by trying to pump out new material as soon as possible."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,selusa,4,Thu Jun 5 18:59:47 2014 UTC,"Can you elaborate on how it seems rushed or where you draw your weird, contrived conclusion about Ninja's decade old bag-of-tricks? I dunno man, if you throw around phrases like ""hot mess"" to describe something you should elaborate a bit. Also, wasn't Die Antwoord always supposed to be a Rap/Rave group (The ""Rave"" part implying heavy, danceable electronic music...)?  I felt that the production on this album was quite a bit better and more polished than the last two. I also thought that both Ninja and Yolandi varied their riffs/rhythms quite a bit more than in the last two albums. Yolandi in particular definitely shows that her ability to rap has greatly improved since Ten$ion and $o$.  Further, they added more variety in themes and styles. They haven't done anything singy like Strunk before -- at least not as Die Antwoord -- and this album has some parts that are less aggressive and more humorous. Not every song is just about sex, money, and weed this time around."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,spaceparachute,1 point,Fri Jun 6 14:54:07 2014 UTC,"To me, it comes down to how many times I want to listen to the album.  I put $0$ on repeat almost all day.  Ten$ion I could listen to a ton as well.  Whole album, skits and all.  This album on the other hand I dislike all the skits, they seem like filler instead of being important elements of the album.  They repeat choruses considerably more this time around than on previous records.    Yes, they are a rap/rave group but I just don't care for the heavier rave elements, particularly in Happy Go Sucky Fucky.  Two of my favorite tracks on Ten$ion were Never Le Nkemise 1 & 2.  I loved the progression of those tracks, so I'm not opposed to the rave elements just not digging what they did with HGSF largely.    The production is going to be better, of course, because they are having producers with larger budgets, better studios, etc. helping out.   I'm not saying the album is terrible, there are parts I love (Ugly Boy, Strunk, Sex) but there were a larger amount of songs I just outright don't want to listen to (HGSF, Rat Trap 666) and I could have done without the fillers.  To me, the effort put into making filler could have been put into refining the songs a bit more.    As for the whole 'bag of tricks' thing-  What I mean by that is that WTJwrote material ages ago that he has continued to put into rotation with every reincarnation of his acts.  That material gets re-approached and refined with every new version; they get edited to a point that they made great songs.  I think that that played into their success and that was lost on this album."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,selusa,1 point,Fri Jun 6 15:26:22 2014 UTC,"They aren't working with different producers (except the DJ Muggs cameo)... DJ Hi-Tek is still the same guy. Same guy that did Max Normal.TV too (except for Super Evil, I believe).  I still don't get where you come to your conclusion that Ninja wrote all this stuff ""ages"" or ""decades"" ago... Which material did you think was re-approached or refined? The beat from Girl I Want 2 Eat U can be heard at the beginning of the Fatty Boom Boom music video and the beat in I Don't Dwank shares a melody with the ""Smok-a Da Weed"" skit from Ten$ion but those are the only things that are even close to rehashed from other albums, as far as I can tell...  Anything else you're thinking of specifically that gives you the impression this stuff was written a long time ago? Seems like you're way stretching, unless you have some secret knowledge about Ninja."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,spaceparachute,1 point,Fri Jun 6 15:38:43 2014 UTC,"Moon Love appeared on MaxNormal.TV's Good Morning South Africa  Rap Rave Megamix on MaxNormal.TV's GMSA  = Beat Boy on $0$  Don't Eat Meat on MaxNormal.TV's GMSA = Super Evil on $0$ & Super Evil on WTJ's The Fantastic Kill.  Those are the ones that pop into my head immediately, but there are more.    As for the whole producer comment, I'm not arguing against the fact that album is better produced.  They have more money, more label contacts, more music connections, better equipment, etc.  By all means the production quality SHOULD be good and it is.  I'm just saying the songs sound rough in the sense that some of them feel more like drafts instead of finished pieces in my head."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,selusa,1 point,Fri Jun 6 16:04:19 2014 UTC,"Oooh yeah for some reason I forgot about Moon Love in my post. But that's just one song. How can you infer from them reusing one song from Max Normal on this album that the whole thing was written decades ago? I think it's much more likely that they added that song in because it goes with the sort of ""love"" theme of the album (including a song about their child having a broken heart), not that they just ran out of material or something.  I don't see how you can extrapolate from that that most or all of their material was written long ago. There were a few other songs on $o$ that share beats with songs from MaxNormal.TV too. But don't you think the fact that there aren't any rehashed MaxNormal songs on Ten$ion, and just the one song on Donker Mag seem to imply they're writing more and more material lately?"
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,spaceparachute,1 point,Fri Jun 6 16:22:46 2014 UTC,"No no no, you're confusing what I'm saying.  They HAD a lot of previous material they dipped into to add filler, beats, etc to their albums in the past.  The frequency of them reusing material has dropped.  This album consists mostly of new material.  My point was that WTJ has had a habit of reusing material over the years.  When he reuses the material, it essentially gets edited and updated, it gets refined.   Since this album is using a lot more new material, I don't see the same amount of polish that the previous albums had.  Edit:  TLDR answer of your question-  Yes they are writing new material.  I was commenting on the frequency of them reusing material has been declining."
DieAntwoord,27c9yf,selusa,1 point,Fri Jun 6 16:26:33 2014 UTC,"My bad.  I thought you were theorizing that they were running out of old, pre-written material to use and therefor scraping the bottom of the barrel, giving us Donker Mag.  I now simply disagree with your opinion that Donker Mag is worse than Ten$ion and $o$, rather than thinking you're factually wrong. =P"

DieAntwoord,27c9yf,Skrambles,2,Fri Jun 6 00:08:08 2014 UTC,"There aren't even very many skits... o_o There's one song with a girl laughing a bunch, one short intro track, a tiny Pinky and the Brain reference at the beginning of Raging Zef Boner, and the DJ Hi Tek skit at the beginning of I Don't Dwank which totally rules. They even put the laughing girl on her own track so you can skip her if you want.  Also... where's the other slow song on this album? I'm pretty sure the only one is Strunk. Unless you're including Donker Mag, but that's just the outro track."

DieAntwoord,27ajni,KawaiiGangster,3,Wed Jun 4 14:19:52 2014 UTC,Super Evil off their other album is also a MaxNormal TV song.
DieAntwoord,27ajni,metallisch,2,Wed Jun 4 20:27:23 2014 UTC,Same as the version you hear on Good Moring South Africa.
DieAntwoord,27ajni,zefz,1 point,Wed Jun 4 20:11:00 2014 UTC,Max Normal shall return.
DieAntwoord,279734,TheRealLilB,7,Wed Jun 4 01:42:01 2014 UTC,yes totally.  i love that he has brought back some of the voices he used.  like the voice from constructus corporation
DieAntwoord,279734,stabbinghands,3,Wed Jun 4 06:34:34 2014 UTC,The inclusion of a somewhat wider range of genres/styles also gives me a Max Normal vibe.
DieAntwoord,279734,spaceparachute,5,Thu Jun 5 03:31:06 2014 UTC,"Not ""Max Normal/MaxNormal.TV"", but more like ""Waddy"", yes absolutely. I was already thinking it, but Raging Zef Boner came on and cemented it. Reminds me a lot of Y Front."
DieAntwoord,279734,LSDXM,8,Wed Jun 4 23:19:17 2014 UTC,"Yup! I hear it, too. I think this album is already way, way better than the other two albums they've released so far as Die Antwoord."
DieAntwoord,279734,YellowElevator,12,Wed Jun 4 16:46:55 2014 UTC,"You know, I do too. Doesn't seem to be the popular opinion, but it's the one I have."
DieAntwoord,279734,kllys,3,Wed Jun 4 20:08:46 2014 UTC,"I pretty much agree with every other comment. I also think this is the best Die Antwoord album, and much of that is because they called back to bits and pieces of previous projects in a great way. It also has a ton of variety for that reason as well."
DieAntwoord,279734,Razorshroud,5,Wed Jun 4 23:22:18 2014 UTC,Hell yes.  I like this. I think they finally have the resources to produce their ideal music as they very first envisioned.
DieAntwoord,279734,Lout_rampage,2,Wed Jun 4 10:20:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, I did right off the bat even just from hearing a sampler of the album."
DieAntwoord,279734,Mistressquestion,2,Wed Jun 4 21:26:26 2014 UTC,"More a Fantastic Kill vibe, in my opinion. Zef Boner sounds a lot like Drunk by Name to me, especially the hook. Love that album, and I know I'll love this one too."
DieAntwoord,279734,MenuBar,1 point,Fri Jun 6 04:17:09 2014 UTC,"Yep, there's a sort of narrative storyline tying several of the songs together."

DieAntwoord,2776lg,Mad6amer,15,Tue Jun 3 20:38:01 2014 UTC,"Man, I love Strunk! Its like a waltz/love song, but all fucky-wonkey.  loveit loveit loveit  Girl I Want 2 Eat U should have been their single.  To me, this album feels like a brilliant echo back to their Max Normal ""storytelling"" days."

DieAntwoord,2776lg,Steezem,2,Wed Jun 4 06:32:08 2014 UTC,"After listening to it a couple of times I like it, but not that much. Usually I have to get used to many of their songs untill I get to a moment that I can't stop listening to them.  Either Strunk needs more time, or I can't really get into it."

DieAntwoord,272asj,harleenfrances,2,Mon Jun 2 00:39:18 2014 UTC,"i think they kind of have to bc of the way they edit her voice on the albums. when she sings live you can definitely hear it bc her voice becomes much more shrill when she tries to get it to go really high, to where she's almost screaming.  but it don't matter cause she always brings it."

The songs are getting increasingly unoriginal, the lyrics increasingly simplified. There were a few good moments, and this is based off of a single listen, so maybe it will grow on me."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,MindlessMind,2,Fri May 30 23:00:56 2014 UTC,"I felt the same way after my first listen. $O$ and Ten$ion felt like they really tried and put themselves into the music and Donker Mag came off very lackluster and nothing stuck out too much. After playing it three or four more times, it definitely grew on me, and quickly. Ugly Boy, Girl I Want 2 Eat U, and Rat Trap are great songs. It features more YoLandi and Ninja doesn't go as hard but it's still amazing."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,BuriedAlive636,3,Fri May 30 23:23:22 2014 UTC,"I'm with you guys. I love $O$, Ten$ion grew on me (Fatty Boom Boom drew me in to giving the rest repeated listens), I'm not sure about this. Ugly Boy, Girl I Want 2 Eat U and Rat Trap are the best on the album (I think Raging Zef Boner is okay too, and maybe I Dont Dwank after the beat drops), but I'm not sure about great. I definitely prefer Good Morning South Africa to either of the newer albums actually.  The lyrics definitely seem dumbed down and flat (though maybe I've been listening to too much Constructus Corporation and the storyline adds a lot of complexity) and there's a lot of sing-song stuff instead of rapping."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,likebuttermilk,3,Sat May 31 19:47:34 2014 UTC,"Sounds like you enjoy most of the album. I do agree w/ dumbed down lyrics like rhyming words w/ the same fucking word again but I like to think it's supposed to be funny. I expect in the future they're gonna go further back into deeper shit like Constructus & MaxNormal, this album is like a bridge & the next will be more inaccessible for lack of a better term."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,whocareswhatever,3,Sat May 31 23:16:44 2014 UTC,"It's alright - I do actually dislike Pitbull Terrier and Strunk and the skits seem long and silly, but even among what I like, I don't really like any of them. It's listenable but if I wasn't already a fan this wouldn't have me coming back. Bring on the inaccessible, ha!"
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,likebuttermilk,1 point,Sat May 31 23:40:43 2014 UTC,"I do agree w/ bring on the inaccessible. To be blunt fans are being talked down to which is unnecessary at this point in their career, I chalk it up to a cultural translation issue."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,whocareswhatever,4,Sun Jun 1 00:40:27 2014 UTC,"I think it's a perfect album for them right now. It's a new kind of music not relying on cliches except ones they invented or resurrected & blew up. I could personally do without the ""skits"" and Rat Trap 666 is just a goof, sounds like a demo. Kinda wish they'd included Xpen$ive $hit so it would be available on CD & vinyl for people who want it. Also I think they could really increase their fanbase if they were to provide ""stems"" or sets of samples for fans & other producers to make remixes to better suit club styles. Pitbull Terrier I think could make a great remix EP on it's own, I've heard a few attempts at remixes just off the vid audio & they're cool, but so much could be done with real separated tracks & since their voices are so unique it's all good press for DA. Like I said somewhere else, it seems to lean back toard MaxNormal.TV with the humor & fun/happy aspects & that's totally cool."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,whocareswhatever,3,Fri May 30 18:59:20 2014 UTC,"I can see why people don't like it, but I love it. Feels like a more balanced album of the old and new.  Ten$ion is great because every song is a banger.   This has more of a mix. I love Happy Go Sucky Fucky, Raging Zef Boner, and Girl I Want 2 Eat U because, not only are they fucking hilarious, they're loud and feature some of the best production.   But Strunk, Rat Trap, I Don't Dwank, and Moon Love/Donker Mag are interesting because they're very different, sometimes referencing their older work.   And unlike most people, I thought the skits were hilarious except Pompie which was just annoying."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,alucidexit,4,Sun Jun 1 07:20:21 2014 UTC,"I must be in the minority because I really like Pitbull Terrier. I didn't think much of it at first but it's really grown on me. Also Ninja does the song in the Pitbull mask when they do it live, which to me is pretty awesome."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,Lout_rampage,3,Sun Jun 1 22:33:48 2014 UTC,"I honestly feel like there is not enough Afrikaans. $0$ was a lot of Afrikaans, Ten$ion was a little bit less, and Donker Mag has the least so far. I kind of miss the sound of angry Afrikaans, but maybe that's just me."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,spamonkey24,3,Wed Jun 4 01:41:57 2014 UTC,"Ugly boy samples Aphex Twin's Ageispolis. I know it's not the same as a track together, but that's where that came from.   As far as my thoughts on the album go, I've always loved Cookie Thumper. I've only heard everything else once so far. Pitbull terrier I didn't think much of, but I really loved Raging Zef Boner and Girl I want 2 eat U. Really nice variety and I think they tick all the boxes for things I love about the duo. The rest of the album needs time to sink in I think, I rarely love a song first listen, so I think I will come to appreciate the rest with time, possibly and quite probably pitbull terrier aswell."
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,MARIOCAT,3,Fri May 30 11:41:12 2014 UTC,Some pretty awesome tracks on that one. Especially Girl I Want 2 Eat U is incredible. I'll second your opinion on Afrikaans though. Would have loved at least one song in it. But all in all an amazing album!
DieAntwoord,26v4ia,scooksen,1 point,Fri May 30 15:13:21 2014 UTC,"I think the album is great up through Pitbull Terrier (minus the skits, which I never cared for), but then the quality drops off fairly quickly in my opinion. Strunk was an interesting change of pace, but it really didn't click with me and it was probably the first Die Antwoord song that I had no interest in listening to again anytime soon. Rat Trap sounds like something that would come off of a B-sides or EP. I thought the beginning of I Don't Dwank was great, but everything after was fine but forgettable.  I definitely want to give it a few more listens before rendering a final verdict, but at this point I wish the high energy from the first half, especially the amazing Happy Go, lasted through the entire album."

DieAntwoord,26sj5q,dylanger,5,Thu May 29 15:21:22 2014 UTC,"After the Pitbull Terrier video and Happy Go Sucky Fucky near the beginning, I immediately was hoping there would be some kind of total dark twist on a DA/KMFDM crossover rap rave mega mix. There are a few good ones but I was immediately let down by Rat Trap, as the build up left me expecting it to be epic. Raging Zef Boner was good, and though I wish they'd cut out the skits, Ninja showing off in Zars was a little funny. I really wish they'd grow past so many South Aftican Big Star references, after Ten$ion I figured they would have aired all of that out enough that everyone gets it.  While I think a bit more out of house production might have actually done this album some good, I also enjoyed the character development and the even more regressed Yo Landi lines and giggles, Strunk was pretty cute and I thought the Moon Love throwback was good but honestly, couldn't they have spent some time updating it. Overall happy, but know they could have done better. Like I said one or two more solid dark rave mixes would have made this album the shit if they tightened up the tone on the other tracks too. Would have like to have seen Ninja's lyrics grow a little more as well, because even Yo Landi's regression progression seems more developed this time around. Seriously.  Also, come to Detroit motherfuckers."

They're clearly not looking for mainstream attention at this point & it comes across as more musical & thoughtful to me, where as the bangers on Ten$ion were mindblowing, you wanna listen to death but then grow tired of them, this seems more listenable.

Overall they played basically their best songs from $O$ and Ten$ion, plus those Donker Mag songs. The show was amazing.

DieAntwoord,260uxr,balance07,2,Wed May 21 02:11:34 2014 UTC,Interesting. There are no Die Antwoord songs that I skip over. They're all too lovely! Maybe I just think $O$ is better because I was hooked on Die Antwoord way before Ten$ion even came out...
DieAntwoord,260uxr,cannellbd,1 point,Wed May 21 03:13:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah I mean I was a fan before the physical SOS release, but still like Tension better. Tension feels ""more DA"" to me, as so much of SOS was put together from pre-DA stuff. Tension feels like the firat real DA album. Also, there is the difference between the 2009 'internet version"" and 2010 ""official version"" of SOS. Loads of filler in the 2009, but some great tracks were cut for the 2010 (like the fly away mother fucker remix). My feelings about it all are pretty complicated."
DieAntwoord,260uxr,balance07,2,Wed May 21 05:10:44 2014 UTC,"I think the internet version was better. On the physical version I really miss Wat Pomp and those mellow tracks in the middle, and I don't think the new songs quite gel with the others."

DieAntwoord,260uxr,IrresponsiblePenguin,4,Tue May 20 12:26:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like he kinda dumbed it down because if you see the live video of the first time they performed it from their performance in Paris last year, his verse is much faster and more complicated."
DieAntwoord,260uxr,SuperDuperBranflakes,3,Wed May 21 03:12:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah it took my a few listens to get into it too. Although I gotta disagree about the first verse - I think it's pretty good.

DieAntwoord,24xn74,makesyoumoist,1 point,Wed May 7 06:57:31 2014 UTC,"That would be awesome indeed as Die Antwoords videos are quite a visual treat (ive noticed that even people who don't like the music much still enjoy the music videos). Unlikely, however, as the market for that is practically nonexistent.   5.1 would be pointless, though, as the original mixes are 2.1 (unless im wrong). I just mean there would be no benefit to 5.1 unless the songs themselves were initially mixed for all those additional channels.   But a proper high quality 1080 version of the videos would be nice to have as youtube's compression leaves a lot to be desired.   You could always download the videos as they exist today from youtube/wherever and resave them with a high quality .flac or .wav rip from the original cds. The end would give you a video with the same video quality but better audio quality than what exists on youtube etc. Wouldnt take too much time, just the right tools, and a couple of hours of rendering them when saving."

DieAntwoord,1yodho,ihatecentipede,2,Sun Feb 23 04:51:11 2014 UTC,they said February but then never actually gave a release date...I bet it's not out until March.
DieAntwoord,1xlwz8,Philophobie,6,Tue Feb 11 12:40:48 2014 UTC,"""Sometime in February"" has been all I've heard from their facebook page etc. I'd really like an actual date too, however it shouldn't be too long."
DieAntwoord,1xlwz8,XDHawkster,6,Tue Feb 11 14:56:57 2014 UTC,I need that shit now!    I thought I read on their latest Facebook post March.  Which is one month later than what they had been saying.
DieAntwoord,1xlwz8,theghostpepper,2,Tue Feb 11 21:59:15 2014 UTC,"sounds about right. Yo-Landi's post yeterday or two days ago said ""Now to finish this fokin album"" or something along those lines. February seems a bit unlikely"
DieAntwoord,1xlwz8,wesjall,3,Sun Feb 16 16:51:37 2014 UTC,"Well, we know Cookie Thumper was released a month later than expected due to Ninja and Yolandi's (mostly Ninja's) obsession with making sure everything they put out is exactly how they envision it. So my guess is that is why they haven't put an official release date on it yet. They're gonna give it to us good, so patience will be more than worth it."
DieAntwoord,1xlwz8,VortexOfTime,0,Tue Feb 11 18:58:13 2014 UTC,FEB 28th
DieAntwoord,1x7m8c,Thumpar,8,Thu Feb 6 20:59:09 2014 UTC,"Either that, or he's being a huge kiss-ass in an attempt to apologize."

DieAntwoord,1x7m8c,Msmadmama,1 point,Thu Feb 6 21:06:26 2014 UTC,They had posted the article talking about Ninja being written out earlier today in Facebook. But it appears they may have deleted it (cause I can't find it now) then posted the kiss assy sounding one.
DieAntwoord,1x7m8c,eQUIV,1 point,Fri Feb 7 00:30:06 2014 UTC,"The main reason this sounds like bullshit is because Ninja and Yolandi are the leads of the movie. There's no way they could just write out Ninja, he's a main character. They could replace him, but I'm sure Yolandi would walk too. Chances of them replacing both lead characters this far into production.. Unlikely. The original article is bullshit."
DieAntwoord,1x7m8c,oddsonicitch,1 point,Sat Feb 8 12:11:05 2014 UTC,The original made it sound like he was written out of a scene with Hugh Jackman and Sharlto Copley had to cover it.
DieAntwoord,1x7m8c,FizzBitch,1 point,Mon Feb 10 19:55:08 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure that Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver and Sharlto Copley are the leads."
DieAntwoord,1x7m8c,eQUIV,1 point,Mon Feb 10 17:53:41 2014 UTC,"Don't think so. Here is the movie plot they released:  ""After being kidnapped by two criminals during birth, Chappie becomes the adopted son in a strange and dysfunctional family. Chappie is preternaturally gifted, one of a kind, a prodigy. He also happens to be a robot.""   The ""two criminals"" are played by Ninja and Yolandi. Basically they play the adopted parents of Chappie the robot. They are the leads along with Sharlto Copley, who does the voice of Chappie."

DieAntwoord,1x12jt,shimonaanvil,18,Tue Feb 4 23:24:53 2014 UTC,"The article doesn't say that he was written out. Why would anyone break a confidentiality agreement with a big-ass hollywood movie to speak to some shitty sensationalist journalist. This guy, Charl Blignaut obviously has a problem with Die Antwoord, he has previously written like 5 negative articles about them. Don't believe everything you read just because its in a newspaper."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,AliceCreed,2,Wed Feb 5 07:09:16 2014 UTC,"I also noticed when listening to Die Antwoord, they have dissed all of the people they used to work with (Spoek Mathambo, Markus Wormstorm, etc.).   This has always been kind of distressing, but I rationalized it as the possibility that those people did something to legitimately piss DA off and gave the band the benefit of the doubt. If the latest reports are true--and time will tell--their faux arrogant personas will vanish, dissilusionment will set in and DA will have one less fan.  I hope this is manufactured buzz but I really can't see the point of doing that. There are too many different sources for the allegations to be completely made up, particularly from an author that has attacked them before.   edit: There's some audio with the article's author here. I can't listen to it at the moment to tell if there are any new details revealed."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,oddsonicitch,11,Wed Feb 5 04:16:57 2014 UTC,Doesn't this strike anyone else as a deliberate and orchestrated extension of the Ninja character? Waddy is clever and I bet Blomkamp is in on it!
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,Krapulator,6,Wed Feb 5 20:55:31 2014 UTC,That would be some serious Andy Kaufman shit.
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,Babelwasaninsidejob,3,Wed Feb 5 08:59:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'd imagine a lot of subscribers here aren't familiar with Watkin's work before Die Antwoord. He has a history of combining music with performance art."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,RedshiftRider,6,Wed Feb 5 15:01:13 2014 UTC,Die Antwoord wrote that this isn't true  http://gyazo.com/6b8e7a628eae1f37535b13d1242f9dec.png
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,BluntSmokinAnus,11,Wed Feb 5 18:29:19 2014 UTC,"If true, that's just really disappointing. This makes it seem like he's becoming more of a parasite than a creator."

DieAntwoord,1x12jt,mister_mishap,3,Wed Feb 5 03:53:48 2014 UTC,I guess it's not really surprising. Ninja seems like a pretty abrasive guy. Still love Die Antwoord and their next level $hit!
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,cannellbd,2,Wed Feb 5 04:06:13 2014 UTC,"This article is making me unsub from this subreddit.  I enjoy the music, and learning about the musicians and drama behind it all too often distracts from the music."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,ferrarisnowday,10,Wed Feb 5 00:45:12 2014 UTC,This is the first article I've actually seen posted about Die Antwoord. Are you really that distraught over one article?
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,cannellbd,1 point,Wed Feb 5 02:36:07 2014 UTC,"There was another one a while back about Evil Boy.  I'm not distraught, I just don't care about the drama."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,ferrarisnowday,5,Wed Feb 5 03:30:57 2014 UTC,"The truth usually lies somewhere in-between. The more I think about this article the more I think it's sensationalized. I find it believable that Ninja was overbearing and not being sensitive of people's boundaries - he's an intense guy, an artist, and entrepreneur etc. But when you start slamming vegans for not eating vegetarian food I have to call shenanigans.  When you criticize successful rap artists (or anyone really) for drinking Veuve Clicquot that's bullshit.  There's nothing in their persona public or otherwise that leads you to believe they wouldn't. Also whatever arraignment Ninja and Yolandi have is between them.  If Ninja hits on women in front of Yolandi it's probably because she's ok with it. Plenty of people have open or polyamorous relationships and if this author thinks it's ok to cirtizice people for consensual sexual relationships he's wrong. Was Ninja overzealous in hitting on women on set? Probably.  Did Ninja try to give his friend space cakes? Probably.  Did Ninja tell two no name actors how to do their jobs? Probably.  But what do you expect when you bring two crazy musicians onto a set?  After all wasn't Ninja brought in specifically for this kind of energy.  Isn't this the roll he's playing?  No one critizes Daniel Day Lewis for walking around like he's Abraham Lincoln all day.   So what are we really talking about here?  In the overseas we call it 'sex drugs and rock & roll' and we know to expect it.  Btw, Ninja if you're reading this and those pics are with Yolandi hook us up dude. Just sayin..."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,Babelwasaninsidejob,2,Wed Feb 5 04:13:56 2014 UTC,"Pure Evil? None of this sounds remotely evil to me. They are pretty new to fame, it affects people, changes them or exaggerates their normally rash and wild behavior, in public and private. I'm embarrassed for him if its true that he doesn't show his Yo-Landi the respect she deserves. Poly or open relationship or not, never disrespect your partner. I feel like Miss Yo-Landi is Ninjas little puppy sometimes, and goes along with whatever her Ninji wants."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,PRgirl888,2,Wed Feb 5 16:52:08 2014 UTC,"Seems like Yahoo News has picked-up this story...  http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/rapper-branded--pure-evil--on-hugh-jackman-film-104008101.html  Anyways, I get serious Andy Kaufman vibes while reading both these stories. It's either a complete bullshit fabricated story, or Watkin is purposely acting out to commit to the ""Ninja"" persona. I guess we'll know soon enough, if Ninja is actually cut from the movie then there is likely some truth to the story. I don't buy it."
DieAntwoord,1x12jt,eQUIV,5,Wed Feb 5 21:03:37 2014 UTC,I love their music but this just seems like they are full of themselves.

DieAntwoord,1x12jt,Dordo3,2,Wed Feb 5 00:52:55 2014 UTC,Did you read the article? He was written out of a scene with Hugh Jackman because apparently Blomkamp didn't want to deal with him in the scene. He's in the movie though.

Or if you do change, do it very gradually, linearly, in a way that feels 'natural'. Change too quickly or drastically, and you'll be accused of faking it.""

DieAntwoord,1nby4h,HairyBalloonKnot,13,Sat Sep 28 20:37:38 2013 UTC,tl;dr Wanga (the guy who raps in Evil Boy) is a bit of an asshole.
DieAntwoord,1nby4h,grafittibob,8,Sat Sep 28 22:32:18 2013 UTC,"Formatting and stuff and liberties taken with sentences beginning with 'Then'.  DIE ANTWOORD WANGA  PART1  K so here'z da scoop about Wanga kids. Let's start at the very beginning.  So... Ninja met ¥o-landi a loooooong time ago on a strange little farm in Cape Town. Now on the farm lived a creepy old man with big beard and fat tummy called Andre. Andre didn't own the farm, he just squatted there. But in South Africa if you squat on government land for long enough, you can't get kicked off that easily, especially if you tell everyone that the farm is a 'shelter' for street kids.  ¥o-landi used to stay on this farm for a while when she didn't have a place to stay, back when she was 19 years old. ¥o-landi's best friend on the farm was a sweet kid called Wanga (who we'll come back to in a bit).  ¥o-landi started getting a bit freaked out when (50-something year old) Andre started writing her love letters saying that he wanted to 'be with her'. ¥ got even more freaked out when Andre (who likes drinking lots of red wine and painting pictures in his spare time) asked ¥o-landi if he could take some nude fotos of her. It was Ninja who finally convinced ¥o-landi to move off the farm when Wanga (and some other boys from the farm) showed Ninja and ¥o-landi a secret box, that Andre kept hidden on the farm. Inside this box were lots and lots of fotos of nude girls (who had visited or stayed on the farm) that Andre had taken fotos of. (None of these photos were ever turned in2 paintings by the way.)  So when Ninja eventually 'stole' ¥o-landi from the farm shortly after this, Andre freaked the fuck out and has been fuckin pissed off with Ninja ever since.  PART 2  When this recent big new hit that that Ninja and ¥o-landi are going to be starring in a big hollywood movie, some haters lost their fuckin minds, and all of a sudden, people (who we have nothing to do with) start crawling out the woodwork with all sorts of ridiculous claims. One of the people being old creepy old Andre, who recently told Wanga to go to the newspapers with his story, which, by the way, was missing quite a few juicy details.  So after Ninja stole ¥o-landi from the farm (some time ago) her and Ninja would visit the farm from time to time to hang out with Wanga and some of the other kids. At this point in time Wanga (and some of the naughty boys from the farm) had just got out of Pollsmoor prison for getting up to mischief again. But Ninja and ¥o-landi just loved Wanga because he was just so cool, and fun, and just kind of like, a lost soul, looking for direction in life.  Back when Die Antwoord was just starting out, N+¥ got an idea to teach the boys from the farm some dance routines and show them what it was like to perform in front of a crowd. Then Ninja hand-painted some track suits for the boys and the boys danced with N+¥ during one of their shows, which was a super fun experience 4 everyone.  Ninja taught the boys a lesson after the show, when he paid them for dancing with them. Ninja told the boys that money is nrg. He said that the more time and nrg u put in2 something you love, the more money you will get from it, and that magic doors will start opening for you in life if you do this. But if you dont give lots of time and energy to something you love, you obviously wont get that much money for it, and all the magic doors in life will stay closed to you.  PART 3  Then anyway, just after this concert Wanga told N+¥ about a little problem he was having. Wanga told them that everytime he went home to visit his mom in the hood, the men from the hood would hit him and tease him because Wanga was not circumsized. Wanga told N¥ that he was too scared to go to the bush to get circumsized to become a 'man'. Every year hundreds of kids die (or get left with tragic penis problems) from this old school Xhosa custom, which Ninja thought was a bit silly.  Now around about this same time, Ninja and ¥o-landi were working on a new track called EVIL BOY. This track was based on Ninjas EVIL BOY tattoo (that Ninja got a loooooong time b4 all of this.) So when Wanga told Ninja about this little problem he was having, and what he was expected to do to 'become a man', Ninja lifted up his sleeve, pointed at his EVIL BOY tattoo, and said: ""Yo Wanga, why don't you just stay 'EVIL BOY 4 life' like me?"" And Wanga smiled a big, relieved smile.  Then Ninja asked Wanga if he wanted to try something fun, and Wanga said, ja! Ninja told Wanga that he was busy working on a track with ¥o-landi called EVIL BOY, and that it would maybe be cool if Wanga kicked a rap verse on this track in Xhosa with them.  PART 4  Now Wanga didn't know anything about rapping, but Ninja said he could maybe teach Wanga how to rap. The 1st thing Ninja taught Wanga was that the best stuff to rap about is real life stuff.  Ninja told Wanga that he was busy writing his own 'evil ninja' rap verse, and Yo-landi was writing her own 'evil witchy' rap verse.   Then Ninja got the idea to write a rap verse for Wanga based on this Xhosa innitiation Wanga was trying to get out of. Then Ninja and ¥o-landi wrote a hype rap verse for Wanga. And Wanga helped Ninja translate the lyrics to Xhosa. Then Ninja rapped the Xhosa verse on a beat (that his homie Diplo made for him). Then Ninja gave the rap to Wanga on CD to learn. Then N+¥ took Wanga into a studio for the 1st time and Wanga copied how Ninja rapped. Then Ninja and Yo-landi showed Wanga how to rap some extra stuff on the EVIL BOY chorus they had written, and the track came out real cool! And this is how Wangas raps on the Evil Boy song got made.   (Just a little quick note here kids: Wanga told the papers recently that N+¥ based their EVIL BOY character on Wangas EVIL BOY 'artwork'. This is just one of the delirious little fibs Wanga slid into his dodgy story. Just for the record: Ninjas EVIL BOY tattoo was stuck into Ninja's arm looooong before Wanga kicked his verse on the EVIL BOY song) But anyway, lets carry on with this fun little story here...  PART 5  So because the EVIL BOY track turned out so well, Ninja told Wanga, that he could carry on training with him to learn how to make more songs... and that IF Wanga worked hard, N+¥ would even maybe take Wanga on tour overseas with them!  N+¥ paid Wanga a logical fee for his performing the verse they had written for him, and again Ninja said: ""The more time and nrg you put into the things you love, the more money you will get, and the more doors will open for you in life.""  However, after Wanga started getting a bit attention from people (and cute girls!) from his hype vocals on the EVIL BOY song... Wanga suddenly started acting a little strange. The 1st time N+¥ noticed this strange behaviour was when they flew Wanga up to Johannesburg to help them make the EVIL BOY video they were working real hard on.  Ninja and ¥o-landi were working hands-on (as usual) with a hype little team to create the massive hand-made sets for the Evil Boy video. But when Wanga arrived at the film studio and Ninja and ¥o-landi asked him to help them... Wanga (who had just smoked a fat joint he got from someone) asked them if he could rather just go to the hotel to 'chill out'.  And suddenly...Wanga was a rock star! Later when Ninja tried to teach Wanga how to rap with them during live shows, more problems started popping up. Wanga would get stoned and drunk before every show, even though N+¥ had told him to NEVER get wasted before a show, because it's important to always be fresh, and furious and focussed every time you step to da mic.  N+¥ finally decided to take a little break from working with Wanga after he got FUCKED UP wasted the night before a massive new years concert he was supposed to perform at, and went missing. N+¥ later found out that Wanga missed his flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg because he was passed out comatose after parting the whole night with some homies in town.  A few days later Wanga got hold of N+¥ and said he was really sorry and begged them to give him another chance. But working with Wanga took up SOOO much unnecesarry time and nrg that N¥ told him it would be healthy if he did his own thing for a while."
DieAntwoord,1nby4h,checkmeoutnow,3,Mon Sep 30 19:43:12 2013 UTC,"PART 6  Wanga kept on phoning N+¥ and sending them messages begging them to let him rap his verse with them everytime he found out they were rapping anywhere. Wangas big love for performing live definitely had a little bit to do with all the attention he got from girls after the concerts he rapped at.  So N+¥ gave Wanga another chance to rap with them at a concert that was a few hours drive outside of Cape Town. Wanga got his new girlfriend to give him a lift to the concert. But...when Wanga got to the concert, he told his girlfriend she wasnt allowed back-stage!  Then Wanga rapped with N+¥ again and this time, everything went quite well. But after the show Wanga partied in the back-stage area with all his NEW girlfriends (he hooked-up back-stage passes for) and again Wanga got super fuckin wasted and partied till da early morn.  Before they left the concert, N+¥ asked Wanga if he was going to need a lift home the next day, and Wanga said: ""No thanks, I'm sorted guys!"" But the next day, while N+¥ were about to get into town after a 2 hour drive, Ninja got a call from the promoter of the concert, who then passed the phone to Wanga who was crying because his girlfriend had broken up with him (for some reason) and left him'stranded' miles and miles away from town.  A sobbing Wanga asked Ninja and ¥o-landi if they could please come back and fetch him! Eventually the concert promoter offered to give Wanga a lift home later after they had 'packed up' the concert.  Then N+¥ said to each other: ""Fuck! EVERY single time we work with Wanga, he dwanks out. He's not taking this music stuff seriously!"" And again they decided to take another little break from working with him.  But once again, Wanga begged and pleaded with N¥ to give him 'one last chance' and once again, N+¥ let Wanga rap with them at another little concert in Cape Town. But when Wanga arrived at the soundcheck in the middle of the day before the show, stinking of alcohol, N+¥ thought to themselves: ""Shit, this isn't gonna work! Here we go again!"" Wangas drunken 'performance' much later that night was obviously fuckin weak.  PART 7  Around this time Ninja and ¥o-landi started hearing all kinds of controversial stories from different people about Wanga: -That Wanga was irritating the fuck out of their friends asking for dwanky favours the whole time -That Wanga walked out of a skate-parks with someone else's board(which nearly got him fucked up) -That Wanga stole a super expensive camera from some dude who was visiting from overseas, after the dude did a photo-shoot with Wanga. -And that Wanga stole a car and crashed it (fucked up drunk) into the parliament buildings in Cape Town, then ran away from the scene of the crime. Now none of this stuff really mattered to Ninja and ¥o-landi.  All that mattered to them was that Wanga did not take this music stuff very seriously, which was a bit of a let-down for them, because it had now upset their friendship with Wanga. Whenever N+¥ bumped into Wanga in the streets of Cape Town from time to time, they didn't say anything about all these dodgy stories they had been hearing, but the conversation was always kind of awkward, cause N+¥ didn't really have anything to say to Wanga.  PART 8  So anyway, Wanga just got out of Pollsmoor Prison recently (for the 2nd time), then decided to go to the papers, and say how Die Antwoord 'expoited him'. But our sweet little Wanga twisted a few facts here and there, and also left out all the fun stuff in this here note.  So there you have it kids. You guys now have 2 sides to this little story. But with all this said, we still love Wanga. He's just a bit lost, and getting 'guidance' from the wrong people... And if one day, Wanga says sorry to us for being naughty and telling lies... Maybe we'll even give him another chance... but lets see. That's all for now folks. Increase da Peace. Keep it real. Once N¥ out"

We youtube that sh*ts - same video.  We spend three hours on youTube and obsessively  watch everything we can find, getting mad smashed on beers all the while.   also: notice at some point in those three hours that a sleazy-but-popular karaoke / dance ""pub"" that we frequently visit has been playing some of the songs for months / years.   That is the tri-force of how i discovered Die fokken Anwoord."

DieAntwoord,1bvf3a,R3DhandedJill,4,Mon Apr 8 17:58:24 2013 UTC,"I actually don't think this is her either. The track was released in 2001, so the kid talking would have to be around 2-3 years old, which would make them about 14-15 years old now, and I don't think their daughter is that old. But check out this track!"

DieAntwoord,1bvf3a,Critcho,3,Mon Apr 8 11:45:58 2013 UTC,"It's a really good edit, so the intonations are altered as well with plenty of variation.  However the rhythm of the vocal tracks are the same down to the syllable,  even the afrikaans words are spoken the same way."
DieAntwoord,1bvf3a,Thermington,4,Mon Apr 8 14:15:47 2013 UTC,"I'm still not sure... like listen to the pronunciation on 'drink my five roses tea with a biscuit' - she rolls the 'r's on the original version, but they seem smooth on this one."

DieAntwoord,191868,HrubyDoo,3,Fri Feb 22 18:26:24 2013 UTC,My Spotify Die Antwoord playlist is basically a Max Normal playlist at this point in the game.  Spotify is the best out of the three because you can search a specific song and listen to it right when you want.
DieAntwoord,191868,futurefree,2,Fri Feb 22 21:10:17 2013 UTC,Not as many commercials either. Max Normal is nice.
DieAntwoord,18zfwb,cerulean_blue,5,Thu Feb 21 23:01:31 2013 UTC,"Are you familiar with a lot of their stuff? If so, go to their official website and it should open to a free mp3 of Dis Iz Why I'm Hot which is some zef ass next level shit. If you're not familiar with their stuff, I wouldn't really consider any of Die Antwoord's music to be dub step but check out the Umshini Wam theme, DJ Hi-Tek Rulez, and Fok Julle Naaiers. Or any of their albums and singles."
DieAntwoord,18zfwb,forestmuse,1 point,Fri Feb 22 03:00:50 2013 UTC,"I've listened to both albums nonstop for a while.  I'm looking for straight instrumental.  Dub step is the best way I can describe the song, but if I listen to something like skrillex it's nothing like that.  So I'm just looking for some jams that are similar in style as Never Le Nkemise 2.  Maybe a simpler question is does DJ Hi-Tek have any instrumental tracks elsewhere?"
DieAntwoord,18zfwb,kuniklo,3,Wed Feb 27 00:11:07 2013 UTC,"Do you mean songs from DA that are like that, or just other songs by other artists in general? $O$ is kinda similar"

We waited a couple hours after it ended and got to see ninja and take a picture with him. He was super nice about it and had asked us if we wanted a picture with him as he was getting the car.

DieAntwoord,17a1ij,futurefree,1 point,Sat Jan 26 18:46:27 2013 UTC,They are very theatrical and imaginative.  I think Die Antwoord was an inevitable result of their experimenting with performance art and music.  They are amazing artists!

DieAntwoord,177wco,grafittibob,3,Fri Jan 25 14:16:08 2013 UTC,"Hi, thank you for the feedback. :D  I get what you are saying about the repetition thing, but I'll say that was pretty much my intent. When it comes to songs with vocals, I generally feel that less is more on the music side.  I just wanted to provide a stable sound underneath them that made the song feel slower and darker than the original mix (even though the bpm is identical), with a chorus that lifted things up momentarilly.  I didn't want to muddle that with a lot of change ups when there are already plenty of dynamics in the vocals themselves.  I will say though, this is actually my first rap beat ever. When I make music that doesn't have vocals I then throw in far more changes in each song.  For example, here's my electronic music from 2008 which you might like: www.myspace.com/letrealityburn  I plan to go back to those tracks soon and enhance their mixes (I've learned a lot since i originally made them) for upload onto my youtube channel and maybe turn them into an EP."

DieAntwoord,13mrcb,ironswine,8,Thu Nov 22 19:14:42 2012 UTC,$O$ had a much more experimental feel to it.  They took more risks and tried more things with their style.  They really figured out what they wanted to be when TEN$ION came out though.  I don't see them doing anything like Doos Dronk or Wie Maak Die Jol Vol again because that kind of style seemed to be over when they released TEN$ION.
DieAntwoord,13mrcb,CliffeyWanKenobi,5,Fri Nov 23 02:00:57 2012 UTC,"TEN$ION is one of those albums that I can listen to over and over again. When I first got it, I was literally streaming it through my Bluetooth earpiece almost all day long at work for about three weeks. Some days I easily listened to it 4 or 5 times, minimum. So it is definitely my favorite of the two.  HOWEVER, I have finally switched over to $O$ and it is making its way up my playlist pretty quickly. But, I think the fact that I learned about them first with TEN$ION makes it unlikely that the album $O$ will top the album TEN$ION, but there are definitely individual tracks from $O$ that top individual tracks from TEN$ION.

DieAntwoord,13mrcb,hlfry,1 point,Mon Dec 10 14:01:19 2012 UTC,"Thanks! Wow, now I need to find some extra songs. Guess I have the internet release plus 2 track but I'm missing evil boy & other tracks from the physical release. Guess I'll have to check itunes."
DieAntwoord,13mrcb,newk8irosa,4,Mon Dec 10 18:34:31 2012 UTC,"For listening to an entire album, start to finish, like if I'm driving or something, I will always choose $0$.  It just seems to be more cohesive to me...each song flows into the next and builds on one another.  However, I'm torn because TEN$ION has some of their best individual songs on it.  Usually I'll listen to $0$ all the way through and then skip around on TEN$ION."
DieAntwoord,13mrcb,licoricesnocone,8,Fri Nov 23 18:14:19 2012 UTC,"I think its about the attitude. $o$ is more, ""look at how weird we can be."" while ten$ion is more ""fuck you haters we're still around."" and honestly i'd prefer almost anything to the ""fuck you haters."" phase most rappers seem to go through."
DieAntwoord,13mrcb,idonotmath,3,Thu Nov 22 22:19:17 2012 UTC,"I love both albums. I usually just play both albums in order and enjoy both. If I usually pick just one, I go with Ten$ion. It seems a little more, for lack of better words, hype(?). Either album, though, makes me move faster at work. Either way, i'm ready for a new album, as I have abused both albums to a ridiculous extent. Hey Waddy, Waddy!"
DieAntwoord,13mrcb,dylanger,3,Fri Nov 23 16:53:04 2012 UTC,"Or... Does anyone else like MaxNormal.tv better than Die Antwoord? I can listen to Max Normal all the time. I love DA, but MN is like so much better in a different way. But it is also old and we will probably never get that style again."
DieAntwoord,13mrcb,catapultacat,0,Wed Nov 28 14:14:19 2012 UTC,"For me, I Like $o$ better because a lot of the album was rehashing's of their earlier stuff.and i love the early stuff  Some of the songs are completely different, others are almost the same exact song. I thought Tension was amazing except for Hey fatty...The video is awesome, but im not a fan of the song."
