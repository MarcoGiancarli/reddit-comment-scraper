notcirclejerk,3dxg8b,ShetlandJames,5,Mon Jul 20 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"Year 1 - Launch : Make a warrior with friends. Game is everything I wanted, loved Warcraft III and Blizzard. Never played an MMO and dove right in. High school and 17 years old. Shit was cash.  Year 2 - Time to Raid! : That warrior wasn't working out. I didn't know that it was doing and had to re-learn everything. Macro's, PvP, Keybindings, Mechanics. That first year was rough and being unaware of what was out there, I re-educated myself and rerolled a Warlock on a PvP server. I got lucky and joined a top end raiding guild that was clearing Zul'Gurub and half way through Blackwing Lair.  Year 2 1/2 - The Best or Bust : High school is over, on my own. Got Grand Marshal this year and got to the 4-Horseman, but PvE was just a way to get better at PvP. Cross-Server PvP introduced and couldn't be happier/upset. Little did I know the trend of mixed emotions I would feel coming up... everything will be different when the expansion comes out.  Year 3 - New Lands : New expansion! 30 minutes in, realize all my Tier 3 gear is being replaced and my heart dies instantly. I hate all of my work over the past 3 years is for nothing and I have to start anew. Well, at least I can fly now and things are getting better. Arena seems fun, might give that a shot.... but gotta get to work now.  Year 4 - Repeat : Fucking bullshit, I saved up 4 months of DKP for the Ashe's of Alar mount and the GM gets first dibs!?!? And when I bitch about it, I fucking get kicked?! Fuck this man, I passed on so much gear I needed just to be the 1st to have that damn mount.... at least I got my Gladiator mount. Well, my girlfriend didn't understand why I was so upset that day, she has begun to watch me play more and more. Lets see what the new expansion has to offer....  Year 5 - Where are you? : I've been playing this new expansion for fucking ever and no Arthus. The reason I wanted to play this game in the first place was to enjoy the idea of wielding Frostmorne just once! My girlfriend is pregnant and has picked up WoW too, so that's nice. She is learning fast and loves mounts like me, but I'm sure she'll get bored eventually.  Year 6 - There and back again : I quit. No Lich King, I'm gonna sell my account, how hard can it be... I'll just put an ad on craigslist and see how much people will offe.... 2,500!?!? SOLD! Totally buy a new crib for the baby, and maybe a wedding ring..... wait, Lich King announced?! Fuck... better buy a new account...  Year 7 - I didn't ask for this : My wife is fully in this game and I have given up. Nothing is challenging anymore, all that is once new is gone and the flavor is getting sour. I enjoy watching my wife play though, I'll stick around for her.  Year 8 - Are you even trying? : I now sell paid Grand Marshal runs to fund my wife's mount addiction. She wants to get all of them so bad, so I help how I can. I noticed I play on her account a lot more and more than my own..... HOLY SHIT BABE, STOP BUYING THE TCG BOOSTERS!  Year 9 - Lost lands : My account is gone, but I still play on the wife's account. She loves pet battles and enjoys mounts so I get all the hard ones that she doesn't know how to grind. I'll let her do the drop ones and I'll say something like, ""Back in the day, it took us 40 guys to do this."" or something. She enjoys it so I can't complain.  Year 10 - Full circle : I still help when I can and what not. New expansion out now and she's digging the whole new systems. I think it's so watered down that i'll never go back, but what ever.... is that my daughter doing the pet battles?"

notcirclejerk,3aa0y1,morpen,3,Thu Jun 18 12:25:03 2015 UTC,"I've highlighted select portions of the OP for your reading pleasure. Enjoy:  Not only are they idiots, they are themselves racist and sexist.  I'm a feminist, my Mum's a feminist, and even here on Reddit most of us would probably classify ourselves as feminists to some degree or another, if only insofar as we're for equality. (I assume.)  That said, it seems to be that the longer I stay around reddit, or make the mistake of looking at twitter, or Tumblr, I'm finding that my general experience of feminists these days seems to be only of the loudest, most insane amongst them.  There is a very ugly anti-men, anti-white attitude pervasive throughout modern feminism, and I see more playground arguments around it than I ever see serious debate. Frequent examples of this can be found in any of the SRS subreddits/gamerghazi. I feel this behavior is becoming more prevalent and vicious and I think that's very ugly and very sad.  The increasing racism and sexism in mainstream, popular feminism (online at least) is turning me away from the cause. I'm all for equality, but I simply don't want to be associated with these people, who I find to be ten times more ""toxic"" than any of the targets they spend their days harassing.  As an aside, I also find their forced/stressed use of particular words (""problematic"", ""toxic"" etc) to be the height of pseudo-intellectualism and cringe every time one of them comes off with any of them.  I've been on reddit today and already seen several threads where self-identified feminists are engaging in openly racist, openly sexist speech. I have heard arguments from some feminists that it's impossible to be sexist and racist towards white men, as white men are so dominant in society (which society?) that effectively, it's OK to do it. It's fine to be racist and sexist, apparently.  No it isn't. It's no more acceptable than any other form of racism or sexism, nor is it any more acceptable than when any white male is racist or sexist. You're just looking for an excuse to be hateful and a group to blame your own failures on, and you don't even have the courage to admit it.  A case of ""don't become the thing you hate the most,"" I guess."

notcirclejerk,38mno7,rnjbond,3,Fri Jun 5 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"The recent disclosure laws had been a boon to my career. In the past, voters never had time to actually do the research and figure out who was getting campaign contributions from which companies. So they abolished all previous disclosure laws, got rid of the PACs and Super PACs, and replaced them with a single, simple system: put a logo on your suit for each corporate sponsor who contributed more than $100,000 to your campaign. The size of the logo must be proportional to the contribution.  When the laws went into effect, I was the only one who emerged unscathed. Today was the presidential debate. I stood in a plain, tailored black suit. My opponent, the incumbent president, was decorated head-to-toe in corporate logos. Altria, Disney, McDonald's...the list went on. A massive Google logo covered his entire back.  The debate moderator addressed the President. ""Presidant Wilson, the first question is for you. The recent disclosure laws have put a spotlight on your sponsors in the tobacco industry, the fast food industry, and several others. How can we be sure that these corporate sponsors don't influence your policies in any way?""  ""Well you'll find that my voting record as a senator, and the laws I've signed as President, speak for themselves. I signed into law the Smoking Education act last year, which definitely wasn't a pro-tobacco policy. So I'm not afraid to do what's right for the American people even if it means not seeing eye-to-eye with my sponsors.""  There was a smattering of applause. The President paused, and I saw my opportunity to interject. ""Mr. President, with respect, you and I both know that law was exactly what Big Tobacco wanted. By the time it passed through the House and Senate, the funding had been all but removed, and it was bundled with a 2% reduction in the nationwide Tobacco tax.""  This time I was the recipient of applause. ""Senator Harrison, please wait your turn to respond,"" said the moderator.  ""My apologies,"" I said.  ""Senator Harrison, this question is for you. There are no logos on your suit. How are you financing your campaign?""  I cleared my throat and took a sip of my water. ""That's a great question. The vast majority of my money does come from sponsors. They just aren't of the corporate variety."" Applause broke out, but I continued talking. ""It's ordinary people, like those in the audience tonight, who are clamoring for change and are supporting my bid for the White House.""    My campaign manager Christina and I sat in the back of a limo, riding back to our hotel after the debate. Christina was checking the results on her phone.  ""Unbelieveable,"" she said. ""Fox, CNN, MSNBC, all the major networks are declaring a decisive victory for you. You're up four points in polls.""  I smiled. My phone rang and I answered it. ""Hello?""  ""Congratulations, Senator,"" said the voice on the other end of the line.  ""Thanks Mr. Davis. I couldn't have done it without your help,"" I said.  He laughed. ""I really loved the line about 'ordinary people.'""  ""Really? I thought it might have been over-the-top, but I guess it worked,"" I said. ""Listen, we need to increase TV ad buys in Florida. I think two million dollars should do it. I'll have Christina work out the details.""  ""Consider it done,"" said Mr. Davis. ""I'm looking forward to working together once you're in charge.""  I hung up. Most people assumed that I had a groundswell of popular support, but that wasn't quite accurate. In truth, my biggest sponsor was the Blacksquare group, a little-known defense contractor whose logo was a black square. My entire suit was covered in it, but I guess some folks don't look closely enough.    /r/rpwrites"
notcirclejerk,38mlqk,chaosmosis,12,Fri Jun 5 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"It's great that kids on the autism spectrum can have a place to come together and play free from being teased and all, but this is one of the most recent posts on the site:   We've had quite a few players seemingly get bored of Autcraft and leave only to return a while later, bored of what ever else they were doing and then, once again, complain about being bored on Autcraft.  Here's the thing, you're not bored.  When this happens, essentially you are confusing the real feelings that you don't understand with boredom. You think you're bored because you're not really sure what you're feeling and this confusion causes you to feel like there's nothing to do. Generally speaking, when I've observed this, there are usually one of two causes.  Depression  Sometimes, when you're depressed, you shun the things you enjoy. That is to say, what you love doing, you just ""don't feel like it"" anymore. It's not that you don't enjoy those things anymore, you just don't want to do it. Either because you're not in the mood or you are simply pushing away the things you enjoy in an effort to feel even more down. It's a silly human thing that we all do.  If you constantly find yourself being bored with everything in your life, Autcraft, other games, friends and so forth... maybe you're not bored. Maybe you're depressed. The good news is, there's a solution to your problem and often times it's as simple as talking to someone.  Restlessness  That looks like a funny word but basically it means that you feel like there's more that you should be doing but you're not and so all the things that you are doing seem boring. Some people call it ""thrill seeking"" or ""seeking a challenge.""  Basically it means that you want to do more with your life than what you're doing now. You still enjoy the things you're doing now but you can't quite figure out what it is that you're missing... that one thing that could challenge you. So your mind is basically telling you that what you're doing now isn't what you should be doing and so it makes you feel like you shouldn't be doing it at all. That comes across as boring.  You can still do what you do and seek out new and challenging things at the same time. Just don't let your need for something new confuse you into thinking that the things you love are now boring.  Memories  Which ever the reason, the ones I listed or some other reason, the important thing is not to place blame. More often than not, players will blame Autcraft for their boredom. They feel like Autcraft was the place they loved and now it's not making them feel the same as it once did and therefore, it's boring. What's worse is, some players take that as a means to attack it. On the server, in the forums, on their Enjin walls... they accuse Autcraft of being a terrible place... because it's boring.  I feel it's important to remember though that the times that you had on Autcraft, the moments you loved and cherished, those are memories now. Wonderful memories. And maybe you're bored, maybe you're just confused or maybe it's you that has changed... but if you're going to blame Autcraft for any of this then perhaps it's those good times that you should blame us for. You have those memories now and whether you miss them or not isn't the point. You have those memories now when without Autcraft, you wouldn't have them at all.   AF    Does that seem a little creepy to anyone else? To me it sounds like telling children with a neurodevelopmental disorder that might already cause them to be confused about their feelings ""If you think you are bored with our game, you're just confused about your emotions and possibly depressed. Keep playing on our server."" Can't a kid just get tired of playing Minecraft for a bit?  I know this might not be the right sub to talk about this, but I couldn't help but notice and I didn't want to make myself open to an accusation of brigading /r/dataisbeautiful"

notcirclejerk,37weju,MKorostoff,0,Sun May 31 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"Considering that Tesla vigorously and publicly disagreed with Einstein on relativity in the 1930s, the answer is probably ""no."" Add to it that I've never seen any sort of actual citation for the quote in question, I am inclined to put it in the very large file of ""stuff Einstein never said that people attribute to him anyway."" Searching around the various books, databases, and articles I have, I see nothing that would suggest that this quote is legitimate. It is of course hard to prove that something did not happen, but in the absence of any indication that it did happen — I suspect it did not.   A few of the public Tesla references to relativity:  In 1934, on the occasion of his 79th birthday, Tesla denounced relativity theory as ""a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king"" and ""a mass of error and deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men of science of the past and even to common sense... the theory wraps all these errors and fallacies and clothes them in magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors.... its exponents are very brilliant men, but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists. Not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved."" (NYT, 7/11/1935, p. 23).   He also claimed in 1932 that he had detected particles from the Sun that ""vastly exceeded the speed of light,"" which would be contrary to special relativity. (NYT, Letter to the Editor from Bergen Davis, Columbia University, 2/24/1932)  Both of these are relatively (pun) late in Tesla's life, and early in Einstein's own fame (Einstein's world fame took off in 1919, picked up again when he fled Germany in 1933, and then became gigantic after the atomic bombs in 1945)."

I don't think it's as simple as a correlation between ""conservative religion"" and anti-scientific bias. After all, they've lumped all Catholics and all Orthodox Christians together, and members of those groups can certainly be liberal or very conservative.  They might have been more honest had they classified religious groups as more or less associated with conservative politics, specifically in the American context. But then, they wouldn't be able to say anything (apparently) interesting or new on the topic. At most, what we might be seeing here is the degree to which various religious groups have become affiliated with one of the two great political tribes."

Originally chartered as the ""Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies"", the company rose to account for half of the world's trade, particularly trade in basic commodities that included cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea and opium. The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India.   The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth on 31 December 1600,  making it the oldest among several similarly formed European East India Companies.

notcirclejerk,35e8qv,TotesHuman,1 point,Mon May 11 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"What may make you feel a bit better is that the main reason these 'movements' exist are in response to a greater understanding and acceptance of scientific principles in society.   If a person or institution maintains its social influence through the value of its knowledge, and that knowledge is shown to be faulty, it can either adapt, deny, or die out. With the coming of the internet and social media, people all over the world are able to access way more information than they could in the past. Such a flood of information has made adaptation practically impossible for those whose power depends on pseudoscience (they can't adapt quickly enough without undermining their credibility), and so the most they can do to stay alive is deny, deny, deny.   So, who is it that 'relies on pseudoscience' to keep their influence? The people who rely on fear of the unknown to justify their beliefs, clinging to anything that might possibly convince people to doubt what 'science' tells them. People who fear GMOs or vaccines are not being insincere, they are just finding comfort in the things that justify their fear. They cling to it so hard that people and institutions rise up based on that fear, such as Ken Ham who insists that a literal interpretation of Genesis is fundamental to Biblical authority- a position that is becoming more mainstream the more we learn about the nature of the universe.   So really, I don't think it's accurate to say these anti-science movements are growing so much as fear of the unknown plus an influx of information is polarizing people on scientific issues."

I was always a very shy and timid person and had difficulties talking to people in general, let alone a girl I was interested in.  No matter how hard a tried I just couldn't keep a conversation going.  In fact, the harder I tried the more awkward I would become.  To make matters worse, pretty much all of my friends are ""ladies men"".  They have no problem walking up to a group of girls and striking a conversation.  Meanwhile, I'm pretty much just standing off to the side all alone with nothing to contribute.  This lead to a very lonely and depressing period in my life.  Your early twenties are the time of your life you're supposed to be going out and meeting new people, dating, figuring out where you fit, etc.  It seemed to me like I was destined to be alone forever.  I was pretty much about to give up on the whole dating scene forever and just accept my solitary life status.  That's when I thought of a different approach in regards to the ladies.  This was a radical, risky and yet at the same time simple and brilliant strategy.  All I needed to do was put on a genuine smile, walk confidentally up to the girl that had caught my attention, look her straight in the eyes and say four simple words.......paul-blart-mall-cop.  I was astounded at the results!  The first time I tried it the girl got right down on her knees and blew me there in the bar in front of all her sorority sisters.
