badlinguistics,3dxhrl,Choosing_is_a_sin,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with it? Seems like a pretty good basic overview of what a pidgin is. The biggest issue I see is that the text in the video loses the qualifiers that the actual explanation has. So if the speaker says something like ""pidgins tend to not last very long"", which is a true enough statement, though obviously not 100% accurate, the text on the screen says ""pidgins don't last very long"" which doesn't describe all pidgins.  The description of the way a pidgin can evolve into a creole is decent enough too.  Maybe he's wrong on the specifics of Tok Pisin? Or the various languages? But the video seems to me to be a decent enough overview of the way pidgins and creoles come about."
badlinguistics,3dxhrl,smileyman,11,Mon Jul 20 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"From when this was posted on /r/linguistics:   Universal Grammar is the set of formal conditions that can be placed on language rules. It's a common error, one that even people who write whole books on the matter do not seem to grasp. But along with much, much of what this presenter says, this part of the discussion simplifies so much as to just be misleading or wrong. It's hard to tell what features a pidgin lacks that shows that UG does not constrain its development. Is this guy trying to claim that UG isn't in effect during second language acquisition? If so, he should explain why, rebutting prominent researchers on UG in SLA, like Rex Sprouse, Bonnie Schwartz, Lydia White, and Laurent Dekydtspotter, who have done extensive research on the matter and see a definite place for UG guiding SLA. [EDIT FOR THIS POST: Perhaps he means the language bioprogram, a concept promoted by Derek Bickerton that was never really accepted by creolists and ultimately mostly abandoned by Bickerton himself.)  Other things that this person gets wrong:   The old canard of creoles coming from pidgins. Yes, sometimes that happens, but not all pidgins yield creoles and not all creoles come from pidgins. This idea is a zombie, and I wish I knew a way to kill it, but I suspect it will just live on. The idea that children are responsible for the elaboration and stablization of a creole grammar. Particularly with respect to Tok Pisin, spoken for decades by adults with ever-increasing, well-documented expansion without nativization (and you can read Peter Mühlhäusler's pidgin and creole textbook for more on it), this claim leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Do kids play some role? Of course they do, and sometimes it's significant. But it's not always the kids leading the way in nativization (and perhaps even not usually-- we need more information on this). In Hawaiian Creole, for instance, we see a huge influence of the syntax of Portuguese, whose adult speakers were the first to shift to Hawaiian Pidgin as their main language with their kids. Unsurprisingly, as we know from lots of studies of language shift and from SLA, their first language syntax  transferred extensively to their second language, and lo and behold, their kids picked up on these regularities in the second language discourse and nativized them.  The apparent conflation of a jargon, which is highly unstable, with a pidgin, which has much more stability. The idea that pidgins and creoles are common results of people coming into contact who don't know each other's language. Bilingualism and language shift are far more common, and the video doesn't even mention that its subject is a rare, rare phenomenon. It's unclear what languages of the Caribbean he's referring to when discussing the idea of Caribbean pidgins. Perhaps the maroon creoles, hopefully not the creoles of places like Belize and Antigua, which are more likely to have emerged in Africa and been exported to the Caribbean (I believe John Holm has written on this, as has Mervyn Alleyne).   So there's a lot in this video that's misleading, and it shouldn't be taken too seriously by people looking to actually learn about pidgins and creoles."

badlinguistics,3dxhrl,myxopyxo,10,Mon Jul 20 15:19:57 2015 UTC,"I would probably attribute the similarity of Early Modern English (King James) and Modern to the rise of printing and overall increased literary & education in England, which led to increased standardization and thus more mutual intelligibility.

badlinguistics,3dxhrl,alynnidalar,10,Mon Jul 20 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, so I might not be the right person to ask, but there's some fairly common processes that tend to occur when creoles are created.  The basic process of creating a creole is: two languages interact -> people form a pidgin with features or at least vocabulary from both -> children learn this pidgin as their first language and it becomes a full-fledged language, now called a creole.  So naturally when the initial pidgin is created (which is not a full language, although some languages that are called pidgins might be (Hawaiian Pidgin is actually a full-fledged creole, for example)), there's a lot of simplification and regularization that goes on. Irregular verbs lose their irregularities and start being conjugated regularly. Case systems simplify or disappear. Clause structure tends to be very simple.  A creole, being a full-fledged language, is capable of the same expression as a non-creole language, but because it's so new, the simplifications of the pidgin can remain while new irregularities haven't been introduced yet.  So to apply this to English, the argument goes that Middle English lost the complex case system of Old English, had more rigid word order, etc. which could be a result of a creolization process, buuuut probably aren't because you can see from various written documents that these processes were already starting to occur in Old English before the exposure to Norman French. Also a lot of Norman vocabulary replaced native English vocabulary, but that can happen without it actually being a creole.  Someone who's a real linguist, please correct me where I'm wrong. :/"
badlinguistics,3dxhrl,Choosing_is_a_sin,12,Mon Jul 20 13:25:19 2015 UTC,"Argh, so much to correct.  I'm just gonna repost an excerpt from an old post of mine,   When people don't share a common language but they need to communicate, they will try to find ways to do so that accommodate the abilities of their interlocutors. The earliest and most unstable is a jargon.  Jargons have little to no conventionality to them; they are much more highly variable and therefore much less systematic than more mature forms of intercultural codes. They are generally highly reduced, meaning (in this case) they lose things that do not contribute to meaning, such as lexical tone and morphological paradigms. These, like pidgins and creoles, usually arise in situations where three or more language groups come into contact.  Jargons can then give rise to pidgins. Pidgins are conventionalized codes that are no one's native language. They have generally arisen in situations of trade, where contact is particularly intense. They show evidence of grammaticalization, with certain words getting reanalyzed to serve new grammatical functions (e.g. Tok Pisin bilong from English belong as a preposition of attribution -- Han bilong diwai 'arm of a tree; branch'). They may get expanded and used in new environments and at this point in their development are sometimes indistinguishable from creoles. Another feature of pidgins (and creoles) is that the vast majority of their vocabulary comes from one language; in the case of colonial pidgins and creoles, it was always the colonizer's language that predominated (though there are some exceptional creoles, e.g. the maroon creoles of Suriname, that have a high proportion of African words, because the slaves' exposure to English and Dutch was cut off early when the slaves who were forming the new variety escaped to the Amazon jungle).  Creoles are a diverse class of languages that emerge in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are just nativized pidgins, that is, pidgins that are acquired as native languages. Other times they arise when large, successive waves of non-native speakers arrive in a territory and their L2 speech, learned in large part from fellow L2 speakers, becomes the dominant input/discourse of the speech community, and the language simplifies with L2 transfer effects and imperfect acquisition through each successive generation, until the influxes stop. Imagine if an entire community learned their language from the students in fourth-semester French who could only make about 50% of their classes and had no other exposure to French-- even the most intelligent people would have difficulty producing native-like French when their input was so restricted. This scenario, with the successive waves of African slaves learning and producing increasingly distant L2 French (whose original target, colonial French, was itself a D2 variety since most colonists spoke French as an L2 to their native dialect) is how most of the French-based creoles of the Caribbean and Indian Ocean seem to have formed, since there is no pidgin stage attested for them. Other creoles formed in slave forts in situations that might have given rise to a pidgin, but instead appear to have been instances of abrupt creolization. Like pidgins, creoles are highly reduced in terms of surface morphology and show extensive grammaticalization, but it's important to keep in mind the role of languages involved-- while creoles seem to be isolating languages (i.e. most words have just one morpheme), it is largely because the languages of those who formed them, particularly among the French and English creoles, lacked a lot of surface morphology. When creoles formed between Bantu languages, the large number of noun classes (basically noun genders) get reduced, but not eliminated, and much of the other inflection survives too.   If I can leave one legacy in this subreddit and /r/linguistics, it will be to get people to stop embracing the stupid life-cycle view of Bloomfield and to stop parroting the idea that creoles come from pidgins. Some do, some don't, and there's no reason to frame a creole in terms of a pidgin."

My linguistics professors were not creolists and thus evidently didn't have a very up-to-date view.  It's still generally accepted that Middle English was not a creole, though, right?

badlinguistics,3dxhrl,Choosing_is_a_sin,3,Mon Jul 20 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"No, inflectional material is lost through second language acquisition, not gained. So whether we're looking at a pidiginization scenario, an approximation of approximations, a fort creole, or whatever, there's no scenario that doesn't involve second language acquisition in the process, and that will lead to less inflection over time.

badlinguistics,3dxhrl,Choosing_is_a_sin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"First, please don't characterize my use of 'non-native' and 'not target-like' as ""bad"" French. The ""quality"" of the product has to be viewed in light of the input. I'm quite careful not to frame L2 varieties as somehow deficient, and I'd like that to persist through the responses.  Secondly, you can think of it as coming from two different directions. A pidgin is something that is built up from a jargon. So there's initially very little belonging to that system, but as it gets used more and more, it is progressively elaborated into something more conventionalized and stable in terms of vocabulary and structures. Pidgins are of course notoriously unstable when compared to the natural languages that serve as their speakers' L1s, but compared to jargons, they are more stable. The approximations of approximations model, on the other hand, is a gradual move away from the target. It is not the product of expansion, but rather of increasing reduction of lexifier-like input. One thing to keep in mind is that in this latter scenario, children are growing up with the approximations as their native language, as opposed to the pidgin-nativization scenario of creole genesis, where that is supposed to be the final, decisive step that leads to all sorts of glorious expansion and stabilization. That being said, John McWhorter is someone who tries to fudge the distinction, arguing-- with good merit-- that the end result of either process is likely to look the same, and is content to call either one a pidgin. His is an idiosyncratic use of the term, but it allows him to preserve the pidgin-to-creole life cycle (though I think the persistent nativization through the generations is something that he glosses over)."
badlinguistics,3dxhrl,StopBanningMe4,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"I used the term ""bad"" in keeping with your analogy to the idea of students who half assed through a few mandatory French classes trying to teach French to people. Of course I meant no judgement by the term, rather just a case where each successive person will end up with something farther and farther from the original language in question, although perhaps I should have used a different term.  Otherwise thanks for clarifying. I still don't quite understand the major distinction between a pidgin and something formed by this process of approximation though. It seems to me that in that latter process, major lexical gaps would have to be filled in with something else (perhaps the speakers' first languages) and you might end up with something that looks to the casual observer like an odd mash together of (say) French and a local language, which is what most people call a pidgin.   Clearly I'm misunderstanding some part of this. Is a pidgin just something that has a different kind of origin? In this case the intended target language is French, but what they have to work with is so incomplete that something else needs to fill the holes, correct? Is a pidgin something that from the ground up has no intended target but is a thing of convenience for all parties?"

What I'm getting from you is that you're throwing out the entire process because of those exceptions. What recent studies have been done to show that most creoles don't come from pidgins?"
badlinguistics,3dxhrl,Choosing_is_a_sin,8,Mon Jul 20 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"Part of the issue will be about the counting of creoles. There are a number of English-based Caribbean creoles, but most of them are second- or third-generation creoles, in other words, creoles taken from one island to another. Then there's the matter of whether we know the origins of the creole. For the French-based creoles, MOST of them have no known pidgin origin, and there are plausible models that I already described backed up by textual evidence, e.g. the fact that Haitian Creole's earliest texts are actually closer to Colonial French than its later texts. So keep in mind that the world's most spoken creole is not the result of a pidgin. We've also got things like the Caribbean English creoles whose source appears to have been a jargon, rather than a pidgin (in other words, this was likely to have been a fort creole). It's only in the Pacific Ocean area that the pidgin-to-creole model really dominates. Why should we favor one area over another? This of course assumes that the idea of creoles as a linguistic type, rather than a sociohistorical type, is even a coherent idea, which people like Mervyn Alleyne, Salikoko Mufwene, Nicolas Faraclas, Pauline Christie, and other important creolists outright reject. So we're not likely to find any conclusive evidence to support either hypothesis, but importantly, we never had good evidence to support the life-cycle view as a general process in the first place. What we had was an unrepresentative sample and ideologies that could be outright racist (see DeGraff's ""Linguists' most dangerous myth"").  Bloomfield worked with what he knew, but those views are no longer compatible with the evidence that we have. Even McWhorter, whose opinion you cite elsewhere, has to redefine pidgin in order to make the life-cycle fit (as he does in Chapter 2 of his 2005 book), making it either the result of a jargon (therefore something built up from scratch) or the result of the successive L2 waves (therefore something restructured over time). But as /u/millionsofcats explained, the views of linguists outside the field don't reflect the views of people inside the field, and they are often influenced by people like John McWhorter and Derek Bickerton, who manage to make a splash outside the field without having their ideas accepted widely within it."

Is this the equivalent of historians talking about historiography--where the entire model of the past is looked at through a different lens?   E.g. I study the American Revolution and there have been major shifts in the way the past is viewed, both in the causes of the American Revolution, as well as the types of sources, and the people whom historians focus on. Thirty years ago historians would have never considered writing a book about gay marriage/relationships in early Amercia, yet Rachel Hope Cleves' recent book on the subject shows that it may have been far more common than was previously thought."
badlinguistics,3dxhrl,Choosing_is_a_sin,4,Mon Jul 20 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that creoles haven't been shown to display any consistent structural characteristics, nor has ""creolization"" been shown to have any consistent structural processes. So the outcomes and processes are both diverse and also not unique to creoles, so then what would we mean when we talk about a creole language? Instead, it's more likely that they share sociohistorical things in common, including the intensity of language contact and the presence of a colonizing power."

You're responding to an actual creolist, FWIW.  Linguists who work in other subfields can be out of date, and this is one area of study where the problem is particularly pronounced. The consensus of linguists in general is not the most important here; the consensus of creolists is a better guide. Many linguists never learn more about creoles than what is in introductory textbooks, where you'll often find the ""nativized pidgin"" explanation--and so the definition gets repeated in classrooms, in new indtroductory textbooks, etc. But if you delve into the literature the picture is so much more complicated.  As far as recent studies, it's probably best not to think of this as something that a single study demonstrates, but as something that has evolved as more investigation makes the picture clearer. Creole work involves a lot of piecing together evidence from different sources--history, child language acquisition, grammatical analysis of involved languages, and so on. Maybe /u/Choosing_is_a_sin has an idea of a good summary. I don't, since I've only dabbled.   What I'm getting from you is that you're throwing out the entire process because of those exceptions.

I do remember McWhorter mentioning this process in his ""Story of Human Language"" lecture series (he spends about 2 1/2 to 3 hours on the topic of pidgins and creoles). I know that he started as a creolist, though the information in that lecture series might be well out of date and he might have completely different opinions on the subject now.   I'm fully aware that the lecture series is a basic intro to the subject, but I'd think that a creolist at least would get the basic information right. OTOH, if this re-examination of creolization has been mostly done within the past decade or so, then the lecture series is probably woefully out-of-date on that topic."

badlinguistics,3dx81x,Tift,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that has anything to do with the NCVS, it's just a coincidence that a lot of the region has certain words with /ɛ/ instead.  The NCVS shifts vowels around but the distinctions are maintained.  So words are phonetically altered, but not phonemically.  I think it's more likely the milk>melk thing is due to Scandinavian influence.  Sometimes words just don't follow sound change patterns.  For example, I say 'gether' and 'rether' for gather and rather so that they no longer rhyme with slather and lather, but I don't have the NCVS.  My little brother says 'lit' for let, but his accent isn't noticeably different from mine."
badlinguistics,3dx81x,storkstalkstock,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:24 2015 UTC,"Well, /ɪ/ lowering toward /ɛ/ (but remaining distinct) actually is one of the stages of the NCVS, it's the final change. It certainly may happen in other dialects as well, but it's definitely something you consistently hear in people with the full NCVS.  Whether or not it's a result of Scandinavian influence, I couldn't say."
badlinguistics,3dx81x,alynnidalar,0,Mon Jul 20 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"Right, but there are speakers with the NCVS who pronounce pillow and those other words with the KIT vowel and speakers with the NCVS who pronounce them with the DRESS vowel.  Additionally, there are speakers without the NCVS who also pronounced them with the DRESS vowel.  Either way, people wouldn't be writing their own pronunciation of the word pillow as 'pellow' unless they either have a merger there or just happen to use the DRESS vowel instead of the KIT vowel.    A non-NCVS speaker interpreting the NCVS pronunciation as having a different phoneme than they would is one thing, an NCVS speaker interpreting their own pronunciation as having a different phoneme from standard is something else entirely."

badlinguistics,3dx81x,theamazingchris,6,Mon Jul 20 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"I assume the point was that when writing standard written English, you should be careful to use the correct homophone if you want your writing to be taken seriously.

It could be true that someone early on was very careful about how they translated it and which declension to use.

Same for Latin.   How is this in any way amusing? How is it at all relevant whether or not the Chinese would have cared about Latin?

Peking is just the old (and quite inaccurate) way of transliterating the Chinese sounds into acceptable spelling for English. The British always knew it was called Beijing but the closest equivalent using their system became Peking. On a similar note, many Chinese last names are actually different transliterations of the same characters - Chang and Seong for example.   Peking is actually based on an earlier pronunciation. There was a relatively recent sound change in Mandarin where [kʰ] became [t͡ɕʰ] before a front vowel or (front) glide. Some Chinese languages still use the k-pronunciation.

The actual vowel in hon is a short monophthong [o̞]—Japanese doesn't even have phonemic diphthongs to begin with. Second, people speaking an accent with phonemic vowel length, such as Australian English as well as many accents in England, would pronounce ""nee"" as [niː], whereas the Japanese i is pronounced [i], contrasting with ii [iː].  Additionally, the leading /n/ would be palatalized preceding /i/—my copy of the Handbook of the IPA writes this as [ɲ̟]—and the realization of the final n, /ɴ/, varies somewhat, but is commonly a uvular [ɴ] (a sound that doesn't exist in English), with the preceding vowel somewhat nasalized.

This really only applies to younger people though. Older ones will know quite a lot.  My personal experience, I went to the Korean War Museum in Seoul with a friend of mine who was 61. There was a memorial there, written entirely in Hanja and my friend could read all but 2 or 3 characters. After reading it, in context, he figured out the other three. At the same time, my gf (33) doesn't know much beyond what I mentioned above.  They do not teach hanja in school here any more, at least not to the extent that it used to be (gf is a public school teacher - they have no classes at the middle school for hanja).

I've got to say that knowing German has helped with Swedish a bit, particularly with vocabulary. But - and I am now talking about GUT FEELING here rather than reliable analysis - I feel that English being my L1 is actually MORE of a help with Swedish in some ways.  But do I think Swedish and German are ""not that different""? Really it depends on what you mean by ""not that different"". They aren't mutually intelligible, except in the rare case where a sentence comes out as nearly identical in either language. Knowing German definitely HELPS in learning Swedish, but not to the degree where I feel that they are almost the same language or anything. But these are ""feelings"" not the hard-headed analysis we linguists (or linguists-in-training in my case) are supposed to employ.  As for pronunciation - know how I said my German sounds bad?

They're closer than Swedish and Polish or Swedish and French, but they're still very different I think. Icelandic is probably more similar than German, and that's still completely incomprehensible.  Vocabularies share a common origin from not too far back I suppose, so there's that, but I still think it's a very different language. Korean and Japanese also share a very large portion of vocabulary derived from Chinese, so for about 50% of the day-to-day vocabulary (or so I've read...) Japanese and Korean are about as similar as Swedish and German despite not being in the same language families. [How similar the words are vary a lothttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Korean_vocabulary, but you probably get the hang of it pretty quickly just like you get the hang of what kind of differences there are between German and Swedish if you study it for a while. With Swedish and German you might learn that many words ending with ""k"" in Swedish might end with ""ch"" in German (bok - buch, I think that's a general ""rule""... been long since I studied German...) while Korean speakers might learn that 囚/수 is read as しゅう in Japanese and vice-versa.  And they both have the same kind of grammar I guess with lots of corresponding particles etc. But is that enough to call them ""really similar""? I don't think so.  Then again, I lack a bit of perspective on this. I do think French, Spanish and Italian could be called ""really similar"", but I'm not sure how different they actually are from each other. Perhaps they're as different as German and Swedish are."
badlinguistics,3dmg7s,ancientGouda,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"I think ""similar"" not in the sense that most people would think when they read that word. We call Dutch and German similar because those languages sound a lot alike, and, if you're a native speaker of one of them, often you'll be able to occasionally fully understand chunks of the other when heard (to me as a German, Dutch sounds more like a crazy dialect than a different language).  I don't think Japanese people can understand Korean people at all in this sense (or the other way). But I think the structure, the way thoughts are formed into sentences, are similar. You basically don't have to rewire your brain as much. One reason for Japanese being hard for Westerners to learn I've been told over and over again is something as simple as the verb being at the end of the sentence. However, for me it felt completely natural and I never had to struggle with it once, and I think that's because of the Latin classes I took around middle school (even though word order in Latin is not fixed, the verb often appears at the end).  I think what your Swedish students experienced might have been very similar to what my Korean friend did. Sure, Swedish sounds a lot different (I can't understand anything of it), but structures might be similar.

It said that the semantic world of Finnish and Swedish are very alike.  Basically what I gather it means is that we use the same figures of speech, the same terms etc. So even though the languages are extremely different in almost every way I've had a fairly easy time when I've studied finnish. I think the same holds true for most european languages (at least western, not sure about eastern but I'd imagine them as well). We have words for the same things and we draw the boundaries in the same places. If I see a finnish word that means ""corruption"" I can be fairly certain that word's used in almost the same way as it's Swedish equivalent (but perhaps not in the English sense of depravity and such), however the equivalent word might not overlap so well.  This has been the biggest issue for me in studying Japanese (apart from kanji making immersion much more difficult). Their ""semantic world"" is different from Swedish in the way I described above, so to fully understand a new word it's not enough to just have one translation for it  (it usually isn't in European languages either, but far more often and far fewer alternatives).  That's basically why learners of any language, semantically similar or not, is encouraged to use a native dictionary rather than a translation dictionary.

Yep, yep. I can look up the word verlieren in an English dictionary, and get to lose. Even though I might have been looking for the term for ""leaving something behind without noticing"" or ""falling out of possession"", I can use the same word when describing the opposite of ""winning at a game"" because it's also the same in German. In fact, looking at its wiktionary entry, almost all use cases translate perfectly into German. In Japanese however, I have no such certainty. There's 失う and 負ける for the respective cases, but they pretty much don't overlap at all. So one has to learn case by case.   That's basically why learners of any language, semantically similar or not, is encouraged to use a native dictionary rather than a translation dictionary. But the effects are more noticable between distant languages that hasn't had much cultural exchange.   Very true. Although nobody ever told me this, I soon found out that the 国語辞書 on my NDS is a lot more complete, with more use cases and more detailed explanations, but most importantly, described in words of the same language, meaning it stops me from reflexively translating terms into my native language inside my head when reading them. I think teachers should really encourage this more. But then again, you can only do it once you have a solid base vocabulary. Otherwise you'll just end up with 5 more words you don't understand."

badlinguistics,3dij75,taoistextremist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:48:28 2015 UTC,"No. Judging by google books, it's pretty much only used in relation to Japan, except for the occasional misspelling of ""kinship"". And honestly, if a word had been in wide use in the 70s we'd still know about it.  It's a Japanese word formed from English following pseudo-English morphology, like ""maître d'"" is English pseudo-French, but French people wouldn't even know how to pronounce it. It's written in katakana because it strings English words together, for the same reason the purely English word ""maître d'"" keeps the original circumflex."

Doing a little Google research on it, it might be used together with カルマ but the kanji seems more common. Possibly (not an expert in this in any sense of the word) because the words used in Japanese from the the Chinese translations or transliterations of them, so they are all going to be in kanji.

This wasn't reblogged over 100,000 times by people attempting to learn Japanese; it was reblogged by people who think that ""Asian"" words and concepts tap into mystical truths - the age-old ""mysterious east"" trope. Many probably do not read kana, and do not realize that this is just ""karma"" transliterated into Japanese. While there's no untrue factual claim1 here,the exoticizing of the Japanese language and its writing is still bad linguistics of a sort. It's especially funny this time because it's just a transliteration of the word ""karma,"" exactly like we have in English.  1 I don't speak Japanese so I don't know if this even a real loan that people or something that someone just kana-ified to make it seem mysterious."

I'm pretty sure that the prestige dialect of French has been the formal register of the French of Metropolitan France for a while, but that's partly an assumption. I guess first you'd have to define what you mean by saying that Canada standardized French. Standardized language doesn't really reflect actual usage so much as what governing bodies think usage should be, at least for official stuff."

So when these Ur-Linguistic Nationalists (to coin a term, if a different one already exists please let me know) claim that THEIR language is the source of all other languages, they're claiming that their particular form of speech has resisted all the usual forms of drift and evolution and so on that affected all the other dialects that became languages and so on for Lord knows how many millennia, right?"

I apologize for any errors because I do not know Dutch and have a very basic Arabic knowledge.  Grijpen is Dutch for ""grab."" It is said here to be related to the Arabic word for ""handful."" This is not even the same word. The Dutch word for handful is handvol. Grijpen comes from the Indo-European ghreyb. The author could have made a much stronger argument that grijpen comes from Persian gereftan. The Arabic is really illegible but it looks like it says غرفه.  ف is actually an ""f"" sound - not ""p"". The author came up with a convoluted system of excluding the vowels in Arabic to make the words look more similar to Dutch despite pronunciation. He also cut off part of the Dutch word to make it work.  غرفه has multiple meanings in Arabic, but what the author was going for was ""hollow of the hand.""  That is not actually the same as a handful.    http://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%87/  Basically he took two sort-of-not-really similar sounding words with vaguely related definitions and changed some details around until he could prove Dutch comes from Arabic.

Some other guy wrote a rebuttal that claimed Sanskrit was just a debased dialect of Greek that the locals had picked up from their Hellenistic masters post-Alexander. His exact term was ""kitchen Greek,"" which probably references an older joke about kitchen Latin  (which I actually bothered to link instead of explaining because it's kind of complicated and I don't think it's that funny) or maybe just refers to ""kitchen French,"" which is more or less the universal language of the European kitchen (largely replaced in the US by kitchen Spanish), which would have been a representative low-status dialect as well as analogous to what the guy was claiming were the actual origins of Sanskrit.

Even if they didn't necessarily contrast those sounds in eye-dialect, I wouldn't say that being able to spell /ɑ:/ two different ways is proof that the <r> is considered silent.  After all, we spell /f/ as both <f> and <ph>, yet dropping either the <p> or the <h> in the digraph definitely changes the sound of a word."

The <ph> example is unlike the ""ba""/""bar"" example, in that you can simply remove the letter in question in one and have the same sound with ""ba(r)"" but not with ""grap(h)"".  For example, ""tar"" and ""ta"" are homophones, and it could be said that they differ in one having a silent letter.  This isn't to say that I'm arguing that the ""r"" definitely is silent.

badlinguistics,3de0kg,storkstalkstock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Maybe a better example would be the digraph <aw>?  In cot-caught and father-bother merged dialects, it represents /ɑ:/ just as much as <-a> does, so that jaw and spa are rhymes.  But in non-merging accents, the <w> keeps the two vowel sounds distinct and I presume for most people it wouldn't be considered silent.  Does the <w> suddenly become silent in accents with the mergers, even though the phoneme count remains the same?  As someone with a merging accent, I'd say not.    In fact, if I were to use eye-dialect specifically for people who share the mergers, I would probably use <aw> more than almost any other spelling to represent that sound, if only because <ah>, <a>, and <o> would be pronounced differently word finally or before certain consonants.  Like, if I were representing /pɑstə/ as 'pastuh' or 'pahstuh', a Canadian who says /pæstə/ might think I share their pronunciation and if I write it as 'postuh', people might think I mean /poʊstə/.  The only really unambiguous ways to spell it would be 'pawstuh' or maybe 'poss-tuh'.    I think that's a decent enough demonstration that just because the same sound can be represented by one less letter (as in spa compared to jaw), it doesn't mean that extra letters are automatically 'silent'.  When it comes down to it, there's probably not really a right answer, but that's at least how I see it."

(In Spanish, conejo means rabbit but also is slang for vulva.) It’s not a coincidence that the words coney and cunny are so similar; both probably go back to the Latin for hole or tunnel.   Fun fact: 'Coney' was first pronounced with a short 'o' (as in 'money', but that was changed because of its resemblance to the 'cunny'. In French, 'conin' was dropped because of similar accidental connotations. Hardly seems like a easy co-existence.  Etymologically Latin cuniculus is most likely derived from a Paleo-Iberian language, which makes sense since rabbits are indigenous to that peninsula; it's why Spain's called Spain! Coney might be derived from cuniculus, but it might also be a Germanic borrowing directly from the source language, or a partial loan-translation.   Latin cuniculus can also mean 'subterranean passageway' (as in mines, mineshafts, later also 'covered aquaducts'), but it's more likely that it derives from the borrowing animal than anything else. I'm not sure it even had sexual connotations.  Cunny, on the other hand, is derived from Latin cunnus. The c-word is very Germanic and not necessarily related.  So, any connection between cuniculus the animal and any sexual c-word is coincidental and was seen as unfortunate throughout history."

I'm not familiar with the history of English orthography or English phonetics, so I can't give you details. But the reflex of Old English /ʊ/ was/is written as both ⟨u⟩ and ⟨o⟩. It might be related to the difference in spelling that in parts of Yorkshire, some or all words spelled with ⟨o⟩ for /ʊ/ (e.g. nothing, love) are pronounced with [ɒ], rather than [ʊ], which is the normal realisation of this phoneme in that area.

It was more in reference to the kinds of structures which either do not occur in languages world wide, or only very rarely so. One example is that basic word orders in which O precedes S are very rare, another one would be number categories beyond trial for specifically four, five, six, ... entities. I don't think these even exist at all.  An OSV standard word order or a ""pental"" are both perfectly sensible, but due to cognitive processing constraints or lack of frequency, they do not or only seldom develop or occur in languages.

It's true that we can consider English personal pronouns a closed class, but not all languages have a closed class of personal pronouns. Japanese comes to mind.  The text does come off as prescriptivist, but from a descriptive perspective I think it's perfectly reasonable to hypothesize that all the new, arbitrary pronouns are unlikely to catch on, and that singular they is the most likely candidate for a gender-neutral pronoun. I say that, though, knowing I risk talking down to non-binary people who prefer other pronouns, which I don't really want to do."

A similar thing happened with the deictic status of these pronouns (not all of these pronouns were created with a similar goal - some were simply created due to peoples' pretensions about 'they/them').  I think the argument works as long as the end conclusion is not that no new pronouns can be added to english, but that the creation and argumentation for them has involved several ideas that make them unlikely to be adopted outside of their speech community.

New content words are learned quite easily, whereas function words take time to get used to and integrate.  My personal - though not mutually exclusive - theory on why these new pronouns won't catch on however is that they don't look English.

badlinguistics,3dbs2w,bananensoep,0,Wed Jul 15 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"Except we'd run into the same lack of data.  Granted, these properties u/mamashaq points out (except for modifiers) are things which didn't occur to me. Then again, as I have said earlier, I think people will only use these neopronouns as replacement for actual pronouns, so their distribution would be relatively similar. The real question is how easy it is to process a sentence like ""The man gave the woman a present"" compared to ""He gave her a present"" (given that the 'he' and the 'she' have been introduced) compared to ""xe gave plor a present"". My point with the aliasses has been that these neopronouns function more like nouns do in that regard."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,bananensoep,4,Thu Jul 16 08:04:38 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks for the link! I didn't know saying pronouns are a closed class word group or deictic elements counted as 'talking out of your ass' or 'bad linguistics', but you learn something new every day.  u/Rial91 points out where I am coming from: there is a difference in how you use content words and function words. Sentences which consist only out of full NPs are harder or 'more heavy' to process than those which contain more deictic elements like pronouns. As pronouns have certain properties which make it so they don't really allow for new members to be added (cfr. the most recent addition being 'they'), and furthermore require these additions to be deictic elements, these overly specific and arbitrary 'pronouns' wouldn't really be pronouns like the classic 'I', 'you' and so on and I would predict processing a sentence with these neopronouns would be similar to processing a sentence with full NPs.  That's another explanation of what I meant, though I do understand people who have taken my post to be prescriptive.  And yes, I am persuing a PhD in linguistics, but to calm your fears, it has nothing to do with pronouns and it will be on the basis of corpus research."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,Rial91,4,Wed Jul 15 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"I assume the brain uses function words to construct those tree-like structures to analyse sentences, and integrating new function words into that tree-building process is a difficult task for the brain.  Content words on the other hand can easily be placed into the leaves of those trees and don't influence the structure at all."

Simply put, pronouns have no properties that do not permit the addition of new ones. Can it take a while? Sure, but it doesn't have to. Wunna/unu/wunnu, the common second person plural throughout Caribbean English, took root rather quickly as speakers had a gap in the paradigm to fill, and we find it even in early Caribbean Englishes. Conjunctions might be said to have the same 'properties', yet we have a new coordinating conjunction slash from the last few decades. Is it unusual to add them? Yes, it's the unusualness that leads us to call them 'closed-class'.  What about other properties of anaphora? Are you saying that xe  would be fine in both of the following?   Jordani sent xei a message 'Jordan sent a message to xeself' Jordani sent xej a message 'Jordan sent a message to someone else'   Did you get grammaticality judgments for that? Isn't that another basic property of pronouns to account for?  People are accusing you of talking out of your ass in large part because you're presenting a small part of the story, ignoring the people who actually do use these things like pronouns in the classical sense, and trying to use your budding expertise as a justification among people who are unlikely to be able to see through your rhetoric."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,bananensoep,2,Wed Jul 15 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't say new pronouns cannot be added. A new one is currently being added to the English inventory in the form of 'you all' (and variant forms), to fill a gap in de paradigm, as you said (or perhaps to disambiguate). I'm not hiding this, I clearly stated it in the first post.  I don't really know where you're going with the part about anaphora. Is the point that people would interpret the sentence as one or two? As 'xe' really hasn't caught on, most people would probably interpret it as two and ask: ""Who is xe? Do I know her?""  What part of the story am I missing? I did talk about people who are using those pronouns, but I also said why they do not function like real pronouns do. No matter how you bend it, 'xe' does not have the same generality as 'he' and 'she', because every woman I meet is a 'she', but not every non-binary person is a 'xe'. That's the real crux, if they would come up with a specific pronoun to fill that slot, then it would be a wholly different story.  Also, ""my rhethoric"", as if I have a secret agenda."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,Choosing_is_a_sin,5,Wed Jul 15 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"The part of the story that you're missing is evidence of your points. You're only presenting part of the story about real pronouns. You don't take the time to show for example that these pronouns can disobey binding constraints that real pronouns do. The point of the example sentences, as shown by the glosses, is that under your formulation, people should be able to interpret sentence 1 as being grammatical, since it's functioning like an NP that's coreferential with Jordan (as shown by the indices). If you insert s/he in there, there's no way people would find it grammatical, and it would have to be replaced by herself/himself. The normally used repair for that for xe is xyrself. But we don't see that kind of behavior for NPs.   Additionally, ""most people would probably"" isn't really evidence; it's a guess. It's also trying to conflate two things: the speech community that uses these pronouns and the one that doesn't. If you want to determine whether it actually behaves like a true pronoun, first you look at the people who actually do use it. Does it have the properties of a pronoun like obeying Binding Conditions A-C? Does it function like other pro-elements, like pro-verbs, pro-adjectives, etc.? When two people, e.g. Jordan and Baylie, who use the same pronoun are being referenced in a conversation, is a sentence like Jordan sent the flowers to xyr rather than keeping them for xyrself somehow ambiguous to those communities? You have to look at the properties of the elements within the system that they actually belong to, and if the people in the group don't share the same norms, then it really can't be said to be a single speech community (in either the Labovian or Chomskyan senses). So, go ahead and find out whether xe follows these arguably more central properties of pronouns in the communities where it's used. If it doesn't obey those properties, then you'd have a much better argument. But right now, it just seems like you're trying to say ""it's not a true pronoun because some people have different idiolects"". That you don't recognize ""the class of people who identify with this set of pronouns"" as a class capable of being grammaticalized is not an argument that it isn't a class of people in itself. You might wish it were more generic, but you don't seem to care about the fact that singular they with a specific referent behaves exactly the same way (it only refers to people who wish to be identified as they), unless you happen to belong to a community where singular they with a specific referent happens to already belong to your grammar."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,bananensoep,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, this is a more substantial amount of criticism. It is true I haven't done any testing and elsewhere in the comments on the thread, I concede that in limited communities this might work (E: https://np.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/3daf1k/why_custom_personal_pronouns_dont_work_a/ct3c1cv). However, I would see this as similar to willfully replacing certain words among your group of friends, like this post says: https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/3daf1k/why_custom_personal_pronouns_dont_work_a/ct3m7nz They are club nicknames, you know to refer to John and Kyle as 'xyr', but Taylor is 'xe'. Do people within these communities process these words as they do pronouns? Perhaps, we'd have to do some brain scans to see.  As soon as you'd try to implement it in the whole of the English speaking community, it wouldn't work nearly as smoothly because of the properties of pronouns I outlined, most specifically the deictic semantics.  E: As for 'they': as I said, I am not a native speaker, so I do not know if there are significant differences in the acceptance or usage of singular 'they'. Either way, it would still require some communication, yes (""Please use 'they' when talking about me"" or something), but when people hear it used in this sense, it is far easier to understand than a pronoun they have never heard."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,Choosing_is_a_sin,5,Wed Jul 15 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"They are club nicknames, you know to refer to John and Kyle as 'xyr', but Taylor is 'xe'. Do people within these communities process these words as they do pronouns? Perhaps, we'd have to do some brain scans to see.   No, you don't need neuroimaging techniques to do this (and I'm not sure that they'd be very reliable in any case). An anaphor must be bound to something in the discourse. Do people actually use xe as a name, or do they only use them when bound to something? And if they are bound, and they are not simply nicknames for Kyle or Taylor, then they are functioning as pronouns, even if their class is a small class to point to. I don't accept your premise that these are not deictic elements, because you haven't actually established that there's no class of people for them to refer to. Indeed, the class of people is akin to the class of people that can be referred to with singular they; it's already working the way you say it can't work, since not all new non-binary people can be referred to by they with specific reference. It seems like you're just stipulating that something isn't deictic without taking the time to look at the communities that use these pronouns as part of their everyday discourse to find out whether they are in fact deictic. And if they are deictic, and they spread to the wider community, then that deixis is likely (but not guaranteed) to persist. ""Implementation"" is not at stake here; this is a bottom-up change, just like specific-reference singular they, just like wunna, just like slash.  I also take issue with your learnability hypothesis. Show me the evidence that says it's easier to relearn the conditions of coreference on an existing pronoun rather than implementing the same conditions as all other third-person pronouns with a new one. Are you sure you're not arguing from personal experience with respect to your last edit?"
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,bananensoep,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"We'd need corpus data to fully be able to investigate whether or not binding is necessary for these pronouns. (Though I would argue a simple ""don't say this, say that"" process is taking place: ""At this moment I'd say 'he', but I know this person prefers 'xe', so I'll go for that"", akin to how you replace words in your native language with foreign language words when you're first learning that language. They will never use 'xe' at the beginning of a conversation before binding, but if they did, it wouldn't really cause that much of a problem, except for how knowing two Johns may also cause confusion.)  However, my question to you is how an element can be deictic if it does not have a clear class of elements to refer to. How is a pronoun like 'xe' different from a name like 'John'? Both are arbitrary with regards to the people they refer to, there is nothing about the group of 'xe'-ers which distinguishes them from people who picked 'xyr'. Tell me how this is supposed to gain traction if it's by no means generalizable to a whole, easily definable group. Tell me how they are deictic when they do not derive their meaning solely from the context, but also from the fact that the referent can only be part of a specific set of people.  The point I make about knowing only one man is also crucial here: all men are immediately 'he', there is no question even about that. That makes it so 'he' is a clear deictic element. 'Xe' is not a clear deictic element: it can be taken to refer to many people, but who is in or out is not something you can decide right away, it needs informing. Much like how I need to know your name first if I want to call you by the right name."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,Choosing_is_a_sin,3,Wed Jul 15 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily need corpus data. You can start by getting acceptability judgments. But if you do get a corpus, you have to get it from the relevant speech community. Right now you're telling me what people will never do, but I don't get the feeling that you're basing this on anything in particular. What is your source here?  The pronoun xe is different from a name in a variety of ways, but particularly with respect to its coreference. Xe substitutes for names, it obeys binding conditions A-C, which names do not need to do. I would say that the thing that distinguishes the groups that have different pronouns is their membership in the group that uses those pronouns. Remember that even now, we have nouns that are ambiguous for gender: attorney, parent, caretaker, laborer, obstetrician, police officer, sibling, Redditor, and so on, not to mention gender-neutral names like Kerry, Shannon, Kyle, Jordan, Choosing_is_a_sin, etc. When I encounter a reference to a specific attorney or to Jordan, I must pay attention to the pronoun used to put them into the class of a particular pronoun; that process does not change when you add more pronouns to the group (again, this is already part and parcel of the solution that you yourself suggested, singular they). Again, that you don't acknowledge the class of ""people who identify with a certain pronoun"" as an easily definable class is a reflection of you, not your data (which again, you don't actually have).   There are similar problems with T/V pronouns. Who gets to be T and who gets to be V? People in the real world don't agree on this-- I've had many friends who've bristled at being addressed as T by people in a situation where the addresser 'should have known better'. When I recounted the story of me getting mugged to a French linguist, he expressed surprise that the mugger used the V form with me. It gets more complicated in places where three levels exist (e.g. in those places in the Spanish-speaking world where vos, tú and usted all co-exist). In those cases, you either get corrected and make adjustments or the person just deals with it, knowing that there's no clear line. I'd also point out that gendered pronouns also make reference to specific sets, and that in languages with lots of noun classes, there are lots of different pronouns to be learned (e.g. in Itakho, where the word for 'infant' belongs to a different gender than the rest of the words for people, should a baby automatically get referred to with the class of 'infant' or for people?). People manage to learn lots of pronouns, sometimes not with very clear semantic bases for the classes. But those pronouns are very clearly deictic nonetheless, even if the class isn't easily definable for analysts."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,bananensoep,4,Wed Jul 15 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"The problems you point out, ambiguity of the gender of someone or their social hierarchy towards you, actually just further motivate moving away from gendered systems alltogether. Don't know if an attorney is male or female? Well, maybe consider using 'they', saves you a lot of typing. In Dutch, the boundaries between T and V are also fading, which simply means the V pronoun is disappearing (as it has once before; similar to what happened in English).  People manage to learn pronouns, but I would posit there is always a sort of general class beneath what falls in which pronoun in why. For gendered pronouns, this goes back to the grammatical gender system that existed in IE and earlier forms of English (of which the current system is a remnant), for T/V systems, it's a clear social structure. A T/V system may no longer be as easily grasped by speaker because social norms are changing - do you automatically V older people or not? Is a professor always a V or are some a T?  A class of people who do not identify with a particular pronoun is not an easily definable class for the same reason people who are named John is not an easily definable class. However, I am not saying you can't study who uses what and learn it like you would learn people's names. Ultimately though, none of us have any data to definitively prove or disprove is, I just rest my case on the properties which pronouns have and which these new pronouns lack, which are deictic meaning and a universal acceptance and usage by all speakers of the language. We can chitchat about specific language communities and sure, different social groups may develop their own specific grammar rules, but I highly doubt these neopronouns will ever gain mainstream traction."
badlinguistics,3dbs2w,Choosing_is_a_sin,3,Wed Jul 15 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"Don't know if an attorney is male or female? Well, maybe consider using 'they', saves you a lot of typing.   Except that I don't know that this person uses they, and using it the way you're suggesting is something that I find ungrammatical. If I say John's attorney wants their documents ASAP, I won't interpret their as being coreferential with John's attorney unless I have been told otherwise. This is my grammar, though, and I'm not making claims about its generality.   For gendered pronouns, this goes back to the grammatical gender system that existed in IE and earlier forms of English (of which the current system is a remnant),   This is only true of the gender systems in IE, but of course you have lots of gender systems all over the world, and they have their own pronouns. You said that the class has to be 'easily definable' to be deictic, and I supplied you with examples of how there are systems where it's not 'easily definable' and where there is still deixis. That's the point you need to respond to if you want me to accept that xe is still not deictic.   Also, your point about social norms changing is one that you should take to heart when thinking about the possibility of pronouns like xe spreading. With social norms changing, it opens up the possibility for these to take root.   I just rest my case on the properties which pronouns have and which these new pronouns lack, which are deictic meaning and a universal acceptance and usage by all speakers of the language.   Let's be clear: You have not supplied even marginally convincing evidence that these pronouns are not deictic (unless you accept Peter Matthews' logic in his dictionary that while you and I are deictic, he and she are anaphoric, but that would undercut your whole point). You have ""posited"" that it's like learning people's names, but you haven't shown that these pronouns bear the same formal features as people's names, i.e. that they share the same distribution as names and differ crucially in their distribution from the other personal pronouns. You have stipulated a lack of 'deictic meaning' (though nothing I've found supports your interpretation of deictic-- perhaps you could supply the definition that you've consulted). Furthermore, under this logic, vos is not a pronoun in the Spanish-speaking communities where it's used because it's not in use everywhere. The same thing would be true of wunna in Caribbean English; it's not a pronoun here because people who aren't part of this speech community don't use it. So you want to have a social definition of a pronoun and a formal definition of a pronoun, so that when one of them fails, at least you've got the other one to go back to. Thus, if I were to take your approach when doing descriptive analysis of variation between tú and vos in Colombia, I could not do a variationist analysis because I wouldn't be comparing like with like, i.e. I'd be comparing a pronoun to a non-pronoun, and I'd be basing that distinction on norms from outside the speech community despite the fact that the speakers in the speech community all share the norm that it has the same kind of distribution as other subject pronouns. Do you see why your criteria are untenable if we wish to do descriptive analysis?"

This person claims the potential semantic content of a pronoun to be more limited than it probably is.

Do you really think that makes the idea of a ""pussy pass"" valid, and is this really the battle that you want to fight? Yeah, let's not attack the misogynist attitudes behind the double-standard - let's defend the group of men who wanted to gather together and complain about how women get special treatment.  There is so much wrong with this that I don't know where to begin. I could start with the qualification attractive; I could continue and add my own qualification of white. I could explain how taking the few situations where women benefit from misogynist cultural attitudes and turning them into a general concept of a ""pussy pass"" is at its heart misogynist and obtuse.

I'm reasonably certain that that very judge would not have extended is generosity to an equally attractive equally white man.

Is the idea that ""prescriptive linguistics is just descriptive linguistics of the educated classes"" original, or is it an existing idea which has some sort of name?   It seems to me that people saying ""You ought to speak this way"" are really just saying ""It would be wise to speak this way, if you want to be taken seriously/get a good job/be successful"". So the language that people tell you that you ""ought"" to speak is simply the language that successful people already do speak.  I'm quite happy to listen to any critiques.

If you mean that ""prescriptive linguistics"" is the enforcement of the linguistic norms of the privileged classes, then it's not a new idea. I don't think it has a specific name. There are terms for the converse: linguistic stigmatization, linguistic discrimination, and linguistic prejudice are some terms for the enforcement of linguistic norms against stigmatized varieties and people.  And that's what's actually going on. It's not so much that we expect people to speak ""the standard language"" (at least in the US); there is no such thing, as what counts as ""standard"" is very broad. It's that we expect people not to speak certain stigmatized varieties.   For example, someone who has immigrated from the UK to the US will probably not be expected to assimilate to Standard American English, and their accent might even be considered cute, intelligent, or sexy - nevermind that it's not ""standard."" A person who speaks AAVE natively, whose variety is no more different, is expected to learn ""better"" English. Likewise, people from certain countries (especially Western European ones) might be considered to have prestigious accents, but if you are from south of the border, your accent isn't valued.   It seems to me that people saying ""You ought to speak this way"" are really just saying ""It would be wise to speak this way, if you want to be taken seriously/get a good job/be successful"".   Yeah, some people believe that they're only dispensing practical advice. Here are some things to consider if you're one of them:   People who speak stigmatized dialects know that they're stigmatized; it's not as though they're ignorant of the fact that people think they speak poorly and need to be told so Being able to speak a non-stigmatized variety opens doors, but there's nothing objectively better about speaking it all the time - i.e. no good reason why a person shouldn't ever know (and use) non-standard language It's no accident that the language of success is the language of white, middle class males Telling someone that they ought to speak a certain way is really presumptuous unless it's a situation like you being their teacher Telling someone that they ought to speak a certain way isn't politically neutral, either; language is closely linked to identity, and that is where attitudes towards different varieties stem from -  so when you say that certain linguistic varieties aren't acceptable in professional contexts, you are enforcing a racist, sexist, and classist idea of what it means to be ""professional"" People have their own individual needs and goals - they need the tools to make their own decisions about how much to accommodate, and when The urge to enforce linguistic norms in informal contexts is usually more about enforcing norms than legitimately helping people   All of that said, you are also giving many people way too much credit. The belief that there is a ""correct"" language and that certain deviations from it are denerate, lazy, uneducated, illogical, etc is firmly entrenched in our culture. People who don't think that some varieties are objectively more correct than others and who are only dispensing ""practical advice for success"" or whatever are in the minority."
badlinguistics,3d8erb,boruno,6,Tue Jul 14 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is our education system, which has a subject called ""L1"" (""English"" in the US) which teaches several aspects of the language (literacy/reading, composition, grammar, spelling, style, literature, and, especially, the formal register), but does not (obviously) teach the language itself, which was already acquired.   This subject is bundled with other disciplines that are more receptive to a ""right/wrong"" approach, such as math, biology, physics etc.  On top of that, there are also foreign language classes, which depend on ""right/wrong"" to actually teach non native speakers.  So, how can the student realize that, when an English teacher corrects their grammar, it's not the same kind of correction that the Chemistry teacher does, or even the (foreign) French teacher?

What, then, is a non-standard dialect but simply a dialect?  The problem is the implication that the dialect of Speaker X is more standard than the dialect of Speaker Y. More often than not, the argument comes down to ""correctness,"" which implies that Speaker Y just doesn't understand his language as well as Speaker X.  It's simply untrue, as all native speakers are experts in their own languages. What dialect or variety gains prestige is driven by cultural standards, not linguistic ones, and it too often results in prejudice.  Your very use of ""ask"" is a huge problem that belies your misunderstanding of language theory. The process by which /æsk/ becomes /æks/ is called metathesis, and it's been apparent in the English language at least since the 14th Century (to my knowledge), and you'll find Chaucer using ""ax"" where Shakespeare later uses ""ask."" So did Chaucer not know how to speak English correctly? Did Shakespeare?  It is a privileged class that determines what is right and what is wrong, and they do so at the disenfranchisement of lower classes."

Sociolinguistics is a thing and pretending you wouldn't understand that there are prestige-variants which are expected to be used in certain situations by most people (aka standards) seems a bit insincere to me.  I can't see how chiming into a conversation that tries to apply prescriptivism to a single word in a context with regular usage of language that is heavily shunned by prescriptivists is something Badling would get up in arms about.

badlinguistics,3d8erb,Cheese-n-Opinion,15,Wed Jul 15 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"Another point that my colleagues have not yet raised is the difference in breadth between the two views of language. The prescriptivist approach takes no interest in the things that many of us describe. There's no prescriptivist rule about how long it takes between the release of a consonant and the voicing of a vowel for it to count as ""aspirated"". There's no prescriptivist rule against a question whose answer is Jordan and Kerry said they met a couple who sold coconut water being phrased as *What did Jordan and Kerry say they met a man who sold? There's no prescriptivist argument to be had about the role of age of arrival in naturalistic second language acquisition. Prescriptivism has a narrow, focused goal of policing those who dare not obey a certain set of social norms.  Another issue is the nature of the two. Prescriptivism is inherently stipulative. There cannot be prescriptive observation. It can only serve to say what should and should not be done, by definition. Descriptivism on the other hand shies away from stipulation with respect to language use. It can report on any aspect of language, and on any language variety to which we have access. By taking the value-neutral approach that is absent from prescriptivism, we can learn all sorts of things about language that we wouldn't have if we just dismissed things as being 'not real language'. Al Bedouin Sign Language, which 85 years ago would have been brushed off as mere unsystematic gesticulation, is challenging our ideas about words necessarily being decomposable into smaller units like units of meaning or the sign equivalents of sounds. Bantu languages, once dismissed as the grunts of inferior peoples, have shown us about the complexities of noun-gender systems. Descriptivists have had to learn to stop dismissing sources of linguistic evidence a priori. Any source of language can tell us something important. If you've seen Ratatouille, this is the ""Anyone can cook"" philosophy: Not every language variety will have something that truly causes us to reexamine received truths, but any language can be such a source, and we have to look at all languages with the same level of detail and respect if we want to find that out."

And those that do consume mass media don't all consume the same mass media. And those that do consume mass media might relate linguistically to that particular dialectal form of communication while in certain situations (e.g. online or with other fans of that particular type of mass media), but will revert to their local dialect when among friends.   There's plenty of evidence of new dialects arising in North America, and there's no evidence that mass media is reducing local dialects.   Mass media might be making a standard register more common so that people will code switch into that easily when talking to strangers or talking formally, but it's not going to eliminate local dialects."

I remember reading something over in /r/linguistics that said dialects are still arising, even with the advent of mass media and the internet... it's just the changes might be different.   I don't know all that much about English dialects. Where I'm from (Sweden), dialectal differences have been steadily diminishing since the 19th century. Maybe they are on the rise elsewhere, but it seems natural that as communications improve, language differences grow smaller and smaller.   We tend to speak in a manner similar to the people we speak with. In the past, we spoke to the people living close to us, and consequently we spoke as the people living close to us. Today, we speak to people from all over the place on the phone, on Skype and so on. We spend a greater time talking and listening to people living far from us and less time talking and listening to people living close to us.  People who do not move from their hometowns will probably keep their accents, and regional accents will keep evolving in various directions. Accents are very easy to pick up and the accents we pick up as kids tend to stick with us. However, accents are such a small part of a dialect. I have a stronger accent than my father, since his parents were pronunciation nazis that thought their own accent sounded uneducated. However, his social network is much more local than mine, to a large degree thanks to improved communications, and as a result, his vocabulary in the local dialect is much larger than mine. There are so many words that I've just never heard of, since time is finite and I spend more time than he does speaking to people from other places. And since younger generations tend to be more like me, because of improved communications, they won't learn many of these words either. Consequently, when we speak to each other, we won't use these words. The words will likely go extinct as a result. That doesn't mean the dialect will go away completely, but it will gradually become more similar to some sort of standard language.  An extreme example of this is my brother who has spent most of his life in front of a computer screen, communicating with people in English rather than Swedish. When I speak to him, it is obvious that his Swedish vocabulary is lacking. There are many words that he doesn't know, but would've known if he had spent more time communicating with Swedes. In this sense, while I agree with the sentiment, I think it is an oversimplification to state (as many do here) that everyone speaks his or her native language perfectly. Of course everyone can communicate fluently in their native languages, but fluency is not black and white. Some people are more fluent in their own languages than others, perhaps because they have a larger vocabulary.   I know this is all anecdotal and I would be very interested if someone could show me evidence that this is not an ongoing process, or even that it is going in the opposite direction in some places."

badlinguistics,3d7eho,ephemer-,-3,Tue Jul 14 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"A bigger vocabulary doesn't make them more fluent. It just means they can be more eloquent... Almost all native speakers (barring those who are mentally and/or physically incapable, and those with language attrition) can communicate perfectly in their native language.    This is just a matter of how we define fluency. Of course, if you have a small vocabulary, you can fill the blanks by waving your arms around. And the message will eventually get through, even if it takes more words and hand gestures than ""necessary"". If someone doesn't know the word for 'plate' and instead asks for ""that thing... uhh... the thing in the cupboard... that you eat on"", you could call that lack of eloquence, but one could just as well call it lack of fluency. And it wouldn't be wrong to state that his knowledge of his native language is smaller than that of someone that knows all the words he knows, plus 'plate'.   But this wasn't even the point I was trying to make. The point was that if there is a tendency that the vocabulary of the local dialect is getting smaller and smaller, then that dialect is not disappearing, but approaching something else as words get replaced by non-local substitutes.    I suggest reading through this thread, particularly /u/Choosing_is_a_sin's response. And this thread   I also wouldn't expect e.g., American and Canadian English to converge any further than they already have. The differences between the two are already quite small. It would be much more interesting to look at, for example, the extent to which dialects within the UK approach eachother. Is the English spoken by young people in Scotland more or less similar to the English spoken in England than the English their grandparents spoke was? And preferably differences relating to vocabular and grammar, not just accents. The differences between different types of North American English are probably so small as to make the reasoning above inapplicable.  EDIT: And instead of downvoting, it would be helpful if someone would actually explain why the process I described above does not take place.   EDIT2: If you read /u/Choosing_is_a_sin's response, you would see that he or she implicitly supports the existence of this process, where cultural contact/communication homogenizes language.    Look especially at Milroy's work on social networks (real social networks, not Facebook and its ilk) to see the homogenizing effect that dense network connections have on people's speech.   So what happens when social networks become less dense?   You should also look up the importance of interaction for language change and acquisition. Also, think about your daily surfing habits. How many Canadian websites do you visit? Australian? Indian? South African? [...] Do people generally have lots of friends/contacts from outside their dialect area? If so, what features would you expect to see changes in, and do you actually see them? If they don't have many contacts outside their language area, why would you expect their language to change?   Implying that our language is influenced by the people we communicate with.  So how exactly does this reddit user contradict my position? You could of course argue that this process does not take place because improved communications have had relatively little actual impact on our social networks. That of course differs a lot depending on where you are, but it could be the case in a lot of places."

As far as I know, Italy isn't the only country where languages and dialects are dying as people try to adopt the most prestigious one.   But the issue is new dialects will form almost immediately. They might not be as marked, but due to natural language change, and the fact that nobody speaks the standard natively, new ones diverge."
badlinguistics,3d7eho,Polisskolan2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, probably the fact is that I'm more worried about what we call ""dialect"" in Italy, which are really other romance languages, sometimes as divergent from Italian as French is.  So... maybe the fact is more that we are right now losing languages just to get some ""dialects of Italians"" back, which is not a good deal for anyone, imho. And I'm still quite sure a lot of innovations are mediated by mass media and affect ""Italian speakers"" of most part of the peninsula...  A list someone sent me about the differences between one of such ""minority languages we call dialects"", Abruzzese and Italian:   the lexicon use of schwa (which is common to other upper southern varieties) Auxiliary selection (person-driven in Abruzzese, verb-driven in Italian/rest of Romance) Passives by gemination (not found anywhere else in Romance) Person-driven differential object marking (prep accusative ALSO person-driven): only found in Abruzzese, [to the knowledge of who made the list] deictic adverbs (the way I do it, the way you do it, the way neither of us does it): Italian does not have that epenthetic /ɤ/ non-phonological Raddoppiamento fonosintattico metaphony deictic pronouns and demonstratives... (also present in old Italian, now disappeared) many others   I don't have a similar list for what people used to speak in my region, but in my city I know just 3 persons aged under 30 who speak it. Transmission between generation was broken by the generation before mine (parents would do their best to speak Italian with their children)... and this is the standard situation in most of Italy.  Even if language will continue to naturally evolve and diverge, I think mass media and a ""good"" school system will probably keep those variations uniform between Italian speakers... the standard will slowly adapt to new uses, there will still be a more colloquial and slangy register and a more formal one... but even if there will still be some geographical differences, I doubt we'll ever develop very divergent dialects."

No, the words we're talking about are more advanced ones, usually learned through education, such as 'quotidian'.   This is of course true. Although I've never heard the word 'quotidian' before, so I have no idea exactly how ""advanced"" it is. But yes, the plate example was bad. I like to use exaggerated examples to make sure I get the point across, but sometimes (like now, evidently) that just creates other problems.   Your definition of fluency and word count is much more suited to L2 learners than L1 learners. Doubly so given the fact that all (physically and mentally capable) native speakers are 100% competent in their language, though they might have performance errors relating to things such as nervousness.   How would you prefer to define fluency for L1 learners then? Or is the concept irrelevant, since complete fluency of native speakers is taken as some kind of axiom?  I would never argue that there are people who ""can't speak their own language/dialect"" or anything like that. However, the language I speak is different from the language my father speaks. My vocabulary contains fewer local words than his. I have replaced these words with other words and experience no probems communicating using these. And of course, this does not mean I don't speak my dialect anymore, it means that the dialect is changing. It's not getting ""destroyed"" or anything like that, it's just becoming different; becoming more similar to some standard language. Maybe ""fluency"" is not the right word for this, I wouldn't know. But I don't see how it could be wrong to state that his knowledge of (at least) the dialect of older generations is greater than mine, since it is changing and I am not learning all the words that are disappearing.  So while all native speakers might be 100% competent in ""their language"", ""their language"" is not necessarily the same thing as the language traditionally spoken in their hometowns.    While it is less difference than in England, I would argue it's not just 'quite small'. There's quite a lot of dialectal difference even in American (think of the rural South, vs. working-class Manhattan). Sure, the standard is there, but people still use their dialects.   Yes, there are definitely differences. How large they are just depends on what we compare it with, I guess.   And who do you interact with the most? People in your social group, and in your local area. So, what would that do? It'd reinforce the sociolect and dialect of that group, making the dialect stronger   Right, and this is how dialects arose in the first place. But if technology and the nature of communication is changing so much that are social networks become less and less global, could this not make the dialect (relatively) weaker by the converse argument? I am not saying that this is happening today to any significant extent, but this seems like the direction we are (however slowly) heading. And even though dialects will of course always be there, in some form or another, it is interesting to consider how this development influences language on the margin, and to compare it to what it would've been like in the absence of this development.   First off, I never said it was my 'best'. It was simply the one that came up first on Google.    I regretted the way I phrased that edit and changed it. It appears I was too slow and you had already replied.   But, as Labov's study shows: the differences are actually happening faster. While I don't know research for dialects in the UK, I feel it's much more reasonable to assume this same process is happening there than something completely different.   While the empirics are very interesting, it would be even more interesting to learn something about the underlying causes. I haven't read that study. If you have, does he/she provide any explanation to that tendency? Unless there is some underlying causal relationship that is tested in the study, I would be careful to assume we'd experience the same development everywhere else. We are no doubt experiencing development in the opposite direction where I live.   Do you have any suggestion for what could cause divergence in the US to accelerate?"

Nobody is expecting you to speak the language your parents spoke; languages are constantly changing every generation.

So while all native speakers might be 100% competent in ""their language"", ""their language"" is not necessarily the same thing as the language traditionally spoken in their hometowns.   Exactly. Again, this is because language is constantly changing every generation.    But if technology and the nature of communication is changing so much that are social networks become less and less global, could this not make the dialect (relatively) weaker by the converse argument?   But, you have to look at the level of interaction. I'm from a rural area, and even though most of my friends here have Skype and other tools, they don't interact with that many people globally. I know several who haven't left the state we live in. Even if they were to start talking to people from, say, Ireland, the level of interaction would be much lower, and it's unlikely they'd pick up those speech features.    but this seems like the direction we are (however slowly) heading   See, I'm of the view that as the world becomes more global, people will identify more and more with local areas, and thus use the dialect of that area more and more as a social marker."

People think they know linguistics because they speak a language fluently, so they assume that linguistics is all intuitive and anyone who studies it formally is just jacking off.  It's a problem in a lot of fields, actually. For instance, I study Information Technologies and every semester, we get hoards of new students fresh out of high school who think they're experts because they installed a graphics card in their Dell gaming PC once, but they still can't defrag their hard drive or set up their router for port forwarding (nor do they have any idea what those things are, and they're likely too stubborn to even learn... which is why they inevitably drop out after a couple weeks :P).

You do claim this, though:    Yes, but they'll gain it back with quick practice; they don't lose that native speaker intuition.   This is the view that first language attrition is just performance loss, rather than competence loss; the knowledge does not disappear but, with lack of use, becomes difficult to access.

We do know that people who have undergone first language attrition appear to have lost native speaker intuitions when given grammaticality judgment tasks, and now the question is about how much of that is due to performance, and how much of that can be recovered.

badlinguistics,3d1jff,alx3m,-8,Mon Jul 13 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"""I could care less"" isn't an idiom that makes no literal sense, though; it makes perfect sense for the opposite meaning and there are plenty of native speakers who aren't familiar with it being used to mean ""I couldn't care less"". Imagine if someone from Flanders used ""Het zal niet me worst wezen"" to mean ""I couldn't care less"".

Of course the premise that we should conform to some specific dialect based on ""logic"", as if colloquial phrases and idioms are regularly logical, is a ridiculous proposition, even if we do, I'm not really seeing the ambiguity here. Do people actually say ""I could care less"" when they mean they're emotionally invested in something? Would it ever be ambiguous in context if they do?"

I'm seriously in disbelief that there's a situation that would exist in. From what I understand, then, the phrase simply doesn't exist in that form in your idiolect. I'm not really clear where the confusion is coming from, because every time it's used it's very obvious what it means. If there's a bot going around correcting people every time they use it in a natural setting, how could someone justify its existence except for the fact that the phrase ""could care less"" ALWAYS means the same as ""couldn't care less"" in that context?  Your example is meaningless because it's not an analogous situation. If people actually used ""could care less"" for anything other than the same thing as ""couldn't care less"", MAYBE you'd have some sort of point, but they don't, as far as I can tell."
badlinguistics,3d1jff,taoistextremist,-4,Mon Jul 13 08:14:28 2015 UTC,"I accept that the majority of uses of ""could care less"" would be with the idiomatic ""couldn't care less"" meaning. However, that doesn't change the potential for confusion among those who aren't familiar with the corrupted version.  What would you say if I told you that here in Australia ""it could come soon enough"" means the same as ""it couldn't come soon enough""?  Sure, in the US the latter series of words might be much more common because it's a common idiom, but the former still makes sense as a series of words and you might parse them as they stand without even considering that it's a corruption that means the opposite of its literal meaning. Maybe I've never heard the former used in a literal sense because it would be ""obvious"" to everybody speaking my dialect that it would be interpreted in the idiomatic sense and they would naturally avoid that combination of words for any literal meaning. That still wouldn't change the fact that you might get confused if I used the former version with you."

So, the difference between the two has been effectively lost in every other Western Germanic language except for English. I won't be surprised if it has also happened in the other Germanic languages.  So far, so good. However, does that mean people don't know what the 'correct' use is, or has the idea of what is 'correct' changed? I'd say the latter, not the former."

""dormía"" in this context is hence more like English ""I used to sleep/I was sleeping (when)/I often slept"", whereas estuve dormiendo can be used similarly to dormí and dormido."

badlinguistics,3czmrb,gordiep,2,Sun Jul 12 09:51:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I see some badlinguistics here, but I think it's pretty squarely on the side of OP and anyone else who claims that an understanding of ""Romance aspect"" somehow gives one particular insight into the Latin tense/aspect system.    Aside from the hilariously weird idea that ""Romance aspect"" is somehow unitary--I mean, it's not like ""Romance"" comprises  separate languages spread over a multi-thousand-mile diatopic stratum or anything, yes?--it's more than a little badling to suggest that a 2000-year old modern descendant would preserve the tense-aspect distinctions of its historical ancestor.  And this is all without even addressing the claim that the Latin perfect had a stable tense-aspect identity during the Classical: clearly not, as we can see movement in how the tense was applied from the Archaic to the Late Imperial periods (to say nothing of Latin compared to Proto-Italic or PIE).  As such, it doesn't matter at all that your grammar authority speaks Portugese:  is he a native Latin speaker?  No?  Then it has about as much bearing as my claim that knowing English makes me an expert in Old Frisian.  Most of the optimistically-named ""grammar discussions"" that OP links to rely on the same or similar fallacies, and so aren't of much worth.  In the discussions you link to, basically nobody bothers to cite a precedent for the construction.  Looking in the corpus is basically ground zero for this kind of question, and a quick search in the PHI corpus for imperfects of dormio demonstrates that while these are fairly rare and tend to skew to Imperial usage, they were nevertheless licensed.  Cf. Seneca Ep. Mor. 83.14.3, usque in horam sextam fere dormiebat,  where it is used to indicate continuous activity within a bounded timeframe, just as in your meme example."

badlinguistics,3cxyki,amelaine_,5,Sun Jul 12 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"The linked text ""the development of conservative words grows by doubling each century"" leads to this bizarre essay and i have never been more confused in my life   Conservative terms, expressing conservative insights, originate at a faster rate and with higher quality than liberal terms do.     Conservative triumph over liberalism is thus inevitable. Each year the English language develops about a thousand new words. The King James Version of the Bible contains only about 8,000 different words;[1] many good words have developed since.  Powerful new conservative terms have grown at a geometric rate, roughly doubling every century. For each new conservative term originating in the 1600s,[2] there are two new terms originating in the 1700s, four new terms in the 1800s, and eight new terms in the 1900s, for a pattern of ""1-2-4-8"". This suggests that the future will be increasingly conservative.   Those ""powerful new conservative terms"" include such self-evidently conservative words and phrases as:   accuracy - conservatives strive for accuracy, while many liberals are masters of deceit  elementary proof - a mathematical proof based on the minimum assumptions associated with real analysis; term probably does not predate complex analysis and its first use may have been the English mathematician James Joseph Sylvester's paper, ""On an elementary proof and generalisation of Sir Isaac Newton's hitherto undenionstrated rule for the discovery of imaginary roots.""  tour de force - 1802 - a feat of skill   Entries like   life vest - 1939 - a pro-life invention   would convince me this was mere trolling, were it not for the fact it was added by Andy Schlafy himself."

He wrote a well-known review of a style guide where he discussed the ongoing precriptivist v descriptivist wars. And while he was an intelligent and well-educated person he seriously mangled the issue. But one of the points he made, which pedants love to trot out, is that if you don't follow the prescriptions of Standard American Written English you are demonstrating how much you disrespect/despise your readers.

badlinguistics,3cy1uo,NeilZod,4,Sun Jul 12 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"I think the less thoughtful apologists would say that even though his fiction writing is challenging it always remained ""grammatically correct"" (style-wise) so it wasn't disrespectful but just challenging which is actually a sign of respect (you, careful reader, have the ability to figure it all out). But I always felt that didn't really hold up. We can often figure out non-standard styles and what was meant even if it's a challenge, so why does it matter?  I think the next level of apologetics is that it's OK to ""challenge"" the reader if you know what you are doing, ie, know the rules, ie you are Joyce or DFW or Pynchon. I find this lacking in explanatory power also as in how do we judge when someone is of that level, plus elitism.  There is no next level of apologetics which means the whole thing falls apart and if you are correct that DFW struggled with the notion then perhaps in time he would have rejected his original position.

This is called grammatical gender, it's nothing new, and the three-gender system is far from unique to German. In fact, 1500 years ago, this drivel would have been written in a language with three genders.    Depending on a word's ""case,"" or construction   What does ""construction"" even mean here? The case just gives you extra information about how the noun relates to the other words in the sentence.   Germans have more than a dozen different ways to say ""the"" and ""a.""   This may be true if you count the number of possible articles, but German uses most articles for multiple roles (for example, the dative article is the same with both masculine and neuter nouns), and German has exactly a dozen articles.   Even more mysterious are the verbs, which frequently reside at the end of a sentence   Oh God I have multiple verbs in the sentence what do I do?   or are split in half and placed as far away from one another as possible.   Which are mostly verbs that have prepositions at the beginning, like aufmachen, to open. ""Er macht das Fenster auf."" (He opens the window.) But apparently this is some confusing and mysterious phenomenon that is impossible to understand and exists only to confound those learning the language.

Also I really find it amusing how people who have only learned German other than their L1 of English (though native German speakers tend to have the same opinion) go on and on about the difficulty of German grammar. Sure, maybe it's more difficult than Romance grammar for English speakers (despite the relation to English), but it's far easier for native English speakers than pretty much any other language.

It might just be that my dialect (more or less prestige) and my friends/informal speaking community (well-educated, generally) are different than /u/galaxyrocker's (as he mentioned below), but I consider that I speak with a pretty high register, and also very creatively, often mixing quite archaic terms* with modern slang. Those I speak to understand that that's how I talk, and so far I've never taken any guff for it.  *I once rather seriously said ""Welkin weeps"" when I was trying to communicate that it was raining. I'd spent the day reading Beowulf and it kind of slipped out. My friend asked what ""welkin"" meant; I told him; he thought that was pretty cool; we went on our way.  EDIT: But, of course, there's a difference between doing that with a friend and doing that at karaoke night.

badlinguistics,3cvddc,Cheese-n-Opinion,3,Sat Jul 11 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily the obscureness, but there often is a correlation between less-used words and high register, for me."

It's not parsed ""reliably* among people I know, but there are certain situations where it has a different meaning than the previous two, like ""I want to speak not to the teacher"", where the ""not"" applies to ""to the teacher"" rather than to ""speak"". By the way, this one of the reasons that ""to X not"" isn't our solution to the split infinitive in ""to not X"". Because of this, we just split the infinitive. It was never a problem.  Finally there are overlaps as usual and people tend to use them with minor differences between different places, but this is how I always parse these personally."

badlinguistics,3cq7s5,Xaethon,5,Fri Jul 10 09:06:50 2015 UTC,"the Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines body as a corpse. The only way someone can be a corpse is if he or she is dead.   Not all bodies are dead (and 'dead body' is a centuries-old expression). Also, historically, 'corpse' (derived from Latin corpus by way of French) didn't necessarily mean a dead body either, which is probably the reason the dictionary went with that word.*  But who knows. Dictionaries are not authoritative. The author of this page makes the same mistake with his random nonsense about 'race' vs 'ethnicity'. Come on, if you're going to be a pedant at least know what you're talking about.  A similar shift in definition also happened to Old English lic; it's descendant lich means a dead body (as in other Germanic languages), but the original could just as well mean a living one. In Dutch the current word for 'body' lichaam is an old formation, from this word for 'physical body' and a word for 'home', which I think is very poetic."

The author of this page makes the same mistake with his random nonsense about 'race' vs 'ethnicity'. Come on, if you're going to be a pedant at least know what you're talking about.   Oh my god. I am going to quote some parts of that section so people can read it without searching through.   The difference between race and ethnicity is black and white. The example above is from Match.com who apparently don’t know the difference. Here at the academy, all the cadets are taught the difference, but just in case you don’t, The Random House dictionary defines ethnicity as: pertaining to or characteristic of a people, esp. a group (ethnic group) sharing a common and distinctive culture, religion, language, or the like. To that, I would like to add country. For example, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Scandinavian, etc.   So, first, he thinks it's a ""black and white"" distinction (it isn't, both race and ethnicity take into account real or imagined ancestry, and they're both extremely fuzzy and subjective categories). And then he takes ethnic nationalism in the totally bizarre direction of deriving ethnicity from nationality, leading to several bizarre conclusions, including this:   Last year, I stopped into a pizza parlor in Milan and it was run by a Chinese family who were Italian born. So, their ethnicity is Italian, but their race is Asian.   What the actual balls is this? First of all, many Chinese would consider themselves racially different from Japanese, Koreans, and Southeast Asians (people that we in the US tend to group as Asians -- and the category in the UK is different). Secondly, no Han Chinese family living anywhere in the world is going to identify as anything other than ethnically Chinese. They may be Italian citizens, but they are overseas Chinese.  Does this guy understand that there are ethnic groups that don't have a separate state? Like, most of them? And that most (well, really all) states have multiple ethnic groups. Again, a truly and epically bizarre application of ethnic nationalism."

I'm not terribly up to speed with recent developments (like Gothica Bononiensis, which is fascinating).   What was the word order in East Germanic languages?     That's actually not known for sure. The extant corpus of Gothic is is quite small, with most of it being parts of Ulfilas' translation of the Bible. Ulfilas had the tendency to adhere to the Greek original very strongly, in syntax and even vocabulary; Ancient Greek itself has a complex word order, so it's quite hard to argue any position. The rest is quite fragmentary; the other largest text (Skeireins) might be 'original' Gothic but it's still strongly influenced by Greek.  That said, most agree that it was SOV; it's also consensus that its shared ancestor with North and West Germanic had this order, as seen in contemporary runic inscriptions. It's not unreasonable to think that Gothic still retained that system in most situations, Gothic generally having been a conservative language. The most recently attested East Germanic language (a thousand years later), Crimean Gothic, is also barely attested; about a hundred words including a few clauses. Some claim those fragments indicate SVO with SOV traces."

Its cognates, Arabic ʾilāh (from which we get Allah < al-lāh) and Aramaic ʾalāh(a)/ʾelāh(a) also possess an -H ending, but feminine singulars in both these languages end in -at, not -ah. The few Biblical appearances (particularly in Job interestingly enough) of ʾeloah are also treated as masculine grammatically (eg. Deut 32:15b, Prov 30:5), so the -ah then simply can't be a feminine suffix.

The other examples are “yah” - God, and all its various uses as suffix, including the ever famous ”hallelujah.” The tetradrammaton, Yhwa, is another example of this rare occurence of the letter -h in this context. It's a unique use that has special deistic meanings, and is completely unrelated to -h's other uses as feminine, female posessive, and past tense.  I'm no linguist, but I do have a particular interest in biblical Hebrew. If there is anyone who can add anything to what I've said, I'd be happy to learn it.  I'd also like to point out that there are cases of feminine nouns with masculine plurals in Hebrew. One example being ”עט” - a quill or pen, the plural of which is ”עטים” - a masculine plural. However, it is still treated as a feminine contextually; only its plural format is masculine. I don't know if that counts."
badlinguistics,3cmzms,Znex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well that's what I just explaining, that it couldn't have been a feminine -ah, even though it looks like one. Nonetheless, your info is useful as well.  Although I must say that YHWH is believed to have been derived from a pre-Hebrew/non-Hebrew form of HYH, HWH, which means given the supposed voweling YaHWeH is likely a Hiphil form meaning ""he creates"". YaH is only a shortening of YHWH. Also, I don't know what this mapek -H you're referring to is. Where does the word come from?"
badlinguistics,3cmzms,Pyriew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"It's an Aramaic word (”exigent” or ”that which takes out.” the idea is basically that it develops the word.), used in mesoratic contexts to describe this partcular use of the letter 'he'. A Google search shows me a Wikipedia article about it titled ”Mappik” (which is a mistransliteration). I looked through it and it's pretty bad, with a lot a mistaken claims in it. However, it's a start.  Regardinh YHWH, I hate discussing this word because it is the grandest temple of badling. Suffice it to say that almost all ”beliefs” regarding it are quite unproven and often highly speculative. Nobody even has any real clue regarding the period of its emergence.  The only assertion I am willing to accept is that it is DIRECTLY related to the word YH, which I believe is pretty self-evident. YH has a mapek-he, so I put Yhwh (BTW Yahweh is a pretty badling pronounciation, but that's a whole different discussion. Suffice it say that if you know know something of Arabic, you'd always presume that its an -ah sound at the end. The various assumptions that it's an -eh suffix are Hebraicisations of the word. People have always liked to assume that it has something to do with HVH or “being“ that they impose an unverified and unfounded pronunciation upon it.) as another example of such a use, since  that seems to me (and I've heard it from others as well) to be a perfectly reasonable hypothesis.   At any rate, eloah is an undisputable mappik-he. It is even supposed (probably) to have a different pronunciation from the feminine -ah (although not different from the often confused female possesive -ah, which does have a mappik.)"
badlinguistics,3cmzms,Znex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the YaHWeH vocalisation is completely unwarranted; for one it is widely accepted by many Biblical scholars. Although I agree for one that speculation as to what it means and where it comes from is largely merely speculative at this point.  Also, YHWH needn't necessarily come from Arabic, but likely from one of the other Semitic languages around and earlier; in fact it's probably unlikely that it comes from Arabic due to geographical displacement."

Focus is something within the sentence that is highlighted, again defining this loosely. Focus narrows the interpretation of a sentence to some member of a set described by the focused element.   Alfred levitated a beer. It’s Alfred who levitated a beer. As for telekinetic manipulation of beverages, Alfred levitated a beer. As for telekinetic manipulation of beverages, it’s Alfred who levitated a beer.   In (2) there is a specific individual associated with beer levitation, so we can’t say #it’s Alfred who levitated a beer, and Egbert too. This is in contrast with ✓Alfred levitated a beer, and Egbert too. So the possible set of people who levitate beers is reduced in (2) as compared to (1).  In (3) there is an ‘as for’ topic introduced, but no focus. In (4) the topic is present along with focus, showing that they’re compatible.  The above examples use a specific kind of focus, the cleft construction. There are other kinds of focus in English, including especially intonational focus. In this case there is a pitch accent assigned to a constituent that changes the pitch contour of the sentence from its ordinary default form. The pitch accent indicates that the constituent is focused.   Alfred levitated a BEER. Alfred LEVITATED a beer. ALFRED levitated a beer. Alfred levitated A beer.   In (1) it is a beer being levitated and not a Colt 45. In (2) Alfred is levitating and not just telekinetically pushing the beer. In (3) it is Alfred who is levitating malt beverages and not Alfwine, Baldred, or Ethelstan. In (4) Alfred only levitated one beer, and not several.

The reason for this is that two negatives actually cancel each other out and create an affirmative statement. For example, the sentence ‘I don’t have nothing for you’ is ungrammatical because the presence of two negatives technically switches the meaning to an affirmative one, so that it means ‘I have something for you.’""  Is fucking dumb. Languages don't work like math. So many languages use double negatives that retain a negative meaning. They don't magically switch to a positive."

badlinguistics,3cfpux,chunter16,15,Tue Jul 7 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Which isn't even true. ""I couldn't not help him"" does tend to cancel out to a positive. But many dialects of English use some construction like ""I didn't do nothing"" to mean that they did not do anything."
badlinguistics,3cfpux,ConBrio93,14,Tue Jul 7 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, anyone can tell the difference between ""I couldn't refuse to help"" (which is what that really means) and ""there aren't any"" (which is what a phrase like ""ain't none"" means.)"
badlinguistics,3cfpux,chunter16,8,Tue Jul 7 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, a sentence like ""I didn't do nothing"" could actually have two different meanings, but it would be obvious based on context and tone of voice.  In most cases I would expect to hear it from someone expressing that they really didn't do anything, and I wouldn't be confused by that.  I could see it maybe as a critical boss asking what their employee did so far for an unfinished project and the employee might sarcastically say, ""Well, I didn't do nothing"" indicating that they had been working but don't feel like they're getting credit.  Just like a million other cases with language, sometimes a sentence is ambiguous and we usually get by just fine with context and tone of voice. People who treat language like math or programming are ignoring the many other aspects involved in communication."
badlinguistics,3cfpux,wizardcats,2,Tue Jul 7 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"The first one seems like it couldn't really ever be construed as a negative, perhaps because you've already negated the modal do, by negating the help part you process them as two separate negated parts. Whereas maybe in the sentence I didn't do nothing it can be construed as a whole. I'm not an expert by any means on how language is processed, or psycholinguistics.  I have a hunch it might just be that the stress falls on the not that makes them cancel out, or just plain context."

badlinguistics,3cfpux,ConBrio93,2,Tue Jul 7 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"Also double negatives are not the same as negative concord. In the first example, ""not"" is said twice, whereas in the second, ""anything"" is changed to the negative ""nothing"" in order to be in concordance with the ""not"" in ""didn't"".

It just reads like you were under the impression that Swedes speak English effectively  natively, and the question makes sense if you were operating under that assumption. You probably came to that conclusion because of people spreading actual badling misconceptions (things like ""Swedes speak better and more perfect English than natives because they don't make dialectal ""mistakes"" that I don't like"" are relatively common, you can probably find examples in this sub)"
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,zaavk,2,Tue Jul 7 01:49:52 2015 UTC,Thanks. The reason I asked was because I thought swedes have near perfect english as well as swedish and was curious to which they prefer speaking amongst themselves. Thank you for clarifying that misconception as well!
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,coconutsrule,7,Tue Jul 7 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"Our perfect English is greatly exagerated, in my experience. First of all, you can't count on anyone above 40 to speak satisfactory English (some do, most don't) and while there certainly are some swedes with ridiculously advanced English (of which you'll find most here, I think) who perhaps could hold an almost native-level conversation, it's not like every guy I meet is going to be on that level.   Furthermore, while lots of people have very good written English, most of us really suck at pronouncing English. Th is a bitch, sh and ch get mixed up, j and y sound exactly alike, it's a mess. We just don't get much practice speaking English, so for many of us it's actually quite bothersome to form these sounds. Though we can do it, it doesn't feel natural, it's just too different from Swedish - definitely ruling it out when Swedish is available.   EDIT: We do however MIX the languages like crazy, which is pretty fun. What my friends and I speak on game nights could hardly be called neither Swedish nor English, but some ungodly hybrid, unintelligible to anyone not fluent in both and playing the same game as us."

So basically, the language from Magicka?"
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,Stibitzki,2,Wed Jul 8 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"Having recently homestayed several college-age Swedish students, I think this is really quite true. None of the students had trouble communicating basic concepts and their pronunciation was generally good other than a few common mixups (like you describe), but I could tell they weren't exactly trying to use super complex sentence structures to convey the exact meaning of life. Being able to communicate effectively in a second language is still awesome, and something that is quite uncommon in America due to our shitty second language education programs in general, but I don't think I would describe these students as perfect English speakers or even near-native, so much as ""competent to the point where I didn't feel the need to try to translate/code switch"". Which is good, because I don't speak any Swedish. (But, for example, in similar situations with Japanese exchange students, since I do speak basic Japanese, I felt it much more necessary to code switch for certain subjects/vocabulary.)"
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,keakealani,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"Ya, I think many native English speakers (Americans in particular) are just baffled by the fact that almost everyone they talk to while in Sweden will be able to communicate in English, unlike in many (most?) European countries, where half of the people they try and talk to just shake their heads. So they go home and rave about everyone in Sweden speaking perfect English, ignoring the fact that there's a big difference between giving some stranger directions to the train station and sitting down for a two hour conversation.   There's also quite a bit of selection bias going on, since Swedes with sub-par English don't exactly go out of their way to speak English with foreigners, but rather avoid situations where they might have to. Basically, the only Swedes who dare talk to Americans are the ones who already speak very good English. Same goes for Reddit (and the rest of the Internet) - we who frequent English websites and actively engage in discussions are pretty much the top 1% English speakers of Sweden. The rest you never hear from, because they're on Swedish websites, trying to find Swedish subtitles or some bullshit like that.   I think sometimes, since bilingualism is so uncommon in America, that many Americans just don't quite understand what it's like to speak two languages. You might assume from how advanced my English is that I speak English like a native, but that's nonsense. You don't see how it's taking me 40 minutes to write this, looking up words and spellings, and how I edit the thing 10 times before I'm satisfied with the result, whereas I could knock this out in Swedish in two minutes without giving it a second thought. I think, live and breathe Swedish every single day, from morning to night. No L2-language will ever come close to the kind of fluency you have in your native language, unless you actually move to that country and live there for like 20 years.   The idea that Swedes would be speaking English with eachother in Sweden is ridiculous."

That's a common phenomenon among bilingual speakers by the way, to switch between different languages for whatever reason.

badlinguistics,3cd2sc,Znex,3,Wed Jul 8 03:13:13 2015 UTC,"Your post made sense to me (but then again I only saw it after you added the clarification). Also where I live (SoCal), most people learn Spanish in school to some extent (usually not very good) and native English speakers might once in a while speak Spanish to each other just for fun or to practice. It's also super-common for people around here to say short sentences in Spanish. So it's not crazy to think Swedes might speak a little English among each other occasionally."
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,newappeal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this is common in any region with any degree of multilingual/multicultural communities - living in Hawaiʻi and depending on your exact peer group, it's probably more uncommon to hear an entire long conversation without any loanwords. (The funny part is that because so many people are also mixed-race, there becomes this weird tangled situation where you have a different set of loanword slang depending on the majority ethnicity present, since people obviously tend to have a linguistic background somewhat tied with their ethnicity. And then there are always a few people who have a totally different language background than their ethnicity would imply, too.)"
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,keakealani,6,Thu Jul 9 05:02:03 2015 UTC,"Well if that is the case, my girlfriend is an Australian-Swede and I know a number of Swedes, and it is my experience that they will sometimes speak English among themselves, especially in a mixed social setting. But I get the impression that this is largely an inclusive gesture for the dumb non-Swedes amongst them. Also these are generally young, well-travelled and often highly multilingual Swedes, so I have no idea how representative they are of the average man on the bus. Obviously I have no idea how they speak when there are no native English speakers around.  Looking at their Facebook posts, many of them post in English and Swedish depending on the topic. Swedish is normally used when they are discussing things like going to the pub or a concert, and English when they are discussing issues of wider interest like international news or how drunk they got at the pub earlier (answer is almost always ""very""). Again, I cannot comment on how representative this is of the average Swedish Facebook user.   Several of them are Swedish purists as well - they are extremely fluent in English, but are incredibly prescriptive about the Swedish they use, claiming that it is being debased by English loanwords. One in particular has said he dislikes it when people code-switch, finding the result ""ugly"" and ""uneducated"". As I am learning Swedish, I actually find this quite helpful, whatever my philosophical views might be.  My girlfriend says (and it has been my limited experience) that Swedish is still the preferred Main Street language, and at Swedish community events in Australia, Swedes will take the opportunity to converse in Swedish.  I am learning Swedish, and given how terrible my accent is, I doubt any native Swede would bother trying to speak with me in Swedish at this point."

badlinguistics,3cd2sc,Sheikh_Kristophe,22,Tue Jul 7 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"Okay even though there's no saving myself at this point, I'm going to clarify my thought process anyways.   1: From what I've read Swedes learn English at a very young age and are amongst the best countries in the world at speaking English as a second language.   2: If you are in a group of friends who are all proficient in 2 languages, you have 2 choices of languages to use. In this case I thought that Swedes' English was near perfect, so there wouldn't be a huge disparity between knowledge.   For example: My grandparents are from Greece and spoke only Greek until they moved to America in their mid 20s, where they learned English. However when they talk to each other by themselves they usually speak English. This got me curious for other people who learned English as a second language.   I still don't think it was an awful question, but maybe I clarified something in this comment."
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,coconutsrule,36,Tue Jul 7 01:19:49 2015 UTC,"At least you recognised that it sounded pretty dumb. Seems to me that's enough for this to just be a silly misconception, not bad linguistics."
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,TermyForgotUserName,20,Tue Jul 7 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"I would assume your grandparents have been living in America, and speaking English primarily, for the better part of their lives at this point and so are more comfortable expressing themselves in English.   Understanding and speaking English as a second language in a country full of people who only understand and speak English as a second language is different from understanding and speaking English in a country where people are primarily native English speakers.  Consider for a moment a group of Catholic priests who all understand Latin, and use Latin throughout the course of their workday. They understand the language primarily as a tool for a certain job rather than a form of personal expression between people."
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,freeogy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:41:08 2015 UTC,But when they are in the other room speaking to each other about politics or whatever it shouldn't matter what language the majority of people in America speak.

badlinguistics,3cd2sc,coconutsrule,14,Tue Jul 7 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"Immigrants may speak the local language with their children rather than their native language, so long as they're proficient, because they want their children to learn the local language. (Of course, they would anyway...) perhaps your grandparents became so used to speaking English at home while raising their family that it became their most natural language to speak to each other in."
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,givememyrapturetoday,9,Tue Jul 7 05:38:23 2015 UTC,Who you're speaking to doesn't change what you're more comfortable speaking.

You're equating two entirely different scenarios.
badlinguistics,3cd2sc,freeogy,9,Tue Jul 7 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"If they are using English most of the time and have been doing so for decades, it may be unnatural for them to switch back to Greek for no reason (since they both understand English), even if it is their native language. English has become in some way a ""dominant"" language for them.  But this can happen only if you are really immersed in a country where everybody is a native speaker of your L2. In your own country, speaking with other native speakers of your native language, using what is an L2 for all people present would be unnatural (and feel pretty dumb, trust me)."

Anyway, I grew up in a bilingual household (although not in Sweden) and my siblings and I will switch languages more or less seamlessly, while my Spanish-speaking friends who speak English well but learned it as a second language communicate among themselves in Spanish.

This is why we have to tell every cashier whether the card we're paying with is debit or credit before paying so they can access the correct network, and it's also why we get the most baffled looks from American cashiers when we visit after flashing our card to them before paying.

I understand why we'd say that blood orange is a compound, since it's got a specific meaning that goes beyond the sum of its parts (it's not simply an orange made of blood, for example), but orange juice seems pretty straightforwardly a noun modifying another noun, easily replaceable by any other juiceable thing.

In Dutch, it's sinaasappelsap, composed of 'sinaasappel' (orange) and 'sap' (juice). Obviously, the first word of this compound modifies the latter. Yet in Dutch it's a compound, and in English it's a wholly different phenomenon?  That doesn't make sense to me. Add to that that English does sometimes form compounds in the exact same manner as Dutch and German, without spaces. I recall it being the default in Old English (so interjecting spaces between these compounds was a later innovation), although I'm admittedly not as familiar with it as I used to.  I'm honestly more confused than anything else. For the record, I'm a native speaker of Dutch, maybe that warps my perspective."
badlinguistics,3c8xe9,GothicEmperor,3,Mon Jul 6 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not saying that it's a wholly different thing. I'm just saying that it might not be only English with the quirks. I'm saying that sinaasappel (itself a good example of a compound, since it's not simply any Chinese apple) and sap might be separate words that, through the quirks of Dutch orthography, aren't distinguished as separate words because Dutch writes noun + noun sequences as compounds, regardless of their syntactic status.

It's some sort of berry, but the makers don't want you to know what berry it is, so they label the cups with non-berry fruits: pineapple, banana, and orange. My intuition is that we could identify the juice we liked by calling it the orange juice, where orange is clearly not being used as an adjective (as in your very example) and is not the compound orange juice.

Do with it as you wish.    Many people, especially scientists, adhere to the theory that our number system was developed by the Arabs. This theory needs to be revised. The system of numbers from 0-9 was not developed by Arabs, but by Arameans. Because Arameans used their alphabet as early as 2500 years ago as a number sytem. Initially only as letters, which then became numbers.  As proof, dear readers, consider these two pictures:  (pictures)  The development of the number system suggests that Arabs adopted the number system from the Arameans and gladly spread it as their own invention.  The Aramean language has many remarkable characteristics, it was not only an easily understood language during the times of Assyrians and Babylonians, but its alphabet also simplified communication between the great empires of the time: Assyrians, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and other empires of the Near East. The Aramean language and its script even spread to China and the Balkans. 3000 years ago, until the emergence of Islam, Aramean was the lingua franca in all of the Near East. Throughout Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, as well as Syria, Turkey, Irak and Iran, one and only one language was spoken: Aramean!  Aramean has many letters that can also serve as numbers, such as the letter ""Beth"", on the picture Aramean number ""2"".  The letter ""Beth"" has several meanings in the Aramean language, it may signify ""house"", but also ""between/of"" or the number ""two"". One example to illustrate this theory is the name ""Mesopotamia"" or ""Beth-Narin"" in Aramean. Mesopotamia is translated from Greek into German as ""Zweistromland"" (land of two streams) or ""Zwischen den zwei Flüssen"" (between two streams). Hence, ""Beth"" means ""between"" or ""two"".  We implore our dear readers not to spread the theory any further that says that the number system came from the Arabs!"

Although writing isn't language, it is a static representation of language. Like a snapshot of language. Unless somebody gives everyone in the world all the same camera and subject matter, we can't all take the same snapshots. I hope that makes sense."
badlinguistics,3c5x5p,boruno,3,Mon Jul 6 04:40:35 2015 UTC,"I see. The thing with most writing systems is that they are indirect representations of ideas. They represent sounds, which in turn represent words, which represent ideas.   I know it sounds silly, but a long time ago I was a kanji buff and memorized dozens of symbols. But, as I don't speak Japanese, I couldn't memorize their names. Now, when I look at a Japanese text, I can make out a few pieces of it: that means ""water"", this here means ""white"" etc. isn't it funny that I can read without speaking?   As Arabic numerals (and, why not, punctuation) show, we can have universal symbols that:   are taught in school concurrently with the usual alphabet; are pronounced completely differently by different languages; don't even have to be pictographic.    An upside down triangle means ""yield"" anywhere in the world, right?   Sorry if badling, I am just speculating.   Edit: I was on mobile, so I couldn't look into bliss. It is fascinating!

Which doesn't happen. It can, but doesn't. Also, in Japan, the stop signs are the upside down triangles. As a side note, as someone who studies Japanese, it's actually disadvantageous to learn kanji in isolation. There's a paper out there (once again, not on computer so don't have handy) that said that Japanese people don't learn characters individually, but as compounds. There are many reasons to this, so, I recommend checking out the paper when I return to my computer and post it :)"

I don't mean that you can't get people to do it, I mean it cannot work (ignoring phonetic writing systems like the IPA, which do something completly different).  Do you speak another language than english? Languages aren't just a list of words that have a specific meaning, that sound different in different languages (words are weird). If you try to boil down specific meanings into specific characters, you're not creating a writing system, you're creating a language. This is a huge topic, but a good illustration is a feature like grammatical tense. In inglish, you can indicate the time by messing around with the verb: I sing a song / I sang a song. In other languages you don't do that, instead, you maybe add another word to indicate the past. So now you have a conflict. It's loads of weird things like these that makes representing ""ideas"" by using the same symbols impossible. Or at least, it's not a universal writing system, because the symbols cannot be read as corresponding to a specific thing. The result is just another language."

Which is fine I guess, because we actually use standard german in writing everywhere (at least, until mobile phones and emails bacame a thing..). But when I write standard german, I don't write in my native language. And when I read standard german, I can't read it in my native language. I read standard german. And it's not that the words are written differently than I'd write them, the problem is that the grammer is a bit different. Compared to other languages, it's still basically german, but the difference is big enought that I cannot read a sentence and just ""on-the-fly"" translate it to swiss-german. Sometimes it works, other sometimes you need to change around the entire sentence, or even multiple sentences. So it becomes basically the same thing as reading a french sentences and translating it to english. The problem aren't the words, but the structure of the language. Every language needs mechanics that distinguish objects from subject, times, etc, and if what you're reading doesn't correspond to the structure of your native language, you're reading a foreign language.  So yeah, you can say ""vocalisation doesn't matter"", but what you're describing is not a universal writing system, it's just another language.

I grew up sort of multilingual, so it's obvious to me, but I can see how it's not obviouse at all for a monolingual speaker. In a way, ones native language is even harder to understand if you don't have something to compare it too.

You say ""Fell the cake (Caiu o bolo)"", but you never write it. You write ""The cake fell (O bolo caiu)"". Of course, if you read it aloud, you say ""The cake fell (O bolo caiu)"", but it sounds... well... read. Also, pronouns change. You write ""I bit him (Mordi-o)"", but you say ""I bit he (Mordi ele)"". You never say ""I bit him (Mordi-o)"". Ever. In my dialect, it sounds robotic. But when you read it, you think it is fine.  What I mean with all this is that a bunch of our visual communication is already universal. Much more than we realize. It is not too far fetched to conceive a way of communicating slightly more complex ideas, provided we take the task seriously. Maybe technically it is a different language.  Did you look into ""Bliss symbols""?"
badlinguistics,3c5x5p,Pyromane_Wapusk,2,Tue Jul 7 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"The problem with universal written languages is that you have to have rules about organizing abstract ideas.   How would you devise a system that conveys ""It will rain tomorrow and sunday morning, but it will be sunny saturday."" without being just like learning a spoken language (minus the speaking part)?  Even if you do come up with a system like that you still the problem  Blyssymbolics ran into... People will inevitablely use your universal written language differently (probably to better conform to their spoken languages) and it will become less and less universal with usage."

How else would you know it?   People will inevitablely use your universal written language differently (probably to better conform to their spoken languages) and it will become less and less universal with usage.   I'll speculate that a written language is not used as often as spoken language, so there would be less of a drift. Even if there is a drift, well, any auxiliary language has it and they are still useful. Imagine if someone said ""Well, English has too much variance to be a used as a common language""!

""Linguistics is descriptive, not prescriptive"" is a simple motto taught in intro classes to students who are still stuck on the idea that words like ""ain't"" are somehow incorrect, and has never meant that we cannot push back against erroneous and harmful attitudes.

Instead of ""persone"" you could write ""della gente"". The most natural way of saying that is ""qualcuno"" (someone), but I suppose it's the same in English, so ""(delle) persone/della gente"" could be a better translation.   ]"

badlinguistics,3bvce1,ThornsyAgain,2,Fri Jul 3 06:32:40 2015 UTC,"""Umani"" is the D&D name of human race, while ""esseri umani"" is the common and politically correct term (the common but not politically correct term is ""uomini"" (men), but this usage is disappearing)... ""Umani di New York"" would also be grammatically ok, it's just a matter of tastes.  The normal way to say this without sounding an alien would be ""gli abitanti di New York"" or ""la gente di ""New York"".  Now, let's talk about venire (you can drop the last vowel sometimes, but it's not wrong if you keep it). Be warned that I'm not a teacher.  Let me start from where I can draw a parallel with English: things like ""I'm getting hungry/sleepy/..."" are translated in Italian as ""Mi sta venendo fame/sonno/..."".   If there is a third agent that makes me become hungry/sleepy/... we say that ""Mi fa venire fame/sonno/..."" (here the third agent could be a smell in the first case, and a boring professor in the second)  When ""makes me"" is followed by a verb, we don't use ""venire"":    ""It makes me shiver"" = ""Mi fa tremare"" ""He made me believe his lies"" = ""Mi ha fatto credere alle sue bugie"" ""This makes me want a better world"" = Questo mi fa desiderare un mondo migliore   Now what's happening with ""It makes me want to kill people""?  We translate ""want to"" as ""voglia di"". And... well, ""voglia"" is treated the same way as ""fame"" or ""paura"". I would like to be able to give you a simple rule like 'The construct is always ""far venire + Noun""'... but there are a few nouns for which ""venire"" is not needed (sometimes it's even uncommon). Take for example:   Mi fa paura (It scares me) Mi fa venire paura (It makes me scared)   First one being the most natural and common, second being grammatical but uncommon.  Colloquially, you can drop the ""venire"" also with caldo ""Il maglione mi fa caldo, me lo tolgo"", but it's not ""Prescriptivist Italian"".  I hope that was somehow clear ^^'''''''''''  I'm ready to answer your questions if you cannot make sense of this mess ^^'''''''''''"

badlinguistics,3bua7w,manu_facere,24,Thu Jul 2 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"Serious answer (which is something I only do early in the morning): For centuries 'less' and 'fewer' have been used interchangeably. Unfortunately in the late eighteenth century, some guy, a British cleric most likely (I could find his name, but why bother?), said that he preferred using 'fewer' for countable items and 'less' for uncountable things (Ergo: you can reduce calories by eating ""fewer sugar cookies"" or by putting ""less sugar"" in each batch).   During the late nineteenth century writing books called ""Grammars"" became very popular, and these writers were not interested in style suggestions: They Wanted Rules! And rules they made up; every literary style suggestion they could find, they turned into a commandment even when they were clueless about why the suggestion had ever been made. There are tons and tons of these silly invented rules, and there are thousands of prescriptivists whose only joy is showing how smart they think they are by enforcing these rules they don't understand -- even in casual chats or by defacing grocery store signs."
badlinguistics,3bua7w,JustMe8,19,Thu Jul 2 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"For centuries 'less' and 'fewer' have been used interchangeably   That's not entirely correct.

badlinguistics,3bua7w,CaptainSasquatch,13,Thu Jul 2 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"This is right.  And the idea that less could only be used with uncountables seems to have just been made up because of OCD consequentialism: because fewer can only be used with countables, logic requires that less only be used with non-countables.

Edgy kids at playgrounds call each-other mute cancer tuberculosis-suffers who should get lung inflammation all the time, whenever their teacher is out of earshot.  Even English has a long history of terms indicating mental problems being re-purposed into pejorative terms; this includes words like 'moron', 'cretin', 'idiot' etc.   Changing the meaning of the word does nothing to deal with the ill intent behind its malicious usage. Instead, it makes communication more difficult, both because the words lose their meaning, and because you get a bunch of people with chips on their shoulder over the words' use. When it's so easy to knock that chip off, it becomes much harder to have a meaningful conversation; you can't easily put that chip back on the shoulder when the shoulder is busy being involved in pummeling you.

Regular sincere well meaning people will talk about someone being ""retarded"" (though probably more commonly ""mentally retarded"") in the ""having mental retardardation"" sense, and while they might seem a bit old-fashioned, no one really complains, because it's clear they're just talking about a neutral fact.   Meanwhile people saying ""that's retarded"" or calling people ""retards"" as a pure pejorative will get called out by those same listeners.  People can distinguish the context.  Same thing for ""gay.""  ""My coworker is gay, has a picture of his husband on his desk"" - no problem, just a fact.   ""Those pants are so gay, LOL"" - will get you called out.  Middle aged in the Midwest here.  ""Moron"" and ""Idiot"" are old enough though that I've never heard anyone use them in the original sense. They are only insults now and most people don't seem to consider them ""ableist"" anymore because the original meaning is so old. Calling someone ""retarded"" as an insult is not okay, but ""moron"" no one bats an eye at.  Same with ""lame"" - unless possibly you're talking about a horse, everyone knows ""lame"" is only used for the figurative bad meaning now (and again people mostly don't complain about the use).  People make ""special"" and ""short bus"" jokes though with awareness of what they're talking about. That gets called out.  In Japanese there's an internet slang 池沼 (chishou) which literally is just the word for ""lakes and swamps"" but it means ""retard"" because there's this other word 知的障害 (chiteki shougai) which is a clinical word for ""intellectual handicap"" (and about as stiff - yep, they have euphemism treadmills too) which you can abbreviate in the usual manner taking only the first characters of each part, giving 知障 and then just pick another word that sounds the same, 池沼 it is.

badlinguistics,3bopnu,Apropos_Username,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Well actually, I don't think the two phrases really mean the same thing anyway, but ""feel"" is already a verb with a transitive meaning that works with ""you"" as an object. For a rather contrived example, imagine the phrase in response to a doctor asking a paraplegic to tell him if he can feel him pressing a certain position on his body. Perhaps you're right and this narrow intersection of meanings is outweighed by the those of a more traditional response like ""got it"" or ""I agree"". Then again, regardless, there is still the cost of confusion of or misunderstanding by those who aren't familiar with the neologism.  Anyway, my point was that it's hardly 'bad linguistics' to express a personal dislike for a certain phrase without actually making any value judgement let alone linguistic assertion.

Google Ngram shows me that a usage of this (which seems to be in the same sense of the modern usage) dates to 1968:  ""I feel you Evelyn. I too feel the great darkness coming over me.""  Even though that usage might be kind of dodgy it at least dates to the early 90s, as Scarface had a rap song in 1993 with the title ""I Feel Ya"" that had this line ""You couldn't have told me nothin' back then/But now I feel ya..."", where the usage is clearly the same as the current usage of it.   For a more recent usage, Omar uses the expression in The Wire when he's confronting Prop Joe in Season 4 ""Now Joe, I need you to resist your natural inclination to do anything twisted up here in this play. You feel me?""  The phrase also shows up in ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" which was released in 2003 (so written in 2002)."

If every native English speaker starts writing ""would've"" as ""would of"" (a lot of them already do), is English going to restructure its whole conjugation/phrasal structure around the missing verb after the auxiliary? Some rules are pretty essential.   Riiiiiight."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Thimoteus,18,Tue Jun 30 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"In that unlikely occurrence, it already would of!"
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Cheese-n-Opinion,11,Tue Jun 30 15:06:59 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that was a quote for a second and was very concerned for you...
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,alynnidalar,2,Tue Jun 30 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well, there's that restructure of the English language, or the guy could just realise that 'of' in that context is a essentially a variant of 'have' and that everyone that uses it, hears it or reads it can understand that."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,GothicEmperor,20,Tue Jun 30 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"Elsewhere in the post:   Perfect English is spoken by the West Coast of the USA. No one ever says, ""Hey you have a Californian/Oregon/Washington accent"" Because there is no accent. It's the natural sound of English.   You hear that? Some region of the US has no accent! And is the neutral, natural way of speaking.  Let's not forget the typical 'US English closer to English 300 years ago' claim, as if it's right, and if it would actually mean something by selecting an arbitrary date."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Xaethon,11,Tue Jun 30 15:58:15 2015 UTC,"If Californians have no accent, then what is valley girl?  (Incidentally, I was talking to my brother about how, because most movies are made in Hollywood, most people's conceptions of an ""American"" accent (that isn't southern or New York) happens to be Californian. It isn't that we have no accent -- we do -- but only that our accent is more normalized in a large amount of media, so people don't generally think about it. I'm guessing that was the ""point"".)"
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,cordis_melum,12,Tue Jun 30 16:14:29 2015 UTC,"Not even valley girl, but the California vowel shift is a real thing."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,loyal_achades,3,Tue Jun 30 17:46:59 2015 UTC,True. I forget that because I have a Californian accent (and I am not a linguist).
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,cordis_melum,2,Tue Jun 30 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Movies, TV, even cable news"
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,first_five-eighth,2,Tue Jun 30 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"As an actor, I don't think too many shows sound like they have a lot of Californian accents, and most people in LA in the industry aren't native to there anyway.  When people I know have taken accent reduction, they are certainly taught a more textbooky ""standard American"". Though transatlantic English is still a thing even though it is not all that popular anymore."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Pennwisedom,4,Wed Jul 1 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"Aww, the 'US English is older' poster was very tentative in that suggestion, and qualified it with a very sensible summary ""either way, they've both diverged a lot.""  It's not so bad, they're only down-voted because they're American."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Cheese-n-Opinion,2,Tue Jun 30 17:31:30 2015 UTC,I'll be honest. I just saw that in passing and dismissed it once I saw that mentioned. Never read all of that.
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Xaethon,2,Tue Jun 30 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"I found this on YouTube the other day when watching Disney songs in French. (specifically Hellfire), the same ""300 years ago""-thing is used about French...   Surely this version is more accurate than the European version? Seeing as French in Europe has been influenced by other languages, but Québecois French evolved pretty much by itself since the 1700s, so it would be closer to the Late Mediaeval French that Frollo would've spoken?"
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,myxopyxo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"That person is confusing accent with dialect. Pretty much guarantee that this person probably hates Valley Girl talk and the use of like as a filler. Or words like ""hella"", or the various Southern pronunciations that have become part of central Californian dialect thanks to vast migrations from Oklahoma during the 20s and 30s.  Not to mention AAVE and Chicano English.   There's an assumption that Californians all talk the same but it's simply not true. Hell, there's often an implicit assumption that everybody west of the Mississippi has the same general accent and that's even less true."

Some things include the pin/pen merger, the use of was instead of were, the positive anymore (instead of saying ""I don't shop there anymore"" someone might say ""I shop there anymore"".   Also this one which mentions that Bakersfield has a real southern influence. Bakersfield actually developed it's own sound/genre of country music in the 50s and 60s as a reaction to Nashville.

badlinguistics,3bmn9a,duyjo,7,Tue Jun 30 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"You're both right. The static grammar rules, with regards to the primary following the auxiliary in ""would've,"" would be kept by prescriptivists, whilst descriptivists are like ""y'know, language changes when people use it, whatever."" The language itself doesn't change, but people with different interpretations of language (a set of grammatical rules to govern groups of graph/morphemes vs simply a means of communication) will argue if it has actually changed or not, and whether it should change or not.   The fuck is going on here"

badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Gregorymendel,3,Wed Jul 1 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"I would know, but my interpretation of the language has changed so now I can't"
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,KlingonLinux,5,Tue Jun 30 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"If we try to be extra charitable in our interpretation, isn't there some truth to some version of this?  Some slang terms, and some constructions that appear in informal speech but not in textbooks, are more likely to be used by native speakers than by second language learners. That is, in certain respects, a skilled second language learner may sound more like  ""the way the textbooks say it"".  I have less background in linguistics than many of you, so correct me if I'm wrong. But please be gentle.  Edited to add: I realize that the bad part of it (and something that irks linguists) is the insinuation that slang and informal things that really, robustly exist in the natural language are somehow ""not the true correct language""."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,skullturf,8,Tue Jun 30 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"There's no contention that a sufficiently skilled second language learner might be more widely understood than a native with an obscure dialect. It's purely the insinuation that non-standard dialects are incorrect.   There's also a disregard for listening and interpretation as a language skill. If you're not understanding natives who have no problem functioning in their own community, you should probably question your own abilities before theirs!"
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Cheese-n-Opinion,5,Tue Jun 30 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"The ability to use slang or common familiar terms is important for non-native speakers. You might not use it, but you are going to hear it."
badlinguistics,3bmn9a,Pyromane_Wapusk,4,Wed Jul 1 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"When native French speakers try to ""compliment"" me by saying I speak their language better than them because I don't use as much slang, it just doesn't really feel like a compliment anymore. Getting the slang right is an essential part of everyday language, and native speakers are far better than me at it. I still have no idea how to use ""wesh"".  Not to mention my listening comprehension is horrible at the moment, since most of exposure so far has been on the Internet. I'm nowhere near as good as a native speaker."

badlinguistics,3bdpij,lanerdofchristian,9,Sun Jun 28 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think this complaint is sound but I've heard it lots of times before. [disclosure: I am a Chomskyan linguist (grad student) working in a very Chomskyan department] Here are a few reasons:   What is the subject that Chomsky created? Generative grammar (GG). GG is indeed technically formidable, full of esoteric algebraic notations, complicated representations, and so on. This is also true of essentially every other mathematical science out there. The argument for all those sciences is that the complicated math helps them analyze their objects of study in a more principles, analytic way. The same is true for the study of grammar: GG has discovered a remarkable array of ""effects"" in natural language grammars: island effects, binding conditions, raising and control etc. Go ahead and try to state the complex-NP constraint or the difference between raising and control without using any formal/theoretical concepts -- I hold that that's impossible. Does GG avoid engagement with culture and society? Yes, because GG is not the study of language, culture, and society; it is the study of grammar and cognition. It restricts its attention to the individual because we want to account for the psychological states of an individual with respect to language competence. I don't think this is a bad thing, because we do need an account of the psychology of language -- it's an open area of scientific inquiry that needs research done in it. There are other fields of linguistics that are concerned with culture and society (sociolinguistics) and the existence of GG doesn't do anything to undermine those people's work. They're just different subdisciplines. Arguing against GG on these lines is like arguing against cognitive psychology because it ""avoids engagement with culture and society"" -- but cognitive psychology is just one subfield of psychology, interested in investigating internal psychological states, and it doesn't interfere with the work of social psychologists. tl;dr: why not have both?. Does GG fall ""prey to the pernicious drivel of the traditional grammar guardians?"" No. It is true that GG originally used many of the traditional grammarian's ideas when the first formal grammars were developed, but how could it be any different? Why would we ignore hundreds of years of research by philologically-minded linguists into grammar once we embarked on our own research into grammar? It's prudent to consider the traditional grammarian's approaches as working hypotheses. Over the years, some of these ideas have held, others altered, and new ideas introduced into the study of grammar. We expect any mature science to hold on to some of the old ideas and to invent new ones once those were inadequate. Concepts like unaccusativity/unergativity, the DP, light verbs, and so on are new ideas, not traditional ones. Old ideas like case, subject, predicate have been given new, more precise definitions in light of what we've discovered. There is a wealth of evidence that some notion of a ""subject"", defined as a phrase in the specifier of certain projections (TP, DP), is a real notion that plays a central part in our grammars. There is also good evidence that the ""predicate"", identified as a verbal projection VP/vP, is also a real notion.  Still more notions, like binding domains and restrictions on movement fall far outside the purview of traditional grammar, and they are the best examples of novel discoveries made by GG. In formal semantics and pragmatics, nearly everything that's been done in the last 40 or so years is completely novel, save for what we've borrowed from the logicians of the early 20th century, since traditional grammarians and structuralist linguists pre-Chomsky were not interested in analyzing meaning."

badlinguistics,3bbvfl,ty_kokos,83,Sat Jun 27 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"Sentinelese is that dialect where every word (barring pronouns and grammatical words and such) is a body part. Here are some translation glosses:   A. I walked to school.   Gloss of A: I legged to brainass (1)    Ass/buttocks being the suffix that broadly means a place, obviously because you sit in places).    B. I made sweet sweet love to my wife yesterday, she's a really charming person.   Gloss of B: I tongue-vaginaed my be-vaginaed (1) handholder (2) left-tonguedly (3) ass-eye-pain (4), she's musclefully (5) a cheek-pulling (6) bodybrain (7).    Sentinels have a curious system of describing gender that typically runs on a bevaginaed, bepenised, or be(untranslateable word for neutral genitalia) system. We don't yet understand if they've figured out that gender is distinct for sex, but they have a well-established third-gender role. 2. Marriage rituals involve holding hands, and holding hands is a common sign of courtship. 3. They mistakenly believe that certain parts of the tongue detect certain tastes more intensely than others. Left, in this case, means sweet, both literally and figuratively. 4. Eye-pain refers to the sun, which can also mean a day. Ass as a prefix means behind. So literally behind-day. 5. Muscles are strength, so musclefully would mean strongly. 6. Cheek pulling is the gloss for their word for smile. So literally, she makes people smile. 7. Bodybrain refers to the two defining characteristics of Sentinels' conception of personhood.   Here's one that demonstrates the power of reduplication:   C. ""Today’s Supreme Court ruling makes the United States the 23rd country where same-sex marriage is legal nationwide.""  Gloss of C: Foot-eye-pain (1), hand-slam (2) of musclemuscle (3) bodybodybodyhandslammer (4) handed (5) the Handarmarmed-Bodybodybodysorefoot (6) the 23rd bodybodybodysorefoot where genitalgenital (7) hand-holding is unhandslammed (8) bodybodybodysorefoot-ful (9).    Foot meaning present, so literally present-sun but meaning present-day, as in today. 2. Handslam comes from an ancient punishment for theft (the breaking of the hand with a hammer). Of course, over time it took on a broader meaning as ""court"", ""ruling"", ""law"", ""judgement"", ""justice"", etc. 3. Musclemuscle is an intensifier, in this case meaning ""superlative"". 4. ""bodybodybody"" refers to a crowd, and ""handslammer"" is a judge. So the word literally means ""crowd of judges"", but is understood as a court or council. 5. Handed is sort of like ""faire"" in French. It can mean a lot of things, depending on context. Usually ""do"" or ""make"" or ""create"" or ""work"". 6. I had to actually invent this one, because there's no word for the US. But handarmarm refers to the distinctive way in which the Sentinels gather wood (using the hands and the inside of the arms). Bodybodybody is crowd, again, and sorefoot refers to a great distance. So bodybodybody sorefoot literally means ""a great distance covered by a crowd"", but it's used to mean country or ethnic group. 7. The word for gential is unspecified but identical, in this case. I don't have an accurate English translation. 8. Legal, lit. ""unpunishable"". 9. Country-wide. I translated a specific suffix as ""ful"".

Luckily the official spelling allows for 'appél' to avoid confusion, and the 'White' spelling allows for the traditional spelling of 'appèl'.

I tried teaching two very good Portuguese speakers, and it went something like this:    (saying the word ""ele"", meaning ""he"") /eili/ no, it's pronounced /eli/ /eili/? no, just /e/. Can you say /e/? /ei/ no, just the first part. Ignore the /i/ in the end. /ei/. Ok. Try saying /eeeeeeeeeeeeeeei/, but stop in the middle.  /eeeeeeeeeee... that's right!  ...eeeei/ ok. Remember the song ""umbrella""? Doesn't she say ""eh eh eh""? That's the sound.  ah! Umbrella ella ella /e/ /e/  yes!  aha! So it's /ei/ oh, forget it."
badlinguistics,3axeff,newappeal,18,Wed Jun 24 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that most Americans don't realize that the /ei/ and /eɪ/ sounds are actually diphthongs and not single vowels. We're taught in school that it's a ""long"" 'a' (/æ/), written phonetically as 'a' with a macron, and that it's therefore one vowel.  I pointed out to some friends of mine that it's actually two vowels and kinda blew their minds."
badlinguistics,3axeff,boruno,5,Wed Jun 24 23:02:39 2015 UTC,"I see. What actually surprised me was that they were long time Portuguese speakers. But Brazilian speakers also have a lot of trouble with English vowels (pronouncing bed and bad the same, and pronouncing but and love differently), so I don't judge them.   Can your friends actually say /e/, now that they know it's a standalone sound?"
badlinguistics,3axeff,newappeal,3,Wed Jun 24 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Many people where I'm from learn how to say /e/ from Spanish and French class even without explicitly knowing (i.e. being told) that it's different from /ei/, but I would say that the reason the Spanish/French accents of many people I know sound poor is partly because they're not pronouncing /e/ as a single vowel. The friends who I've mentioned the diphthong fact to generally have no problem pronouncing the /e/ and /i/ (or /ɪ/) separately by breaking apart /ei/."
badlinguistics,3axeff,boruno,6,Thu Jun 25 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"Vowels are damn tricky. It's hard to realize you are mispronouncing them in a foreign language. An aggravating factor in Portuguese is that /ɛ/ is a distinct sound from /e/, so I can't even tell them to say it like in bed.  On the flip side, tell a Spaniard to say /ʌ/. They're usually gonna say /ɔ/. Love = Lawve  As a curiosity, what's your L1?"
badlinguistics,3axeff,newappeal,6,Thu Jun 25 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"English (American). I think the screwy orthography contributes to native English speakers struggling with vowels in foreign languages. We tend not to realize that we have something like 20+ vowel and diphthong sounds. Hell, the name of every ""vowel"" except 'e' is actually a diphthong, but it's taught in school that a ""long vowel"" is pronounced like the name of the vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')."

badlinguistics,3axeff,MystyrNile,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"I hear /e/ and /eɪ̯/ as distinct sounds, as discussed above. If someone pronounced the letter 'a' as /e/, it would sound odd.

badlinguistics,3axeff,walnutpal,5,Fri Jun 26 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"Another thing that's tricky about pronouncing /e/ as an American (and it goes for most English speakers too) is that the 'dress' vowel /ɛ/ would be a very good approximation of the /e/ in a language like Spanish which doesn't contrast /e/ and /ɛ/, but English doesn't have /ɛ/ in open syllables, so even though English has the phonemes to say 'que' as /kɛ/, English phonotactics don't allow that and we'll say /keɪ/ instead, because /eɪ/ is allowed in that position in English so we're used to saying words like 'bay' but not words like /bɛ/.  I wonder if it would be helpful for foreign language teachers in the US to tell students to try to say 'bed' without the /d/ instead of trying to cut out the off-glide from /eɪ/"

It's not as if prescriptivism is like believing in ""race realism"" or something. It's like comparing manufacturing technology to being physics. Making technology isn't a crime or anything.

badlinguistics,3atexr,sarcasm24,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, then in that case, I think it could work in the original context if one was focusing on the ""resolving"" or ""working through the real-life consequences"" aspects of ""coping with"" (rather than the ""dealing with a situation on an emotional level"" aspect)?  The original context is somewhat ambiguous in that respect, though. From The Grauniad article:    Pupils were instructed to read a passage from Atonement and complete two questions about how a character copes with being accused of rape.   I could see both senses of ""coping with"" being relevant here (presuming Robbie is the character in question here), but I still don't see how that makes ""coping with"" something a ""uniquely English"" concept. I also don't see how it would be difficult for intermediate English students to understand the questions or answer them fully; without further clarification, I'd simply discuss how the character ""coped with"" the situation from each possible angle of the term. Given the source material, that really is not hard."
badlinguistics,3atexr,spikedee,3,Tue Jun 23 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'd simply discuss how the character ""coped with"" the situation from each possible angle of the term   I think that's the difficulty for a French speaker.

Being able to answer that question does not seem out of range (IIRC, at that age I was reading the Lord of the Rings in English, English is my second foreign language and I was in a math and science track).  It seems to me that Internet simply gives to the inevitable complainers a visibility they couldn't get before."
badlinguistics,3atexr,JMBourguet,2,Tue Jun 23 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue is that there is rarely a word which allow to gives all the meanings and connotations as succinctly as the original.  When translating you are often forced to make a choice, to be more generic or more precise, to emphasize or soften an aspect and some can't cope with that.  In the case of cope, it seems to me more generic than all the proposed translations (I don't think s'occuper would work in most contexts I've seen cope used, for sure it wouldn't work in the above sentence)"
badlinguistics,3atexr,JMBourguet,4,Tue Jun 23 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"Those do translate as ""cope"" but I think in the sense of ""cope"" they were getting at ""faire avec"", ""se sortir de"", ""se débrouiller"" would be more adequate."

There’s no DNA or RNA equivalent, no multi-step transcription, no reading frames, no single nucleotide polymorphism, no recombination, etc. It’s a useful metaphor but you can’t push it very far. Evolution of language needs to be understood on its own terms and naively applying high level concepts from biology can quickly lead to serious confusion."
badlinguistics,3asojr,KlingonLinux,0,Tue Jun 23 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between genetics and DNA. All of the specific chemical aspects are incidental. You can have evolution without any of that (see abstract evolutionary simulations).  Memes aren't compositional? Okay. Neither are genes. I mean, you can mutate just a portion of a gene, but you can do that with a meme too.  The main difference is in the mechanism of reproduction. An aggressive reproducer can succeed genetically, but existing organisms must adopt a meme for it to spread.  Let's take a meme like a definition. Let's use our favorite: literally. The use of literally as an intensifier is a meme. People found the novel role useful, and repeated its use. It has since spread.  You might think it to be too arbitrary, but remember that natural selection selects adaptations that suit the current environment. Memes do the same.  A notable difference is that memes can be raised from the dead more easily. But we might manage that with genetics soon enough."

Kommst du mit?  Are you coming along?  *Kommst du mit mir?  Are you coming with me?   The double mit, as far as I'm aware, comes from mitkommen + mit mir, but it somehow is ungrammatical if it's just kommen + mit mir? I'm unsure about that. Any native German speakers here?

badlinguistics,3at7rp,linguistrose,2,Tue Jun 23 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not a native speaker, but I know that such constructions are really common in German and how they work. Komm mit mir is completely correct (also more common that Komm mit mir mit), and means basically the same thing as Komm mit mir mit. Basically, mitkommen just means ""to come along"" and not ""to come along with sb./sth."" Prepositional verb prefixes in German just add further description to the verb and don't actually replace the preposition as they do in, say, the Romance languages. Hence in Latin, ""I go out of the house"" is Domum eggredior (""eggredi"" = ""ex"" [out of] + ""gredi"" [step] = ""to exit"") but in German it's Ich gehe aus dem Haus hinaus (And yeah, hinaus is an adverb and not a preposition, but that's irrelevant)."

Because that trait is generally stigmatized as a sign of ""uneducated"" or ""low-class"" speech, it also clusters with other traits stigmatized as such.  Off the top of my head, these include replacing the imperative with the third-person singular present, excessive use of diminutive -ito/ita, ""de nosotros,"" deaffricating /tʃ/, vocalizing coda /l/ (e.g. /el/ → [eu~ew]), /bl/ → /w/, dropping /ɾ/ before nasals, and eliding final /s/ entirely. Some of these aren't limited to Chile, but they are present there, save maybe coda /l/ vocalization—that's more limited to areas bordering Brazil   (Edit: Did a little Googling around on the subject, and coda /l/ vocalization does actually extend to Chile.)"

Whenever that high degree of polysemy created ambiguity, adding from to clarify was always an option.  Oh, and do kindly have a gander at this living fossil harking back to the days of widespread wh-inversion in PPs. I think it's quite funny in the context of this prescriptivist nonsense.

I hope he'll dig deeper and realise that 'where' always indicated a stationary position (interrogative pronoun followed by a suffix indicating a single location) while 'whence' indicated not just that position but also the direction (interrogative pronoun followed by a suffix indicating a direct). Same as the difference between 'here' and 'hence', or 'there' and 'thence'; 'whence' places a bit more emphasis on the road travelled than 'where'.  So, there's a slight difference in meaning between the two; slight enough that it's nothing to obsess over, but significant enough that it could add a bit of nuance. It maybe doesn't fit in completely with the suffix case-wise (as /u/spikedee points out, it's genitive), but it still fits the Germanic origins of the English language perfectly. I don't think it's very healthy to be obsessed with cases in Modern English."

In fact, the implication of someone being gay is often completely ignored too, to the point that I've seen ""straightfag"" used to refer to a straight person.

badlinguistics,3apnsi,friendly-dropbear,3,Tue Jun 23 06:01:02 2015 UTC,"Good point. I don't think it's restricted to imageboards. Back many years ago I used to frequent a Bruce Springsteen forum, and the term ""Brucefag"" was in general use. It tended to denote a rather passionate fan, but given that we were all on a forum dedicated to a single artist, and we all traded live concert DVDs and CDs of said artist, we probably all qualified (at least compared to the general fan).   I'd forgotten about that until you just mentioned it.   Edit:  And the way it was used then was still somewhat insulting. The brucefag was that fan who was completely obsessed with Springsteen. The only music they listened to was Bruce Springsteen and his hanger ons. Everything that Springsteen (or his hanger-ons) released was the best thing ever. A live recording that was so awful that all that could be heard was the crowd yelling ""Born in the USA!"" would get a rating of 6 or 7. They had to get every recording of every concert. That sort of thing.   The usage of ""brucefag"" within the Springsteen fandom goes back to at least 2002 and was coined on the Stone Pony London forum. It might be older than that (the forum was created in 1999), but there was a major crash of that forum along the way that wiped much of the posting history out.   Within the context of SPL the term *-fag construction was applied to other things (""Ryanfag"" to denote a Ryan Adams hardcore fan, ""Bushfag"" used in reference to hardcore conservatives/Republicans). I don't know if the *-fag construction was used outside of that forum and then imported, or if forum members started to apply *fag to other things because of the term ""brucefag""."

The way my lecturers analysed it was to have [ŋ] be underlyingly /n/ before cellar velar consonants. The way they deal with sin/sing is to say that's underlyingly /ng/ where /n/ assimilates to [ŋ] before /g/ is deleted (as [ŋg] is impossible word finally). They deal with singer etc by saying that the -er ending is a word-level affix, and therefore the phonological processes generating the [ŋ] occur before the affiliation (which would bleed the process).

One where bad linguistics, bad history, bad science, bad sociology, and bad anthropology come together to form a narrative that glorifies India's past, and views its past few centuries under British (and Mughal) rule as mere road bumps on a larger path to greatness.   Interestingly enough, this isn't confined to this particular group of people.

Hundreds of years after that civilization disappeared, the Roman empire renamed the region ""Palæstina"" basically as a fuck-you to the Jewish revolt. For millennia it functioned as an uncontroversial descriptor of the region (alongside others), and right up until the last years before the founding of Israel, both Jews and Arabs who lived there would have been referred to as Palestinians without an issue. After the founding of Israel, which entailed about 5/6 of the Arab population becoming stateless, the term became specific to the non-Jews who lost their homeland, and thereby politicized, a taboo on one side and a marker of identity on the other. For example, if you go to the Holocaust museum near Jerusalem the word ""Palestine"" is absent, you only see references to migration to ""British Mandate Land of Israel"" as if the actual name the Mandate used was too controversial (similarly the name ""Israel"" is often a taboo for Palestinians, the region is normally called ""1948-occupied lands"").

Working your way slowly through novels works as well even if you're an advanced beginner or something (google Kató Lomb or something like that). But then you also spend half an hour on a single page but if that motivates you more than an advanced text book then why not.  I was actually raid leader when I started playing on the English servers :P and we Germans are like the fucking plague and you always find others on English servers. Quite funny when other Germans are speaking in TS, then you whisper them in German and they switch to German on TS as well and don't notice.   Can somebody explain that, by the way? It worked quite regularly. With almost every German. Just one small whisper was enough to make us switch to German until some frustrated Brit or Dane was like ""You're speaking German again you idiot!"""
badlinguistics,3a9iav,Asyx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:50:04 2015 UTC,I should do that more-having something interesting to read or something you need to read would be a better motivator than slogging through a page of textbookese.
badlinguistics,3a9iav,Pennwisedom,2,Fri Jun 19 00:38:40 2015 UTC,"If you actually google Kató Lomb, you'll find a (legal) link to her book on her wikipedia page. She learnt Russian like that in a bunker in Hungary during an air raid (of course not in one night...) with just a dictionary. She also learnt other languages to the point that she could interpret them (she worked as an interpreter) and taught that method a lot of people as well.  It's certainly a lot more fun. Textbooks are fine for the beginning since you have everything you need for your skill level (she actually recommends getting through a beginner textbook first just for the basics) but if you actually work on something you enjoy (like, a book that is interesting or a game you enjoy or even stuff like German football news because the American ones are shit and don't cover the champions league (just trying to come up with a more specific example and that was the first one I could think of)) and see that it gets easier and easier, keeping the motivation up is a lot easier as well.  It's so obvious once you think about it. You learn most stuff easier if you enjoy it. But we still force our way through text books."
badlinguistics,3a9iav,Asyx,12,Fri Jun 19 00:53:55 2015 UTC,"I got only proficient in English after playing World of Warcraft on the international EU servers. That's where I actually started to speak English regularly. But I obviously went through English lessons as well and had a good idea about the language.   MMOs certainly help since you can actually talk to other people, and so did the old text-based games, or games that required text input since you actively needed to use the language. I can't think of any Japanese MMOs except for the FF one...  Anyway, I always mildly cringe at ""immersion"" being sort of a buzzword. To me, ""immersion"" means going to a place where the language is used, in this case, Japan, and not just changing your phone and watching Japanese TV.   Personal story time: I have a friend who watches a fair bit of anime, and every so often is like, ""Oh I hear ___ a lot, does it mean ____?"" And 9 times out of 10 the answer is ""Nope."" Or once asked ""How come they say かわいい when they're scared sometimes. And I had to explain that it was actually こわい, and to an English speaker, they can be hard to differentiate if you're not really trying.   So anyway, that's my story about how watching anime clearly doesn't teach you any Japanese."

Obviously not the same.  The Final Fantasy MMOs don't work either, by the way. The Japanese do everything via chat and don't use voice communication. Even some English Free Companies on the EU servers of FF14 do that which is weird as fuck."

I once thought if I focused hard enough it would be possible. But the problem is you just filter out the Japanese audio, only focusing on the subtitles. You might learn a few words such as interjections or short phrases used in isolation, but other than that, you won't learn anything due to the filtering. Even when I try watching with Japanese subtitles (as my reading is now vastly better than my listening), most of the audio is ignored.  And since it's probably 100% non interactive (unlike say a program which regularly talks to the listener like sesame street), it's not even close to real immersion. I have no evidence for this claim, but I suspect purely passive listening wouldn't be a suitable environment for even native learners (assuming they've never had any contact)."

So you can vary your input to the other person and observe how the results (that person's responses) change, and learn from patterns. This is key high power learning potential.  You can't do that with any sort of canned media.   Now, I do think that watching and listening to media is helpful (which sometimes seems to be a minority opinion on that sub for reasons I could snark about) but yeah, it sure isn't true immersion!"
badlinguistics,3a9iav,itazurakko,2,Thu Jun 18 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"Now, I do think that watching and listening to media is helpful (which sometimes seems to be a minority opinion on that sub for reasons I could snark about) but yeah, it sure isn't true immersion!   Since I probably fall into this category...the problem I have isn't with the idea. The problem I have is that people often talk about it alongside this ""immersion"" gibberish, like setting their phone to Japanese and watching some anime is suddenly going to make then masters of Japanese, when in reality, its benefit is limited, and especially in the early stages, its value is limited, and audio and listening comprehension exercises from a textbook will do you far better (as will most other things)."
badlinguistics,3a9iav,ephemer-,4,Thu Jun 18 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"On the other hand what annoys me is how Japanese in particular tends to attract a lot of learners who will insist that unlike just about any other language in the world, listening or watching media is not only supposedly unhelpful, but actively harmful.  Obviously when learning a language that is not very close to your starting language (which is the case for English speakers learning Japanese) there are less obvious ""hooks"" in the material and less word-for-word equivalents, and so you need to be at a higher level before stuff will really start to make sense enough to be valuable. (Though I think a lot of the questioners know that too.)  But aside from that, there are endless people on Japanese learning groups who will insist that somehow there is no form of entertainment (or indeed any canned media that is available from abroad) that is pure enough to learn this mystical ""real Japanese.""  To hear people tell it, the language used in TV dramas or even in novels somehow bears no relation to this ""real Japanese"" and heaven forbid you get used to it, because you will ruin your language and be laughed at on the street and commit the most serious social errors from which you can never recover.  This is crazy. Grammar is grammar. In the odd case where someone ends up doing the equivalent of talking like Bart Simpson or Bugs Bunny, that's an easier place to correct from than someone who doesn't have any speaking experience at all because they were paralyzed and worried about listening to or reading the ""wrong thing."" (Because heaven forbid someone call them a weeb on the internet.)   ...I just think some of the anxious ""we must prevent these people from going astray!"" stuff is overly heavy-handed to the point where it becomes harmful. And I think a lot of the time there is a one-upmanship aspect to it.  Add to that the crowd of people who will just tear down anyone's efforts at doing anything at all to learn or have some Japanese around them in their daily lives. It seems no matter what it is, there is always someone anxious to jump in and declare that whatever it is they're doing - be that setting their phone to Japanese, or subscribing to a word-a-day calendar, or whatever it is - ""won't make you fluent so you might as well not bother."" Or ""you're just going to burn out anyway, you might as well not bother.""  Half those people never claimed that doing such things is their only study method or even asked for advice on ""should I,"" rather they ask some technical question about it like where they can get some font for their US-carrier Android phone, only to get this ""why bother"" arrogant response. Perhaps they like seeing Japanese on their phone purely for motivational reasons. Who knows?  Or someone mentions they're going on a vacation and looking forward to hearing the language ""live"" - where they CAN have interactive contact! - there has to be someone replying ""you'll never learn anything in three weeks so just give up.""  I'm not sure where I'm going with this, exactly.   But probably the thing I find the most odd is the over the top insistence that no media is ever ""real"" enough, and the implication that since there's no supposedly ""perfect"" thing to consume, you should just give up. I don't see this in discussions of learning other languages, even others that are similarly very far from English.  ETA: I do think a lot of people realize they need essentially audio exercises from a textbook or something else similarly... predigested, though. There are lot of complaints (legitimate ones) that there's not more out there at that level.  At least when it comes to written stuff, there's sources like NHK Easy and the like, plus modern browsers can help with the reading of characters so people have a shot at being able to look stuff up. (Though I suppose now they can just copy paste the word as is in to google, too...)  I remember there was a Chinese language newspaper in Southern California that used to have a ""kid's page"" in the middle that had bopomofo on all the articles and they were written in ELI5 style. It was a good thing, for the learner..."

The occasions that have stuck in my head always go something like this one; OP asks if they can learn Japanese primarily using anime, OP is told they should use a comprehensive and orthodox approach and keep the anime as a supplement, OP gets mad and indignant.  Perhaps because of this, the community has swung too far to one side and now preempts this whole interaction by saying ""Anime: Not Even Once."" Or, simply, a lot of us are recovering weeaboos."

Surely they are different in the way they learn the language (and maybe in some things are better, while they are worse at others).  Regarding the difference itself, children will pick up naturally certain things for which most adults would normally need an explicit explanation (at the same time, children will benefit of these explanations a lot less than adults). That has nothing to do with how much you practice and it means ""immersion without any lesson"" will work better for children than for adults."

The first of these was Sanskrit, as a result of intensive trading contact with India, which also brought along Indian religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, much like Islam would later travel along with Arab traders. Java especially had strong contacts with India, to the point that about a quarter of Old Javanese vocabulary was derived from Sanskrit. Nowadays Sanskrit is use throughout Indonesia much like Latin is used in the Eurosphere; in short slogans and mottos of universities and military units and the like, and it's used to form new words for intellectual concepts much like Latin.   Many Javanese names have a strong Sanskrit slant to them. The Javanese Surinamese I know sometimes have more Sanskrit-y names than the Hindustani Surinamese I know, which is pretty cool (although that's maybe because I know more about Javanese than I know about Sarnami Hindustani)."

Perhaps /ʍ/ blocks the merger?  (I don't have the ""wine-whine"" merger.) Just throwing random ideas out.  As for /ʌ~ɐ/ and /ə/, they're basically indistinguishable in my idiolect. (Just now I pronounced /strət/ and /strʌt/ to see—/ʌ/ may be slightly longer?) I'd have to look up pronunciations to know when to transcribe them ""properly."" I am not sure where that quirk comes from; my knowledge of English dialectology is very basic at best.  Edit: Yup, that's also probably a dialect thing. At least according to Wikipedia, /ʌ/ and /ə/ ""often"" merge in General American. However, they don't merge in Southern American, which is probably the single biggest influence on my accent.

badlinguistics,3a4knm,abargall,7,Thu Jun 18 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"Genuine question: in the UK, if you said ""could care less"", people would hear that and genuinely think you were saying that you could care less because that just isn't an idiom here, the idiom is very specifically ""couldn't care less"", so is it still badling?   I was under the impression a big part of it is if the other party can understand what you're saying, so if they can't, then..."
badlinguistics,3a4knm,Olpainless,12,Wed Jun 17 08:00:17 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that's the case.  The literal sentiment in ""could care less"" is spectacularly vague...so much so that it's meaningless. It's basically saying ""I care somewhere between the minimum and maximum degree of an unquantifiable emotion"".   Anyone who heard that would almost certainly fall back on context to understand very clearly that the speaker was saying ""I don't give a flying fuck"" or thereabouts.   I can't imagine any fluent speaker interpreting the idiom any other way, to be honest."
badlinguistics,3a4knm,rugtoad,3,Wed Jun 17 12:07:12 2015 UTC,"This is true some of the time, I think.   If ""could care less"" exists here it's limited to certain groups, I've never heard it in the wild. Coming across it online I have been thrown, you can't always be sure if someone does or doesn't care about a given topic on message boards etc. ""Could care less still"" feels to me like it's saying the opposite, it's not quite sunk in yet, and I'm someone who pays unusual attention to this sort of thing.  That said, it usually is badling because it's often just people who've interpreted it correctly but still want to arse about dissecting it. Since that David Mitchell video I think it's become more widely understood, so that vid sort of invalidated itself to an extent! It's definitely badling in this case cause it's just a fella railing against the idiom being used at all."

""Could care less"" is used just as much here as it is in America and it's perfectly understood the vast majority of the time.

The same search for ""could not care less"" produced 14 hits all of which were relevant. If ""could care less"" occurs in the UK it's news to me and I'd love to know where!"

More often the rest of the following message contradicts the literal interpretation which only causes momentary confusion and slight inconvenience. But sometimes it's genuinely ambiguous; the BNC up-thread shows that 'could care less' is occasionally used literally.  I'd say you're being a bit ethnocentric by assuming it's easy to deduce idioms prevalent in your community, even when their literal interpretation is antonymous.

OTOH, my son had surgery in April to fix his pharyngal flap (it wasn't closing all the way), which immediately improved his speech (he still has issues and is still seeing a speech therapist, but it's a pretty shocking improvement). Because of that flap not closing he tended towards hyper-nasalation, but especially elision.

So vocabulary and grammar are the same thing now, eh?   There are no grammatical genders (inanimate objects being treated as male or female)   Noun class. Noun class. NOUN CLASS.   Also, almost all European languages, perhaps with the exception of French, sound, in principle, quite similar.   English has what, the dark velar liquid (which isn't as pronounced in the UK) and the retracted alveolar approximant (which again is more of an American thing)? The German and a few other Germanic languages are pretty unique with /ø/. French is sorta unique with the nasal vowels, but German speakers for instance wont't find those hard due to French loanwords. Slavic languages have /ʂ/, /ɕ/, and /ɨ/,which aren't too common. Then Spanish has /ɾ/, which English speakers always struggle with despite it being used in certain English dialects.  Maybe continental languages have more similar orthography, but again... that's not language.   Languages within the major language families present in Europe are usually quite closely related   I mean, there's a lot of diversity within the Uralic and IE families... but I'm guessing that's not what you meant.   but I believe that when you reach the later stages of learning (when you try to attain some level of proficiency), Spanish and Italian grammar can be pretty tricky.   As with every other goddamn language in the world.   Slavic languages are much harder to learn than Romance and Germanic languages, and you can read my explanation of the phenomenon in a separate article.   Ah, the famous ""difficulty of Slavic languages for native English speaker"" phenomenon. Truly a complex topic including such esoteric concepts as ""low number of cognates"" and ""it's been a really fucking long time since the branches diverged"".   Finnish and Hungarian have very little in common with Slavic languages in terms of grammar and vocabulary...   Or with any IE language. You are aware they're Uralic languages, right?   ...and an educated speaker of English should already know a significant number of Greek words.   Yay, I know parts of the body in (Ancient) Greek--totally comparable to the number of English-German cognates. Too bad there aren't really any English words derived from modern Greek verbs... I've heard those are somewhat necessary to form sentences.   Chinese grammar is usually considered quite simple...   So close to finally nailing down the difference between isolating and synthetic languages...   Korean has quite a simple writing system and phonology, but people usually consider it as hard as Chinese or Japanese for some reason   Maybe because the writing system and phonology aren't the entire language? Maybe it has something to do with these inflections you keep telling us about..."

As for the pronunciation thing, that's just a dangerous ground to step into and hence falls right into the territory that routinely lands people on /r/badlinguistics. Your opinion on how your language sounds compared to others isn't really relevant--one would expect you to be less able to distinguish between phonemes in languages that you're not as familiar with as those in your native language. The whole definition of a phoneme rests on the ability of speakers to distinguish two sounds between each other. If two languages have very different phonemic inventories, but neither shares much of its inventory with English, you might still think those languages sound similar--this is probably why a lot of people think that Portuguese sounds like Russian. If you wanted to back up your argument (which I think you would have a hard time doing without cherry-picking), you could easily look up the phonemic inventories of different languages and compare them directly.   The rest of your post is just unjustified mockery, in my opinion.   I mean, that's kinda what we do here.

When I notice I say something regularly that I, in fact, do not wish to say, I pay attention to it, call it a mistake when it happens, and gradually shape my idiolect until, eventually, the new way of saying the expression becomes part of my idiolect and the old way starts feeling unnatural.

badlinguistics,3a2r1s,nonneb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:20:35 2015 UTC,"My problem was with the phrase ""inanimate objects being treated as male or female"" because it insinuates that speakers actually have masculine/feminine concepts associated with individual words, which is not the case. Native speakers of languages with grammatical gender often don't notice which nouns get what gender. Calling it ""noun class"" isn't necessary, but it is necessary to understand that it is in fact a noun class and not a gender."
badlinguistics,3a2r1s,hubertwombat,2,Wed Jun 17 06:54:58 2015 UTC,"That is, in fact, not true; or at least partially. It has been shown that speakers associate objects that have a certain grammatical gender with qualities associated with the corresponding sex. See, for example, this, section 4.8.  This association is in fact so strong that they associate the noun with its feminine or masculine qualities even when it is translated into another language. I see this commonly among native speakers of a Slavic language learning German, who tend to treat German nouns as if they had the gender of the closest translation into their mother tongue, even if they have learned the correct article; it is common to hear sentences like ""Ich sehe die Burg. Er ist groß."" Even though the feminine article in ""die Burg"" was used correctly, the speaker associates the word ""castle"" (and its translations) with the masculine gender and uses a masculine pronoun."
badlinguistics,3a2r1s,jakubmarian,6,Wed Jun 17 10:36:35 2015 UTC,"I hope you know that the article you're citing cites both Sapir and Whorf on the first page, and the Sapir-Whorf theory of language shaping thought has been largely discredited by the linguistic community. Grammatical gender does occasionally become noteworthy with respect to actual gender, but this tends to have to do more with nouns describing people and not inanimate objects.  Furthermore, what you're illustrating with the German example is note necessarily a connotation of ""masculine or feminine qualities"" in gendered nouns, but rather that speakers carry biases over to new languages. If you're used to saying он for castles in Russian, then you'll say the translation of он (er) for castles in German. As a native English speaker, I'm likely to say ""Ich sehe die Burg. Es ist groß."" because es is the translation of it. And again, this is because the speaker assumes the nouns to fit into the same noun class--it has nothing to do with whether or not they believe castles to be women and trees to be men. Noun classes develop and are then named with genders by linguists who notice that a particular actual gender fits into a particular noun class. IE languages happen to use a m/f/n system quite nicely, but other language families do not necessarily. You may have heard of an Australian aboriginal language that uses a noun class for vegetables, which by a series of abstractions got applied to airplanes, but not because they think that airplanes are vegetables."
badlinguistics,3a2r1s,jakubmarian,0,Wed Jun 17 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting that empirical data based on actual studies of speakers of languages that have grammatical genders are wrong just because the paper that reports them cites two controversial figures in the history of linguistics?  What I am illustrating is not necessarily such a connotation (but may be, and based on my own experience as a Slavic native speaker learning German, I definitely used to associate inanimate objects with genders based on my mother tongue and only trained myself not to do that because it interfered with my language learning activities), but what the article mentioned above reports is such a connotation (native speakers of such languages actually associated more ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" adjectives with the given nouns even when they were tested in English)."
badlinguistics,3a2r1s,jakubmarian,6,Wed Jun 17 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"I'm suggesting that anything that tries to back itself up with a discredited theory ought to be taken with a grain of salt.  Whatever the case with gendered connotations--which isn't exactly a settled matter in linguistics--this again isn't a case of you being flat-out wrong, but rather too brief and misleading. You said that genders are ""inanimate objects being treated as male or female"", which insinuates that native speakers of languages with grammatical gender actually perceive objects to be male or female (see how this seems to refer to actual gender and not grammatical gender?). Even if there are certain resultant connotations, native speakers still do not typically notice the gender of nouns. Ask a native Spanish speaker who hasn't studied the language formally if any particular noun is male or female and they won't know what you're talking about. What they do notice is that certain nouns fall into certain classes that require certain endings and agreement from other parts of speech.  If your goal is to teach people about language-learning, then the first thing you should be doing is clarifying that grammatical gender is not actual gender. It eliminates a lot of confusion. You also might want to add that the m/f/n paradigm is mostly an IE one and is not universal throughout language families."

All of those (maybe ""Engagement"" less so) are very common German words that will at least give a native German learner of French an idea of what nasal vowels are.  Also beyond that, German loanwords are ""Germanized"" (i.e. eingedeutscht), but not entirely assimilated into ""native"" German phonology.

badlinguistics,39w8qq,smileyman,17,Mon Jun 15 10:45:08 2015 UTC,"Personal anecdote time  I just realised something.  You can use try when there is a possibility the person won't succeed: ""try to open it yourself.""  You can also use try when the task itself is easy, but it's the effect that is unknown. When you ask ""have you tried to switch it off and on?"" you are not doubting the person's ability to switch off the thing, you are asking if doing it has any effect.  My native language is French, and it does not distinguish between those two cases, but I realise I only use ""try and"" in the second case, never in the first one."
badlinguistics,39w8qq,reeblebeeble,9,Mon Jun 15 11:55:35 2015 UTC,"but I realise I only use ""try and"" in the second case, never in the first one.

""Have you tried to change the oil filter"" is grammatical for me, but ""have you tried and change the oil filter"" is really, really weird.   So I think the important part in your example is the conjugation, not the intent.   If we apply your theory to it:  ""Can you try and lift the car?"" vs ""Can you try to lift the car?"" Both are grammatical for me, even though in both cases the person is going to be unlikely to be able to lift the car.   I do think that there is a slight semantic difference in ""try to"" and ""try and"", and it might be related to what you suggested."

badlinguistics,39w8qq,secondaccountforme,2,Mon Jun 15 15:38:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the reasoning is that ""try to [do something]"" is all one verb, whereas ""wait and see"" is two verbs.

Do ""wait to see"" and ""wait and see"" have the same meaning in English?  And I'm quite sure we don't have the ""try and..."" construction. If you use the conjunction after ""try"", in Italian you're talking about a different action ""prova e fammi sapere"" (lit.: ""try and let me know"") means ""try (to do it) and (then) let me know (how it went)"""

Io direi che wait and see and wait to see sono uguali in significato, ma distinti in utilizzo. Cioè, io solo uso wait to see se c'è qualcosa che segue. Per esempio, Why don't you wait to see what happens? o Let's wait to see the results. Io non direi mai, We'll wait to see. Wait to see...cosa?!  Wait and see posso usare in tutti i due situazione che ho appena illustrato. Why don't we wait and see what happens?, Let's wait and see the results, oppure We'll wait and see. Tutti questi mi suonono buoni e ben naturali.  Eppure nella maggior parte delle situazioni, wait and see mi sembra più naturale che wait to see. Ma ricordate bene che questo qui e solo il mio inglese (uno degli vent'anni nel nordeste degli Stati Uniti); è ovvio doppo di legere gli altri commenti che tutti quanti non sono d'accordo.  EDIT: Quando parlavo di questo con un amico, mi ha spiegato qualcosa chi prima non mi sono reso conto(...?). Wait to see ha un connotazione di un risultato anticipato più negativo, mentre wait and see implica più speranza. Per esempio:   ""Wait to see if he shows up,"" vuol dire, ""Io credo che non va a arrivare. Ma in tutti casi, spettiamo per la raggione di vedere se arriverà."" ""Wait and see if he shows up,"" vuol dire, ""Io spero che arriva,"" o forse, ""Ci scommetto che arriverà."""

""Wait to [do something]"" and ""try to [do something]"" are the same. They both make up a sentence where there's one verb and one infinitive.  The difference is that while you can just wait, you can't just try. ""Wait"" can function just fine on its own. I waited. ""Try"" can't do that in quite the same way. I tried. Tried what? There's always an implied infinitive.    The intention might not be any different, but the people who would complain about ""try and"" wouldn't complain about ""wait and"" because its ability to function without an infinitive. These people are essentially saying that ""and"" necessitates that both verbs serve the same grammatical role.

Whereas I pronounce ""trying and"" as [tʃɹɑɪŋənd] almost all of the time.

In any case, but this might be my civil law bias, it's an inelegant way of running things.

That doesn't mean I don't think we shouldn't explicitly write that marriage includes same-sex couples.

I think it's because English (and Swedish) usally is SVO and thus a first person pronoun occuring later in a sentence is usually supposed to be ""me"", however in this case it's the subject despite occuring later in the sentence.  It's a recuring theme with grammar nazis. You're extrapolating on incomplete knowledge of grammar under the assumption that everyone around you is an idiot. :p"
badlinguistics,39sel7,myxopyxo,2,Sun Jun 14 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Are you a Swedish speaker? If so, are there Swedish grammar nazis? And what kind of things do Swedish pedants (mistakenly or not) rant about?"
badlinguistics,39sel7,abargall,8,Sun Jun 14 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm swedish. And there certainly are.  One thing some people rant about is de/dem. In written Swedish the third person plural pronoun is ""de"" as the subject and ""dem"" as the object, but in spoken language we say ""dom"" to both. Online ""dom"" is very common, and I've seen people correct this. Often people who try to use de/dem mess up too, so that's being corrected.  For the third person singular pronoun we also have a subject/object pair (exactly as in English, he/him/she/her). he/him is han/honom and she/her is hon/henne. For most dialects you distinguish between subject in object both in written and spoken language I think, but some dialects use the subject form for both as in ""han älskade hon"" instead of ""han älskade henne"". This way my main thing back in the day, I had almost instant reflexes correcting han to honom and hon to henne in spoken language. :p  Another big thing is that we write a lot of words together. For example a blue (blå) berry (bär) is called ""blåbär"" in Swedish, not ""blå bär"" (with a space). Usually writing apart just makes it read like nonsense, sometimes it changes the meaning (blåbär is a kind of berry, blå bär are any blue berries). Probably due to English influence, lots of people have started writing words apart that should be written together. When I was younger there was even a very popular site called SkrivIhop.nu (WriteTogether.nu) which sold stickers and informed about writing things together. :p  Speaking of English influence, anglicisms are pretty common too. Directly translating english idioms or using english sentence structure in Swedish. Sometimes it's used for comedic effect, sometimes it's done unintentionally and sometimes it triggers grammar nazism.  Dangling/misplaced modifiers aren't very common, but I have seen grammar nazis commenting on it. Usually it's a source of wordplay more than anything. Not sure if dangling/misplaced modifiers is a correct translation, but basically it's when you don't know what a verb is refering to because of a malformed (or ambiguous) sentence construction.   21-åringen anhölls misstänkt för grov stöld av åklagare.  Meaning 1: The 21-year old, who was suspected of theft, was detained by the prosecturor.   21-åringen anhölls (misstänkt för grov stöld av åklagare).   Meaning 2: The 21-year old was detained because he was suspected of having stolen a prosecutor.   21-åringen anhölls (misstänkt för grov stöld) av åklagare.   Orsak till syftningsfel: Oklart om prepositionen av och substantivet åklagare syftar på anhållandet eller på stölden   I'm not sure why, but I think these happen more often in Swedish than in English. If anyone knows why, I would love to hear about it."
badlinguistics,39sel7,myxopyxo,6,Sun Jun 14 23:18:47 2015 UTC,"I remember losing points in Swedish class once for writing something to the effect of ""han var längre än henne"" (lit. ""he was taller than her"") instead of ""han var längre än hon"" (lit. ""he was taller than she""). Apparently the idea is that it's supposed to be a case of ellipsis, with the verb ""är"" (""is"") omitted at the end of the sentence, in which case the subject form ""hon"" would be expected. Personally though I was quite bewildered, as ""han var längre än hon"" isn't even grammatical in my idiolect, and sounds to me more like a case of using ""hon"" as the object form than anything."
badlinguistics,39sel7,BeholdMyGlory,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"That's usually how it's explained, but there's a much more rational reason I think. The thing is that ""henne"" (or her) is the object of a verb, but the copula verb is a bit different and doesn't have an object. It just links the subject to the predicate.  So since you don't have an object in the sentence ""han är längre än hon"", you don't use the object form of ""hon"".  However, this reasoning would make sense in English too but in English I think you'd say ""he's taller than her"", right? So there's something else to it I guess. Perhaps ""her"" is a predicate form rather than an object form? I don't know, it could just be convention.  Edit: probably wrong."
badlinguistics,39sel7,myxopyxo,3,Mon Jun 15 03:32:51 2015 UTC,"For me ""än"" simply forces the object form just like e.g. a preposition would."

No matter which you choose though it will have two interpretations, either that you like him more than you like her or that you like him more than she does (I think the same would be true for English in this case, right?).   I think I would say ""hon"" if I meant that I like him more than she does and ""henne"" if I like him more than I like her.

For example, the word ""truth"" as we know it was invented by the western Greeks. So why does that matter?   To most western thinkers, something is 'true' if it can be proven. I.e. the sky is blue because I can look at it and see that it is blue (Which is actually false, obviously, but that illustrates my point). However, you're ignoring the fact other cultures/philosophies (including the Chinese for a very long time) may not even have a word that corresponds to our term for 'truth', and the very idea of asking ""what is truth?"" (While possible) to these people is ridiculous, as their very foundations for thought, and therefore the means in which they analyze the *world around them are completely different than ours.  As a more relatable example, let's say we tried to define the word 'water'. H20 right? Sure. But what about ""salvation"" to a severely dehydrated man? Is that not a correct definition?

They may not approach it the same way, or describe it the same way, or value the end product of that proof, but ""truth"" or ""water"" are empirical things. You're doing that terrible philosophy thing where you make a category error, extending metaphors far beyond reality.  Different languages don't ""see"" the world differently in the sense that it makes their users see things differently. They describe things differently, and taken as a mass, culturally that results in different artifacts and approaches. Please do not ascribe this difference to the empirical differences in the particular languages that cultures speak. That is not the case.

badlinguistics,39phij,MobiusCoffee,3,Sat Jun 13 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"""A Chinese Philosophers theory of knowledge"" is an article written by Chinese philosopher Chang Tung-sun after he studied in the West. It's a fantastic introduction to the concept of ""different knowledges"", meaning that there are different (and equally valid) forms of knowledge found in non-western traditions. You can probably find a PDF of it floating around somewhere.  Chinese Thought in a Global Context: A Dialogue Between Chinese and Western Philosophical Approaches by Karl-Heinz Pohl is a good book detailing the modern differences between Chinese and Western thought.   Dao De Jing: A Philosophical Translation this book is a fantastic western take on Taoism and is also highly recommended, but it's written with the assumption that you're already pretty well versed in western philosophy.   For an even more relatable read you can always go with the Tao of Pooh even though it's academic usefulness is questionable at best.  As you can tell I mostly read on Taoism or Chinese philosophy, so I don't really have any resources on Indian philosophy or that of other cultures, but I'm sure a quick Google search will suffice.

But what about ""salvation"" to a severely dehydrated man? Is that not a correct definition? Or ""adversary"" to a ship captain sailing through the high seas? I would say he is correct in that definition as well.   Those examples would still be perfectly valid in a world with one single language, since your point is that the value you give to words depends on your personal experience/situation (and I agree with that).   Now with those examples in mind, what about the cultures in which the concept of ""defining"" something is ridiculous to begin with?   Is it because the structure of their language makes it impossible (and therefore, western me would add this mindset to my toolbox by learning their language), or is it simply because their culture is different (and by learning their language I will get in contact with their cultural heritage).  I celebrate liguistic diversity because it is the materialisation of the diversity of cultures and approaches, and because different dialects/languages correlate so well with different cultures and lifestyles and history so acknowledging this diversity makes us fully aware of how varied we can be. I think multilingualism is a great value to promote because it means you are able to navigate among people with different backgrounds.   But if learning Russian made me understand Russia better it's because it has given me access to primary sources (texts, songs, people etc), not because I realised they consider cinniy and galuboy to be different color (instead of us calling them two different kinds of blue). Realising this did teach me things about human beings in general though, but I don't think the grammar and vocabulary of Russian by itself makes me understand Russia better.  I don't understand Russia better because I can speak Russian, I understand it better because I have been learning Russian.

I think I've been arguing the wrong point, and I think I want to restructure what I'm saying. You see I'm not advocating that you will come to a different conclusion on the definition of water through thinking in another language, or even when utilizing a different cultures philosophy. In fact some philosophers have argued that it is impossible to ever understand another culture or even language as such (the problem of 'otherness' comes to mind).   What I am saying is that we should remember that other languages not only represent different linguistic concepts than our own, but also that they correspond to their own culture's unique philosophies, thought processes and world views, that are entirely different than ours! So who's to say they cannot solve a problem in their own manner that isn't even in our peripheral? Or that they cannot solve an existing 'Western' problem in a way entirely different than how we have solved it, using their own unique methodology (linked to their language)?  But again, I'm not strictly referring to linguistics. Trying to solve a typical western question like ""What is a human being?"" Using your own (western) understanding of Mandarin will only result in a western answer in your best western translated Chinese. I'm saying that its possible that native speakers of Mandarin may just be able to solve such a problem in terms not even expressable in English, linguistically and philosophically (of course Mandarin is only an example).

Sure we can. Why not? Right now, doing so would require too much processing power, and the models themselves are way too complicated to even consider, but there is no hard and fast reason that it won't one day be possible. Yeah, we can't teach computers to translate using semantics and context at the moment, but it's not unreasonable to hypothesize that it will someday come."

A rule-based system would need a way to deal with human-reconstructable mistakes in the input and a statistical system... I don't think a 100% statistical system will ever have human-level capability, they're just convenient because they always produce results.  Probably it will get better now that they're combining the two strategies, but I suspect anything that's at all statistical is just going to be people throwing data at machine learning algorithms, and to be really AI-complete the system would have to be rule-based.  Which is impossible from a practical standpoint, because of vocabulary and name issues.  As far as contexts go, specifically, I suspect that once we have all the information that goes into taking such contexts into account, and all the science to know what to do with it, language will have shifted and we will need new analyses to keep the systems up to date, and as a result the systems will never be completely current (although they may be good enough for some purposes).  Add this to the fact that we just don't have the resources and science for many languages that we have for English, which is very relevant for a machine translation system.

So:   side = Seite  sides = Seiten  offside(s) = abseits  Notice the genitive -s, not the plural -en. Also notice how it isn't capitalized, because it isn't a noun, which also lends credence to the fact that it definitely isn't a plural (of course, sometimes it can be a noun, which confuses things, but not really; the same words can be different parts of speech given context; the important thing is that the noun derives from the adverb, not the other way around).

badlinguistics,39bt48,Sheikh_Kristophe,8,Thu Jun 18 01:31:20 2015 UTC,It actually is kind of challenging when you get very long clauses. I know back in high school I would get knocked off points in my German class because I'd write a complex sentence and forget to add the verb.
badlinguistics,39bt48,Kativla,8,Thu Jun 11 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"Well, German is an SOV language, though it masquerades as an SVO language. Without getting into the specifics of German, it is pretty much the difference between ""He ran to the store"" and ""He to the store ran."" And in my experience learning SOV languages, if you haven't done one before it does take some time for that to start to feel natural."
badlinguistics,39bt48,Pennwisedom,3,Thu Jun 11 00:22:17 2015 UTC,Interesting. How does it 'masquerade' as SVO? Is SOV common among Germanic languages in general?
badlinguistics,39bt48,ThornsyAgain,10,Thu Jun 11 00:36:18 2015 UTC,"the main clause goes SVO, but it's not really SVO.  The conjugated verb must be in the second position is all.  You can throw a phrase, an object, or a subject or w/e in front of it and it won't be SVO anymore in order for the conjugated verb to go second.  Since there are case markers for the nouns, we can even do OVS if we want.  If we use more than one verb in a phrase or if the phrase is a subordinate clause, then the verb goes at the end.  Examples:  Der Hund beisst den Mann.  The dog bites the man. (SVO)  Den Mann beisst der Hund.  The man bites the dog.  (OVS)  Heute beisst der Hund den Mann.  Today bites the dog the man.  (VSO).  If we use a helping verb, like ""have eaten"" (gegessen haben), then the participle (or infinitive or w/e) goes to the end.  Example:  Ich habe das Obst gegessen.  I have the fruit eaten.  Gestern habe ich das Obst gegessen.  Yesterday have I the fruit eaten.    Conjugated verb goes second, participle last.  Subordinate clause:  Als ich sechs Jahre alt war, ass ich viel Eis.  When I six years old was, ate I much ice cream. (""ate"" must go directly after the subordinate clause in order to be in the second position of the main clause)  Ich ass viel Eis als ich sechs Jahre alt war.  I ate much ice cream when I six years old was."

badlinguistics,39bt48,Pennwisedom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"But V2 makes it VSO, not SOV. Subordinate clauses are SOV though"
badlinguistics,39bt48,mszegedy,2,Fri Jun 12 18:43:16 2015 UTC,But not all subordinate clauses for example weil/denn.

It's not stupid using the ""wrong"" one - what's stupid is the fact that prescriptivists aren't able to spot countable nouns without the help of less, and fewer.  If anything the people who supposedly use them incorrectly are more intelligent sounding, because they can infer and understand from context.   Do these type of people just stare, mouth agape whenever someone uses less in place of fewer?

Reading that thread on IPEE, I kept thinking, ""But... but... but... that's just how I talk!"" Although, to be fair, ""I'm a native speaker of IPEE"" is a first-world problem at its finest, so I guess I'll just shut up now.  EDIT: So much for that native IPEE speaker thing.

Because I have opinions, that are appropriate to post in a thread about whatever I have opinions about. Basic Internet etiquette.  I am not ""ignoring the context""; if anything, you are. The context is that SMBC has a readership of millions, most of which are unlikely to be familiar with linguistics. For most, this is an introduction, equal parts didactic and funny. I've been reading SMBC for a long time, and he does comics like this relatively often, where he represents different fields or philosophies using humor. If they're supposed to be entirely inaccurate, then it is lost on everybody. They come off as much more of a funny shorthand or mnemonic than just a joke.  And anyway you didn't address the last part of the rant. Inaccurate but funny is passable. Inaccurate but unfunny holds a lot less water.

badlinguistics,39782a,Apropos_Username,-3,Tue Jun 9 23:41:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it comes down to the audience. I picture the SMBC audience as essentially reddit. And when I imagine reddit reading the comic, I don't imagine them thinking, ""Haha, I know it doesn't really work like that, but that's a funny one."" Instead I think it's much more likely that they'll just run off to correct people with renewed glee, thinking they've found a justification for prescriptivism. That's bad.   You're seriously trying to tell me what I should find funny? That's the worst sort of prescriptivism.   Generally people agree enough on what is and isn't funny to confidently talk about it. The only way I can think of this one being funny is if one really thought of linguistics in this way, and you enjoyed this as an informal (and therefore funny) description of it. Maybe there's other ways, I dunno. Don't get too offended if someone calls something you like unfunny, though—it happens really often.   I don't know why you act like you're some ""true fan"" of SMBC qualified to judge the content.   That's a hyperbolic misunderstanding. What I'm saying is, I've read enough SMBC to gauge Weiner's tone. And I really think you're putting too much faith in the humor element here. You know all those xkcd comics everyone always links to to make a point? This comic is equally quotable, and probably not by accident.   Suddenly now that it's on your turf, it's not funny?   Nah, I find most SMBC comics unfunny, either because they rely too much on niche references to compensate for weak humor, or because they lack both references and humor.

Also, it presents prescriptivism and descriptive linguistics as opposing arguments, when really they're about as irrelevant to each other as creationism and the study of evolution.  This is sort of a general problem with SMBC comics in other fields as well. Once, Weiner had the idea to hold a ""festival"" where people gave presentations on bad ad-hoc evolutionary hypotheses, such as ""babies are physically resilient because early humans would football-punt them to other villages to spread their genes"". He called it ""BAHfest"". Unfortunately, if you google it now, you come up almost entirely with creationist websites that think that it's evidence against evolution. This is fine when we can ignore the creationists, but the majority of SMBC's audience is likely to be prescriptivists. Plus, BAHfest was at least funny, whereas this comic is rather threadbare."

Lots of interesting stuff about the contents of A Beka's Christian homeschooling curriculum.   I was taught that there is a moral difference between prescriptivist and descriptivist grammar. The problem all started with “post-modern ideologies” that affected the way people see language and communication, and it all came to a head with Merriam-Webster’s Third Edition. Dictionaries are supposed to tell you the “correct” spelling for a word, but the Third went and changed it all by refusing to say whether or not a spelling was correct. Over time “correct” and “incorrect” have been replaced by “preferred” or “standard formal.”  This is a huge problem, according to conservative Christians, and the rationale goes something like this:   Christians are “people of the book,” as our Gospel was delivered to us through the medium of language. Evangelization depends on clear and effective communication. Clear and effective communication is best maintained by teaching “correct” grammar and syntax. Therefore, failure to teach grammar is detrimental to the Gospel."

badlinguistics,394hpy,alynnidalar,6,Tue Jun 9 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"It's definitely something that differs between groups. Fundamentalist Christianity is a wide field -- while the various churches and corporations have certain commonalities and trade ideas around, different subgroups all have certain quirks.   This particular approach to grammar is somewhat specific to A Beka, which makes sense as they're a company that produces fundamentalist Christian homeschool materials. Interestingly, Accelerated Christian Education, another company that makes terrible materials for terrible ""schools,"" also takes an outdated, rigid view of grammar, while combining it with propaganda. Jonny Scaramanga is an activist who's been working to get ACE out of UK schools, and he describes it here:   Almost all English instruction in ACE is in the form of traditional grammar exercises — diagramming sentences, identifying subjects and objects, and learning parts of speech. Never mind that study after study have failed to find any evidence that this improves students’ writing, and never mind that we have known since at least the 1950s that ACE’s understanding of grammar is unscientific and not how language works in practice. There are plenty of credible English educators who still support grammar instruction, but none of them recommend doing it ACE’s way. ACE doesn’t care about that. Grammar teaching using isolated sentences is traditional. And traditional, to fundamentalists, is best.  Teaching grammar this way requires thousands of individual sentences for students to parse, and this suits ACE perfectly because it makes every page an opportunity for fundamentalist propaganda. The sentences tell stories of missionaries and Christian heroes, and they teach good Christian children how to behave. A lot of these sentences are about who you should and should not befriend."

Sometimes I just sit with them and admire them. They are so lovely. When I picture an apple, I am picturing the world. The world is merely an apple that no god has yet plucked to eat. Let us rejoice in our appleness.   To eat an apple is to know that apple. My people believe that you cannot know an apple until you have swallowed its juicy flesh. Then you and the apple are one.   PS how do I receive sex upon these women? I have found this website called ""The Red as Apples Pillple"", and they say to understand women I must be sexed unto their bodies in a similar way to eating an apple. This makes sense to me. You can know an apple by talking to eat, having meaningful relationships with it, treating it like an apple being, but until you have stuck your teeth into it, it is only your mother. Or an apple tree.   I feel shame for I do not know the women that these Red-Apple Pillple speak of. I know only apples. Until today I was satisfied with my pure and good apple-knowing, but it seems I have neglected the totality of the world in my relentless pursuit of apples and cider and apple pies and apple bakes and baked apples and caramel apples and...ah.

It's equally appropriate for literally anyone who's ever had ideological views of the sort that most of society is wrong and complacent, which is blinding them from the reality of the world. This is every revolutionary or radical ever.  But several groups of people are so impressed by the illusion that this metaphor somehow uniquely illuminates their own ideology that they try to incorporate it into the belief system itself. Sometimes it's not the red pill either but ""the rabbit hole"" or Plato's allegory of the cave. This is nothing new and it's now the most obvious and trite analogy available to any ""contrarian"".   Of course the defensibility of using the metaphor will always depend on the defensibility of the ideology in question -- an obvious fact that's sometimes overlooked by redpillers who seem to think the red pill metaphor somehow serves an argumentative purpose for their point of view. For some reason they seem to think merely being alerted to the idea that there could be a metaphorical ""matrix"" type situation going on will help convince people that there is and it's this particular sex-related one."

badlinguistics,38tjcx,MystyrNile,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"None. It's [ˈʃpɛ.du]. Or in case you don't read IPA: SHPEH-doo.  From The Lojban Reference Grammar:   2. Pronunciation  Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in Chapter 3, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.  Lojban has six recognized vowels: “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u” and “y”. The first five are roughly pronounced as “a” as in “father”, “e” as in “let”, “i” as in “machine”, “o” as in “dome” and “u” as in “flute”. “y” is pronounced as the sound called “schwa”, that is, as the unstressed “a” as in “about” or “around”.  Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: “b”, “d”, “f”, “k”, “l”, “m”, “n”, “p”, “r”, “t”, “v” and “z”. The letter “c”, on the other hand is pronounced as the “sh” in “hush”, while “j” is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the “s” in “pleasure”. “g” is always pronounced as it is in “gift”, never as in “giant”. “s” is as in “sell”, never as in “rose”. The sound of “x” is not found in English in normal words. It is found as “ch” in Scottish “loch”, as “j” in Spanish “junta”, and as “ch” in German “Bach”; it also appears in the English interjection “yecchh!”. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter “r” can be trilled, but doesn’t have to be.  The Lojban diphthongs “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, and “au” are pronounced much as in the English words “sigh”, “say”, “boy”, and “how”. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an “i” pronounced like English “y” (for example, “io” is pronounced “yo”) or else with a “u” pronounced like English “w” (for example, “ua” is pronounced “wa”).  Lojban also has three “semi-letters”: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter “h”. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.  Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is “y”, which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.  All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters."

badlinguistics,38oygc,MystyrNile,3,Sat Jun 6 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, the front page is normalised so that subreddit of different sizes all take up equal space on the front page -that isn't the case on /r/all. Here's the code for the normalisation on reddit's github  Here's how it was explained by /u/Deimorz:   Raising the subscription limit was actually one of the first things I wanted to do when I started here, but it turns out that the reason it hasn't been done is that it just doesn't work very well. You have to understand the way the front page is built (may not be quite correct, but it's close):   50 (100 if you have reddit gold) random subreddits from your subscriptions are selected (this changes every half hour). For each of those subreddits, take the #1 post (as long as it's less than a day old). These will be the first X submissions on your front page, where X is the number of subreddits that have a #1 post less than a day old. So you get the top post from each subreddit before seeing a second one from any individual subreddit. The remaining submissions are ordered using a ""normalizing"" method that compares their scores to the score of the #1 post in the subreddit they're from. This makes it so that, for example, a post with 500 points in a subreddit where the top post has 1000 points is ranked the same as one with 5 points where the top has 10.   So now, imagine that we raised the subscription limit to 500. If you subscribe to 500 subreddits, and 400 of those have something valid for step #2, that means you're going to have to click ""next"" through 400 items (4 - 16 pages) before you even see a second post from anything. And since the listing caps out at 1000, you're really not going to end up able to see much more anyway, so random subsets can actually tend to give more ""interesting"" front pages.  It's not that we don't recognize there's an issue or anything, it's just that turning up that number doesn't actually improve it much or at all. Stuff is being worked on that's much better than the current system, but it's a major, complex project."

Obviously pronunciation is a different beast from grammar and vocabulary so your example's a little skewed.  Some kids are physically incapable of proper pronunciation and need a speech therapist.  If you have a kid mixing up their W and their R, and they're unable to hear the difference, then they should see a professional."

For example, he says ""piece"" to convey ""small,"" probably since whenever I offer him a ""piece"" of something he sees that it is smaller. He understands and can say ""small"" or ""little"" without issue but does not say them. When we communicate, I say ""small"" and he says ""piece."" Since we understand each other and it's just so darn cute, i've made little to no effort to change his choice of words."

badlinguistics,38l7oz,CouldCareFewer,14,Thu Jun 4 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, how wrong is this? I thought the whole point of children learning languages faster is that they spend literally all day listening and learning and even that takes years. If you immersed an adult in a chinese family and they gave him 2 or so years to just listen and then gave them another 10 or so to slowly learn how to speak it with their guidance I'm sure he/she would learn it just as well if not better than the child.  But I literally don't know what I'm talking about so please correct me."
badlinguistics,38l7oz,elos_,11,Fri Jun 5 05:51:50 2015 UTC,"You can't learn a language as an adult in the same was that you learn it as a kid for reasons beyond the teachers.  When you're a kid your brain is much more plastic, and you can figure out the grammar of the language without formal teaching or formal realization, something that you can't do as an adult. For example, a kid would get an instinctive understanding about how negative sentences work in English, while an adult needs to be taught that negatives require an auxiliary verb and which verbs are auxiliary.  Of course having the kind of teacher that you have as a kid help a lot if you're learning as an adult. Your parent's really want to communicate with you and are very willing go decipher your mispronunciations and grammar mistakes (you might have noticed there is a point during language acquisition where only the parents are able to understand the kid), while native speakers won't be as forgiving with an adult learner, but even if you had that kind of teacher, you'd still need to consciously learn or figure out the grammar."

I wish I could give you an authoritative answer, but the little I know comes from what I have read during my efforts to learn other languages. As far as I understand, the process is always conscious for adults. So even if you're not explicitly taught, when you ""figure it out,"" the conclusion comes as an explicit rule."

badlinguistics,38l7oz,Litmus2336,8,Fri Jun 5 14:17:01 2015 UTC,Check out Noam Chomsky's work on language learning. It might better explain the ideas that language learning is an innate skill that is lost as children go older.

Children's brains are literally hardwired for learning - they have billions more neurons than adults do but far fewer synapses, so the brain is super adaptive to it's cultural surroundings. And sensitive windows are pretty much taken for proven fact in the filed of human development."
badlinguistics,38l7oz,possompants,22,Fri Jun 5 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"It's directly connected to areas of linguistics like language acquisition, first and second language teaching, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics (and beyond - e.g. you could spend a lifetime just studying the sociolinguistics of L2 English learning in any particular English-speaking country).  There aren't hard lines between fields in the sciences and social sciences (even categorising fields within those two broad categories is complicated - where psychology goes is a contentious topic for example) and good research attempts to use all the relevant knowledge. Any language acquisition textbook should contain plenty of references to research done by developmental psychologists and neuroscientists.  So basically this is bad science and bad linguistics at the same time."

This is the current understand, yes. However, This is far from an open and shut case. We do know that adults have more Glial Cells then children. It was used to be believed that they solely served as glue to hold neurons together, but we now know that they help regulate what information goes where and essentially makes the neurons that do exist more effective.   And obviously we can see that kids are not always better at all kinds of learning than adults, so that alone suggests there much be more to it."
badlinguistics,38l7oz,possompants,3,Sat Jun 6 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly.

badlinguistics,38l7oz,Pennwisedom,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've read the kinds of learning that adults and older people are better at is more dependent on judging information, making informed decisions, relying on past experiences and wisdom, and similarly higher-order thinking - which makes sense because the prefrontal cortex is the last to fully myelinate. It would also make sense if they have more cells that strengthen existing connections and make them more effective - so they could more easily judge how new information fits into exiting schema. I wonder how that would apply to language learning?"
badlinguistics,38l7oz,possompants,2,Fri Jun 5 08:13:09 2015 UTC,"I wonder how that would apply to language learning?   While I still find it hard to compare first and second language acquisition, what we do know is that early on adults can make greater strides in language learning than a kid in the same time frame. That they will grasp the basics faster. But they also always tend to be more analytical in the thinking in their second language.  So my hypothesis of sorts is that there's something innate about language in humans that we've evolved this ability to grasp. So what we lose isn't so much the ability to learn language, but we've kinda filled up the ""language spot"" with something, so we are instead adding on to it, and that's what is less natural.  If that makes any sense."
badlinguistics,38l7oz,Mikey_Jarrell,2,Fri Jun 5 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"I would think it would have to do with (going back to the sensitive period idea) the synaptic pruning in the ""language learning"" spot so that certain patterns in your native language are reinforced and become natural - so it's not impossible to learn a new language, but harder, because your brain's not as malleable and you have to actively re-wire it so some extent. And yes, more analytical, because by that time you are consciously looking for patterns and rules, rather than subconsciously, as young children do."
