physicsgifs,3dvhqq,1Voice1Life,27,Sun Jul 19 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"The gifs are great! I wish the captions were a little more coherent though. Here's what I think they mean to say, if you care to edit them:   A Bose–Einstein condensate is a state of matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (that is, very near 0 K or −273.15 °C). This rapidly evaporating liquid helium cools until it is two degrees above absolute zero. A dramatic transformation takes place: suddenly bubbling stops, and the surface of the liquid helium is completely still. The liquid is now superfluid helium. This is a glass bottle with unglazed ceramic bottom with ultra fine porosity. The bottle can hold liquid helium, but the moment the helium turns into superfluid, it leaks through. This kind of flow is called super flow.  Superfluid helium can do things we might have believed impossible. It appears to defy gravity: a thin film can climb walls and escape its container. This is because a superfluid has zero viscosity. The bottom of this tube is filled with jewelers rouge (one of the finest powders).  The narrow part of the tube is filled with cotton to keep the powder in the bulb. This powder creates an extremely fine capillary channel, whose average diameter is a small fraction of one micron (not sure if you meant micron as in 10-6 m or microbe like a bacterium). The IR lamp is heating the bulb so liquid helium rises above the equilibrium level. The height it will rise to depends on the temperature the lamp is producing.   Fantastic post, thank you!"

physicsgifs,3dvhqq,kipz0r,8,Sun Jul 19 23:10:56 2015 UTC,Its another test to show its incredibly low viscosity. The very fine powder would otherwise be an impenetratable barrier for most other fluids (including gasses).   Addition:  I forgot to include the heat gun part. That environment is most likely a sealed one. So when the heat gun is applied the pressure differential is enough to encourage the superfluid to draw up through the powder. Creating a superfluid thermometer basicly.

physicsgifs,3dvhqq,kipz0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:41:44 2015 UTC,Maybe it is showing how the liquid helium is being displaced? Like the powder is expanding but only slightly yet is still displacing a majority of the helium confined within the powder?  Just a guess.

My cousin doesn't walk the street being paranoid, but he's aware a normal argument in his area could turn ugly and end his life. It happens. Whether you think it's rational or not. It happens.

Both of your arms are still working and depending on where I shot you in the leg (say fat/muscle in the calf) you would still be able to get around on that hurt leg. Even a gut shot doesn't instantly stop you so if you are hell bent on killing me you can keep on going.  If I hit you in the head, throat, or heart then yes you are no longer a threat (on average, yes I know there are plenty of people who have survived shots to the head and throat) but any where else a single shot is not a guarantee threat stopper.   If you don't believe me then go and talk to the plenty of soldiers who were shot while over in Iraq/Afghanistan but that didn't instantly remove them from the fight."
physicsgifs,3dqeaw,psycho_admin,2,Sat Jul 18 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"aren't they going to be so incapacitated from the bullet that they won't be able to carry on killing you?   Not necessarily. Adrenaline's a hella drug. There have been many cases where a citizen shoots a home invader, but they have enough adrenaline in their system to make it to a nearby hospital or limp the fuck away. There's been cases where cops have been killed by a meth head even after dumping an entire mag of 9mil.   There's various other factors, such as their momentum and how close they are. For example, a knife attacker has a high chance of killing an officer even if the officer manages to shoot him if the knife wielder is with in 30 feet. Most police engagements occur within 10 feet.   Many people will tell you cops are trained to incapacitate a violent suspect. That's untrue. They're trained to neutralize a violent suspect if it elevates to being forced to a draw a firearm. Doesn't matter how many mags you have to dump. You shoot until you're sure the dude isn't getting back up again, dead or alive."

To address some of what you put into your previous edit:   and if they're particularly determined/armed, when you wound them they drop their gun and try to run   A gun is not a weapon you use to wound with. That is hollywood bullshit.  A gun is a weapon to kill with.  You never shoot to wound with a gun.  You shoot to end the threat and the safest way to end the threat is through killing the threat.     no one is going to die over what you have in your wallet   That is your belief. There are those who are out there that will kill you for what is in your wallet, or for that matter what's in your pants.  Murders like this happen all the time but if you want to live in some fantasy world where that shit doesn't happen then fine, just don't bother talking to those of us who live in the real world.    and you don't have the right (im not talking legally of course) to kill someone over what you have in your wallet.   I have the right to protect myself. If that means I feel that you may attempt to end my life then I am well within my rights to put an end to your ability to threaten my life.     It's called being paranoid    Do you have a first aid kit in your house, car and/or place of employment?  What about home owners, renters, or car insurance?  Have you ever taken a first aid or any type of medical training? What are you paranoid that something is going to happen to you?   Do you see how retarded this logic is?  By being prepared for a possible issue that does not make you paranoid.  It makes you prepared.    Do I think its likely that some one will break into my house and try to kill me?  No I don't but I also don't think its likely my house will catch on fire but guess what?  I still have home owners insurance and keep my important documents in a fireproof safe just like I keep a loaded weapon near my bed for the just in case something happens.

physicsgifs,3df6bq,ipn8bit,41,Wed Jul 15 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"A spinning ball traveling through the air will experience a force perpendicular to the direction of travel and the spin axis. You can see it very well in soccer, where the sideways spin causes the ball to curve sideways. In the gif the rotational axis is horizontal, so the resulting forces cause it to drift away from the launch site. If gravity stopped working it would curve up and around and around until air resistance kills the spin or translational speed.  This is all due to pressure differences the spin causes. It's very similar to how wings on aircraft work.  You could replace the fixed wings of an airplane with rotating cylinders and it would still fly. The reasons why we don't build planes like that are obvious. The cylinders would require an additional source power next to the power to propel the craft foreward. They would also have a higher aerodynamic drag, further increasing the power needed to sustain flight."
physicsgifs,3df6bq,Sipstaff,5,Wed Jul 15 21:54:25 2015 UTC,Although it's worth noting that people did make planes to test this.
physicsgifs,3df6bq,zobbyblob,2,Thu Jul 16 06:21:46 2015 UTC,"If gravity stopped working, wouldn't this effect be impossible?"
physicsgifs,3df6bq,CapgrasX13,3,Thu Jul 16 06:45:17 2015 UTC,No. Gravity has no influence on wether the magnus occurs or not. It just influences the end result. Get some astronaut on the ISS to demonstrate it :)  However if you removed the air it would indeed stop working.
physicsgifs,3df6bq,Sipstaff,2,Thu Jul 16 10:46:34 2015 UTC,But it would not be falling down in the first place without gravity. It would just be spinning in one spot
physicsgifs,3df6bq,seldor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"Let me expand a bit what I originally wrote:   If gravity stopped working ...   ...while the ball is falling...   ...it would curve up and around and around [...]   I failed to mention that I implied this bit. Even if that implication wasn't clear, it should be obvious that I was talking about the ball in a state of rotational and translational movement. The very first sentence described the magnus effect and the requirements (movement) for it. I assumed it would be clear enough from that point on.  Bad assumption, I guess. My bad."

physicsgifs,3df6bq,madesense,5,Wed Jul 15 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"To tack on to the other excellent answers, the spinning causes air on one side to move faster than the air on the other side. This faster moving air will have lower pressure than the slower moving air on the other side. The faster moving, lower pressure air kinda pulls the ball toward it like a vacuum."
physicsgifs,3df6bq,logicalrat,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:28 2015 UTC,"But the ball is spinning towards him? So when it falls down the side closest to him is moving faster through the air, and yet the ball moves away from him. I'm confused"
physicsgifs,3df6bq,Fliffs,5,Thu Jul 16 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"Overall, you're going to have an upward flow of air, right?  Cause the ball is moving down.  Let's look at it from the perspective of the ball.  Air is flowing up, and the ball is stationary, relative to us.  There is a vacuum created on the side where the ball is spinning up.  The ball kinda pulls some of the air with it, faster than it would normally go.  Thus, there is less air directly to the side.  Inversely, on the side of the ball spinning downwards, that is, closest to the guy, the ball is pushing the air back down.  Thus, air moves more slowly, gets clumped up, and a high-pressure zone is created.  Of course, the ball is going to move towards the vacuum to try and fill it, and away from the high-pressure zone, to try and let that expand.  Have my beautiful art. http://i.imgur.com/yl4jzF3.png"
physicsgifs,3df6bq,incompletebreadstick,2,Thu Jul 16 05:35:12 2015 UTC,Great explanation. I didn't factor in the spin dragging air with it. I guess the world makes a little more sense now?

physicsgifs,3df6bq,DoFDcostheta,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"All the other people using the Bernoulli effect (differences of pressure) are incorrect. The ball is moving too slow (terminal velocity of around 23 m/s) and rotating too slowly for it to have a measurable effect.  What's really going on is the Magnus Effect: The spinning of the ball causes one side to of the air flow to stick to the ball (laminar flow) and the other to separate from the ball (turbulent flow). The laminar flow gets deflected to one side, which imparts an opposite force to the ball."

So I knew there was something else going on besides simple slow-motion image capture.   Plus, a low E should have a frequency of about 82 Hz, which gives a fundamental wavelength of a little over 4 meters. Even a third harmonic should have a wavelength of one meter. And while I am willing to say that there are additional harmonics due to the guitar itself, I don't see any lower frequency waves around the sizes that you should for those frequencies. So something weird is definitely going on- I.e. The aliasing.   Still, I think it's a pretty cool phenomenon that gets students starting to see that guitar strings aren't simply waggling back and forth, or that they are doing some more complex motions invisible to the naked eyes"

The reason this effect is interesting is because the droplet lasts a long time.  The temperature of the plate is far beyond the boiling point of the droplet, but the drops don't evaporate instantly because the expanding steam forms an insulating cushion for the droplet."
physicsgifs,3d2q32,erythro,2,Mon Jul 13 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"Indeed, that I get. But the reason the droplet ascends is still a bit unclear to me. Is it because the steam is trying to go up?"
physicsgifs,3d2q32,vvictorr,5,Mon Jul 13 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"Say the surface is underneath the droplet.  Steam would form, expanding underneath the droplet.  This would cause the steam to hover, stationary.  Now say the steam is resting against a hot vertical surface.  The steam would form next to the droplet, expanding to push it away in a horizontal direction.  Now imagine it hits a hot plate at a slight angle from the horizontal.  Steam would form at an angle under the droplet, making it jump up and to the side slightly.  Now imagine right under where it lands there is another hot plate at an angle, but slightly higher.  They form steps, and the droplet jumps up the steps.  These are the steps you see in the gifs."

physicsgifs,3d2q32,vvictorr,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the steam is pushing off of the ridges, and the way they're asymmetrically shaped (the second gif illustrates this better than my words do) means that they push off mostly in one direction, which moves them uphill."

physicsgifs,3d2q32,enestatli,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that, while visually impressive, the reason the droplet goes up hill is very similar to shooting a pellet gun using a CO2 cartridge.  That is, for most people, it's not remarkable that expanding gas can propel an object.  The Leidenfrost Effect is only responsible for the fact that the water doesn't boil away quickly because steam between the hot surface and the water droplet will raise the water droplet away from the hot surface.  One can see the Leidenfrost Effect easily at home by heating up a flat pan and putting a drop of water on it.  It will skittle around the pan and take a while to evaporate.  The movement of the droplet uphill is because the top of each ridge is not horizontal (or rounded), but rather, angled.  This is clear in the 2nd GIF.  The angle of the ridge creates a puff of steam perpendicular to the surface of the ridge, which pushes the water to the side.

The droplet of liquid nitrogen is moving around like due to changing surface tension from an effect called ""Marangoni convection"".  As the liquid nitrogen dot sits on the surface, it cools the surrounding gasoline, which causes the surface tension to drop.  In a perfectly undistributed system, the liquid N2 dot would stay perfectly still, as the surrounding gasoline would all be cooled of exactly the same, resulting in zero net force.  However, when it is even slightly disturbed, the surface tension gradient begins to push the N2 dot in one direction.  This leads to a positive feedback loop, which pushes the dot even more in that direction.  Eventually the friction and drag forces equal the forces due to the Marangoni effect, and a stable speed is reached.    Source: ""Interfaces and Colloids"" by J. C. Berg"

If you replace F by mg in the second equation, you get m g = G M m / d², and, having m on both sides, you can remove it.

physicsgifs,3bs7gp,NoNSFWsubreddits,4,Wed Jul 1 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the same thing that would happen if someone poured molten metal like steel into liquid water, right?"
physicsgifs,3bs7gp,slowrecovery,6,Thu Jul 2 05:11:02 2015 UTC,"Kind of...  It'd be a fair amount different though because of the temperatures involved.    For instance, steel melts at 1500 C, and water boils at 100 C, making the temperature difference 1400 C.  Liquid nitrogen boils at -196 C, and the mercury poured in it was only 21 C, making the temperature difference 217 C....    So pouring liquid steel into water would have a temperature difference 7 times greater than mercury into liquid nitrogen.  The water would boil away much faster, if not instantly.  Not to mention that brosilicate glass begins to melt at 820 C, so liquid steel would melt right through the glass and the steel would be so hot it would be reacting with the air as well... it would be a total disaster haha.    Perhaps someone here more educated than I could give a better answer, but from my understanding, something like liquid steel poured into water would be SOMEWHAT like this, only everything is dialed up to 11"

physicsgifs,3au5ac,mrchives47,27,Tue Jun 23 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"No such thing as a stupid question! But to actually answer it, basically, no. The problem is twofold: firstly, the masses and heights involved. A regulation golfball is about 45 grams. A medium-sized satellite is anywhere from 500-1,000 kg. The golf ball reached a height of 8.5 meters, the lowest low Earth orbit is 160 km. So you're looking at launching something 500,000 times more massive 19,000 times higher. As I'm sure you can imagine, the energy involved would be ridiculous.  But let's say you somehow manage to get enough energy from your bounce. Well, you know that saying ""What goes up must come down""? No matter how high you throw something straight up (ignoring the gravitational influence of other bodies) it will always return to Earth. To achieve orbit, you need tangential velocity. That's why rockets turn during their ascent. So unless you want to bounce a vehicle with fuel and an engine (which is going to add even more mass) you have no way to alter you trajectory and as such no way to achieve orbit.  Damn, now I want to play some KSP."

In this case, X,Y,Z are amplitudes of a fourier series. X(t),Z(t) is also what is plotted (but the axis was removed for esthetics) and the development in time is shown. The starting point was very close to one unstable fixed point, so first you see the system spiralling away from the fixed point. For certain parameters the system becomes chaotic, which is the case here. So it corresponds to the case of a very high temperature difference resulting in turbulent flow."

physicsgifs,3abkds,True-Creek,3,Thu Jun 18 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the cool question. I thought about it for a while and I think I can prove that there is no symmetry. However I think it will appear symmetric due to limited resolution.   For the proof, I make the following assumptions:  1) The system is deterministic. This means, that whenever you know that the system is at position P, you can calculate the system's position at any other given time according to the differential equations.  2) There are no periodic orbits in the chaotic case of the Lorenz system. This is a complicated proof, so I will just quote it.  Let's start: One can calculate the two points about which the system is moving around (they are called fixed points). They are given by C1 = (+a,+a,r-1) and C2 = (-a,-a,r-1), where a is a number. One can see, that the fixed points are symmetric about the z-axis. Hence the only possible axis of symmetry is the z-axis.   Also the differential equations posted below are invariant under the transition x → -x, y → -y. This means that one can turn the space around the z-axis and the system will not change.  Lets say there was symmetry. This implies that there is a point P0 = (x0 , y0, z0 ) that lies on the trajectory and some time Δt later, the system will be at P1 = (-x0 , -y0, z0 ). Because we can transform space according to x → -x, y → -y and because of assumption 1), the system will be at P0 again after 2Δt. Due to 1), we find our self in a 2Δt-periodic orbit which violates assumption 2).   Hence there is no symmetry."

My guess is that since the Hellfire missile uses a shaped charge designed to penetrate through the armor, the tank would be mostly still intact, since most of the destructive force is focused through a small hole into the interior of the the tank. The thought goes something like: why waste time and money on a large explosive to destroy the entire tank when you can vaporize the crew inside with a relatively small explosion?  Watching the GIF you can see that the tank barely moves when the missile strikes since more of the energy is being used to melt/burn a hole through the armor, which turns the armor itself into a weapon since all that molten steel is blown into the crew cabin."

physicsgifs,39vow2,JellyMcNelly,19,Mon Jun 15 08:53:57 2015 UTC,And the bottom is at zero g. If you preformed an integral on the length of the slinky you can work out the acceleration at any point.  Edit: spelling
physicsgifs,39vow2,LithiumEnergy,3,Mon Jun 15 10:30:31 2015 UTC,0 to 9.81?
physicsgifs,39vow2,DomUK89,4,Tue Jun 16 11:02:02 2015 UTC,"Well 19.62 to 0.  In fact, now I think about it it's quite simple and doesn't even need to be integrated."
physicsgifs,39vow2,LithiumEnergy,2,Tue Jun 16 11:35:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough regarding your second point, however, why would the value of gravity have doubled for the integral?"
physicsgifs,39vow2,DomUK89,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"Well the amount of acceleration at the top is equal to the acceleration due to gravity + acceleration due to the elasticity of the slinky.   The reason this added acceleration is 1g is due to the spring being held until it reached an equilibrium state, I will explain.   A formula you learn is F=ma=-kx where k is the spring constant and x is it's displacement from equilibrium. This can be arranged to a=-kx/m. If you carefully measured the three values on the right side and then calculated the equation, a would indeed equal -9.81"
physicsgifs,39vow2,LithiumEnergy,7,Wed Jun 17 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good approximation at the start but doesn't hold for the entire fall. At the beginning, the top part is feeling gravity plus an additional downward force from the stretched state of the spring. So it is accelerating at g plus whatever acceleration from the spring force. As it falls, the spring is less stretched, so that part of the force becomes less, and the acceleration (of the top of the slinky) decreases. Once the top part hits the bottom part and it is fully compressed, there is no more spring force and the whole thing accelerates at g.  The reason that the bottom doesn't move is that information can't travel through the slinky faster than the wave speed in that direction. So the bottom doesn't know it has been dropped until a wave from the dropping event at the top reaches it. The slinky is a very weak spring, which leads to a low wave speed. The wave speed is in fact so slow it is slower than the rate at which the top part of the slinky falls. You can see a small wave front just down from the top and the top catches up to it as it falls.  You are correct that because the slinky as a whole is in free fall, the acceleration of the center of mass is g."
physicsgifs,39vow2,mechanician87,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think the point being made is that if the bottom of the slinky is at 0 g, the spring must be causing an acceleration of g upwards, therefore the top of the slinky must be causing an acceleration of g downward, therefore the total acceleration at the top is 2g downward."
physicsgifs,39vow2,Manypopes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"That would be true if the force distribution were the same for the whole length of the slinky. Which at the beginning is true if the slinky is well modeled by a linear spring (which may not be true, especially for the really tall Empire State Building case mentioned in another comment). Either way, as soon as it starts falling, you either get a compression wave traveling down the slinky, or in this case, a shock, behind which the slinky is fully compressed. In both cases, the force distribution is no longer uniform throughout the length of the slinky and one can no longer make that acceleration averaging argument that the top is accelerating at 2g."

physicsgifs,39vow2,Salmanius,2,Tue Jun 16 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, basically, it takes time for the slinky material to react to a change in tension on it; the reaction propagates at a speed determined by the flexiness of the material (rather like the speed of sound in air or water is different).  It takes a while for the bottom of the slinky to get the news that the top of the slinky has been released."
physicsgifs,39vow2,whyamisosoftinthemid,2,Tue Jun 23 04:48:41 2015 UTC,"It takes a while for the bottom of the slinky to get the news that the top of the slinky has been released.   While technically true, that's a poor way to put it since it really isn't about ""getting the news"" in the normal way people use that phrase.   It's better to say that the tension of the spring pulling up on the bottom keeps it from falling until the top portion reaches it, which ends the upward tension.   In other words, the top part is ""pulling upwards"" on the bottom part with enough force to counteract the pull of gravity until the top part reaches the bottom part, at which point the upward force ends and gravity takes over and all of it falls downward."
physicsgifs,39vow2,prajnadhyana,3,Fri Jun 26 00:00:53 2015 UTC,Would the same thing happen for a slinky that is the length of the Empire State Building or any tall building for that matter?

In reality a material that could hold all the weight most likely wouldn't have the ""springiness"" of a slinky, so it would be too stiff and would simply fall normally."

The collapse is often mistaken for a case of resonance. This article goes into more detail about this and what causes the collapse.  The wind was more or less constant at 42 mph on that day. So the wind was not periodic and couldn't have externally forced the bridge at its resonant frequency. Because of the geometry of the deck, vortices are formed periodically that externally force the bridge in the motion that the bridge is moving in. The frequency of the vortices is not close to the resonant frequency of the bridge either. It is just feeding more and more energy to the bridge to the point where the amplitude of vibration is so high that it collapsed."

It's not at all complicated or anything beyond what your seeing, that air (fluid) attaches to any surface it moves around.   Now Boundary Layer Physics is looking at the friction between a fluid and surface. May not sound interesting but it gets interesting at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. As air moves faster, there is more friction generating heat and increased friction. Eventually the friction causes so much heat and static charge can cause that high speed air to impact the surface explosively.  I forget which one, but one of failed space shuttle launches was a result of a single tile being slightly not flush, as it reached Boundary Layer forces the shuttle exploded."

physicsgifs,38u0be,1Voice1Life,7,Sat Jun 6 20:29:30 2015 UTC,Looked into this and it's caused by O2 molecules having paramagnetic properties. Unpaired electrons in O2 have magnetic dipole moments so the molecules are effected by magnetic fields. As to why O2 molecules have unpaired electrons is a bit beyond my knowledge of chemistry and is explained by molecular orbital theory.
physicsgifs,38u0be,MaliciousHH,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:34:16 2015 UTC,"It's because electrons fill orbitals from the lowest energy up. If two orbitals have the same energy then the electrons fill up one in each orbital and are in parallel spins. In the case of oxygen there are enough electrons to half fill the highest level orbitals but not enough to completely fill them, so there are two degenerate orbitals with unpaired electrons."
physicsgifs,38u0be,FlowingSilver,3,Sun Jun 7 11:35:16 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think it's that simple. Oxygen molecules have an even number of valence electrons and can fill the first three orbitals completely. It's do with the behaviour of electrons in the overlap of orbitals and wave-particle duality.
physicsgifs,38u0be,MaliciousHH,3,Sun Jun 7 13:47:46 2015 UTC,"When a molecule forms, an entirely new set of orbitals form due to the overlap of atomic orbitals. There are no longer 1s, 2s and 2p in each atom, the 2s orbitals on each interact to give Sigma bonding and antibonding orbitals. The 1s orbitals don't really overlap because they're too small.  Two p orbitals overlap to form another set of Sigma orbitals and the other 4 create two each of pi bonding and antibonding orbitals. So the oxygen molecule has the 6 valence electrons from each oxygen, a total of 12, to fill the orbitals. The 2 Sigma orbitals completely fill, using up four electrons. Two electrons go into the lower 3 Sigma orbital. Four electrons go into the lower two pi orbitals. There are two electrons left and according to Hund's law they will each occupy independent pi orbitals with parallel spin. So both of these are unpaired.   TL;DR you are right. Orbital overlap makes new molecular orbitals. Wave particle duality explains orbitals in general, not just this example."

physicsgifs,38e5t5,GrethSC,21,Thu Jun 4 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the chemical reaction that generates the charge. I forget the actual reaction, but basically two dense materials (which don't bounce well) turn into a single sponge like substance that is more springy.  Do a little searching around YouTube on the subject. I'm pretty sure that's where I saw the explanation."
physicsgifs,38e5t5,WeeferMadness,7,Wed Jun 3 18:00:04 2015 UTC,It's the other way around. Spongy is soft and absorbs the shock. Hard is springy.
physicsgifs,38e5t5,MuckingFagical,2,Thu Jun 4 00:18:48 2015 UTC,So I'm guessing this doesn't work with rechargeables?
physicsgifs,38e5t5,WeeferMadness,2,Thu Jun 4 05:23:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried, but I would doubt it. Rechargeables don't work the same way as single use. I'm not an expert by any stretch but my understanding is that single use batteries get energy from converting one substance to another. Rechargeables act more like capacitors. The 'stuff' builds up at one end, and its transfer to the other end releases energy. Putting electricity back into the system moves the 'stuff' back to the original end. Fun fact - Discharge a rechargeable too far and you can send it into what's called reverse polarity, where it confuses the + and - poles. Basically, all the 'stuff' has moved and it doesn't know where to go back to. This is why if you drain a car battery all the way it won't come back, but if you only get it really close you can often just recharge it and carry on."
physicsgifs,38e5t5,Livingthepunlife,2,Thu Jun 4 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"Also, I think it's making the point that it bounces about the same when there is 50% life in it, as it does when it is dead. So the higher bounce doesn't mean it's dead."
physicsgifs,38e5t5,adrenalineadrenaline,-19,Thu Jun 4 04:42:24 2015 UTC,I'm no expert but it may have something to do with reactions taking place within the battery that release electrons and lower the weight. Or something along those lines.

It's a one-for-one deal, so your final weight is the same as your starting weight.  The difference is actually the structure of the material inside. A fully charged battery has two really dense chemical chunks inside. When you use up the battery, you're taking electrons from one of the chemical chunks and giving it to the other.  This results in both chemical chunks being less dense than before.  It's like dropping a steel ball versus dropping a steel spring. They weigh the same amount, but the physical structure is different."

Due to the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass, the battery cannot make or destroy electrons, just move them around.  This is how the battery does work.  Did I physics right?"

physicsgifs,37uut8,vipersfate,10,Sun May 31 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. Any object or material that's capable of deforming elastically (i.e. something that deforms when force is applied and undeforms when force is removed) can be modeled as a mass on a spring and analyzed in this way. In college I took a mechanical vibrations course from a guy who used to work on Ford's acoustics and vibrations research team, and apparently tuning the damping in shock absorbers is very important for rider comfort.   Ideally, a car's suspension would be tuned to perfect critical damping, because it returns the passengers to equilibrium as quickly as possible. In practice, however, avoiding an underdamped system is even more important, because it isn't comfortable to constantly bounce up and down. As the car is used and the suspension wears down, the damping ratio will slowly move towards the underdamped case, so the factory will actually tune your shocks into the overdamped region to delay the eventual slip into underdamping."

There may be a more proper way to explain this, but this is my intuitive understanding.    For a system to be stable σ must be < 0 or you could also say that all the poles must be in the left half of the s plane.    A critically damped system can be represented as  (s + 1)*(s + 1) = s2 + 2s + 1   so there are two poles at -1.  If the poles are moved apart while staying on the real axis, the system becomes underdamped  (s + 0.2679) * (s + 3.732) = s2 + 4s + 1  so it has poles at -0.2679 and -3.732  For oscillation to happen there must be complex poles.    (s + 0.5 + 0.866 i) * (s + 0.5 - 0.866 i) = s2 + s + 1  so it has poles at -0.5 +-0.866 i or -0.5 +-0.866 j if you prefer  Of course these are are all normalized transfer functions and they are all denominators since we are talking about poles.

physicsgifs,37tyq7,Media_Offline,6,Sat May 30 14:25:25 2015 UTC,They create a seal inside the barrel so more energy can build up behind the round for maximum propulsion.  The question I have is: what causes the parts to strip away at the right time?
physicsgifs,37tyq7,Kidifer,6,Sat May 30 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"Air resistance as soon as they leave the barrel.  While in the barrel, they are locked together.  You can see here that there are grooves cut into the penetrator, these match ridges in the sabot petals and while it is in the barrel, these parts are compressed together."
physicsgifs,37tyq7,Kidifer,1 point,Sat May 30 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify a little bit here, there seem to be two things that strip away in the animation. The first is the driving band, which is usually a band of copper alloy wrapped around the projectile for tanks to allow it to grip the rifling, allowing it to spin. The second is the sabot sleeve. There are actually two forces causing these to strip away. One, as stated previously, would be the air resistance. The muzzle velocity of a saboted armor piercing round seems to be around 5100 feet per second, so this air resistance is incredibly strong. The second force would be due to the rotation of the projectile. By comparison, small arms ammunition can leave the muzzle rotating at 180-300,000 rpm. So the rotation will also be a large factor in the sleeves/driving band flying away.  Ninja edit; The second article links to a round used in a smoothbore cannon, hence no driving band."
physicsgifs,37tyq7,Sempais_nutrients,3,Wed Jun 10 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"In this case however, it's a slipping driving band.  Translating the forward motion of the projectile into rotation robs it of velocity and therefore penetrating power, and since the projectile is fin stabilized, it has no need for gyroscopic stabilization.  From the wiki article you linked to:   Freely rotating bands can be used to reduce the spin imparted to the round as is preferable for HEAT warheads or fin-stabilised projectiles fired from general-purpose rifled barrels.   This is accurately shown in the animation where the driving band spins while the projectile and sabot does not."

physicsgifs,37tyq7,billyalt,4,Sat May 30 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Here is another video in super slow motion showing actual footage of the sabot petals stripping off.  To expand on why sabots are useful for armor piercing projectiles:   you want to shoot the projectile very fast, so inside the barrel you want maximum acceleration.  The sabot helps to achieve this by giving you a very large surface area perpendicular to the direction of travel which the propellant gasses can push on, for minimum weight since it is usually made from aluminum alloy or carbon fiber. outside the barrel, you want the opposite parameters - a heavy projectile with minimum frontal area, in order to retain its velocity as far downrange as possible and effectively penetrate armor.  This is why the sabot strips off, leaving the arrow-like penetrator usually made from a dense metal like tungsten or depleted uranium to make its way towards the target."

physicsgifs,37m1oa,HeyCarpy,3,Fri May 29 03:42:24 2015 UTC,"Operation Redwing:       Operation Redwing was a United States series of 17 nuclear test detonations from May to July 1956. They were conducted at Bikini and Enewetak atolls. The entire operation followed Project 56 and preceded Project 57. The primary intention was to test new, second-generation thermonuclear devices. Also tested were fission devices intended to be used as primaries for thermonuclear weapons, and small tactical weapons for air defense. Redwing demonstrated the first US airdrop of a deliverable hydrogen bomb - test Cherokee. Because the yields for many tests at Operation Castle in 1954 were dramatically higher than predictions, Redwing was conducted using an ""energy budget"" - there were limits to the total amount of energy released, and the amount of fission yield was also strictly controlled. Fission, primarily ""fast"" fission of the natural uranium tamper surrounding the fusion capsule, greatly increases the yield of thermonuclear devices, and contributes the vast majority of the fallout - fusion being a relatively clean reaction.

Castle Bravo was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the United States (and just under one-third the energy of the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful device ever detonated), with a yield of 15 megatons of TNT. That yield, far exceeding the expected yield of 4 to 8 megatons (6 Mt predicted),  combined with other factors, led to the most significant accidental radioactive contamination ever caused by the United States.

physicsgifs,37kpoy,thesilverblade,5,Thu May 28 09:52:29 2015 UTC,"When a magnet is positioned above a superconductor, the Meissner effect occurs and effectively locks the magnet in place. This allows frictionless (excluding drag) rotation around the magnetic field. More info about this phenomenon here.  In this particular scenario, the high temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 was cooled to 70*K with liqud nitrogen to allow the material to pass into its superconducting state. As a superconductor, it would exhibit the meissner effect on any magnet placed nearby. In the gif, the magnet falls off because the temperature rises to a point where the superconducting state is no longer possible."
physicsgifs,37kpoy,Jorisje,2,Thu May 28 09:57:36 2015 UTC,"The Meissner effect says that a superconductor generates currents to exactly oppose the incoming magnetic field. Essentially it expels all flux. Why does it then stick and not fall off?   That's because this is NOT the Meissner effect. YBCO is a type II superconductor and the effect demonstrated here is called Flux Pinning.   Type II superconductors let through some external flux into ""tubes"" called vortices. Creating more vortices or moving vortices costs a lot of energy, so moving the YBCO will generate currents that effectively ""screen"" this movement, thus locking (Pinning) the YBCO in place."
physicsgifs,37kpoy,argentcorvid,2,Thu May 28 18:13:54 2015 UTC,Is the formation of frost on the magnet at the same time the superconductor is placed just a coincidence? or is there some energy transfer going on there?

My guess is that because evaporation is part of the process and the chemicals at the top are evaporating faster than the submerged part, the crystals are forming at the top.  Probably at the point where surface tension meets solid surface.  The crystals appear to grow up, because the fluid is being wicked up to the top by the same evaporative process."

physicsgifs,36t3xh,Evil_Disco_Marmot,4,Fri May 22 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"High-altitude nuclear explosion:       High-altitude nuclear explosions (HANE) have historically been nuclear explosions which take place above altitudes of 30 km, still inside the Earth's atmosphere. Such explosions have been tests of nuclear weapons, used to determine the effects of the blast and radiation in the exoatmospheric environment. The highest was at an altitude of 540 km (335.5 mi).  The only nations to detonate nuclear weapons in outer space are the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. program began in 1958 with the Hardtack Teak and Hardtack Orange shots, both 3.8 megatons. These warheads were initially carried on Redstone rockets. Later tests were delivered by Thor missiles for Operation Fishbowl tests, and modified Lockheed X-17 missiles for the Argus tests. The purpose of the shots was to determine both feasibility of nuclear weapons as an anti-ballistic missile defense, as well as a means to defeat satellites and manned orbiting vehicles in space. High-altitude nuclear blasts produce significantly different effects. In the lower reaches of vacuous space, the resulting fireball grows much larger and faster than it does near the ground, and the radiation it emits travels much farther.    Image i - How the peak EMP on the ground varies with the weapon yield and burst altitude. Note that the yield here is the prompt gamma ray output measured in kilotons. This varies from 0.1-0.5% of the total weapon yield, depending on weapon design. The 1.4 Mt total yield 1962 Starfish test had an output of 0.1%, hence 1.4 kt of prompt gamma rays. (The blue 'pre-ionisation' curve applies where gamma and x-rays from the weapon's primary stage ionise the atmosphere, making it electrically conductive before the main pulse from the thermonuclear stage. The pre-ionisation can literally short out part of the final EMP.)     Interesting: Cyclotron radiation | Operation Dominic   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

physicsgifs,36t3xh,kipz0r,-1,Fri May 22 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not a scientist but I would say that the center is super depressurized right after the explosion.

A Thor rocket carrying a W49 thermonuclear warhead (manufactured by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory) and a Mk. 2 reentry vehicle was launched from Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean. The explosion took place 250 miles (400 km) above a point 19 miles (31 km) southwest of Johnston Island.

physicsgifs,35hx0g,Megadaman,9,Mon May 11 11:54:32 2015 UTC,Can someone tell me how this works??
physicsgifs,35hx0g,Based_JuiceBox,31,Sun May 10 16:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to make a slightly-educated guess that:  The high-pressure stream of air is pointed up at about a 45-degree angle at the top of the screwdriver, which creates a lateral push away from the nozzle. However, due to the shape of the screwdriver handle, the stream curls around and creates an opposing force, pushing the other side of the screwdriver handle back towards  the stream. The screwdriver is shaped like a bulb with convex faces, so some of this lateral push is actually translated into the upwards pushing, just because of the geometry of the handle.  These forces are not 100% synchronized (in others it's pushing/pulling/pushing), which is what leads to the oscillations that eventually knock the screwdriver out of position in the gif.   diagram for clairity  That's actually a simplification, because the stream will also be wrapping around the handle, not just over top of it, but the principles will same - air pressure exerting upward force against the convex surfaces of screwdriver handle sufficient to resist gravity. Imagine it like a cutaway or cross section, looking directly at the nozzle. You'd see something like  OTO  Where the ""O"" are streams of high pressure air, and the the ""T"" is the screwdriver. The wide top of the T encounters resistance as it is pulled down by gravity into the tops of the streams.  There's probably also a pressure effect (low pressure vortex at the bottom of  the stream), but I doubt that's strong enough to account for much of what's happening here. I would also guess they have to dial in a very specific pressure to allow this to occur - too little and it falls, too much and it just gets blown away.  Edit  So /u/NightHawk_DIY replicated this gif in high definition here, and confirmed two very important things:  1) There is little or no gyroscopic stabilization necessary for this effect. In other words, the screwdriver's stable position is due to the interaction of air currents!  2) You don't need a heavily grooved handle for the lift. The handle's rounded shape is all that is needed."
physicsgifs,35hx0g,zesty_zooplankton,4,Sun May 10 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"One of the first things I noticed, and something I haven't seen discussed in the reddit threads about this, is that since it seems to be spinning at a decent speed, wouldn't gyroscopic effects provide some stabilization against the lateral forces? Or is there not enough momentum to have any significant effect? I'm really bad at physics so I don't really know."
physicsgifs,35hx0g,enuma-elish,3,Sun May 10 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell how fast it was spinning (or even if it was spinning at all!), but the answer to your question is absolutely yes. If the screwdriver is spinning, then it there will be gyroscopic force acting to prevent any lateral kind of rotation around the vertical axis. In other words, the screwdriver's rotation makes it remain perfectly vertical. That force could be very strong if the rotation is fast."

physicsgifs,35hx0g,so-high-o,1 point,Mon May 11 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"I think you're more or less right. There's a lot of things at play here, and honestly I have a hard time wrapping my head around how the stream of air doesn't simply blow the screwdriver backward. You've got positive pressure on the front side, vacuum pressure on the backside - both of those things providing force in the same direction. What force is holding it toward the air nozzle? Gravity is accelerating it toward the ground, but that's exerted along a slightly different axis. I suppose the angle of the screwdriver might explain the discrepancy, but still, a very interesting bit of physics."
physicsgifs,35hx0g,NightHawk_DIY,1 point,Mon May 11 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's vacuum on the backside - that would pull it away from the nozzle - I think there's positive pressure (back towards the nozzle) from the vortex curling over/around the screwdriver. I do think you're right in that the angle is creating a horizontal force from gravity, which also helps counteract the push of the air on the nozzle side.  To prove any of this, you'd have to blow out a candle or hold something making really thick smoke up under the airstream with your (amazing!) slow motion camera, which would show what the air is doing."
physicsgifs,35hx0g,zesty_zooplankton,-1,Mon May 11 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"The screwdriver in the GIF has small ridges near the top of the handle, which provide lift. http://i.imgur.com/3sFnQx0.png"

physicsgifs,35hx0g,DuckyFreeman,1 point,Sun May 10 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"I don't believe this is real. It looks to be implying it's taking advantage of the Coanda Effect. We are used to seeing the coanda effect from a ping pong ball in a vertical stream of air. The ball hovers where it does because that is the point that the force of the air counteracts the force of gravity, and the coanda effect creates just enough lateral forces to keep the ball in the middle of the stream of air. The air from the air compressor hose in the gif would not be strong enough (even straight up) to support the screwdriver against the force of gravity, nor would the light lateral forces from the coanda effect be strong enough to keep the air from the compressor from simply blowing the screwdriver away."

The way I see this working is we can't see the string being held by an off camera person holding up the screwdriver.  I know! I know!  I haven't addressed the fact that the screwdriver falls at the end when the air flow stops.  Here is my explanation and it is on par with the person holding a string off camera to hold up the screwdriver.  But when the airflow stops the person lets go of the string and the screwdriver falls.  BAM!  Mind blowing!"

A simulation might be a 512 cube grid at the highest resolution, generally with at least two less-resolved grids outside the area of interest with a similar number of cells (representing a much larger physical area outside the primary scope of interest).  So using this simulation as an example, we would use a higher resolution grid mesh along the path of the ball and leave the top/bottom portion of the domain less resolved to save computation time (nothing interesting happens there anyway and you don't need high resolution to model the straight part of the spaghetti noodles)."

The fact that there is a lack of evidence where there should be evidence is evidence in and of itself.   People are simply believing his claim because it 'sounds' reasonable, not because logic is on his side. If I made the claim that I saw this clip shown on a documentary about viral videos that are staged, I would have to provide evidence, or my claim is as good as meaningless.   But this is irrelevant. There is only one angle of the video online. There is a claim that there 'used' to be a second angle, but no evidence of such a thing. Absolutely no one has made a claim of 'several' angles until 'dusthimself'.

physicsgifs,34pcri,steik,2,Mon May 4 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm a college student, not a teacher, but here's my explanation. The bat's center of mass was essentially moving along a vertical circular path, with the end on the ground as the fulcrum. This means it has rotational kinetic energy. There is some friction between the end of the bat and the ground, but mostly the rotational energy converts to gravitational potential energy (since the center of mass is getting farther from the ground). It just so happens that this time, the initial rotational kinetic energy and the final gravitational potential energy (along with whatever energy was not conserved) were about equal, so it stopped at the peak of its arch."

What we are watching is not only refraction, but also creation of a real image.   The index of refraction of water is ~1.33. All that means is that light is slowed down as compared to air which for all intents and purposes has the ""same"" index of refraction as a vacuum which is 1.00.   When light hits the water which has convex curvature the light bends towards the center of the curve(in this case there are two convex curves, the front and back of the cup). The light then is considered converging and therefore has a focal point.  We can say for sure that the arrows are at least at the focal point or further away. If they were closer the arrow would not be reversed by adding water because the light would not converge ""soon enough"" to create a real image."

Whether or not it's a virtual or real image depends on the position of the object relative to the lens' focal point, not the position the the glass relative to its own focal point.   I haven't worked with a 2 lens system in class, which is what I'm guessing a glass would be, but the lens equation is (1/S)+(1/S')=(1/F) with S being object distance, S' is the image distance, and F is the focal point. If I have my object at 12 cm from the lens and the focal point is 5 cm from the lens my image will be inverted clearly at 8.57 cm in front of the lens. Putting a screen anywhere but that point would make a blurry image."

physicsgifs,33js8o,dohru,4,Thu Apr 23 08:51:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but until someone well versed comes along I can try. We say that a double pendulum system exhibits chaotic behavior at certain energies. It's still deterministic meaning the present effects the future, but because it's chaotic we say the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. As with any chaotic system we can predict a good deal of its behavior so long as we know its initial conditions. Are the two components of equal mass and/or length? Is the mass equally distributed within both components? Is the motion of the pendulum in three dimensions or along a cartesian plane? Then depending on where we set the origin, typically it would be at the point of suspension of the first pendulum, we can calculate the center of mass of both pendulums which is sufficient information to write out the Lagrangian which is a function that summarizes the dynamics of a system such as this. Analysis can even go further in depth, but that's all beyond me. Hope this helps.

physicsgifs,33js8o,paholg,3,Fri Apr 24 20:41:53 2015 UTC,Can someone please explain why there appears to be much more energy in the pendulum than was put into it when it dropped?
physicsgifs,33js8o,Mixin_Up_Yer_Crayons,7,Thu Apr 23 06:01:23 2015 UTC,"There's a few things at play here.  First, the pendulum appears to be started with a push rather than dropped, so that will put more energy into the system than it perhaps seems like there should be.  Second, the lower the pendulum is, the less potential energy it has, so the faster it will go. When the first leg is low, there is enough energy for the second leg to move very quickly, especially if the first leg isn't moving very quickly. Some of the fastest movements of the second leg seem to happen when the first leg is near the bottom of its path.  Third, the second leg is smaller than the first leg. It is shorter and possibly thinner, and may be smaller in the hidden dimension as well. So, its mass and especially its moment of inertia will be a good deal lower than those of the first leg. Also, when the first leg slows down, the second leg slows down too, although it doesn't really seem like it. The second leg has two rotations going on, one that is centered at its end, and one that is due to the first leg rotating. All of this together means that small changes of speed for the first leg can have comparable energy to large changes in speed for the second leg. That is, when the first leg slows down just a little, there is enough energy for the second leg to speed up quite a bit."

You can model it on a computer, but building the model is not easy since there is so many variables.   Relative lengths and masses of the pendulums, starting angle of the main pendulum, starting angle of the lower pendulum relative to the other. Is it pushed or dropped at the start? This is the usual set of starting variables then you can start adding extra questions and issues.   Do you consider the air friction & friction at all the joints or do you do the maths in a physics perfect scenario where the joints are frictionless and in vacuum? Or just in vacuum? What if the joint have largely different friction coefficients?   What happens if you replace one of the rods with a flexible 'massless' inelastic string? What if it wasn't massless or inelastic?

I hear my boss on the radio running asking permission to come over, and he points at the imminent storm coming in, and we both pack up the banner as quick as possible getting back to the hangar just as the rain started to come in.  This is a Texas super cell thunderstorm.  If you have never experienced one, they are amazing.  The rain comes down sideways, the wind is gusting, and lightning is everywhere.  There isn't much to do, so we are all standing near the hangar door chatting away.  Then, someone noticed it.  A Cessna hadn't been tied down.  The wind was blowing it every which way, and it was hitting other, properly tied down planes.  My boss yells ""Shit"" while running out there to wrestle the plane.  The rest of us lazy fuckers just sit there watching, until I suggested we help him with his losing battle.  We are follow suit, yelling ""Shit"" as we run into the downpour.  There are 6 of us.  6 big guys.  Struggling to hold the plane in position while someone ties it down.  Even with all of us there, we couldn't do it.  We were forced to point it into the wind and use chalks to hold it in place.  The fucker who owned the plane left the next day without talking to anyone."

physicsgifs,339gxz,InfanticideAquifer,8,Mon Apr 20 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"Well....   No two surfaces are in contact, so there won't be any friction, strictly speaking. But there's still dissipation due to air resistance. It does eventually stop spinning."

physicsgifs,339gxz,InfanticideAquifer,6,Mon Apr 20 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"I... don't know if it'd spin forever. Maybe someone else around here does. The two options are ""yes, it spins forever"" or ""no, it loses angular momentum via electromagnetic radiation"" but I don't know which one is the case.   There are supercooled systems that do exhibit perpetual motion (current in a superconducting ring, e.g.) so neither answer would shock me. But I don't know which one is actually the case here.   Try /r/AskPhysics if no-one comes along more in the know."
physicsgifs,339gxz,Twystoff,7,Mon Apr 20 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"No, it would not.  It would very slowly lose angular momentum due to a variety of factors, all very small. EM radiation, quantum effects (like virtual particles), very small changes in gravity from nearby sources and even stellar sources.  Entropy affects everything, one way or another. That being said, with the right cooling system and a vacuum this could spin for a very long time, perhaps decades."

physicsgifs,3344x8,Coronal_Eclipse,40,Sun Apr 19 11:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sick and messed up on cough medicine, so I apologize for any inaccuracies.  This is an example of momentum. Momentum=mass*velocity (p=mv). As the ball falls, the hamster falls at the same velocity. The ball, which is much more massive than the hamster and thus has much more momentum, hits the ground and bounces. It impacts against the hamster and transfers a portion of its momentum into the rodent. Since the hamster can't gain momentum by gaining mass, it gets to become NASA's newest test pilot."
physicsgifs,3344x8,TommyWalker1237,5,Sun Apr 19 12:50:18 2015 UTC,"Why doesn't the ball just keep the momentum that was transferred to the animal? In other words, why does the animal bounce up at high speed instead of the ball just bouncing up a a slower speed?"
physicsgifs,3344x8,Poes-Lawyer,11,Sun Apr 19 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"The momentum gained by the animal will be the same as the momentum lost by the ball, but because the ball weighs so much more than the animal, the effect will be greater on the animal. In equation terms, both objects experience a change in momentum of dP:  dP = M_ball * dV_ball = M_hamster * dV_hamster M_hamster << M_ball, therefore dV_hamster >> dV_ball   Also, if you just bounced the ball by itself you might notice it bounce higher than it does in this gif."
physicsgifs,3344x8,Ziazan,8,Sun Apr 19 14:19:50 2015 UTC,"if he's asking you about this, he doesn't know what dP is, (double penetration), doesn't know what M stands for, doesn't know what dV is, (double vaginal),  good explanation otherwise."
physicsgifs,3344x8,TommyWalker1237,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks - my issue is that there are multiple solutions to the momentum conservation equation, one of which involves these two objects (animal and ball) remaining together and bouncing upward at a relatively slow speed, and the other solution involves some dP being imparted on the ball (it bounces up at a relatively slow speed) and the rest of the dP being imparted on the animal (which goes up at a relatively high velocity due to its small mass).  However, what I'm unsure of is why does the separation take place? It seems to be more of a function of the elastic nature of the ""collision"" that takes place between the animal and the ball. I put collision in quotes because it kind of works the opposite of a completely in elastic collision which would be two objects sticking together after they come together."
physicsgifs,3344x8,Poes-Lawyer,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"Consider each object in isolation.  The ball hits the ground at a velocity v and bounces back at -v. The collision speed is v.  The animal hits the ball also at a velocity of v, however it hits the ball when the ball is already travelling at -v (upwards). So the collision speed here is 2v. Since the masses are constant, an greater impact velocity gives a greater change in momentum, which in turn gives a greater final velocity.  So the differences in effective impact velocities between the two objects results in different final velocities, which gives the separation."
physicsgifs,3344x8,TommyWalker1237,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:42:17 2015 UTC,"I think this makes a lot more sense. Essentially, the bottom ball is going upward during the collision. It imparts a small amount of its instantaneous momentum (sacrificing velocity) to the animal, which results in a very large dv for the animal."
physicsgifs,3344x8,m_reid,9,Mon Apr 20 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"the ball DOES bounce up at a slower speed, but the change is negligible because of the difference in masses.  ball and hamster will exert equal and opposite forces on each other as they collide. if the ball is massive enough, that force won't perturb it much, but the hamster is going into orbit.  newton's 3rd law is a different kind of way to state conservation of momentum - force is the rate of change of momentum with respect to time."
physicsgifs,3344x8,TommyWalker1237,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"Excellent explanation. I teach physics, and this is how I introduce momentum as a concept. I was looking for a nice explanation for why the ball and animal separate after the bounce, and I think it has more to do with the elasticity of the ball than anything else."

The Float table is a matrix of ""magnetized"" wooden cubes that levitate with respect to one another. The repelling cubes are held in equilibrium by a system of tensile steel cables.  It's classical physics applied to modern design. Each handcrafted table is precisely tuned to seem rigid and stable, yet a touch reveals the secret to Float's dynamic character.

physicsgifs,32hai1,tmiw,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Even though they're supposed to I don't think anyone's actually ever compared the signatures here. They seem to be mostly in case someone disputes the charges later. And a lot of places have those digital signature pads so it's not really as much of a hassle for the merchants (other than having to buy enough storage to store those for a certain period of time).  Also supposedly chip is almost deprecated if not already according to Visa, so that's probably why they're not really bothering with PIN."
physicsgifs,32hai1,kyrsjo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:04:39 2015 UTC,"Sure, I've never seen anyone look at the signature either, but you still need to handle all those pieces of paper, alternatively have more complex equipment which is more likely to break (plus those digital pads are a hassle to use). Storage requirements are probably negligble today - you could store a LOT of 100x200-ish monochrome bitmaps in a few MB of flash, plus AFAIK these things tend to be on-line anyways...  What is the next step according to Visa? For the bank customer, the chip was really great as it was much less likely to break (practically never) or to have reading problems (practically never), and you are lots less likely to get skimmed. We've got the RFID stuff also, but AFAIK it is only used for small amounts and it will regularly prompt you to use the chip."

They hide your credit card number from retailers, and they use unique one-time codes that are useless to hackers and thieves. Banks hope these will become main payment methods in just a few years.

However, as long as you have a secure processor INSIDE the card, which can sign things using a private key which cannot leave the card, I don't really see the benefit.

physicsgifs,32hsy6,Kosmozoan,3,Mon Apr 13 22:26:03 2015 UTC,Where does the burnt air/oxygen go? Soot? What exactly is going away to cause the low pressure?
physicsgifs,32hsy6,digimer,5,Mon Apr 13 23:31:26 2015 UTC,"its an organic molecule reacting, so it depends on the extent to which the system burns. In essence the Oxygen reacts with the carbon in the wax to form either CO or CO2. Considering the oxygen is the limiting factor, I'd venture a guess that its mostly CO.  but this doesnt actually affect the pressure! you can see from the ideal gas law, PV=nRT, that the pressure is related to the number of moles not the number of atoms. So when the O2 (gas) and C (solid) becomes CO (gas) or CO2 (gas) the pressure either increases (in the former) or stays the same (in the latter).  The mechanism is heat based. you can see from the same equation that pressure is also directly related to the temperature. Think about how hot the gasses from the candle are compared to room temp. The candle heats up the air increasing the pressure. By the time you get the glass over it a lot of the air has left to balance the pressure. When the flame starts dying out the air cools down, and the pressure drops back down."
physicsgifs,32hsy6,OmniaMors,7,Tue Apr 14 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't know if it's heat based in the way you describe it, the water level starts rising before the flame goes out. Shouldn't the temperature rise when the candle is still burning, since the hot air can't go anywhere?"
physicsgifs,32hsy6,TheProverbial_Cheese,4,Tue Apr 14 10:34:01 2015 UTC,"OK, so the short answer is; ""Fire goes out, air cools, cool air is denser, thus the fluid is sucked up to make up the difference""?  Thanks for the answer!"

I'll show the derivation if people want it, but to a decent approximation, to keep from falling he needs to be travelling at v = (g*r/μ)0.5.  g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8m/s2 ), r is the radius of the loop, and μ is the coefficient of static friction between his bike tires and the wall.  Rubber and dry asphalt has a coefficient of 0.9, and that's probably about as good as we're going to get for that one.  I've estimated the radius of the loop to be 4.1m (about 27 feet across the whole thing).  You're welcome to try your own or I can show you how I got mine if you'd like, but it should be pretty decent.  Using these numbers, he has to travel a minimum of 6.8m/s, or about 15mph, which is definitely feasible."

In order for this to still remain feasible you would have to calculate the speed required to generate the centripetal acceleration such that the torque due to that acceleration and the angle the bike makes with the normal can counter act the torque due to gravity. You can determine this equation to be Velocity2 = gLcot(angle normal to wall). Now, assuming his center of mass (L) to be about a meter and the angle he makes with the wall is about 5 to 15 degrees means he has to travel from 20 mph to 13 mph. This agrees and solidifies the conclusion /u/ayitasaurus made; that this is actually quite a feasible feat.  Edit: Ok, I messed up and im sorry... mgLcos(angle)=mv2 L*sin(angle)/r . This change would mean the biker would have to be at a 41 degrees with respect to normal. Huh... This would actually mean he would need to go about twice as fast (30 mph) to be at the 15 degree angle it appears to be. That or I'm way off on my angle estimates.  Edit 2: This is not a different solution to /u/ayitasaurus. He only calculated the speed required to cancel all forces on the biker and did not calculate the speed required to cancel all the torques as well (torque due to gravity at the center of mass of the biker). This is an equally important addendum to his answer."
physicsgifs,326uyo,Brain-Crumbs,6,Sat Apr 11 05:53:46 2015 UTC,"The friction is what counteracts gravity.  Friction f =  μN  Normal force is equal to the centripetal force: N = mv2/r  Weight W = mg  Setting W = f gets you   mg =  μN =  μmv2/r  v = √(rg/μ)   Which is what /u/ayitasaurus got.  The trick is to realise that friction isn't pointing in the opposite direction of the bike's velocity (pure roll and all), but pointing up to counteract gravity."
physicsgifs,326uyo,Aliudnomen,5,Sat Apr 11 10:08:14 2015 UTC,"But friction works on the bottom of the wheels, whereas gravity works in the center of mass. That creates a torque that you have to take into account. I think that was what /u/Brain-Crumbs was trying to calculate."

physicsgifs,31v3g0,Usemarne,7,Wed Apr 8 12:20:43 2015 UTC,"Crookes radiometer:       The Crookes radiometer, also known as a light mill, consists of an airtight glass bulb, containing a partial vacuum. Inside are a set of vanes which are mounted on a spindle. The vanes rotate when exposed to light, with faster rotation for more intense light, providing a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity. The reason for the rotation was a cause of much scientific debate in the ten years following the invention of the device,   but in 1879 the currently accepted explanation for the rotation was published.  Today the device is mainly used in physics education as a demonstration of a heat engine run by light energy.

physicsgifs,31v3g0,clempho,23,Wed Apr 8 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"I have one of these that I put on my desk! The thing with a radiometer is that it is made to be a vacuum (and in some cases a near vacuum).  In the complete vacuum version, the photons bounce off of the white side, pushing the white side away from the light source.  In the near vacuum version (the one in the posted gif), the light heats up the dark side of the vane.  When the dark side heats up, an air temperature differential is created and air from around the white side of the vane is pushed to the dark side of the vane to attempt to achieve an equilibrium, but it doesnt.  The increased amount of air behind the dark side pushes the dark side forward.  This is called thermal creep or thermal transpiration.  Hope this helps!"

physicsgifs,31lmwb,sverdrupian,2,Mon Apr 6 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"Stokes drift:       For a pure wave motion in fluid dynamics, the Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.  More generally, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel, and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid at a fixed position. This nonlinear phenomenon is named after George Gabriel Stokes, who derived expressions for this drift in his 1847 study of water waves.  The Stokes drift is the difference in end positions, after a predefined amount of time (usually one wave period), as derived from a description in the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates. The end position in the Lagrangian description is obtained by following a specific fluid parcel during the time interval. The corresponding end position in the Eulerian description is obtained by integrating the flow velocity at a fixed position—equal to the initial position in the Lagrangian description—during the same time interval.

physicsgifs,31i0en,fernando_69,2,Tue Apr 7 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"Partly. The uncertainty principle states that there is a finite limit to which you can know both the position and momentum of a particle such that  Δx Δp >=ħ/2. So when you force a particle into a tiny gap, such as a thin slit shown in the gif, you are obtaining a very small value for Δx (the error in its position). However, due to the uncertainty principle, this means Δp (the error in its momentum) has to a sufficiently large value. Momentum itself is actually a vector and so not only does it have a magnitude, it also has a direction. This means that the particle forced through a thin slit is also forced to spread out in direction and hence you get a large Δp. The particle will then interfere and produce the famous diffraction pattern."

The lady's inertia would keep it moving around if she had a large enough tangential velocity, and it's the inertia which causes the ""centrifugal"" force. Saying centrifugal is arguably more correct (even though it's a fictitious force) than saying centripetal, because centripetal is in the wrong direction."
physicsgifs,31dlkj,sleepisafunnything,3,Sat Apr 4 08:01:21 2015 UTC,What force acts on the hammock pointing radially inward? Shouldn't the hammock be the source of Fcp on the girl? And the girl exerts Fcf on the hammock as a result.
physicsgifs,31dlkj,bfuller181,0,Sat Apr 4 12:49:28 2015 UTC,Tension from the support chain is Fcp.

physicsgifs,31dlkj,4-Aco-DiMiTri,5,Sat Apr 4 11:42:22 2015 UTC,"She doesn't feel anything pulling her out of the circle - she only feels the reaction of the hammock pushing her back in. if the hammock wasn't there, she wouldn't fly radially outward, she'd fly on a path tangent to the rotation. The thing keeping her in the hammock is her own inertia. She falls out because she's not moving fast enough to maintain the necessary acceleration."

physicsgifs,31dlkj,lancerevo98,3,Sat Apr 4 06:19:49 2015 UTC,Your teacher is very wrong. Centrifugal force and centripetal force are completely different concepts. Centripetal force is the name for the force which is causing the circular motion. Centrifugal force is the outwards force felt in a rotating reference frame.

physicsgifs,31b6tv,jpeg1992,5,Fri Apr 3 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Info below is from the OP of the original post, which you can find here. I'm just quoting.    For more information, check out the video  Another Stanford video over this experiment.   This experiment on dancing droplets is a very interesting demonstration of fluid dynamics and chemical properties of liquids. Feel free to x-post this to /r/physicsgifs if you want. The reason why this type of motion is observed is somewhat complex but I'll try to explain. These droplets are composed of propylene glycol (an ingredient in food coloring from what I have read) and water. A difference between the surface tension of the liquids themselves and the vapor surrounding them is enough to cause the droplets to be drawn to each other, as they exert a force on one another. So you have one droplet with a vapor that attracts the other, and another droplet exhibiting the same thing just in a different direction, creating a shifting imbalance in tension between the droplets.  Depending on how you arrange them you can see them move differently based on the force of them pulling on each other due to the vapor/liquid surface tension difference"
physicsgifs,31b6tv,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"Surface tension:       Surface tension is the elastic tendency of liquids which makes them acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension is an important property that markedly influences the ecosystem. Surface tension is exposed, for example, any time an object or insect (e.g. water striders) that is denser than water is able to float or run along the water surface.  At liquid-air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of water molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion). The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes water to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other, water has a high surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 °C) compared to that of most other liquids. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.  Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent—but when referring to energy per unit of area, people use the term surface energy—which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids.

physicsgifs,30ub70,Aliudnomen,3,Mon Mar 30 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"Explanation:  The ball is struck by the cue at an angle, and slightly off to the right of the center. This imparts a translational velocity to the ball, as well as a rotational velocity with two components. If the +x direction is to the right and the +y is up (z thus pointing out of the screen), the velocity of the point of the ball that makes contact with the table is:   vc = v + ω X R = (vx - Rωy)ex + (vy + Rωx)ey   R being the radial vector pointing from the center to the contact point. This causes the contact point to move in a direction that is different from the translational direction. As a result, the friction on the ball actually points slightly in the -y direction, causing the curve visible in the video.  Interestingly, the force of friction on the contact point is quite large; the acceleration of the point turns out to be   ac = -7/2 μkg evc   Because of this, the contact point quickly stops moving with respect to the ground, causing the ball to switch to a pure rolling motion - visible in the video just after it passes the top of the curve, where it continues in a straight line.  A few friends and I made a simple model in Matlab that shows the effect of changing the angle under which you strike the ball and of hitting it more/less off-center. Fun stuff."

physicsgifs,2zs1i5,SuperSeriousUserName,0,Sat Mar 21 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"right, it gets tricky around these parts because it is the limitations of our mouth noises and their associated symbols which are discussing themselves.   Ones philosophy can only manifest itself in ones language because it is the meanings behind the words that are the true definition. Every language has different words for different meanings. It seems to be that if there is not a word for something, it does not exist in the collective mentality of a culture. Therefore by learning the language, one inherently learns the philosophy as well.   I have failed to communicate this understanding I have in my head to you, seemingly in demonstration of this linguistic limitation.   The concept seems to make sense to me but might not for anyone else, and thats precisely the point I am trying to make regarding the study of language being related to the study of philosophy."

We don't know what made the guy want to kick a car. It could have been anything.    If you're riding a motorcycle and someone is being reckless around you or ignoring the fact that you're even there, just move. Same as if you were in a car around a reckless driver. You want to get away from them ASAP. Slow down a little and let them pass, move away from you, or takean exit ramp and then get back on the road. Don't stay near drivers like that."

At speed you don't turn the front wheel to make turns. You lean into the turn. If you absolutely want to lean very low and very fast you actually turn the wheel, but in the opposite direction, just for a split. This is some physics stuff. That said, you do not want to take any chances on forces that would sway you sideways. Back to the jesting thing. That one with the horses and the sticks and middleevilages. What you do is that you hold on to the steer real tight, lean back so you're almost horizonal, have some bend to your elbows so you can embrace the hit if there is any, and kind of put both of your legs up, the right one is just far balance, aim at the farthest edge of the mirror with your heel, and throttle it. Going faster somehow feels lighter. The mirrors bend or snap quite easily. I think they are supposed to do that so they don't harm peoples.  Tip: only do this if somebody's been really reckless. It's ok to destroy peoples mirrors if they are not using them anyways. Not driving safely can cost lives, and pain and hurt to the ones that are left behind. A mirror is a cheap wake-up call.  Cars should really have their owners faces and names painted on them. Youtube comments sometimes seem less cancerous than the roads."

Believe me my day job is (arguably) mathematics. My explanation to this statement is that mathematics are meant to be used, not just to be learned. Of course, you need fundamentals to learn Physics, I agree. But my point is, Mathematics should be taught side by side by Physics. For example, a simple trigonometry can be taught inside a physics class by calculating a trajectory alongside with laws of gravity. In this way, students will truly understand the importance of Mathematics and Physics. To be honest, most of the common people will never going fully comprehend the importance of trigonometry, geometry or calculus. They believe that its pointless to learn these things because they don't see themselves using it. They see mathematics as something you just need to learn in order to pass some exam.   Also, I believe the problem is that the school system focus more on those subjects more than physics. I believe that if the system concentrate more on physics, these stupid accident will be decreased."

More information: The radius and mass of the rolling object (and the sliding object) do not affect its acceleration.   The rolling objects roll at different speeds because they have different amounts of rotational inertia. The cylindrical shell has the most rotational inertia because all of its mass is concentrated as far away from its axis of rotation as possible. The solid sphere has the least rotational inertia, as its mass is concentrated as near to the axis of rotation as possible."

physicsgifs,2z195r,dustinechos,27,Sat Mar 14 21:07:12 2015 UTC,The cube is modeled without friction. The other one's must have friction because they are rolling and not slipping. If all of them had zero friction they would all hit the bottom at the same time because the circles would all just slide the same.

The reason the cube hits the bottom first is because of the fact that it doesn't rotate. The kinetic energy obtained from the inclined plane doesn't need to be converted to rotational energy. It just slides down the hill. With the spheres and cylinders, they have to utilize some of this kinetic energy on actually rotating the damn thing to go down hill."

An ice cube (or dry ice puck) can slide down an incline with nearly no effect from friction while a round object would roll without slipping down the same incline. That is what I was going for here (even made the cube blue to look a bit like ice). As a matter of fact, I made the original with just the rolling objects and another physics teacher suggested I add in an object sliding without friction as a comparison, which I thought was a good idea."

The only thing I would add is it is not the vacuum that keeps the water in the tank, but the difference between the vacuum and the atmospheric pressure the surface of the water is exposed to. This difference in pressure creates a net force on the cube of water which counteracts the force of gravity trying to pull that water down out of the tank.   TL;DR The vacuum doesn't pull or suck the water up, the atmosphere on the exposed surface actually pushes the water and holds it in the tank. The vacuum is necessary though.   Edit: typo"

Vortices are the worst when a plane is slow and heavy, such as during takeoff. They are very dangerous because they can be powerful enough to flip a smaller aircraft.

My example:  I am a boom on the KC-10, a modified DC-10 with a takeoff weight of around 350,000 lbs for most training flights. We regularly practice formation takeoffs with 2-4 jets. After all the jets are in the air (lets say 3) and 4-5 miles apart, we generally turn right towards less crowded airspace. In that turn, we do what's called a visual cutoff where jets two and three turn early and more shallow than lead so that after a 90 degree turn, all three jets are lined up and 1 mile apart. On this day, we were #2 and in the visual cutoff. The pilot shot just a bit wide, and just below lead. As we crossed behind lead a mile back, the pilot warned us ""here comes his wake..."" Seconds later the plane rolls hard to the right, about 30 degrees, and the autopilot immediately gives up and disconnects. We hear all of the relays clicking and clacking and the lights start flashing as the plane hands control back to the pilots. He held the yoke hard left and put some rudder in to stay coordinated, and we came out just fine. But you can imagine what something capable of tossing 350,000 lbs of aluminum could do to a Cessna. Wake turbulence is no joke."

physicsgifs,2x8x0e,jook11,5,Thu Feb 26 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"Induction furnace:       An induction furnace is an electrical furnace in which the heat is applied by induction heating of metal. The advantage of the induction furnace is a clean, energy-efficient and well-controllable melting process compared to most other means of metal melting. Most modern foundries use this type of furnace and now also more iron foundries are replacing cupolas with induction furnaces to melt cast iron, as the former emit lots of dust and other pollutants.  Induction furnace capacities range from less than one kilogram to one hundred tonnes capacity and are used to melt iron and steel, copper, aluminium and precious metals. Since no arc or combustion is used, the temperature of the material is no higher than required to melt it; this can prevent loss of valuable alloying elements.  The one major drawback to induction furnace usage in a foundry is the lack of refining capacity; charge materials must be clean of oxidation products and of a known composition and some alloying elements may be lost due to oxidation (and must be re-added to the melt).

Different patterns emerge in the excitatory medium depending on the geometry of the plate and the driving frequency.

If the frame rate is 30 fps and the ring spins 30 times/s, then it would appear still.  If it spins at 31, 61, 91 ect. times/s, it will appear to spin 1x per second as those are ""aliases"" of 1 times/second."

The first part is sliding relatively slowly, and after around a half meter of snow goes off the edge, the sheet is under too much tension and a piece breaks off. Then, as it moves faster off the edge, it can go further without reaching the same angle that needs to be reached for the snow to break into another piece.  For example, say the first blocks of snow fall .5 meters in .2 seconds, before breaking. In that time, the snow has moved horizontally .5 meters. Towards the end, the snow falls the same .5 meters in .2 seconds, but since its moving faster horizontally, it was able to move a full 1 meter horizontally before breaking.   Thats my guess."

physicsgifs,2uzvvy,manrubc,24,Fri Feb 6 19:45:05 2015 UTC,there are magnets attached to the head of the screw. the battery provides an emf across its terminals and drives a current through the 'load' (wire + magnets + screw). magnetic field due to magnets and magnetized screw causes the electrons flowing thru the magnet surface perpendicular to the screw to spiral along the magnetic field lines (roughly parallel to the screw) and this induces the rotation of the screw.  it's called a homopolar motor
physicsgifs,2uzvvy,oldrinb,6,Fri Feb 6 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"Homopolar motor:       A homopolar motor is a direct current electric motor with two magnetic poles, the conductors of which always cut unidirectional lines of magnetic flux by rotating a conductor around a fixed axis that is parallel to the magnetic field. The resulting EMF (Electromotive Force) being continuous in one direction, the homopolar motor needs no commutator but still requires slip rings.  The name homopolar indicates that the electrical polarity of the conductor and the magnetic field poles do not change (i.e., that it does not require commutation).    Image i - DIY simple homopolar motor made with a drywall screw, a battery cell, a wire, and a disk magnet. The magnet is on top of the screw head. The screw and magnet make contact with the bottom of the battery cell and are held together by the magnet's attraction. The screw and magnet spin, with the screw tip acting as a bearing.

It will travel perpendicular to the direction of charge and magnetic field. So as the current flows from the negative pole of the battery, down the screw, and into the magnets, the Lorentz force causes the magnets to want to move perpendicularly, making them spin."

But as the distance between them increases, the energy stored by the gluon field, the field that governs interactions between quarks, increases. Eventually, there will be enough energy for the field to create a new quark/antiquark pair, say C and D, between the original A and B. So you managed to separate A from B, but now A is bonded to C and B to D. If you try the same thing again, you get the same result and just produce more and more quarks.   So you can never have a quark all by itself alone. Because when that's close to happening, the gluon field will have so much energy it can just create quarks out of thin air and make sure that doesn't happen."

Statistically this was shown to not be a random occurence. The lower part is showing the difference between the data points and the background, the larger that part the more it is ""likely"" to be a Higgs boson. The numbers at the top are just an indication of how much data data was collected and the energy of the collisions (the squareroot number). The blue line is simulated data with no Higgs present and the red line is one where a Higgs boson is included with a mass of 126.8. Does this help? I can try and explain it more thoroughly if you have any more questions.   Basically what is being shown is a histogram, where the x-axis is the mass of the measured particles (in this case two combined photons)."
physicsgifs,2uutz9,pizzabeer,8,Thu Feb 5 10:24:20 2015 UTC,"When you say ""the combined mass of two photons"" do you mean the inferred mass of the particle that created those two photons when it decayed (by measuring their energy)?"
physicsgifs,2uutz9,LazinCajun,7,Thu Feb 5 17:20:41 2015 UTC,Yes.  By measuring the energy and momentum vectors of the photons you can reconstruct the mass of whatever created them.

physicsgifs,2uutz9,Fmeson,-1,Sun Mar 29 17:22:43 2015 UTC,Photons have mass now?
physicsgifs,2uutz9,SirJeff,8,Fri Feb 6 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"LordVimes did a great job, but I thought I could clarify some points. Based on already known physics, people can predict the probability of two photons being created (and detected after applying all sorts of selection criteria) in a proton proton collision at the LHC as a function of their combined energy. That is what the blue line represents. Its the background of all the stuff going on and is just a bunch o noise essentially.  Now, what happens if in addition to all this noise, you thrown in a particle of mass m that also occasionally decays to two photons? Well, those two photons ill have all the energy and momentum of the particle do to conservation of momentum and energy, right? That means that the photons will have the same energy as the particle had mass (assuming the particle wasn't moving with respect to the detector). So you would see a bump in the distribution of the combined energy of the photons around the mass of the particle. In this case, we see a bump at 125 GeV indicating there is some particle that decays to two photons with 125 GeV mass (GeV is a unit of energy, but why convert to mass? eV are a convenient unit to use).  Of course, fake bumps occur all the time, but they will eventually go away with better statistics, so its important that we ensure the bump is statistically significant by gathering enough data and seeing a large enough bump that it shouldn't occur by chance. Of course, you then also wait for another experiment to see the same thing (ATLAS and CMS). Unfortunately, because the event is pretty rare (produce a Higgs that decays to two photons), and you need a lot of the event, it takes a very large amount of data to detect."

physicsgifs,2ulu40,jamesbrowski,62,Tue Feb 3 06:14:25 2015 UTC,Correct. There's no reason for it to come out of the bottle because the force creating the pressure which was forcing it out of the bottle in the first place (gravity) is moving it downward at the same rate as the bottle.

physicsgifs,2ulu40,Napster449,8,Tue Feb 3 07:27:11 2015 UTC,"One way of looking at it is that the gravitational force exerted on an object increases with mass at the same rate the object's inertia increases with mass (inertia being an objects resistance to acceleration, in this case gravitational acceleration). So as gravity pulls harder, the object ""digs its heels in"" to match it.  If you actually look at the equation this has the effect of the mass term cancelling out, in other words being irrelevant."

physicsgifs,2ulu40,jackfrostbyte,5,Tue Feb 3 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"actually depending on the geometry it would spout out again, but not due to gravity, but still because of a pressure differential, a fluid, in this case air, rushing past an opening, creates a suction effect, also known as the venturi effect, pulling the water out, same as in an aspirator.   tho I think what is more likely is that the air would rush into the hole, pushing the water out at the top... but that would change the center of gravity...so the bottle would turn over, also as the bottle loses water it gets lighter while maintaining the same shape, thus lowering its terminal velocity over time. the longer I think of it the more complex this problem gets.   I guess it really depends on the geometry in the end, how many holes are there and what is their orientation towards one another and the bottle...."
physicsgifs,2ulu40,Admiral_Cuntfart,2,Sun Feb 8 12:32:32 2015 UTC,"My hypothesis is it would spout out again, but appear to pour upwards, in relation to the bottle, because of lower terminal velocity once out of the bottle.  While in the bottle, there is no air resistance on the water, just the bottle, so there is no terminal velocity on the water in the bottle."

For near earth conditions of relatively small objects (compared to the mass of the earth) we can write Fgrav = m*g, where g is the local acceleration due to gravity.  Force in general is written as F=m*a, we typically get motion equations by setting a specific force equal to the ""general"" m*a and then finding acceleration this way (I'm not sure how much calculus you know, but given the acceleration and the velocity and position at some time  you can find the position at any time).    A quick glance shows we can write  Fgrav=mg  ma=mg  a=g  So acceleration of an object due to gravity is independent of its mass."

physicsgifs,2ulu40,boringoldcookie,1 point,Tue Feb 3 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"It's not any specific equation, it's just recognizing that acceleration is the second time derivative of position.  For constant acceleration this is probably the normal kinematic acceleration you've seen before:  Set d2x/dt2 = a  Integrate with respect to time:  dx/dt = a*t + C1.  Recognize that C here represents the initial velocity (notice dx/dt, which is velocity, equals C when t=0).  Rearranged:  dx/dt = vo + a*t  Integrate with respect to time:  x = vo*t + 1/2(a*t2) + C2.  Notice again that when t=0 you get x=x2, so C2 is just position at time t=0:  x= xo + vo*t + 1/2a*t2   Note that acceleration is the change in velocity with respect to the change in time and therefore is the change-in-change-in-position w.r.t time, this technique of integrating  m*d2x/dt2 = Force will always be a technique we can (and will) use in general.   A really brief other example might be if you wanted the motion equation of a spring instead.  For a spring, the force felt on the spring is equal to F=-kx, where k is some constant and x is the current position of the spring.  You can derive the equation for motion of a spring at any time by just saying   m*d2x/dt2 = -kx  d2x/dt2 = -(k/m)x  Integrating this ends up giving you  x = C1Cos(Sqrt(k/m)t) + C2Sin(Sqrt(k/m)t).  Don't worry if you don't know how to get that, just note that if you take the derivative of both sides of that equation twice you'll end up with what we started with, which proves it's correct up to a constant shift.   Now note c1 and c2 there will just correspond to the two initial conditions of the spring."
physicsgifs,2ulu40,_TheRooseIsLoose_,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:57:54 2015 UTC,"not exactly a direct answer to 'why', but one answer is that the two objects both follow the law of gravity. one description that we've made related to this law is:  d = t*(vi+0.5*a*t)   or more commonly  d = vi*t + 0.5*a*t^2   which says that for any object subject to an acceleration 'a' and an initial velocity 'vi', the distance 'd' it travels at a given time 't' is equal to the right hand side of the above equation. youll notice that weight does not show up  the bottle and the water in it are both two objects that are subject to the same acceleration (gravity) starting at rest (initial velocity=0), so their distance profile with respect to time, or trajectory, is the same.  edited as below"

physicsgifs,2ulu40,HowDoYouTurnThis0n,3,Sat Feb 14 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"*QUESTION* Is this really pressure at work? The water leaves the bottle and immediately begins falling downward. The bottle follows suit when dropped. Thus water that leaves the bottle at the same time the bottle is dropped hits the ground at the same time as the bottle, as you can see in the video. BAM just proved gravity. We postulate that the water in the bottle is falling just as fast as the bottle and therefore cannot escape.  What's confusing us is atmospheric pressure. Does accelerating at 9.8 m/s2 negate atmospheric pressure?"
physicsgifs,2ulu40,OmniaMors,15,Thu Jul 2 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"The water inside the bottle is pushed out of the bottle due to the weight of the water above the cut/hole.  When it's in freefall it doesn't feel gravity and therefore the water at the top of the bottle exerts no downward force on the water under it and the water is not forced out of the bottle.  I don't think you need to really consider atmospheric pressure in this case.  It's pushing on the bottle equally from all directions so if you're thinking it's pushing the water back through the hole or something, consider that atmospheric pressure is also pushing on the rest of the bottle with the same force."
physicsgifs,2ulu40,6576125,3,Tue Feb 3 06:16:34 2015 UTC,"If there was an additional source of pressure inside the bottle when in free-fall (i.e. something besides the weight of the water, say, a gas expansion for example), water would still flow out of the hole. In a simple model where the water jet is perfectly horizontal, when in free-fall, the water expelled and the bottle would both fall at the same time. Also, the bottle would move horizontally in the opposite direction to the water flow due to conservation of momentum."

After the Rayleigh scattering the state of material remains unchanged, hence Rayleigh scattering is also said to be a parametric process. The particles may be individual atoms or molecules. It can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids, but is most prominently seen in gases. Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles. The oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, causing them to move at the same frequency. The particle therefore becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light.

Same thing happens at the surface of a still pond.   The differences in refractive indexes of water and air cause light to reflect, giving you a refection on the surface.  Look too steeply into the water, and you see into the water and not a reflection.  This is because you exceeded the critical angle and went from reflection to refraction.

Because parts of the core closer to the fiber axis have a higher refractive index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber. The most common refractive index profile for a graded-index fiber is very nearly parabolic. The parabolic profile results in continual refocusing of the rays in the core, and minimizes modal dispersion.  Multi-mode optical fiber can be built with either graded index or step index. The advantage of the graded index compared to step index is the considerable decrease in modal dispersion.

physicsgifs,2sxz5o,Bigetto,2,Mon Jan 19 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"I don't have a resource but I can try to give you a general idea.  The water droplets can act as a microscope (ie as a lens) because diffraction, which is basically any phenomenon caused by a wave (such as light) encounters an obstacle.  The spherical surface of the water droplet acts as such an obstacle. It would take a long time to describe everything in complete detail (there are full courses around diffraction) but the basic idea is that when light hits the curved surface it is refracted in many directions, thus spreading out the beam of light, just like a lens   The bacteria in the dirty water also act as obstacles, and are also magnified in the same way.  Also, due to the wave nature of light, rays of light that intersect each other interfere, causing rings of constructive and destructive interference. These can be seen around each moving microorganism, and look similar to the image shown here"

Around 65 species of Demodex are known.  Two species living on humans have been identified: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis, both frequently referred to as eyelash mites. Demodex canis lives on the domestic dog. Infestation with Demodex is common and usually does not cause any symptoms, although occasionally some skin diseases can be caused by the mites. 'Demodex' is derived from Greek 'dēmos' fat + 'dēx', a wood worm.

Explanation of article  Blue field entoptic phenomenon:       The dots are white blood cells moving in the capillaries in front of the retina of the eye.  Blue light (optimal wavelength: 430 nm) is absorbed by the red blood cells that fill the capillaries. The eye and brain ""edit out"" the shadow lines of the capillaries, partially by dark adaptation of the photoreceptors lying beneath the capillaries. The white blood cells, which are much rarer than the red ones and do not absorb blue light, create gaps in the blood column, and these gaps appear as bright dots. The gaps are elongated because a spherical leukocyte is too wide for the capillary. Red blood cells pile up behind the leukocyte, showing up like a dark tail.  This behavior of the blood cells in the capillaries of the retina has been observed directly in human subjects by adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, a real time imaging technique for examining retinal blood flow.

And even when it becomes known that a theory doesn't describe nature precisely, it can still be very useful. For example, classical mechanics has definitely been 'busted' multiple times and is still used everyday to construct large bridges, cars and airplanes. Nothing wrong with that."

Theory is a collection of facts and techniques that help explain and predict the behavior of a particular phenomena.  So we have ""electromagnetic theory"", ""theory of relativity"", ""chaos theory"", etc.  by the time we call something a theory it's pretty well established and understood.  What laymen call a theory (i.e. ""I have a theory"") is actually what we call a hypothesis.  Science is more than just theory though - it's also experiment and observation.  The theory can be a bad interpretation of observations, but the observations are often indisputible.  For instance, we observe that masses attract, but we theorize at what rate they attract for a given set of masses.    In fact, that's what separates philosophy from science.  Philosophy can't go to experiment to verify their interpretations.  So I would say philosophy is just theory - science is verified theory."

physicsgifs,2rjzi7,Peterb77,30,Tue Jan 6 21:19:42 2015 UTC,Here is a paper that was written about Hurricane Balls.  I don't  have the knowledge to understand it but maybe someone can interpret.
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,bentfork,28,Tue Jan 6 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"They roll like two little wheels on an axle.   But rather than going straight forward, they're making a tight turn.  The turn is so tight that one wheel has lifted off the ground.  Knowing this, you can figure out how it works, and also use it for a simple magic trick (below.)  The motion is gravity-powered, since the lifted-up wheel is trying to fall back down.  But when it tries to fall, instead it just makes the entire thing spin faster.  That's the weird and counter-intuitive part.  It's a rotating spinning gyroscope that's tilted.  So, if it tries to lay down horizontally, that just speeds it up again, which keeps it from laying down horizontally.  The end result: friction doesn't make it slow down, instead friction makes the ""upper"" wheel slowly tilt down to the surface.  (Does the whole thing speed up as this happens?  I don't know.)  We can see the slow tilt if there's an overhead light bulb reflected in the two balls.   The high RPMs make the reflection look like a little circle.  But there are two little circles, one reflected from each ball.  Since one ball is lifted up, its circle hovers above the other circle.    Watch closely and the two circles slowly come together as the upper ball slowly tilts down.  When the circles touch, it means that the upper ball has just touched the table, and the whole thing suddenly drags to a stop.   With practice you can secretly watch those circles, then magically wave your hand at just the right time, and it looks like you commanded them to halt.    Also, if you have a couple of neo supermagnet balls, you can throw them at each other across a wooden tabletop, and half the time they automatically produce the ""hurricane"" effect.  Hold a big hunk of aluminum or copper just over them, and the induced electric currents will drag them quickly to a stop.  No copper slab available?  Try a stack of quarters."

physicsgifs,2rjzi7,MrBody42,7,Wed Jan 7 04:43:22 2015 UTC,How relevant that a useful xkcd bot turns up in a discussion about the legitimacy of the gfycat bot to give actual proof of their worth.
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,PublicSealedClass,6,Wed Jan 7 07:43:05 2015 UTC,That bot converts enormous gifs into tiny html5 files. It's not spam.
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,pjwork,3,Wed Jan 7 03:41:04 2015 UTC,is that lubricant you're putting on them? and then you blow air at them through a straw?  Man you've got me stumped..
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,TacoRedneck,14,Tue Jan 6 21:32:25 2015 UTC,"Glue them together, then blow on them with a straw. Then they spin crazy fast, like a hurricane."
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,ahabswhale,16,Tue Jan 6 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"exactly, and you can get them up to REALLY high RPMs. What's strange to me is that one is always elevated.    Both aren't in contact with the surface at the same time..."
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,Fliffs,5,Tue Jan 6 21:37:54 2015 UTC,I need this in my life. Where'd you get the balls from?
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,atsigns,11,Tue Jan 6 21:39:51 2015 UTC,Sauce the ball bearing we're less than a $1 at the hardware store and making them took under a minute.    So easy and incredibly fun to play with
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,TremorAcePV,5,Tue Jan 6 21:42:36 2015 UTC,Just bearings?! Not magnets?
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,thegreybush,6,Tue Jan 6 22:34:06 2015 UTC,I guess you could but it wouldn't make a difference. There is nothing magnetic affecting the bearings in op's gif.
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,Revolvyerom,3,Tue Jan 6 23:09:52 2015 UTC,"Without looking at the paper, it seems likely that it's important to freeze any degrees of freedom between the two bearings. You'd probably still have to glue magnets."
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,SCGuenter,7,Wed Jan 7 00:46:08 2015 UTC,Doing this with magnets is kind of scary because they still get to ridiculous speeds but then split apart and fly at the same ridiculous speeds
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,jook11,9,Wed Jan 7 00:58:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they'd have to hit ludicrous speed for that to happen.
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,Fatal_Da_Beast,2,Wed Jan 7 05:06:40 2015 UTC,"True, but I would see using magnets as giving more utility to the thing.  Like, glue two magnets together (on top of their own magnetic forces pulling them together), then get them spinning as fast as possible.  Then, use metal things to interact with the spinning magnetic death spiral without actually touching said spinning magnetic death spiral.  It sounds cool, but also sounds like the scientific version of ""Hey, hold my beer and watch this.""  Edit: So... corollary thought to that: Hurricane Ball Battle Dome. Get two sets of magnetic hurricane balls spinning very fast away from each other, then get them closer together using the magnetic forces with a small piece of metal. Their own magnetic forces may or may not pull them together and they will duke it out.   10/10 chance one will split off (the super glue can only be so good), but the magnetic forces should help keep them together regardless, or at least slow them down when they go flying off (these are tiny balls, after all, not much mass we are dealing with here). Still, I wouldn't want to be near that thing when it starts, myself.  TL;DR: Shit can get crazy when you combine this interesting ""hurricane"" phenomenon, super glue, magnets, and human curiosity/stupidity."

physicsgifs,2rjzi7,shupack,2,Wed Jan 7 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"I almost passed out from blowing on them. Canned air worked pretty well too! Just be careful, the superglue might break loose if you get them too fast. And then you've got two bullets..."
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,tehyosh,0,Wed Jan 7 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"I think this video can kind of explain what is happening to the two balls. In this example, they are using a tube. The balls may have an additional axis to rotate on because they are round, but I am not entirely sure.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQTVcaA3PQw"
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,autowikibot,-9,Fri Jan 9 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"Edit: just realize how rude this came off as, my bad.  i dont understand what you dont understand? you blow on an edge causing them to spin. they spin quickly because of a low coefficient of friction."
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,Mister_Spacely,8,Tue Jan 6 21:59:26 2015 UTC,One ball seems to elevate itself while the other spins on the surface. Why?
physicsgifs,2rjzi7,rostadebananer,2,Tue Jan 6 22:21:13 2015 UTC,"my guess (since i cant verify that it does that) is that when you blow on it some air goes under one ball and elevates it. Then you are actually spinning it along two axes. The first is how it spins around an imaginary line tangent to both balls, which is the obvious one.  The second is that the balls are probably (same reason) also spinning axially alone the line normal to both, like connecting the centers. This is probably (yeah) caused by the initial off set of only one half of the system along this line touching the ground and having friction. This axial rotation would act like a gyroscope and keep the system spinning on only one ball akin to the bicycle wheel trick."
